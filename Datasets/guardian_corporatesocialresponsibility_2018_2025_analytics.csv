2025-07-07T10:19:42Z,Like looking in a mirror: how HR data and AI can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility,https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/how-hr-data-and-ai-support-corporate-social-responsibility,"Businesses have had to get to grips with a range of new criteria in recent years that reflect more socially conscious goals, impacts and metrics. These are often lumped together under the acronym ESG, which refers to environmental, social and governance factors. They might incorporate these criteria for regulatory purposes or simply to better manage their business risks – whether it’s physical risks from the impact of climate breakdown, financial risks, or risks to their reputation. When it comes to ESG, the environmental and governance factors have typically been more measurable. You can count your carbon emissions and you can measure how much waste you produce. Similarly, you can set up governance frameworks and follow best practice. But the S part of the acronym has always been trickier to quantify. This is partly because of a lack of objective and comparable data. Likewise, social factors have often been regarded as subjective and malleable – contingent upon changing social attitudes and individuals’ personal lived experiences. They also vary from company to company and across geographies – taking in everything from diversity and pay disparities to relationships with stakeholder groups, corporate stances on contentious issues and volunteering. Organisations often don’t know where to start, even if they want to do the right thing. But despite being difficult to get a grasp of, social responsibility can’t be ignored. Companies now need to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements, such as the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and European sustainability reporting standards. Moreover, they might also have to meet the requirements of their own business partners in their supply chains, who may stipulate social disclosure and reporting. They also need to think about how they are viewed by potential new hires. Younger people, in particular, increasingly want to work for businesses that align with their own values. Social responsibility is therefore part of being an employer of choice. While it can be confusing terrain to navigate, data can provide clarity. As the adage goes: what gets measured, gets managed. Given that so many social criteria relate to the welfare of a company’s employees, having a robust and dynamic HR platform can help. These platforms provide companies with a wealth of objective data, from deeper insights into the diversity of their workforce to pay gaps at different management levels and social responsibility initiatives. Steve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at software company Sage, says high-quality HR data can be a bit like looking in the mirror for a business. It can really help you understand what your culture means, what you stand for as a business, where you’re going, and what you need to do to get there. “This really helps when you are trying to attract and retain the best people,” he notes. This can make it easier for businesses to do everything from meeting disclosure requirements to demonstrating community engagement. Of course, all this data still needs to be sifted in order to generate useful insights. Kaustubh Sevak, a principal solutions consultant at Sage, says businesses have often struggled with this. “Traditionally, companies will take all of this data, and it’ll take a team of analysts a week to actually come up with some insights or nuggets on what that data actually is.” Now, he says, companies can take advantage of what Sage calls a “workforce intelligence offering”. “This is where AI and machine learning-led statistical analysis is really powerful, because it’s bringing those insights to HR at the click of a button. HR practitioners can look at whatever data points are important to them in the jurisdiction that they want to restrict it to, and in a couple of clicks they get real-time insights.” This is particularly important when it comes to dealing with different disclosure requirements across different countries or geographical territories. It also enables multinational businesses to integrate data from different territories with different HR policies. There are many other ways that a high-quality HR platform can make it easier for businesses to comply with disclosure requirements. They can provide transparency about company policies, and also the methodology companies use to measure its performance against ESG criteria – which is particularly important given that some ESG reporting regulations require information about how the data was calculated. Moreover, a good HR platform can provide all this required data in one place that’s easy to access and collate. Lampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at Sage, notes how the company’s all-in-one HR and payroll platform, Sage People, can combine HR data insights with responses to employee surveys. “You can use Sage People to gather data on the social side of things and share it with whoever needs it,” he says. “You might, for example, ask staff if enough is being done to support wellbeing or volunteering, or you could look at the backgrounds of new hires – and this could be reported or shared with regulatory bodies.” Data can also be used to help companies improve their own performance and reach their internal social objectives. One Sage People customer has incorporated social mobility data into KPIs (key performance indicators). The idea here is that you can cascade a top-level goal down the organisation and use data to see how employees are contributing to achieving it and what more needs to be done. Sekliziotis emphasises that this is very much a two-way flow of information. “You could also communicate the sort of social responsibility programmes you are undertaking and ask staff if they’re interested in participating, or report on community collaboration.” Another benefit of the platform is that this communication can be targeted. For instance, it can often make sense, if volunteering news is sent to those closest to the communities it takes place in. “[Employees] can even book volunteering days on the system so that the company knows you’re not booking a day’s holiday and that you’re working in your local foodbank,” says Sekliziotis. An organisation can learn from this data and use it to make improvements. For example, it can look at programmes it has instituted and see what the takeup is. Watmore says that this can be useful when it comes to making comparisons across different parts of a business or across different regions and territories. “Comparative data is useful, but you sometimes need to use it to recognise that all data should be comparative,” he notes. “You can use software to slice and dice it into different regions – and the richer the data is, the more powerful this becomes.” Discover more about how HR data can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility",,Empowering Your Employees
2024-12-05T00:43:47Z,Australian debt collection giant will cease to exist after claims it dodged its own blacklisting,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/05/panthera-debt-collection-agency-sold-end-operation,"Panthera, one of Australia’s biggest debt collection firms, has been sold and its brand will cease to exist after claims that it circumvented a blacklisting barring it from operating in Victoria. Panthera has been mired in scandal since the federal court found in 2020 that it had unlawfully harassed Australians for money they did not owe. In Victoria, the federal court ruling automatically triggered a blacklisting banning Panthera from buying or collecting debts. A Guardian Australia investigation earlier this year revealed that Panthera had allegedly circumvented that blacklisting and continued operations in Victoria, again chasing debts from individuals who owed nothing, including a 10-year-old boy with autism. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email In some cases, the Guardian revealed that Panthera had bought debt from major telcos and energy retailers within weeks of receiving direct warnings from the regulator, Consumer Affairs Victoria, that continuing to engage in debt collection could amount to a criminal offence. CAV launched legal action against Panthera in July, alleging it had breached the blacklisting. The case is still ongoing and no plea has been entered. Administrators were also brought in to sell off large parts of the business. On Thursday, Francom Group, which operates existing debt collection and legal services, announced it had bought Panthera. The Panthera brand will now cease to exist and 200 existing staff at the debt collection giant will now work under the Francom banner. Francom said it would seek to resolve the legal proceedings against Panthera “as quickly as possible”. It would also seek to “transform the perceptions and practices of the debt collection industry” and would take a “strong moral and ethical focus, based on robust corporate social responsibility”. “Under new ownership and management, Panthera’s operations will be realigned with Francom Group’s approach, which is underpinned by ethical leadership, flexibility, transparency and education,” Francom said in a statement. The acquisition has been backed by Canadian investment company Brookfield, which has previously provided a massive capital injection to Panthera. The legal proceedings against Panthera were due to be mentioned in the Melbourne magistrates court on Wednesday, but were adjourned at the last minute. CAV has been approached for comment.",Debt collection; Australia news,Australia news
2024-02-29T11:00:16Z,"Trump gave top US firms staggering tax cuts, with some paying $0 or less – report",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/29/trump-tax-cuts-us-companies,"Some of the US’s most profitable corporations, including General Motors, Citigroup and Netflix, have slashed their tax bills in the years since the passage of the Trump tax cuts, with nearly a quarter paying rates in the single digits and 23 paying nothing, a report has found. The 2017 law cut the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. But the new assessment of corporate tax avoidance, published on Thursday by the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep), found that during the first five years the law was in effect, many profitable public companies in the US paid a far lower rate in practice. Together, the 342 corporations studied by Itep paid an average effective tax rate of just 14.1%. Eighty-seven companies paid an average of less than 10%; 55 of those firms paid less than 5%; and 23 corporations, including T-Mobile US and Xcel Energy, paid zero (or less) federal income tax over the five-year period – even though they made a profit each year. Among the lowest taxpayers were companies including Netflix and Nike, as well as several corporations whose CEOs have become high-profile advocates for corporate social responsibility and “stakeholder capitalism”, such as Salesforce and Bank of America. In the five years since the Trump tax law took effect, “the biggest and most profitable companies don’t appear to be paying anywhere close to that 21% rate”, said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at Itep and the lead author of the report. “What Trump described as a big tax cut turned out to be just that.” Between 2018 and 2022, Bank of America brought home more than $138bn in profits, yet the company paid only $5.3bn in federal income tax – an effective rate of 3.8%, Itep found. Bank of America was recently named the second most “just” company in the United States by Just Capital, a non-profit that ranks US corporations by how well they “perform[] on the issues that matter”, like serving their communities. Fortune magazine has called the Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, “the king of stakeholder capitalism”, a term that describes the notion that corporations today are taking care of not just their executives and shareholders but all of society. In 2020, Marc Benioff, the co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, declared to the New York Times that “it’s time for a new kind of capitalism: stakeholder capitalism, which recognizes that our companies have a responsibility to all our stakeholders”. During the first five years of the Trump law, however, Salesforce paid only $175m in taxes on some $6bn in profits, according to the Itep report. “There appears to be a substantial overlap between the companies that are routinely avoiding corporate income taxes and the companies whose leaders seem to have laudable charitable aims,” Gardner said. “No one would doubt that Marc Benioff wants to do good things in the world. He just doesn’t seem to prioritize doing it in the way that the law says he should. He wants to do it his way.” The Itep report makes clear that the companies listed in the report aren’t breaking the law. “Tax avoidance occurs because Congress chooses to allow it,” the report notes, “either by enacting special exceptions and breaks from the regular tax rules, or by leaving in place loopholes that are clearly being exploited.” Congress is currently considering additional exceptions that could help corporations lower their 2022 tax bills even further, the report warns. A bipartisan tax package that recently passed the House of Representatives, for which corporate interests have been lobbying aggressively for months, includes a tax break that would allow businesses to immediately deduct the costs of “research and development” conducted in the United States. The Trump tax law requires firms to spread out the deductions over time, rather than claiming them all at once, starting in 2022. But the tax deal currently moving through Congress would roll back that limitation for domestic investments – and do so retroactively. That means companies could update their 2022 (and 2023) tax filings to claim billions of dollars in new deductions, ostensibly to reward them for investing in research and development – even though the only thing that would have changed is the text of the tax code. “By definition, extending them backwards in time … can’t encourage a dime of additional research,” Gardner said. While limited corporate disclosures make it difficult to say precisely how much money companies could claw back, the available data suggests that this single, retroactive policy tweak could potentially save some firms billions of dollars – and that the benefits “would be hugely concentrated in the hands of a very small number of corporations”, Gardner said. Meta, for instance, might be able to shave its tax bill by nearly $6.5bn, the report found, which would bring its average effective tax rate below 0% over the five-year period of the study. Microsoft could potentially save a similar sum. “I always go back to that social contract of our company with the world around us,” Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, told Just Capital in 2020. “You can’t exist if all you’re doing is benefiting yourself … Profit [comes] because of the larger surplus you’re creating around you.” “The whole point of having a tax system is to pay for all the important services that we need,” Gardner said. “Healthcare isn’t sexy, right? Education isn’t sexy. Making sure that we have the money we need to defend ourselves as a nation isn’t sexy. But these basic bread-and-butter needs are why we have a tax system.”",Tax avoidance; Business; Trump administration; US politics; General Motors; Citigroup; Netflix; Nike; Bank of America; Meta; Microsoft; House of Representatives; US Congress; US news,Business
2025-06-30T09:48:55Z,‘It’s never too late for an MBA’: how a skills development programme supercharges careers,https://www.theguardian.com/tech-consulting-impacts/2025/jun/30/mba-and-skills-programmes-that-boost-your-career,"Tech consultants are key figures in the modern economy, advising every size of business from startups to some of the world’s biggest organisations on deploying new technologies and helping to implement gamechanging innovations. It’s a fascinating and rewarding career – bringing together both tech and business expertise – that requires constant upskilling. For Korusha Pillay, a senior manager in AI and automation at EY, the opportunity to deepen her knowledge in areas such as leadership and business skills has been invaluable in boosting her career and widening her prospects. She took advantage of the free EY tech MBA to broaden her knowledge of key technologies and explore new opportunities. Just weeks after moving to the UK to take up a role at EY in 2020, Pillay’s life was turned upside down as she found herself in lockdown. “I’m incredibly goal oriented” she says. “Without something to aim for, I hit a slump.” So when she saw an announcement on an internal EY newsletter about the newly launched tech MBA, she jumped at the chance. On the same day, she drafted a detailed plan to complete the entry requirements and never looked back. To qualify for the course, Pillay completed the EY digital badge programme, which offers training in broad aspects of technology, leadership and business. The learning and development programme is available to all EY people globally, with training covering an extensive range of topics. A bronze badge is typically awarded after 15 hours of study, a silver badge after 30 hours, and more intensive study leads to gold and ultimately platinum badges. Pillay completed 21 badges in subjects such as AI, machine learning, leadership and digital transformation. This gave her the accreditation to join the MBA, where she focused on business, leadership and technology. The course culminated in a number of written research papers and a final project undertaken with other EY people on the course. Her team tackled employee turnover at EY, developing a prototype app inspired by dating platforms to match colleagues with internal opportunities, a project that received a 100% mark in the final assessment. The MBA was a transformative experience for Pillay. It gave her life direction during lockdown, but it also helped her develop contacts across the organisation and learn a range of useful interpersonal techniques. She found she could apply the lessons she learned to her daily work. And crucially, she says, it taught her to be more aware of the limits of her knowledge. “Sometimes you’re in this bubble and think you know everything, but a course like this that stretches across so many boundaries made me realise how much more there is to learn.” The MBA helped her develop her knowledge in areas such as managing clients, resolving conflicts and leadership skills. As one of the first to take the course, she was invited to many presentations, panels and learning events at EY to discuss her experiences. Career opportunities have grown exponentially, she says, “since I put MBA at the end of my name”. She says the MBA is so appealing as it is free, online, and involves study at your own pace. The course is open to people at different stages in their careers, “it’s never too late”, she adds. Run in association with Hult International Business School, the EY tech MBA is available to some 400,000 EY employees in 150 countries regardless of their role or position. For Peter Capsalis, an AI and data senior manager at EY, gaining a deeper understanding of how clients view technology projects has been a major benefit of taking the tech MBA. A chemistry graduate with a master’s in data science, Capsalis found the MBA’s focus on leadership skills, business strategy and understanding the client’s point of view helped with the business side of his role. “After coming from a developer, technology and data science background, EY’s tech MBA gave me more formal organisational knowledge and a better understanding of business strategies and how clients think,” he says. His MBA covered three areas: transformation in a digital age; digital leadership; and competitive business simulations. The last one “really framed some of the new advances in technology and what that means for an organisation”, he says. He has learned practical leadership skills, which has enhanced how he manages his own global teams, which operate across different time zones, and his ability to carry out ideation sessions virtually. And the tech MBA has helped him apply this learning when advising clients on how to manage their global teams. Learning programmes are part of the EY commitment to people development and its employee value proposition, which promises to help employees to “shape your future with confidence”. The organisation also offers an MBA in sustainability and has a range of other development programmes for staff. Even more ambitiously, EY intends to have a positive effect on the lives of 1 billion people by 2030 through EY Ripples, a global corporate social responsibility programme that will work with entrepreneurs around the world to scale innovative solutions to global problems. More than 1 million people across EY member firms and their communities will be mobilised through the programme, driving the adoption of business models that protect the environment, while unlocking economic opportunity. The programme will ensure the next generation of EY people will develop the skills to find and sustain meaningful work, such as bringing affordable energy to off-grid families and providing safe sanitation for low-income communities. As technology-fuelled business disruption continues to reshape the world, learning and development opportunities and corporate social responsibility programmes such as these are essential for tech consultants to achieve their full potential. To transform businesses and drive sustainable growth around the globe, tech consultants need to constantly re-invent and transform their knowledge. Building and maintaining market-leading skills is key for consultants as they find new approaches to develop transformative solutions for some of the world’s biggest organisations.

2025-06-30T18:48:03Z,Prada accused of cashing in on Indian culture with Kolhapuri-inspired sandals ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/30/prada-accused-of-cashing-in-on-indian-culture-with-kolhapuri-inspired-sandals,"Prada has acknowledged that its new leather sandal design was inspired by India’s famous Kolhapuri “chappals” – handcrafted shoes known for their toe-loop design – after facing criticism over its failure to credit the footwear’s origins. “We acknowledge the sandals … are inspired by traditional Indian handcrafted footwear, with a centuries-old heritage,” Lorenzo Bertelli, the corporate social responsibility chief at the Italian fashion house, said in a letter to the Maharashtra chamber of commerce. The chamber had complained on behalf of thousands of Kolhapuri sandal-makers after images from Prada’s Milan runway show showed models wearing the open-toe footwear that was virtually identical to the unisex Indian original. The chamber president, Lalit Gandhi, had said: “The collection includes footwear designs that bear a close resemblance to Kolhapuri sandals, a traditional handcrafted leather sandal that has been awarded ‘geographical indication’ status by the government of India in 2019.” The geographical indication tag verifies that a product originates in a specific place. The sandals’ origins go back to the 12th century, to the city of Kolhapur in western Maharashtra state. The buffalo-hide shoes with their distinctive braided T-strap are worn by everyone from farmers to millennials and business leaders. The sight of models walking the runway last week in the footwear blandly described as “leather flat sandals” triggered a widespread backlash in India and charges of “cultural appropriation”. The row tapped into a broader debate about how global fashion houses frequently repackage traditional craftsmanship as luxury goods without credit or compensation to the original artisans. The sandals, known for their durability, cost about $12 (£8.75) in India, whereas Prada sandals retail for upwards of $800. Indian artisans “lose, while global brands cash in on our culture”, said Harsh Goenka, the chair of the pharmaceuticals-to-IT conglomerate RPG Group. As photos of the show spread online, Indian outrage mounted. “From the dusty lanes of Kolhapur to the glitzy runways of Milan … will the world finally give credit where it’s due?” asked the news outlet DNA on X. Gandhi asked Prada to seek ways for “collaboration or fair compensation that could benefit” Indian craftspeople. Bertelli replied the sandals were still in the “early” design stage, but that Prada was willing to open a “dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans”. “While Indian artisans and small-scale producers excel in craftsmanship, they rarely have access to capital or business acumen” to position their products globally as luxury goods, Dhanendra Kumar, an ex-World Bank executive director, said in India’s Economic Times. “By not calling their new line of sandals ‘Kolhapuris’, Prada is guilty of monetising cultural appropriation,” Kumar said. Still, some believe the row could have an unexpected upside. Sales of the sandals have plateaued in India in recent years, but local designers believe the spotlight could boost interest in the classic design, especially among younger consumers. “Until now, it hadn’t been considered part of the ‘cool’ or aspirational footwear space in India’s luxury market … I truly believe in the ripple effect of what Prada has done,” said Shirin Mann, the founder of Needledust, a label known for its contemporary take on traditional Indian embroidered slip-ons. Mann could be right. Since Prada’s runway show, Google Trends has shown a rise in searches for Kolhapuri sandals, and retailers report interest has surged, according to local media.",India; Prada; Fashion; South and central Asia; World news,World news
2025-05-21T14:00:30Z,A new US report makes it clear: five-day in-office mandates are outdated | Gleb Tsipursky,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/21/in-office-mandates-outdated-telework-study,"When the pandemic hit in early 2020, organizations pivoted overnight to remote and hybrid models to survive. Nearly five years later, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Dell and Goldman Sachs have enforced five-day-in-office mandates, while US federal agencies imposed on-site requirements for more than 400,000 employees. These actions rely on outdated assumptions about productivity, culture and resilience, according to authoritative federal government data. A May 2025 report from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO), Telework: Private Sector Stakeholder and Expert Views, shows that telework offers clear advantages when leaders embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking and available regulatory guidance. Companies ignoring these insights risk talent attrition, rising costs and reduced agility in an era that demands adaptability. Flexibility now drives talent acquisition and retention more powerfully than traditional perks. Interviews in the GAO study reveal one technology firm cut voluntary turnover by 33% after offering two remote days each week. Across industries, employees cite autonomy and work–life balance as top priorities when evaluating offers. Remote work removes geographic barriers for candidates facing challenges such as caregiving, disabilities or rural isolation. A National Bureau of Economic Research analysis cited in the report found full-time employment among workers with disabilities rose by 12% on average – and by as much as 40% in computer roles – once telework became widespread. Veterans, caregivers and parents of young children similarly gain access to roles they would otherwise forego, expanding the talent pipeline. By hiring beyond traditional office locations, organizations retain top performers who might otherwise resign due to relocation or caregiving conflicts. Telework can deliver significant cost savings and measurable productivity gains at scale. Organizations in the GAO report halved their office footprints and slashed lease expenses, redirecting budgets toward home-office stipends rather than fixed desks. Some reported saving millions annually in real estate costs alone. Employees reclaim an average of 55 minutes daily by skipping commutes, boosting focus and reducing burnout, while employers report fewer sick days and lower absenteeism. Research reviewed by the GAO indicates a 12% performance lift for roles with clear metrics when executed remotely, thanks to fewer interruptions and personalized work environments. Reduced commuting and lower energy use help companies meet sustainability goals and support corporate social responsibility commitments, while ensuring continuity during severe weather, transit disruptions or other emergencies. Workers and employers in the study did raise concern about difficulties in building workplace culture and relationships – and indeed, building a cohesive culture in distributed teams demands intentional effort. Leading companies foster connection through weekly video huddles, virtual coffee chats and cross-team recognition ceremonies that spark collaboration and belonging. Mentorship programs pair new hires with seasoned employees, and all-hands virtual events celebrate milestones and reinforce shared values. Clear communication protocols and compliance frameworks – drawing on Department of Labor guidelines and multistate payroll solutions – ensure legal peace of mind and maintain consistent policies across jurisdictions. Robust IT safeguards, ergonomic stipends and mental wellness resources protect sensitive data and support employee health across locations, demonstrating an organization’s commitment to its people. Insisting on full-time return-to-office mandates now carries steep risks to competitiveness and culture. The GAO report highlights one business that lost half its workforce – including key leaders – after enforcing a strict in-office policy. In contrast, organizations embracing a remote-first mindset enjoy minimal turnover, higher morale and stronger employer brands, attracting top talent even in saturated markets. Experts advise publishing telework eligibility in job postings, investing in high-speed broadband infrastructure and designing compensation models that reward flexibility and fairness. The GAO’s data-driven findings deliver a clear roadmap: integrate remote work strategically to attract talent, reduce costs and enhance productivity. Leaders who act now will build resilient, high-performing teams prepared for whatever challenges lie ahead in a competitive global landscape.

2023-10-24T05:33:39Z,"Top ASX firms report social and environment performance by revising pastdata, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/24/top-asx-firms-report-improved-social-and-environment-performance-by-revising-past-data-study-finds,"Australian companies are reporting better social and environment performance but many gains are generated by revising past outcomes, particularly when a chief executive’s own remuneration is tied to the results, a new study has found. The study, “CSR Restatements: Mischief or Mistake?”, examined 674 instances of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting from the Top 500 ASX-listed companies between 2004 and 2020. The researchers found about 17% of a CEO’s bonus pay was linked to sustainability targets alone, potentially lifting payouts by around $200,000 if targets were met. All up, 33.5% of all restatements of CSR outcomes were for one or more CSR goals that were tied to bonuses. Only about 15% of revisions of past outcomes were to correct an error, compared with 69% resulting from measurement changes. After back-dated revisions, the following year showed an average 28.3% improvement of the metric being assessed, a gain that rose further to 36% when a CEO’s bonus was linked to the outcome. “Our results show that CSR contracting is associated with a greater number of CSR restatements, particularly when social performance measures are contained within CEO compensation contracts,” the paper, published in the Journal of Management Accounting Research, found. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Overall, our results suggest that compensation provides an incentive to manipulate CSR performance through restatements.” The authors, associate professor Helen Spiropoulos from the University of Technology Sydney and Rebecca Bachmann from Macquarie University, said CSR reporting was already perceived as “greenwashing” – the selective disclosure of positive environmental or social performance and the withholding of negative information. One motivation for the study was that CSR reporting remained “largely unregulated across the globe”. Separate research has identified that 37% of CSR reports from Global Fortune 250 firms included revisions with a bias towards overstatement, the authors noted. “CSR reporting is [also] an important issue given its increasing occurrence and pressure to conduct business in a way that minimises any negative social and environmental impacts,” the paper said. The authors hope the findings will be considered by the International Sustainability Standards Board. The body plans to draft sustainability reporting standards but has yet to consider issues surrounding metrics and measurement, it said. “Currently, there is significant discretion in how [environmental, social and governance] performance is measured and reported, and one way to show improved performance in the current year, is to adjust or restate last year’s score to reflect worse performance relative to this year,” Spiropoulos said in a statement. Bachman said: “Auditors who will be required to audit environmental performance disclosures under forthcoming sustainability assurance standards should also investigate the legitimacy of restatements.” “The irony is striking – what was intended to be a mechanism to drive positive environmental and social change may instead act as an incentive to manipulate sustainability performance.”",Corporate social responsibility; Business; Australia news; Australian economy; Environment,Environment
2025-07-28T15:00:35Z,Mastercard and Visa face backlash after hundreds of adult games removed from online stores Steam and Itch.io,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/mastercard-visa-backlash-adult-games-removed-online-stores-steam-itchio-ntwnfb,"Payment companies such as Visa, Mastercard and Stripe are facing public backlash, including from billionaire Elon Musk, for pressuring online gaming platforms to remove hundreds of games in response to a campaign from an Australian anti-porn lobby group. Itch.io, an independent gaming platform, last week removed all adult or not-safe-for-work (NSFW) games from appearing in its library in a hasty move to prevent payments for games being blocked across its entire service. Itch.io said that it was bowing to demands from payment providers “to ensure we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers”. The move came after an open letter organised by Collective Shout, an Australian-based group that fights the sexualisation of woman and girls. On 14 July, it called on payment providers to cease providing services to gaming platforms Steam and Itch.io, claiming that hundreds of their games contained content including rape, sexual violence and incest. Itch.io’s swift compliance, however, meant removing not just the content in Collective Shout’s claim but all NSFW adult content from browsing and search – at least temporarily. Some games were also removed entirely. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure,” the company said. “Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologise for the abruptness of this change.” Some users reported they were unable to play games removed from sale that they had already paid for, which Itch.io has denied. Collective Shout, a small but vocal lobby group, has long called for a mandatory internet filter that would prevent access to adult content for everyone in Australia. Its director, Melinda Tankard Reist, was recently appointed to the stakeholder advisory board for the government’s age assurance technology trial before the under-16s social media ban comes into effect in Australia in December. Collective Shout routinely focuses its campaigns on underwear advertising and video games in Australia. It has recently campaigned for Elon Musk’s X to ban adult content, but the success of its recent campaign against gaming platforms has brought them the most international attention. In the two weeks since announcing the letters sent to major payment providers including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, video game marketplaces Itch.io and Steam have announced policy changes. Steam, which has an estimated 132 million active monthly users, earlier this month removed an estimated hundreds of titles in response to pressure from payments processors. Tankard Reist said she and her team had been bombarded with “abuse, harassment, rape and death threats” since the campaign launch, which the team was compiling to report to the eSafety commissioner and the police. By Monday, a Change.org petition calling for payment processors to “stop controlling what we can watch, read, or play” has garnered more than 147,000 signatures. “Nobody is forced to engage with content they find offensive – but they have no right to dictate what others are allowed to enjoy, especially when it’s within the bounds of the law,” it said. Elon Musk posted “bravo” in response to an X user’s post about the petition, and – in another reply to criticism of a payments processor forcing the removal of content – said he wanted to get his own X payments platform “going soon”. While Collective Shout solely targeted games it said violated policies held by payment platforms, Itch.io’s move to temporarily remove all NSFW content resulted in games with LGBTQ+ themes being removed. One petition signer who is a member of the LGBTQ+ community said they were concerned that banning sexual-based games would be the start of cracking down on LGBTQ+ content. “Banning sexual content never stops there, it always include non-sexual things. As such the fight to protect people’s right to sexual expression is vital for protecting my right to exist,” they wrote. Tankard Reist said the blanket removal of NSFW games was not the objective of the campaign, noting that Itch.io has said it would introduce compliance measures for NSFW pages to allow games as long as they abided by the policies of the payment processor linked to their account. “It is likely many games will be restored to the platform after Itch.io’s review,” she said. “Payment processors have a right to determine what services they will provide … according to their CSR [corporate social responsibility], mission and values.” Asked whether the incoming Online Safety Act codes, which restrict access to content refused classification in Australia and bring in age verification for adult content, would have been a better place for the concerns raised by her group, Tankard Reist said the issue did not affect Australia alone. “The internet has no borders. Women and girls everywhere are impacted by male violence against women and misogyny in general which we believed these games perpetuated,” she said. Collective Shout “could not afford to wait” to see if the codes and age verification would be effective, she added. Mastercard and Visa were contacted for comment. Steam did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for PayPal said it could not comment on individual customers. “PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe platform for its customers. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal activity. Any accounts found to be associated with illegal activity will be closed,” they said.",Censorship; Games; Australia news; Technology; Culture; World news,World news
2025-03-16T17:48:38Z,Charles Medawar obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/16/charles-medawar-obituary,"My friend Charles Medawar, who has died suddenly aged 82, campaigned on consumer safety and corporate accountability. He started his career in the 1960s working with Michael Young at the Consumers’ Association, where his research included the first testing of tar and nicotine in cigarettes (not that it stopped him from smoking at the time). After he became unhappy with the unquestioning promotion of consumerism and consumption, he went to the US, where he spent a formative time working with the activist Ralph Nader. Back in the UK, having secured financial backing from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Charles set up Social Audit and the charity Public Interest Research Centre in 1972. Their groundbreaking work on transparency and corporate social responsibility was decades ahead of its time and went on to spawn the campaigns that secured the UK’s freedom of information and whistleblowing laws. From the late 80s, Charles focused on researching the way the pharmaceutical industry and regulators approached drug safety. This culminated in his books Power and Dependence (1992), on tranquillisers, and Medicines Out of Control? (2004), on antidepressants, which exposed how the risks of these addictive drugs were being downplayed and overlooked. Committed to openness, he made his work freely available on the internet, where it attracted around a million visits a year. While he was not medically trained or qualified, Charles’s expertise on pharma was called on by the World Health Organization and the UK parliament’s health select committee. When group actions for drug injuries were first launched in the UK, it was no surprise that he was sought out by the claimants. In the Opren litigation (1985-88), there was a rare ruling from the court of appeal that approved his status as an expert. He played a notable role in establishing the case for haemophiliacs who had contracted HIV after being treated with infected blood products. Charles was born in Oxford. His parents were Sir Peter Medawar, who won a Nobel prize for his pioneering work on transplantation, and Jean Taylor, a leading light in the Family Planning Association. He attended Westminster school and briefly Oxford University, before transferring to Indiana University, where he graduated in Russian. Despite, or perhaps because of, his establishment background, he was undaunted by power and authority and spent his life challenging the complacency and lack of accountability it can foster. In 1974 he met Caroline Vogel, who became his wife, and they lived in Primrose Hill, north London, in former stables that he had designed and converted himself. Charles was a lovely man, whose integrity, mercurial charm and irreverence endeared him to all who knew him. He is survived by Caroline, his three stepchildren, Anna, Toby and Dan, eight grandchildren and his siblings, Caroline, Louise and Alexander.",Activism; Corporate social responsibility; Consumer affairs; Consumer rights,World news
2025-07-29T10:30:49Z,Why did thousands of adult titles just disappear from the biggest PC gaming marketplaces?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/29/why-did-adult-titles-disappear-from-steam-itch-pc-gaming-payment-processors,"In the last two weeks, thousands of “adult only” and “not safe for work” games have disappeared from Steam and itch.io – two of the most prominent distribution platforms for PC video games – as they scrambled to comply with stricter rules mandated by payment processors such as MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal. These rules were established after a campaign by the organisation Collective Shout, which urged payment processors to stop facilitating payments to platforms hosting “rape, incest and child sexual abuse-themed games”. But the new rules have affected a far broader range of games – including some award-winning titles. *** How did this start? On 16 July, Valve, the developer of Steam, updated its rules and guidelines regarding the games and software that can be distributed on the platform. The rules, which already prohibited “nude or sexually explicit images of real people” and “adult content that isn’t appropriately labelled or age gated” were expanded to include “content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors” including “certain kinds of adult content”. In a statement to PC Gamer on 18 July, Valve confirmed it was “retiring” several games from the Steam store due to these new rules. It did not clarify which games were being removed, nor what “kinds of adult content” are now deemed unsuitable. A week later, itch.io issued a statement explaining it had also come under “scrutiny” from payment processors, and as such was “deindexing” (removing from search results) all games labelled “NFSW” as it undertook a “comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors.” Unlike Valve, itch.io specifically referenced Collective Shout as the cause of the renewed scrutiny. *** What is Collective Shout? Collective Shout is an Australian organisation that describes itself as “a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls”. In April, it successfully petitioned to have the game No Mercy – which featured depictions of “incest”, “blackmail” and “unavoidable non-consensual sex” – removed from Steam and itch.io. After this, the group published an open letter to payment processors claiming to have “discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and itch.io”, and requesting payment processors “demonstrate corporate social responsibility and immediately cease processing payments on Steam and itch.io”. After Steam altered its rules, Collective Shout claimed credit for the change, stating that more than 1,000 of its supporters had called or emailed payment processors to demand they “stop facilitating payments and profiting from these games”. *** Why payment processors? Like many online retailers, Steam and itch.io rely on payment processors to enable users to make purchases on their platforms. As such, these companies hold considerable power and can influence what products – regardless of their legality – are bought, sold or published. In recent years, payment processors have become increasingly strict about transactions relating to adult content. In 2021, the subscription-based video platform OnlyFans, widely used by adult content creators, announced it would ban adult material from the site after pressure from payment processors – though this plan was subsequently abandoned. Later that year, Mastercard imposed a new policy regulating adult content sellers – one criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union as being restrictive to free speech and potentially harmful to sex workers – and an example of what is known as financial censorship. *** Which games have been affected? It isn’t clear how many games have been “retired” from Steam due to the new rules, but multiple games that depicted incest fantasies have been removed. Itch.io, as mentioned, has deindexed most games labelled NSFW. According to the games industry newsletter Game File, more than 20,000 games have been removed from itch.io’s NSFW category since 16 July. But these include games that explore queer identity and sexuality, such as Radiator 2 by Robert Yang, a former teacher at New York University’s Game Center. Update: Itch has released an addendum on its website stating that it is working to clarify new payment processing policies, and is seeking alternate payment partners for adult-rated content. *** How has the games industry responded? Many developers have decried the power that payment processors wield over what games are bought and sold, and how that power can be exerted indirectly by campaign groups such as Collective Shout. In a Bluesky post, Yang described Collective Shout and payment processors as “waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression”, while Consume Me’s developers told Wired that it is “completely unacceptable that payment processors are conducting censorship-by-fiat and systematically locking adult content creators out of platforms”. A change.org petition calling for payment processors and activist groups to “stop controlling what we can watch, read, or play” was launched on 17 July. The petition claims “MasterCard and Visa are interfering with legal entertainment”, and demands “the right to choose the stories we enjoy without moral policing”. So far it has accrued more than 150,000 signatures. Meanwhile, gamers and developers are sharing the phone numbers of major payment companies and encouraging people to call and complain. *** What happens next? It is hard to know for sure. With sustained consumer pressure, payment processors may reconsider their position, but it may also be challenging for anti-censorship voices to muster political support due to prevailing legislative winds surrounding online adult content. The UK this month enacted stricter regulations regarding age verification for internet users wanting to access adult content, while the EU has drafted guidelines for similar systems. Consequently, it is likely that the new rules will remain in place at Steam and itch.io, at least for the immediate future. But the fallout has drawn attention to the power that payment processors wield, and the lack of clarity surrounding their rules. Because of this, they may tread more cautiously when responding to pressure from advocacy groups in the future. • This article was amended on 30 July 2025. An earlier version stated that the games Last Call and Consume Me had been deindexed on the digital platform itch.io as a result of new payment processing rules; however, Last Call has not been affected and Consume Me was not previously indexed.",Games; Culture; Steam; PC,Games

My local district hospital, the most remote in mainland England, serves a population of about 170,000 (which can more than double in the summer) scattered across a wide rural area and there are plans to bring it up to modern standards. Some of the work has started, but now it seems its future is uncertain. And all because Streeting and his fellow ministers are still in thrall to the economic orthodoxy of the last 40 years – an orthodoxy which has seen the impoverishment of our society, a massive increase in inequality, a massive increase in poverty and homelessness, and a massive sell-off of public assets and services. In 1942 John Maynard Keynes said: “Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” Margaret Thatcher turned that on its head, and we have Rachel Reeves channelling her handbag economics with: “We can only do what we can afford.” Why can our politicians not learn from history? It is an absolute truth that the government is only constrained in its spending by the actual resources available, and as sovereign issuer of currency, it is not limited in its spending by taxes or issuing bonds. Spending on infrastructure and public services is investment in the people. Restoring the original ethos of the NHS, reinstating local services and fixing our struggling hospital estates are essential if this government has any intention of improving local economies. Netti Pearson Ilfracombe, Devon • Here is a superb opportunity for some of the largest corporations in the UK to demonstrate their corporate social responsibility. If they can do it for museums and stadiums, why not prove their commitment to the society without which they would not exist? How about establishing sponsorship programmes supporting NHS infrastructure projects to replace crumbling hospitals, outdated equipment and lack of staff? Think: the Diageo diagnostics centre, the Google roof, Aramco air conditioning, Shell scanners, British American Tobacco respiratory units, Nvidia nurse bursaries etc. Millions of your present and future investors, employees, clients and customers will become NHS patients at some point, and would benefit hugely. So come on, guys – make your name a legend in your corporate lunchtime!

Yet instead of Rockefellers, Vanderbilts or Carnegies building libraries and universities, we get an announcement of further delays to the 40 promised new hospitals.

2025-04-17T12:32:03Z,Uyghur rights group calls on hotel chains not to ‘sanitise’ China abuses in Xinjiang,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/17/uyghur-rights-group-calls-on-hotel-chains-not-to-sanitise-china-abuses-in-xinjiang,"Almost 200 international hotels are operating or planning to open in Xinjiang, despite calls from human rights groups for global corporations not to help “sanitise” the Chinese government’s human rights abuses in the region, a report has said. The report by the Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) identified 115 operational hotels which the organisation said “benefit from a presence in the Uyghur region”. At least another 74 were in various stages of construction or planning, the report said. The UHRP said some of the hotels also had exposure or links of concern to forced labour and labour transfer programmes. The explosion in hotel numbers coincides with the Chinese government’s efforts to push Xinjiang as a tourism destination after years of criticism and sanctions over its crackdown on the local Muslim population. In 2024 Xinjiang recorded about 300 million visitors, according to state media, including almost 5 million foreign tourists – 50% more than in 2023. Several world governments and legal groups have declared the government’s actions against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities to be a genocide, although this has not been settled in any international court. The UN says that China’s policies in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch has said the policies – which include mass internment and re-education, forced labour, and criminalisation of acts of religious expression – amount to crimes against humanity. China’s government denies all accusations of abuse and mistreatment in Xinjiang. Human rights groups have argued that the presence of foreign enterprises in Xinjiang lends legitimacy to the Chinese government’s crackdown, and called on firms to leave. In November, the vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen sold its Xinjiang factory after years of pressure. But as Beijing promotes Xinjiang as holiday destination for domestic and international tourists, the spotlight has turned to foreign tourism businesses. In 2023 the Guardian reported on a number of tour operators advertising holiday packages to Xinjiang. Now, hotel companies appear to be increasing their business there. Well known brands, including France’s Accor, Hilton, the British IHG Group, Marriott and Wyndham are among hundreds of existing or developing hotels across the region. The sites listed include luxurious upmarket hotels in city locations as well as ski resort areas, where the Chinese government has heavily invested in winter tourism. The report said three companies – Hilton, IHG, and Wyndham – all had hotels, and potentially paid fees or taxes – in areas administered by China’s state-owned paramilitary entity, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). Sanctions have been passed on the XPCC by several governments, including the US, UK and EU, over “serious rights abuses against ethnic minorities”. Peter Irwin, associate director for research and advocacy at UHRP, said: “This kind of hotel expansion, from international chains in particular, falls squarely within the Chinese government’s own strategy to try and normalise the public’s understanding of what’s going on in the Uyghur region. “The government can point to these major companies entrenching themselves in the region as evidence that everything is normal, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.” One recently opened hotel, by a Hilton franchisee, was built on the site of a mosque in Khotan that was demolished amid a government campaign in which more than 10,000 religious sites were destroyed. “Building a hotel on the site of a demolished mosque is particularly egregious, given that the Chinese government has undertaken a broad campaign to tear down mosques across the Uyghur Region since 2017,” the report said. It said the hotel was not visible on English-language travel booking sites but China’s CTrip showed reviews dating back to about mid-2024. Tuesday’s report assessed government records, corporate records and media articles, to determine whether hotels had other links of concern, including ownership structures with particular Chinese companies and involvement in state programmes identified by human rights researchers. In another case study, the report identified links between Accor’s Grand Mercure Urumqi Hualing hotel and a training and employment programme. A state media report from one symposium said a human resources director from the hotel had visited and signed letters of intent with many students. The symposium was targeted at young people and “surplus rural labour” workers from ethnic minorities, as part of the government’s poverty alleviation and “social stability” goals. The government says its Xinjiang employment schemes are part of “poverty alleviation” efforts but has been accused of forced labour and labour transfer programmes that breach human rights. The report also said Accor’s strategic partner in China, H World Group Limited, had used a recruitment and training programme, Xinjiang Aid, which a US congressional investigation found contributed to the risk of human trafficking. In 2020 four US agencies warned the programme may make use of internment camp labour or workers from “abusive labour programmes”. “These hotels continue to operate and expand business in a region in which Uyghur families have been torn apart by internment, imprisonment, forced labor programmes, and enforced disappearances,” said Dr Henryk Szadziewski, co-author of the report and director of research at the UHRP. The report called for the hotel chains to initiate “immediate reviews” of their operations, given they had all made pledges to adopt international human rights standards. It urged them to freeze expansion plans, halt operations and sever business ties. “They should publicly disclose their decision to exit, conduct heightened human rights due diligence, and engage with Uyghur rights organisations for remediation,” the report said. The Guardian contacted Accor, Hilton, IHG, Marriott, and Wyndham for comment. A spokeswoman for Accor said the company and its partners “adhere to our group [corporate social responsibility] Charter, which includes standards for how employees are treated. We are dedicated to ensuring that our operations align with these standards.” The spokeswoman said other elements put to them, including the claims about employment programs, were “not accurate”, but did not elaborate. The other companies have not responded. Timothy Grose a professor of China studies with expertise in ethnic policy at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, said investing in the region’s tourism was not a bad thing in principle. “In fact, the investments could bring great benefits to local economies,” he said. “However, if recent history repeats itself, the construction of new hotels, which may attract thousands of tourists, will unlikely translate into improvements in the lives of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other minoritised groups.” “Perhaps most immediately, shiny hotels and droves of tourists attempt to paint the picture that human rights abuses certainly cannot be occurring in such a ‘happy’ and ‘thriving’ place. Unfortunately, this strategy seems to have achieved some degree of success.”",Xinjiang; China; World news; Asia Pacific; Human rights; Hotels; Hospitality industry; Business,World news
2025-02-03T07:00:33Z,"Diesel, oil, condoms: transgender sex workers teach India’s truckers about Aids",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/03/diesel-oil-condoms-indian-transgender-sex-workers-teach-truckers-about-aids,"At a roadside booth, a volunteer pulls a condom over a wooden phallus. “Feel the packet first. If it feels dry, don’t use it, it’s past the expiry date,” he tells his audience of truck drivers as the traffic speeds by behind them. A short distance away, transgender sex workers Ruby and Bhavna are urging truckers clustered around a tea stall to ignore some common myths. “Don’t think that sprinkling lemon juice on your penis after unprotected sex is going to protect you against HIV. Nor will having sex with a virgin cure you. Only condoms will protect you and your families,” says Ruby, 30. The men listen attentively. Groups working to educate Indian lorry drivers on how to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and HIV have long sought to enlist commercial sex workers. It’s their services that drivers seek at truck stops, during the weeks and even months that they are on the road, away from their families. Apollo Tyres Foundation, the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of the country’s largest tyre manufacturer, is working with transgender sex workers after studies showed that some drivers prefer them. “It’s often not spelled out. Sometimes, drivers say they prefer transgender sex workers because they are cheaper and more accessible. That’s true up to a point. But they also cite this reason to conceal their real preference for them and for anal sex,” says Rinika Grover, Apollo Tyres’ head of sustainability and CSR. The company sells tyres to transport companies. About 60% of its revenue comes from buses and trucks, whose drivers are a high-risk group for HIV, with a prevalence rate of 1.48%, seven times higher than India’s national average of 0.2% for adults. The foundation has taken on more than 100 transgender sex workers as part of its HIV/Aids outreach project. They work as volunteers, making drivers aware of the risks, the symptoms, prevention and treatment. Some transgender people have been taken on as paid staff. To an outsider, their advice can sound jarringly obvious but it is necessary. “If you have symptoms, who do you go to?” asks Bhavna, 34, during the drivers’ tea break. “No, not some local quack. You go to a proper doctor with the initials MBBS after his name.” She explains later that the tendency is for drivers to seek an easy and cheap solution from an unlicensed practitioner, who will typically advise them to rub baking soda or mustard oil on their genitals or apply a paste made from certain leaves. She and Ruby quiz the drivers to gauge their level of awareness. It’s just as well. How do you get HIV? “Lack of hygiene,” offers one. How do you get sexually transmitted diseases (STD)? “Through sharing food,” says another. The transgender volunteers know the truckers’ world well. On a cold, grey winter’s day, they are targeting drivers at the Sanjay Gandhi transport hub in north-east Delhi. It’s a dusty, grim wasteland next to a landfill, with black birds of prey circling above them. Here, rows and rows of truckers load, unload, refuel, get repairs done and eat. Alongside, in alleys and grimy parks, they buy the services of transgender sex workers. Both groups are severely deprived, exist on the margins of society and are united by their poverty. The drivers are mostly sockless in sandals and wearing thin layers that cannot keep out the cold. Their last shower and hot meal are a distant memory. It is not very different for the sex workers. The shared experience encourages trust, which is why the drivers listen to their advice, often delivered in street language. India has made significant progress tackling its Aids epidemic: the current adult HIV prevalence of 0.2% is a decline from 0.32% in 2010. But the need for sustained awareness campaigns remains, along with follow-up care. Amit Chaudhary, programme lead for Apollo’s foundation, says: “We also refer drivers to our health centres across India, which provide HIV-testing services and counselling, free medicines, treatment for other STDs, testing for tuberculosis and also vision.” The transgender project began in 2022 and has since reached more than 100,000 truck drivers. The benefits work both ways. Transgender sex workers, accustomed to being despised by society and living in the shadows, enjoy the increase in social status that the volunteer work affords them, even if it can sometimes result in a loss of income. Normally, they would never dream of entering the office of a multinational company. Now, entrusted with the job in hand, the office becomes their space too and their self-respect rises a notch or two. “It’s been a great job for me,” says Mayra Mehraf, 22, now a paid employee after being trained as a health educator. “Seeing me encourages other transgenders to realise they can do more than sex work or begging at traffic lights.” Back in his driver’s cab, Ashok Kumar, whose route is the 400 miles (650km) from Delhi to Jammu, says it has been time well spent. “I knew some of what they said but I learned some new things too. I liked the way Ruby said one condom will protect two people – me and my wife.”",Global development; Sexual health; Transgender; Sex work; Health; India; South and central Asia; World news; Society; Aids and HIV,Global development
2025-01-08T11:17:06Z,Mark Zuckerberg has gone full Maga | Siva Vaidhyanathan,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/mark-zuckerberg-supporting-trump-maga,"Mark Zuckerberg seems to have gone full Maga. Just two weeks before Donald Trump assumes power over the world’s most powerful government, the CEO and founder of the most powerful collection of Internet companies has decided to capitalize on what is sure to be a large and fast retreat from accountability and regulatory curbs on corporate negligence. Some might read Zuckerberg’s announcement on Tuesday that he will end the eight-year project to protect users from hatred, threats, harassment and violent imagery as an example of pandering to the president-elect’s own power or Elon Musk’s new role as regulatory consigliere to Trump. That would get him wrong. Zuckerberg is reverting to his core beliefs because of opportunity, not aligning himself with Trump out of fear. Zuckerberg released a video in which he announced that Facebook and Instagram would no longer subject user-uploaded content to a full content-moderation review executed by both Meta itself and a constellation of contractors around the world. Instead, users will have the burden of flagging and complaining about content that causes harm or spreads dangerous misinformation about health or vulnerable people. User-guided content moderation, as we have seen on the platform formerly known as Twitter, is ridiculously ineffective. And that’s the goal. Zuckerberg, as anyone who has studied his actions, mind and statements over the past two decades would tell you, is firmly committed to the principle that he knows better than the rest of us and that his company’s services are good for us. The more we use them, the better we will live, he believes. The more we encounter messages that challenge us or trouble us, he believes, the more likely we are to forge better decisions for ourselves. The more we post, the more we encounter, the more we mix it up, the more we argue, the more we work toward a better society, Zuckerberg believes against all historical evidence to the contrary. He is not acting as a mercenary capitalist. He is acting as a megalomaniacal ideologue, as usual. Zuckerberg’s self-regard is beyond limits. Perhaps only Musk, among his peers, has more self-regard. Zuckerberg is less insecure than Musk, so he sometimes tries to come off as chastened and innocent. In fact, Zuckerberg has never retreated from his belief that he and his companies deserve the power they have and should mold the world to his vision of the greater good. It’s also a mistake to describe Zuckerberg’s move as a retreat from “fact-checking”, as the New York Times and other outlets described the policy of content moderation. It was never about facts nor should it have been. It was always about limiting harm to Facebook users and advertisers. No reputable company wants its product or service placed next to a gruesome image of sexual exploitation, violence or bigotry. The big question about this move, as Meta makes a clear turn away from being a social media company into an artificial intelligence company, is why Zuckerberg no longer concerns himself with the desires of his advertisers. Zuckerberg has always had so much capital at his disposal he has never had to worry about money. Perhaps this is an extension of that confidence. He might figure that advertisers have no place to go as his campaign to crush TikTok in the United States seems to have succeeded after Facebook’s rise already starved major media outlets of advertising revenue. Or maybe Zuckerberg is committed to freeing Meta from advertising as it develops AI tools it can sell and lease to companies and governments to generate steady revenue and even more political power. It’s important to note, as surely Zuckerberg understands, that even when, from 2017 until now, Facebook and Instagram were deploying elaborate and expensive methods of filtering harmful content (including via AI and thousands of low-paid editors who worked long hours looking at and then flagging videos of animal mutilation and human decapitation) the system was far from effective. Conspiracy theories about vaccines, the earth being flat and secret cabals that allegedly run the world have long thrived on Facebook, mostly in Facebook groups, where much content moderation failed to have much influence. The success of these paranoid fantasies cannot be attributed to their place on the true-false axis. And questioning or disproving them with solid research and evidence does not deflate them. These are symptoms and expressions of deep cultural insecurities, not a failure of cognitive ability or a deficit of knowledge. Zuckerberg was slow to implement even imperfect content moderation systems in the wake of the clear role that Facebook played in the election of Donald Trump in 2016 and the genocide of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. Once he was publicly shamed and threatened with potentially effective regulation to curb the excesses of his platforms, he relented and pledged to solve the problem through a classic example of “corporate social responsibility” short-circuiting policy efforts through self-regulation. Now, with the ascension of Trump and the complete Republican control of all three branches of the US government, the continued domination of Facebook friends such as the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, and the likely rise to power of extremist forces in Germany, France and other European countries, Zuckerberg no longer fears public admonition or effective regulation anywhere but Brazil, which has, under the Lula regime, stood out among powerful nations in its willingness to hold US companies to account. Zuckerberg also understands that Trump, with Zuckerberg’s old enemy Musk at his side, is likely to deploy excessive leverage and power to curb Brazil’s efforts to stand up to Silicon Valley on behalf of its citizens. Going forward, as Zuckerberg and Meta appear to pander to Trump, we should remember that he believes his companies to be the solution, not the cause, of our global maladies. Zuckerberg is using Trump, not the other way around.

2024-11-29T07:00:01Z,My father voted for Romania’s ultra-nationalist. I am beginning to understand why | Andrei Popoviciu,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/29/romania-elections-calin-georgescu-president,"Last Sunday, my country was jolted awake by a collective shock. For days, we’ve been consumed by one name: Călin Georgescu. His unexpected rise to the top in the first round of Romania’s presidential elections has polarised the country to an extent unseen since we became a democracy 35 years ago. Romania’s streets, screens and dining tables are abuzz with debates about how a fringe far-right and ultra-nationalist candidate managed to capture the nation’s attention – and votes. Protesters, many of them young, have already taken to the streets. But more than 2 million Romanians voted for Georgescu. My father, a retired police officer, was one of them. He spends much of his free time on TikTok, and was swept up in Georgescu’s rhetoric. TikTok’s algorithm fed him a steady stream of short, stirring videos of Georgescu invoking patriotism and promising to “put Romania first” weeks before the election. My father explained to me that his vote wasn’t necessarily an endorsement of Georgescu’s nationalist beliefs – even though they did resonate in part with him – but more of a protest against the political establishment. “I wanted to sanction the mainstream political class,” he told me. His sentiment is not uncommon. For the past 35 years, Romania’s two dominant parties – centre-left social democrats and centre-right liberals – have presided over corruption scandals, nepotism, politically connected fraud and opaque use of public funds. Their decision to govern together in a coalition for the past three years has only deepened public mistrust, reinforcing the perception that they are all in it together against the people. For many Romanians, voting for Georgescu wasn’t just about ideology, but frustration. Still, I’ll admit I was furious when my father first told me he voted for Georgescu. But as we talked, I began to understand his perspective. He is part of the sacrificial generation, those who were in their 20s when communism fell and have since endured decades of broken promises. His vote, like those of many others, wasn’t about alignment with far-right extremism – it was a desperate cry for change. This is not just a generational divide. Young people, too, have been drawn to Georgescu. As I scroll through social media, I see old school friends – some with university degrees, some working stable jobs – sharing posts that echo his nationalist rhetoric. Their frustrations mirror those of older voters: a rising cost of living, stagnating wages and a pervasive sense that the system is rigged against them. Yet there’s a deeper issue here, one that goes beyond protest votes and political frustration. It’s tempting to dismiss Georgescu’s supporters as uneducated, misinformed, or duped by social media algorithms. But doing so ignores the broader context. Romania’s mainstream parties have not only failed to address core issues like inflation – currently one of the highest rates in Europe – but their corruption has also alienated voters. The results of this election should be a wake-up call to these parties. I and many other Romanians hold them responsible for what happened. The country’s supreme court has ordered a recount of all first-round votes to rule out a suspicion of fraud. It may even make a decision on Friday to annul the first-round result after two independent candidates, who received less than 1% of votes, filed fraud complaints. The decision is likely to polarise Romanian society further. What’s most alarming, though, is that Romania is no longer just grappling with corruption or incompetence – for the first time since 1989, it’s at a crossroads between the values of the EU and Nato and the allure of isolationism, conspiracy theories, anti-democratic ideals and Russia. Georgescu’s campaign has questioned everything from Nato’s missile shield in Romania to climate crisis, reproductive rights and our relationship with the EU, while praising Vladimir Putin and criticising our support for Ukraine. How did we reach this point? Platforms such as TikTok have become powerful tools for spreading nationalist propaganda, often without sufficient scrutiny. But as a society, we’ve failed to listen to each other’s frustrations and fears. If we are to move forward, we must bridge the divides that Georgescu’s rise has exposed. We need to sit down with our friends, family and neighbours – those who voted differently from us – and hear them out. The fight against polarisation and disillusionment must also include a reckoning with our political class, who have spent decades failing to deliver the reforms and accountability we desperately need. We have a chance to do that on Sunday, when we have parliamentary elections that can either result in an extreme rightwing coalition or a more moderate one made up of the old political parties and new progressive parties such as SENS and REPER. A week later, we have to choose between Georgescu and pro-European candidate Elena Lasconi in the second presidential runoff. We must not only confront the extremism Georgescu represents but also address the systemic failures that brought him to prominence. The road ahead is uncertain, but what is clear is that if Georgescu wins people like my childhood friend Diana, a talented medic who left Romania for Spain, disheartened by the dysfunction of our healthcare system – part of the country’s continuing brain drain – won’t come back. And Tomina, 28, working in corporate social responsibility for a bank in Bucharest, will be rethinking her decision to stay in Romania. Like many young professionals who returned after the pandemic, she’s now preparing to leave again. “I feel naive,” she admitted to me. “How did I miss this man’s rise?” Andrei Popoviciu is a Romanian investigative journalist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2024-11-10T06:30:09Z,How long will we stomach sermons from royals made rich by their own charities? | Catherine Bennett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/10/how-long-will-we-stomach-sermons-from-royals-made-rich-by-their-own-charities,"The British public remains immensely forgiving of royal failings, understandably when the family is fragile and struggling with serious illness. Huge public sympathy has allowed for the revival of a doting, vintage style of reporting that only a year ago might have seemed as absurd as it is, in the longer term, unwelcome. A recent palace announcement to the effect that Prince William is now a “global statesman” has been received, for example, with the same eager interest as his self-appointment as a homelessness expert, his decision to grow a beard and, a few days ago, his domestic hints: do remember to turn the palace lights out before you leave for another one down the road. Even a professionally made but excruciating video of sunkissed royals romping inspirationally in meadows was accepted, pretty much uncritically, as the new Windsor normal, and maybe it is. That said, new revelations about King Charles and his heir’s enormous untaxed wealth suggest that the palace might not want to get too confident about the current non-judgmental state of affairs. Not now that Channel 4’s Dispatches, the Sunday Times and the Mirror have between them, after an impressive investigation, disclosed what the royal family had until last week successfully concealed: that “the firm”, previously understood as self-deprecatory royal slang for their collective labour, is an entirely accurate term for a family company that transacts business for profit. In the case of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, the lands awarded to the king and his heir, the profits (on top of the sovereign grant) amounted last year to £27.4m for Charles and, for William, £23.6m. While it’s known that royal duchies are exempt from tax on corporate profits (the royals have begun paying income tax voluntarily), the investigation shows that these include rents extracted from the armed forces, the NHS, prisons and even charities that have Charles or William as patrons. Ex-military William, in uniform at all ceremonial events, is reportedly a “hands-on” duchy owner, so presumably knows that it charges the Ministry of Defence for training on Dartmoor. And for mooring boats at a royal naval college. A letter to the Daily Telegraph from a retired rear admiral confirms that the distaste provoked by these revelations is not confined to republicans. Charles is commander in chief. “The sums might be relatively small,” the rear admiral wrote, “but the optics are dreadful.” To comprehend, after these reports, the scale and purpose of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall is to appreciate the royal family, afresh, as essentially a massive property company whose corporate social responsibility (CSR) department, better known as the royal family, must be the envy of less competitive enterprises. While the firm’s CSR professionals – Charles, William and their more appealing dependants – deliver a range of brand-enhancing projects involving toddlers, reading, candlelit carols, mental health, less prominent colleagues quietly get on with amassing and raising rents, selling mining licences, collecting assets from the dead but intestate, renting out homes (including substandard ones) and monetising everything from a beach to a scout hut. William might be a limited statesman; as a property magnate in a pre-owned jacket, he has achieved what still eludes, say, James Dyson: delivering moral lectures without instant, retaliatory insults about his business practices. Equally, less fortunate spiritual leaders must dream of the sort of real estate income that, added to his crown estate percentage, has left Charles free to ponder what he calls the “giant paradox” of existence. Perhaps the abundant contradictions between untaxed rentals and “a faint memory of distant harmony that rustles like a breeze through the leaves” even contributed to Charles’s observation, in 2002, “that Man has a dual nature – his feet on the ground and his head in the clouds”. William appears similarly at ease with giant paradox, to the extent that he combines his mission as a global environmental authority with, as Dispatches has revealed, the sale of quarrying rights to a controversial German company, Heidelberg Materials. Discussing his Earthshot prize in South Africa last week, William said: “It’s very important with my role and my platform that I’m doing something for good.” Whether it was out of tact or by arrangement that what has been advertised as a “wide-ranging” interview did not address the royal news of the week, and what untaxed duchy estates say about “doing something for good”, that oversight should probably not be mistaken for indifference. Because, back home even the royals’ media allies, including critics unforgiving about the Duchess of Sussex’s jam enterprise, have been wondering if tax-paying subjects are going to forget about their contributions to the duchy owners’ untaxed commercial income. Justified suspicion about the core family’s openness, probity and claims to spiritual authority could be more threatening to its stability than Prince Andrew, the dead paedophile’s friend now generally sidelined in its church-based events. Still, a country that can tolerate sermons from the current archbishop of Canterbury is perhaps in no position to be picky about moral direction from his colleague, the king. If Archbishop Justin – a former mentee of the former Post Office boss Paula Vennells and now, we learn, sorry for not acting earlier on the latest prolific sex abuser associated with the Church of England – still believes himself entitled to enlighten the nation in emergencies and at Christmas, why shouldn’t Charles, technically Welby’s boss, do the same? In comparison with the Church of England’s record, only a handful of sex offenders have, after all, been associated with the king and his family. And if by Christmas Day Charles is still allowing Andrew the run of a 30-room mansion, an explanation can probably, after all this time, wait. If there is no need for commercial entanglements to spoil the king’s healing Christmas address, it might still be wise to lose, this year, the references to Bethlehem. They could be quite triggering for the tax compliant. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2025-02-21T12:20:22Z,Organizmo! The Colombian architects overturning colonialist ‘sustainability’ ideas,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/21/organizmo-the-colombian-architects-overturning-colonialist-sustainability-ideas,"A curious doughnut-shaped structure rises from an overgrown field on the outskirts of Tenjo, a rural town in central Colombia. It looks like a thatched UFO. Bamboo lattice walls curve up from the ground to form its bulging shell, tapering to a central chimney where wisps of smoke waft into the sky. Through the mesh walls, it is possible to make out bodies dancing in a circle around a fire, to the sound of drumming and chanting. “As architects, we need to unlearn everything we have been taught,” says Ana María Gutiérrez, standing outside this momentous structure in muddy overalls, boots and a broad-brimmed black hat. “Our idea of progress is completely based on colonialist, extractivist practices. People talk about sustainability, but what exactly are we sustaining?” The woven doughnut, Gutiérrez explains, is The House of Thought – an “intercultural temple” at the heart of her Centre for Regeneration. This is a 30-acre outdoor laboratory for indigenous construction techniques that she’s been building for 16 years. It is a place scattered with experiments, from structures that look like coil pots, to little domed houses built from sandbags. Some of the cavorting bodies inside the thatched temple belong to architects, who have come here for the day to cleanse themselves of their desk jobs, and get their hands dirty in workshops focusing on earth construction, ecological restoration, biodynamic agriculture and the healing properties of medicinal plants. Some are busy making bricks from troughs of mud. Like many of the day’s participants, Gutiérrez used to work in a corporate architecture practice, in her case in New York. One day, while on holiday back home in Colombia, she travelled to Barichara, in the north, to take part in a workshop on rammed earth. “The moment I was barefoot,” she says, “working with the earth, I was like, ‘What am I doing sitting at a desk, working on a computer all day, every day?’” She returned to Colombia in 2008, after inheriting land in Tenjo. Here, she resolved to create a centre for ecologically minded construction and “learning through sensorial experiences”. She established Fundación Organizmo, which helps remote tribal communities preserve and enhance their ancient skills. “What if we saw ancestral knowledge not as a romantic past,” she asks, “but as a vivid present that could teach us resilience?” With the help of a grant from the Re:Arc Institute, a non-profit that addresses climate breakdown, Fundación Organizmo has been working with villagers in the remote jungles of Matavén, along the Orinoco River in eastern Colombia, at the border with Venezuela. Here, the Piaroa de la Urbana community has long relied on growing palm – for weaving everyday objects, and to build with. “The weaving techniques are in danger of disappearing,” says Gutiérrez. “Only a few of the older generation know how to. So we designed a classroom with the community and created a curriculum to help preserve the tradition.” A second project, in Vaupés to the south-east, takes a more activist approach. Here, Organizmo is working with a group of young researchers from eight ethnic groups, to make films about the challenges facing local leaders battling land exploitation. They say the films are “to show the differences between ancestral leadership and the sort of political leadership we are experiencing at this time,” adding that they will “show our cultures, our daily life, our beliefs, our dances. We want to make people aware of our flora and fauna, and the richness of our resources.” These projects are typical of the amorphous initiatives that Re:Arc funds, operating somewhere between architecture, community organising and climate action. Established in 2022, the Copenhagen-based charity is funded by the Inter Ikea Foundation, the ultimate owner of Ikea, which made €2.2bn (£1.8bn) in profits last year. The ecological focus of its grants is not surprising. Ikea is the world’s largest consumer of wood and, over the years, the flat-pack furniture giant has come under fire for its environmental impact, accused of fuelling throwaway culture and accelerating the deforestation of protected areas. A recent Greenpeace investigation claimed that Ikea’s suppliers were sourcing timber from some of Europe’s last remaining old-growth forests in Romania. Other reports have highlighted the company’s links to illegal logging in Siberia, Ukraine and Brazil, as well as forced prison labour in Belarus. Ikea refutes Greenpeace’s accusations, insisting that the sourcing practices outlined in the report are legal. The company says it has ceased working with the Brazilian supplier, no longer sources wood from Siberia, and has terminated all contracts in Belarus. “Under no circumstances do we accept illegally logged wood, and we work actively to ensure that such wood is not used in our products,” Ikea said in a statement. “We do this through working actively with control measures via a comprehensive due diligence system which contains multiple safeguards. While no system guarantees against all risks, when we receive indications of misconduct, we immediately investigate and act on them.” Re:Arc doesn’t emphasise its links to Ikea, but its work could be seen as a small form of penance for its funder’s environmental sins – channelling some of the Billy bookcase fortune towards planetary restoration. Over the past two years, it has distributed grants of €15m (£13.4m) to 76 groups across more than 40 countries, ranging from indigenous minorities in Bangladesh to a participatory building charity for young people in London. Its current focus is on Latin America and the Caribbean, which holds half of the world’s biodiversity, and has lost 240,000 hectares of protected land to deforestation. It is also where Ikea is pursuing a $600m (£474m) expansion plan, with new stores in Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia. A 26,000 sq m store opened in Bogotá in 2023, followed by one in Cali, with another popping up in Medellín last October. A half-hour metro ride north of Medellín’s new megastore lies the neighbourhood of Moravia, where Re:Arc has also been working. The area was once home to a gigantic landfill site, the toxic dumping ground of what was then the most dangerous city on the planet. When it closed in 1984, desperate families started building their homes on top of the dump using whatever they could find, and the place swelled into an informal shantytown, ruled by rival drug gangs. In the early 2000s, as part of some sweeping transformations, the trash mound was turned into an urban park, community centres were built, and residents were allowed to legally purchase their homes. “A lot of people were relocated during the transformation,” says German architect Max Becker, who first came here 11 years ago. “They were put in seven-storey buildings, cut off from public transport, with no public facilities.” He started to bring his architecture students here from Berlin, and organised workshops with local people, which saw a new public staircase built through a poorly connected part of the neighbourhood. “As soon as we started, we had so many volunteers,” he says. “People donated concrete, paint and solar panels for lighting at night.” Together with the German architect Albert Kreisel and community leader Cielo María Holguín Ramírez, who grew up in Moravia, Becker established Oasis Urbano, a “think-and-do-tank” dedicated to co-creating urban improvements with local residents, a bottom-up alternative to Medellín’s top-down model. “I saw so many people killing each other on the street when I was a child,” says Holguín Ramírez. “Nobody wanted to come to Moravia. But over the last 35 years, it has become a safe, diverse and productive neighbourhood, through the commitment of the residents to improve their own area.” Oasis Urbano has since worked on building a linear park and a new public square, with a big mosaic map set into the ground, giving people a sense of ownership over the area – which is continually threatened with redevelopment. In 2018, they built a temporary bamboo community centre, called Taller Tropical. Over its three-year life, it hosted 10,000 people at events ranging from concerts, lectures, open-air cinema screenings and classes in everything from cooking and furniture-making to juggling and self-defence. With the help of Re:Arc, they are now working towards a more permanent venue, the Escuela Popular. It will be a bright yellow multistorey affair, with a restaurant and community kitchen on the ground floor, a library and space for artist residencies, and a roof terrace for cultural and educational activities. Construction is set to begin later this year. “We think of the whole building as an experiment,” says Becker, “which can also change depending on the needs of the community.” There will also be a “fab lab”, focused on recycling waste, where perhaps some Ikea furniture may one day end up – discarded Järvfjällets and Malms ready to be reborn in the cycle of extraction, consumption and corporate social responsibility. • Hear more about the work of Organizmo and other low-impact Colombian architects at Architecture on Stage: Learning from Colombia, at the Barbican, London, on 13 March.

2021-09-26T05:00:03Z,Why corporate social responsibility is BS | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/26/why-corporate-social-responsibility-is-bs,"In recent years, “corporate social responsibility” has been viewed by some as the answer to the multiple failings of capitalism. Chief executives have responded to all sorts of problems – worsening climate change, widening inequality, soaring healthcare costs and so on – by promising their corporations will lead the way to solutions because they’re committed to being “socially responsible”. Ninety-eight percent of this is rubbish. CEOs won’t do anything that hurts their bottom lines. They’re in the business of making as much money as possible, not solving social problems. In fact, real social change would prevent them from doing many of the hugely profitable things they now do. Which means they won’t change their ways unless they’re required by law to change (and even then, only when the penalty times the probability of getting caught is higher than the profits from continuing anyway). Their soothing promises of social responsibility are intended to forestall such laws. I’ve seen this repeatedly. When I was secretary of labor, big corporations would violate laws on worker safety, wages and hours and pensions, whenever doing so was cheaper than obeying the laws. And they’d fight like hell against such laws to begin with – all the while telling the public what wonderful citizens they were. You may recall that in August 2019, the Business Roundtable – one of Washington’s most prestigious corporate groups, on whose board sit the CEOs of Apple, Walmart and JPMorgan – issued a widely publicized statement expressing “a fundamental commitment” to the wellbeing of “all of our stakeholders” (emphasis in the original), including their employees, communities and the environment. The statement was widely hailed as marking a new era of corporate social responsibility. Since then, the Roundtable and its members have issued a continuous stream of jejune statements about their dedication to such things as providing childcare, pre-K and affordable healthcare, promoting community college and workforce training, alleviating poverty and reversing climate change. It turns out these are exactly the priorities in Joe Biden’s $3.5tn reconciliation bill. But guess what? The Business Roundtable isn’t lobbying for the bill. It’s lobbying intensely against it. Jessica Boulanger, a spokeswoman, told the Washington Post the Roundtable is engaged in “a significant, multifaceted campaign” to stop tax increases that would finance the bill, and will “continue to ramp up our efforts in the coming weeks”. The group is launching a seven-figure digital advertising campaign to oppose the bill. Hypocrisy? Only if you believed the Roundtable BS about corporate social responsibility. If you know the truth – that corporations will do whatever they can to maximize their profits and share values, social responsibility be damned – there’s nothing surprising here. Why didn’t business groups fight the president’s infrastructure bill? Because government spending on infrastructure helps their bottom lines by lowering their costs of procuring supplies and getting goods to market. Social responsibility had nothing to do with it. It’s tempting to chalk all this up to “corporate greed”. But that makes sense only if you think corporations are capable of emotions, such as greed. They’re not. Corporations aren’t people, no matter what the supreme court says. They’re bundles of contracts. The specific people who enter those contracts (on behalf of big corporations as well as thousands of people who run vast investment funds on behalf of millions of shareholders) are neither greedy nor socially responsible. They’re merely doing what they understand to be their jobs. Greed and social responsibility have been laundered out of these transactions. If we want these transactions to change – to align better with public needs rather than private profits – laws must change. For example, taxes on big corporations must rise in order to fund public investments and safety nets. But such laws won’t change if corporations continue to spend vast sums on politics. Corporate spokespeople like Boulanger of the Business Roundtable – along with platoons of corporate lobbyists and influence peddlers, corporate lawyers and hired-gun economists, corporate political operatives and PR flaks – together form in effect a fourth branch of government, wielding huge and increasing power. About one out of every four people now working in downtown Washington fills one of these roles. The result is clear. The most telling trends over the last three decades have been the growing share of the economy going into corporate profits – generating ever-greater compensation packages for top executives and ever-higher payouts for big investors (all of whom live off shares of stock) – and the declining share going to most Americans as wages and salaries. The meaningless blather over “corporate social responsibility” is intended to mask these trends. Biden’s $3.5tn plan is aimed at reversing them. But big business is doing everything in its power to sabotage Biden’s plan. The only way to stop this sabotage is to ignore all mention of corporate social responsibility and make one hell of a ruckus in support of Biden’s plan, as well as laws to reduce the power of big money in politics.

2024-06-04T15:00:56Z,"News outlets producing ‘covert marketing’ for McDonald’s, KFC and Domino’s, study finds ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/05/news-outlets-producing-covert-marketing-for-mcdonalds-kfc-and-dominos-study-finds,"Fast food chains are successfully influencing news outlets to produce “covert marketing” for their brands, a new study has found. The study, led by the University of Sydney’s School of Public Health, analysed all press releases from McDonald’s, KFC and Domino’s Pizza in Australia between July 2021 and June 2022. The findings, published on Wednesday in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, showed the press releases translated into overwhelmingly positive coverage of the brands. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Of 86 articles across 31 Australian news outlets that the researchers identified were generated because of the fast food brands’ press releases, they found 80 slanted favourably to the brands. Mail Online produced the most articles of any news outlet with 20 items, followed by news.com.au (16), the Courier Mail (8), the Daily Telegraph (6) and the Australian (4). Almost half (45%) of the articles profiled a new, unhealthy food product; more than a fifth (21%) promoted a brand’s corporate social responsibility credentials; while sponsored brand events, recruitment drives and new merchandise were the other main subjects identified by researchers. Dr James Kite, a co-author of the paper, said the six news stories that were judged to have represented the brands in a negative light were reporting on a negative social media reaction to what was announced in the press release. The researchers said the “implied endorsement” raises public health concerns given the poor nutritional quality of the foods sold by the brands and that several of the outlets publishing the stories were among Australia’s most visited news sites. The researchers expressed concern about “press release journalism”, where reporters presented the preferred narrative of the organisations issuing the press releases. They said this “appeared to be the case for most of the news media items included in our study”. They found four articles were identical to a press release, while press release content accounted for between 60% and 99% of a further 33 articles; 10 articles contained a mix (40% to 59% of press release content); and 39 articles contained less than 40% of material in a press release. Kite said news content generated by these media releases was part of the brands’ marketing strategies. “They want journalists and news outlets to pick this up and run it favourably – and what our research shows is that they definitely get that.” The paper noted “while the news media items included in our study were published by many different news outlets, none were published by Australia’s national broadcaster, the ABC, or by the Guardian”. The researchers accounted for this by pointing to editorial policies at the ABC and the Guardian that prohibit the endorsement of commercial products. They suggested other news media outlets adopt similar editorial standards, especially when dealing with products harmful to health. Kite said businesses have a right to promote their products but media organisations may need “a little push from regulation as well to make it clear that this is an unacceptable form of marketing”. In the same edition of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, another study showed the food and advertising industries co-opted not-for-profit organisations to push back against a Queensland government policy proposal to protect children from unhealthy food and alcohol marketing on publicly owned assets. The researchers used freedom of information requests to show that text within submissions that opposed the restrictions was almost identical between food, beverage, alcohol and outdoor advertising industries and five not-for-profit organisations, including three cancer charities, despite obesity and alcohol being risk factors for cancer. Prof Kathryn Backholer from Deakin University’s Global Centre for Preventive Health and Nutrition, the lead author of the second study, said “you can certainly see alignment between the industry arguments and the way in which the policy was watered down … and we’ve never seen the policy go any further”. Backholer, who was also a co-author on the first study, said “we know unhealthy diets are the No 1 reason for disease and death in Australia and elsewhere”. However, “the more that these unhealthy foods are written about, the more they’re marketed, the more that it normalises that these foods should be part of an everyday diet”. Unhealthy diets are related to an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease, as well as some cancers. By failing to prevent such marketing tactics “we’re just setting our kids up for a lifetime of increased risk of disease”, she said. Prof Simone Pettigrew, the program director of food policy at the George Institute for Global Health, said “these studies highlight the sophistication of the unhealthy food industry in the many and varied approaches being taken to promote products in a post-TV world”. “The strategies being employed involving policy influence and garnering unpaid media coverage demonstrate the ability of unhealthy food purveyors to bypass the existing inadequate controls that continue to focus on traditional media environments,” Pettigrew said.

2023-11-16T06:00:08Z,The government has lost control of the cost of living crisis – here's how businesses must step in | Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/16/cost-of-living-crisis-businesses-poverty-winter-companies-charities-gordon-brown,"A few weeks ago, a father walked into a charity warehouse, dumped his distraught 16-year-old son and walked away for good, saying he could no longer afford to keep him. The distress of that teenager cannot be dismissed as an isolated incident: the Lancet, the medical journal, has reported that poverty, as distinct from neglect, parental addictions or domestic violence, is now a principal cause of children being forced into care. Indeed, in a survey of low-income families in Fife, 11% of parents reported that without essential goods provided by local charities, their children might already be in care. By 2025, according to the County Councils Network, there could be as many as 100,000 in care in England alone. Mental illness and attempted and actual suicides, some of the hidden injuries of poverty that traditionally remain behind closed doors, are also on the rise. But a more visible sign of Britain’s increasing epidemic of poverty is that children are going to school not just ill clad and hungry but unwashed and unclean, with infections now being passed on in classrooms. Schools should not have to double up as launderettes for children’s clothes, but dozens of schools are installing washing machines. As a recent survey of teachers concluded, private hygiene is fast becoming a public health problem, with 71% of those polled expecting this to worsen in the coming months. Bronchitis, scarlet fever and rickets, caused by low levels of vitamin D and calcium, are joining malnutrition as medical problems doctors are having to address, with about 1,000 cases a year in England and Scotland . Tooth decay among children with no access to an NHS dentist is also on the rise. In total, 1 million children are considered destitute, lacking access to food, shelter, heating or toiletries, and every night 1.1 million boys and girls sleep on the floor or share a bed. More than 2m households live without at least one essential household appliance, such as a fridge, cooker or washing machine. Four out of five families on universal credit report going without food, turning off the heating and not replacing worn-out clothing. And nearly 3m UK low-income households have run up debt to pay for food, a crisis recognised by King Charles with his food initiative this week. And it’s not just the safety net that is being shredded; our social fabric is being ripped apart. We are now as divided as we were in Victorian times: the income of our top 0.1% – about £9,615 a week – is 100 times more than that of a universal credit claimant, on £92 a week. So as we enter one of the hardest winters in modern times, with not just food and fuel but almost every household item more expensive than last year, the autumn statement on 22 November is a defining moment, an acid test of whether poor people will remain invisible to the chancellor. I fear their desperate needs will again be ignored, as Jeremy Hunt is reportedly determined to cut yet another £4bn from the already meagre social security payments of hundreds of thousands of claimants. Once, charitable giving filled some of the gap, but it has halved in a year, with charities now as hard pressed as the people they serve. It is not that fewer people are giving, but that they are giving less. People with little who gave to those who have nothing have less left to give. And promises that high incomes would trickle down are sadly another neoliberal delusion. While there are many wealthy philanthropists who give generously, the top 1% as a whole typically declare donations averaging just £10 a week, much of which they can set against tax, their generosity extending to just 0.21% of their income. So, with breadwinners struggling to afford bread, food banks struggling to provide food and the safety net no longer fit for purpose, it is urgent that the one other sector central to our national prosperity – business – steps in. Already, a large number of companies do a great deal, but none can be truly secure when all around them millions are insecure and in despair. Two years ago, the US Business Roundtable in what was hailed as a revolution in corporate social responsibility, reaffirmed that shareholders had obligations to all their stakeholders, the general public included, and that serving their local communities was integral and not incidental to their raison d’etre. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no less important to business planning in Britain – one study showed that 52% of businesses now believe a successful CSR strategy can add value. I have no doubt that at some point in the future companies, which after all enjoy the privilege of limited liability under our laws, will be required by statute to publish accounts that measure not just their profit and loss but their social and environmental impact. To meet this winter’s poverty emergency, we urgently need a new social contract between companies and charities. First, companies have surplus goods that are often wasted, destroyed or sent to landfill. But they can be recycled, as is being done through FareShare, In Kind Direct and food banks. The idea is simple: companies have goods people need, and charities know the people who need them. Keen to reduce poverty and pollution at the same time, companies led by Amazon are donating to a new initiative: multibanks. These are not just food banks but clothes, furnishings, toiletries, baby and hygiene banks all rolled into one – and as such offer a holistic approach to meeting the needs of a family. Already, for example, the Textile Services Association and Whitbread are offering nearly new bedding that might otherwise be ripped up as rags. If tax law was changed to exempt charities and companies from VAT when goods are distributed free of charge, even more donations could follow. And if the government gave FareShare the £25m it has sought, much more surplus food from farms and shops could be distributed to hungry families. But so severe is this winter’s crisis that multibanks are pleading with companies to follow the lead of toiletries manufacturer Accrol and agree to donate necessities – such as soap, shampoo, nappies, toothpaste and cleaning products – with foundations and companies sharing the costs to ensure they are free of charge to families in desperate need. Next week the chancellor should announce a root-and-branch review of universal credit if we are to address Britain’s long-term poverty crisis. But this winter, with a new coalition of compassion between companies and charities, we can at least begin to ease the sorrows of Britain’s left-behind millions, relieve a mounting public health crisis, and at last, as more businesses respond, show we really are all in this together.

2024-03-18T06:00:04Z,"Banks driving increase in global meat and dairy production, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/18/banks-driving-increase-in-global-meat-and-dairy-production-report-finds,"Billion-dollar financing is driving unsustainable increases in global meat and dairy production, a report has found. Global meat production rose 9% between 2015 and 2021, the report said, while dairy production increased 13% in that time. Over almost the same time period, 2015 to 2022, financiers provided the world’s top 55 industrial livestock companies with average annual credit injections of $77bn (£60bn), and some appeared to compromise their own anti-deforestation policies to do so, according to the report. Credit, the report said, “is designed to help companies expand … and has helped drive a huge and unsustainable increase in global meat and dairy production”. Martin Bowman, policy and campaigns manager for Feedback, the UK-based campaign group that produced the report, said: “We’re calling for financial institutions to defund industrial livestock companies as soon as possible.” The sprawling risks of industrial animal agriculture catalogued in the report include its contributions to the climate crisis, deforestation, pollution, animal abuse, biodiversity loss, worker exploitation, human sickness and antibiotic resistance. Eating less animal protein and farming fewer animals, especially in richer countries, is the best way to reduce livestock emissions, the report said, referencing a survey of more than 200 climate scientists and food and agriculture experts. The survey found that to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, global livestock emissions need to peak by 2025 and fall 61% by 2036, with faster and deeper reductions in richer countries. The banks offering the most support to the world’s top 55 industrial livestock companies were Bank of America, which provided almost $29bn, Barclays with just over $28bn and JPMorgan Chase with almost $27bn, the report found. Barclays was the biggest lender to the Brazilian meat firm JBS, “the world’s highest-emitting livestock company”, it said. Big dairy financiers named in the report include Wells Fargo, which was the top creditor to Dairy Farmers of America, and ANZ bank, the biggest creditor to New Zealand’s Fonterra. In 2021, Dairy Farmers of America emitted more greenhouse gases than Denmark, and Fonterra was responsible for about 45% of New Zealand’s total emissions that year, it said. The report also found some banks compromising their own anti-deforestation policies to fund the Brazilian meat companies Minerva Foods, Marfrig and JBS. All three are frequently linked to deforestation. HSBC policy documents promise it will “not knowingly provide financial services to high-risk customers involved directly in or sourcing from suppliers involved in” deforestation. But, between 2015 and 2022, HSBC was the second largest creditor to Minerva and fourth largest to Marfrig, the report said. Bank of America was the fifth largest creditor globally to Minerva during the same period, the report said, despite a policy that says “lending proceeds are not used to finance commercial projects or operations” which lead to deforestation. Rabobank says it does “not finance any deforestation, even if legally allowed” in Brazil. However, the report found it provided credit to JBS and Minerva between 2015 and 2022. A Barclays spokesperson said its financial policies “were updated in April 2023 to include restrictions on beef production and primary processing in high deforestation risk countries in South America [and require companies] to respect human rights across their operations and supply chain”. Rabobank said in an email it was “actively combatting illegal deforestation” but did not comment on individual cases. When it received Feedback’s report it would “review its findings attentively”, it said. HSBC said it was “important [to] distinguish between entities that are [banking service] customers of HSBC … and other companies to whom we may appear to be linked to via shareholdings”, and that it had “a stewardship plan and engagement policy” for raising concerns with companies “including deforestation risk”. Marfrig rejected any connection with deforestation, saying its “entire production undergoes third-party audits of international recognition” with zero non-conformities found over the past 11 years. Until it had access to the full report, it was “impossible to provide” detailed responses, the company said, adding that defunding would hinder sustainable food system developments which depend on new investments “in technology, innovation, technical assistance, and training”. An 18-page Minerva statement said its efforts to protect the ecosystem on which it depends included the recent suspension of 414 Brazilian suppliers for illegal deforestation and other environmental issues, and a range of anti-deforestation successes in its direct cattle supply chain. However, it said, the monitoring of indirect supplier farms remained the “biggest challenge facing the entire sector”. It further detailed animal welfare policies, emission reduction projects and sustainability and human rights initiatives. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Others did not respond to requests for comment. The International Meat Secretariat said livestock businesses “are very aware of the need to develop and grow in a responsible way to provide the necessary essential protein for an increasing population”. It added that the commercial livestock sector “seeks growth to support growing demand” and was bound by “increasing controls, regulation” and corporate social responsibility requirements.",Meat industry; Agriculture; Environment; Banking; Climate crisis; Bank of America; Barclays; JP Morgan; Brazil; Wells Fargo; ANZ; Minerva; HSBC; World news; Food,Environment
2024-03-14T12:00:19Z,The cries from Britain’s struggling CEOs are growing louder – how can they survive on a mere £4.4m a year? | Stefan Stern,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/14/britain-ceo-pay-top-executives-exodus-us,"Every now and then, somebody lets the fat cat out of the bag. In January, it was the turn of Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica (the owners of British Gas), to say the unsayable about executive pay. His £4.5m pay package was “impossible to justify”, he said, “so there’s no point in trying to do that”. In 2016, there was a “Please, sir, I want some less” moment, when the then CEO of the Co-Op Group, Richard Pennycook, sought a 60% cut in his pay package as, he argued, his job had got simpler after a restructuring. But such episodes are unusual, and are often drowned out by the collective tutting and teeth-sucking of the top executive class. These admissions cause embarrassment and are not the story the business elite want to tell. Right now, in fact, pleas for even bigger and better pay packages are being heard in the City. Julia Hoggett, the CEO of the London Stock Exchange, has said that CEOs are getting paid at levels that are “significantly below global benchmarks”. She fears an exodus of businesses and executives who feel greater rewards will be found elsewhere, especially in the US, where top CEOs’ pay is on average about three times the level to be found at FTSE 100 companies. The High Pay Centre reports that, in 2022, the UK’s top CEOs were paid an average of £4.4m, while the equivalent US figure was then £13.1m ($16.7m). There is nervousness in the Square Mile about the “delisting” of UK-based businesses, although whether this is primarily about the pay packets on offer or has more to do with the sluggish post-Brexit business environment is an open question. Certainly, Hoggett’s boss, David Schwimmer, overall head of the London Stock Exchange Group, is worried. “If London has an ambition to be a globally leading financial centre and to attract world-class companies, that means it has to attract world-class talent,” he said recently on the subject of executive pay. (His personal anxieties may be eased should LSEG shareholders approve a proposed 76% pay rise for him, from £6.25m to £11m, in the coming weeks.) These are the conventional, self-serving arguments we have regularly heard from the highest-paid people. We need top talent, the bosses say – people like me. If you don’t pay us enough we will leave to work abroad or for private equity firms, where we will be paid more. This generous form of validation, offered to CEOs by themselves, does not always take into account the performance of the businesses they supposedly lead. Talent is not universal nor evenly distributed. But “benchmarks” can be useful to anyone looking to jack up their pay. Isn’t all this jockeying for position, the gaming of supply and (perceived) demand, just the free market and its participants at work, doing their thing? A Nobel laureate economist has just given this simplistic notion a massive kick in an article written for that subversive anti-capitalist outfit, the International Monetary Fund. In his recent piece Rethinking my economics, Angus Deaton, emeritus professor at Princeton, criticised his profession for underestimating how important power relationships are to economic outcomes. “Without an analysis of power, it is hard to understand inequality or much else in modern capitalism,” he wrote. A focus on efficiency at the expense of a discussion of equity means that “when efficiency comes with upward redistribution – frequently though not inevitably – our recommendations become little more than a licence for plunder”. In the end, Prof Deaton added, “social justice became subservient to markets”. We might also ask: is the US really the model we should be emulating? As Alison Taylor from New York University’s Stern School of Business writes in a new book, Higher Ground – how business can do the right thing in a turbulent world: “CEO pay packages keep growing more extreme, even in companies that trumpet corporate social responsibility.” And, she adds, while US philanthropic gifts are impressive, “philanthropy is no long-term solution for intractable societal problems such as rising inequality or tax avoidance”. Lastly, what do the workers make of all this? Pre-Covid, in fact as long ago as 2015, a survey of 1,000 employees for the HR trade body the CIPD found that about 60% believed CEO pay levels in the UK demotivate employees, while 71% agreed that CEO pay levels in the UK are generally too high. More than half (55%) said the high level of CEO pay in the UK is bad for companies’ reputations. I don’t suppose these numbers would look any better in the middle of today’s cost of living crisis. So there we have it. In “global Britain”, we have low pay for the masses, flat productivity, widespread economic inactivity, disenchantment and low morale. And the CEOs’ solution? Pay us more! That will fix it.

2024-02-08T03:16:16Z,"For corporations, greed is good – so how can Australia really tackle price gouging? | John Quiggin",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2024/feb/08/for-corporations-greed-is-good-so-how-can-australia-really-tackle-price-gouging,"The long-running debate over “price gouging” should have been settled yesterday by the release of a report by Allan Fels, the former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The report, commissioned by the ACTU, found that a wide range of Australian industries are characterised by limited competition, giving powerful firms ample scope to extract large profit margins. Consistent with international evidence, most of the inflation observed in the wake of the pandemic was captured in the form of increased profit margins. Contrary to the dominant economic model – in which inflation begins in the labor market, with higher wages being passed on to prices – the recent inflation has seen wages lag far behind prices. In some countries, notably the US, real wages have recovered, but in Australia they are still well below the pre-Covid level for most workers. The facts are clear enough. But they raise the question: why now? In addition to market power, much of the discussion of price gouging has focused on denunciations of corporate greed and on the various tricks (such as “shrinkflation”) that can be used to raise prices surreptitiously. But personal greed isn’t new (it’s one of the seven deadly sins, after all). There’s no obvious reason to think that corporate managers have become personally greedier in the years since the pandemic. More importantly: greed in the form of profit maximisation is the driving engine of capitalism. That’s why Gordon Gecko in Wall Street, echoing his real-life models Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken, said: “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.” In corporate-speak, this is usually shrouded in euphemisms like “shareholder value”, or softened by pledges of “corporate social responsibility”, but profit is still the main goal. Devices like shrinkflation have also been around for a long time. In his classic 1933 work The Theory of Monopolistic Competition, which (along with the contemporaneous work of Joan Robinson) introduced the idea of imperfect competition, Edwin Chamberlin described this and other deceptive practices. As for uncompetitive markets, this is certainly nothing new in Australia. It has mostly got worse over time, particularly as public infrastructure services have been sold off to private monopolies; but this trend hasn’t been uniform. Notably, the arrival of Aldi has provided some competition for the dominant supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles. And there has been no particular change that would explain the upsurge in profit margins over the last few years. Rather, recent inflation has resulted from the interaction between corporate market power and pent-up demand from forced saving during the lockdowns. Economic analysis, including my own work with Flavio Menezes (quoted in the Fels report), shows that increased demand allows firms with market power to increase their margins, exacerbating any initial inflationary shock. Unfortunately, the process does not work smoothly in reverse. Because wages are slow to adjust, a policy-induced slowdown – such as that now being engineered by the Reserve Bank – will prevent wages from catching up to past inflation, effectively freezing higher profit margins into place. What then, should be done? First, instead of focusing solely on the consumer price index as the measure of the “cost of living”, we should be looking at profit margins – largely determined by the gap between prices and wages. Restoring wages is more important than a rapid return to an arbitrary target rate of CPI inflation. In the longer term, we need to tackle the problems of an economy in which most markets are dominated by a handful of firms. In part, this can be achieved by strengthening the powers of the ACCC. Most importantly, as suggested in the Fels report, there is the possibility of breaking up firms that are already dominant in their markets – Qantas is an obvious target here. But in an economy as small as Australia’s, dominance by a handful of firms is inevitable in many cases. One possible solution, suggested in the Fels report, is more extensive price regulation. In the case of infrastructure utilities, the remedy in most cases is to abandon the failed experiments of privatisation and corporatisation and return to public ownership. Ideally, this would involve a statutory authority model in which the objective is to maximise social benefits rather than profits, while setting prices sufficient to cover operating and capital costs. It’s another idea that’s been around for a long time. But it’s one that might be worth trying.

2024-02-20T17:41:25Z,"I have your back, Rishi Sunak tells farmers at NFU conference",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/20/i-have-your-back-rishi-sunak-tells-farmers-at-nfu-conference,"Rishi Sunak has told farmers: “I have your back” at the National Farmers Union conference, as he promised to “change the culture” in government around farming. Sunak was the first prime minister to address the NFU conference since Gordon Brown in 2008, and had brought three Defra ministers with him to put the Conservative case to farmers. Farmers say recent flooding that has hit the UK could lead to a significant hit on food production. Sunak committed to improving food security in the UK and expressed concerns about low self-sufficiency in “things like tomatoes, pears, plums, lettuces and apples”. Sunak also said he had “once milked a cow”. He took two questions from the audience. Replying to one farmer, Hannah, from Hertfordshire, he admitted that allowing farmers to trade with the EU was a “work in progress”. He said: “We are working very hard with individual countries to ease all those areas in which there are differences. I’ll be totally honest, it’s a work in progress.” Farmers have been critical of trade deals undercutting their business, including the free trade deal with Australia and the prospect of importing Canadian pork and Mexican beef. Sunak said: “We are absolutely committed to supporting you and making sure that you are not undercut.” He expressed sympathy for those who had been affected by recent floods that had wiped out thousands of acres of crops. “It’s always devastating when that happens,” he said. Later, David Eudall, economics and analysis director at the Agricultural and Horticulture Development Board, told the conference that the rain would cause huge problems. “In previous years when we’ve seen this [level of rainfall], like 2019-20 when we had a very similar wet period through the autumn and winter for planting, we saw a 24% reduction in the planted area. Considering we’re in a similar area and have similar weather pattern we’d expect we’re going to see a similar magnitude of scale.” The Environment Agency chair, Alan Lovell, faced an angry reception from farmers who said the EA had worsened the flooding situation. He responded: “I take issue with the idea that water comes from the EA: water comes from above.” He also revealed a new inspections regime for sewage works, to restore checks to their level in 2010, before cuts by the Conservative party. Recent polling from the Country Land and Business Association found that people in rural areas are defecting to Labour in huge numbers, with the party’s share of the vote having climbed to 37%, up 17 points on the 2019 general election result, and the Conservatives’ share falling 25 points to 34%. More respondents in the poll believe Labour understands and respects rural communities and the rural way of life than the Conservatives (28% v 25%). The Conservatives hold 96 of the 100 most rural seats but face losing more than half to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, including those of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Hunt and Thérèse Coffey. Minette Batters, leading her last NFU conference as president, said the farming vote was still up for grabs and asked for Brexit-related labour problems to be solved. “Which party will introduce a minimum five-years seasonal workers scheme and recognise that we need more people if we’re to continue providing the raw ingredients for the country’s largest manufacturing sector?” she asked. “Which party will formally commit to sourcing more food from British farms? For our schools, hospitals, our military?” Batters alluded to protests in Wales, where farmers have been blockading roads with their tractors over plans to force them to plant 10% of their land with trees. She said: “I have watched and listened as the Welsh government try and deny our members and their children the farming futures they had planned.” The next big battle for the NFU is against the supermarkets, which they accuse of intimidating farmers and striking unfair deals, which cause them to go out of business. Batters said: “There are still many of our members who will not raise a complaint for fear of being delisted by supermarkets. Conference, this is wrong. It’s unfair, and totally unacceptable. In my last address as NFU president, I have a message to all food retailers and, most importantly, to their shareholders. You have a duty to your farmers and growers. They have a right to earn a fair price. For what they produce for you to sell. This means the culture at the top of food retail has to change. Right now, the badge of honour sits with an often ruthless buyer for negotiating the hardest deal [with] suppliers. Retailers should find them more than that. “That badge of honour needs to be worn by responsible board members who recognise the importance of long-term supplier relationships. But it’s really that we need a blueprint for action. My suggestion is that the Groceries Code Adjudicator survey of supplies is used to create a new framework. This would embed retailers’ ethical responsibilities to farmers and growers within their businesses, environmental sustainability goals and corporate social responsibility.”",Farming; Rural affairs; Rishi Sunak; Politics; Environment; UK news; Business; Conservatives,Environment
2023-10-19T14:00:13Z,Australia breaches WHO treaty with carbon neutral certification of big tobacco company ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/20/australia-breaches-who-treaty-with-carbon-neutral-certification-of-big-tobacco-company,"The government has been forced to revoke carbon neutral certification given to a big tobacco company after the endorsement was found to be in breach of a World Health Organization treaty to which Australia is a signatory. Freedom of information documents show a complaint was made by the managing director of the Carbon Reduction Institute, Rob Cawthorne, to the health department in August 2022 about British American Tobacco (BAT) receiving the certification from Climate Active. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A government-backed carbon neutral certification scheme, Climate Active is managed by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. It offers certifications for organisations who can show they are making efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. Those organisations can then use the certification trademark. In his complaint, Cawthorne wrote: “The certification itself could have the effect of saying smoking is not so bad because it causes no impact on our climate.” Australia is a signatory to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control [FCTC], which means the government must protect its policies from interference from the tobacco industry and its interests. Among many clauses, the FCTC states that government consultation with the tobacco industry should be limited to measures needed for public officials or agencies to enact effective tobacco control; that action should be taken to de-normalise the tobacco industry’s “socially responsible” activities; and thatpartnerships with the tobacco industry should be rejected. The documents show that after being alerted to the complaint, the health department’s director of tobacco control advised the Department of Industry that “promotion of the tobacco industry’s carbon-neutral operations could be perceived as a corporate social responsibility activity and government endorsement could be in contravention of the FCTC”. The director noted “the ‘greenwashing’ tactic used by the tobacco industry globally”. Greenwashing is described by the University of Bath’s Tobacco Tactics watchdog as harmful or controversial industries marketing themselves as environmentally friendly in a bid to divert public attention from their environmentally damaging practices. A report on tobacco industry greenwashing co-authored by the World Health Organization found that “at every step of production, the tobacco industry has an impact on the environment”. “It could be argued that the tobacco industry has attempted to greenwash its reputation and products through programs such as beach clean-ups, and funding environmental and disaster-relief organisations,” the report says. “This practice is especially true in low- and middle-income countries that tobacco companies target to increase sales and profits. In recent years, as the tobacco industry has tried even harder to rehabilitate its image, the evidence suggests its greenwashing activities and promotion has increased.” Becky Freeman, a professor of public health and tobacco-control expert, said the certification served “only to polish the tarnished reputation of an industry that annually kills more than 8 million people around the globe”. “To then accredit this company as a champion of protecting the future health of our planet is laughable.” Harmful industries should never be eligible for government-backed endorsements, Freeman said. “If your business model relies on lifelong addiction and is responsible for millions of preventable early deaths, no amount of greenwashing can make up for that.” Climate Active has itself been accused of greenwashing by former chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Prof Allan Fels, who told a Senate inquiry in July that the program was guilty of “misleading and deceptive conduct” through accepting the purchase of offsets as a “carbon neutral” activity, instead of requiring actual cuts in emissions. There is no record of the BAT certification under the Climate Active website list of previously certified brands. An environment department spokesperson said it was officially revoked on 9 December, and that Climate Active standards were updated to exclude tobacco-related organisations. Hansard records show that in February, Greens senator Sarah Hanson Young asked environment department officials about the Climate Active scheme and if officials were “worried that some of the certifications are not legitimate”. The department’s deputy secretary, Jo Evans, responded that “certainly issues have arisen over the last few years where we’ve questioned ourselves,” citing the example of certifying BAT. “On reflection and on advice from the department of health we made a decision that that probably wasn’t an appropriate certification, so we rectified that one,” she said. BAT was approached for comment. • This article was amended on 20 October 2023. An earlier version said the Climate Active scheme was managed by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources.

2023-09-04T08:53:16Z,"Fracking projects in NT risk exposing people to cancer and birth defects, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/04/fracking-projects-in-nt-risk-exposing-people-to-cancer-and-birth-defects-report-finds,"Fracking projects fast-tracked by the Australian government risk exposing people to cancer, birth defects, asthma, cardiovascular disease and other harms, a new report published on Monday has found. The report, led by the University of Sydney, was written in response to paediatricians in the Northern Territory who are deeply concerned about a full-scale fracking industry in the Beetaloo Basin. Guardian Australia’s exclusive investigation revealed the proposed Middle Arm industrial development on Darwin harbour would enable the export of gas from the basin, despite the project being labelled a “sustainable development precinct”. Drawing on evidence from projects overseas, the report synthesises more than 300 recent peer-reviewed scientific papers on the risks posed by oil and gas operations to biodiversity, water and food security, contributions to the climate emergency, potentially harmful chemicals involved, contamination of air and water, as well as wider health risks associated with the disruption of life near oil and gas fields. Melissa Haswell, lead researcher and professor of environmental wellbeing, said government decisions have not taken the health impacts of gas and oil developments seriously enough. She said recent major studies from the United States have seen the evidence for health harms grow “substantially stronger”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Some of the most damning evidence includes increased instances of heart failure, asthma hospitalisations, a blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia and birth defects in communities living near gas and oil exploration sites, Haswell said. “The research has become so elegant, they can very clearly show that the differences that they see with people’s exposure to the industry didn’t happen until the industry came in. So we know the egg came before the chicken.” The evidence includes research that shows people living downstream or downwind from the projects experienced health harms, while those in communities upwind or upstream did not, Haswell said. Australia already has a coal seam gas industry, Haswell said, but shale gas mining in the Beetaloo Basin, which is “knocking on our door”, involves drilling three to four kilometres down to where the shale was deposited up to 400m years ago. “So when they drill and bring up the water, that water contains a whole array of chemicals that have activities that we know if someone’s exposed to them, then there is an increased risk of … illnesses.” Prof Jennifer McKay, an expert in corporate social responsibility and environmental law from the University of South Australia, said the report contains information that is “long overdue to be put into the public domain”. “The debate has always been skewed by the wrong factors,” McKay said. “It’s great to have medical scientists producing information that is relevant to public decision making and getting that elevated in the decision makers’ minds but also importantly, in the minds of the community who haven’t been seeing often the full arguments.” Dr John Van Der Kallen, national chair of Doctors for the Environment, said while there have been some Australian studies examining the health impacts of gas developments, they have not been as extensive as those which have come from the US, where there are denser populations around the gas wells. The report includes research from large population studies, Van Der Kallen said. “These are massive studies that are able to quantify the health impacts.” “Most concerning is the effects on pregnant women, on unborn children, then infants and then children, because many of these chemicals will then accumulate in a small human’s body and have impacts for decades,” he said. “So those impacts we are yet to see.” In August more than 2,000 doctors, GPs and health professionals signed a letter to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, demanding the government reconsider subsidising the Middle Arm project and “intervene to prevent gas fracking in the Beetaloo Basin, acknowledging that the emissions cannot be fully offset”.",Health; Australia news; Fossil fuels; Fracking; Energy; Environment,Australia news
2023-10-21T19:00:55Z,‘I never thought he would steal from me’: Australia’s youth gambling crisis is taking a toll on families,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/22/australia-youth-gambling-crisis-is-taking-a-toll-on-families,"Wendy* could tell something was wrong by the look on her son’s girlfriend’s face when she came down to the kitchen on Easter morning. “He’d been out with his mates, had a few drinks, got her phone, got into her savings account, and gambled $2,800 into two bets,” she says. Her son’s girlfriend burst into tears. “She said, ‘I never … thought he would steal from me.’” Wendy’s 22-year-old son had started gambling just before he turned 18, when he was working as a landscape apprentice with a boss heavily into gambling. His girlfriend has now left him and Wendy estimates that she and her husband have spent up to $25,000 paying off his gambling debts. A Guardian Australia investigation into the youth gambling crisis revealed a 16% increase in the number of young people seeking help for gambling in the past financial year, many of them entering adulthood with debt, broken relationships and depression. It led MPs to call for an urgent parliamentary inquiry into the impact of advertising by harmful industries, including gambling, on children and young people, and also prompted many parents, including Wendy, to share their stories. Wendy says she and her husband tried to stop their son from gambling but he would turn to his friends for money instead, and they would charge him interest. Wendy says her son has acquired more gambling debt by using money lending apps. She and her husband are now dipping into their savings to pay $55,000 to send him to live-in rehabilitation for one month. “It’s got really, really bad.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “I’m just so fortunate that I’m in a position to be able to do this,” Wendy says. “But there’s so many other parents out there that just aren’t and that makes me so sad. The government needs to stop the gambling advertising on the television, stop shoving it down these kids’ faces.” Just like tobacco Dr Simone McCarthy and her colleagues from Deakin University’s faculty of health have just finished interviewing 500 parents across Australia about their concerns about risky products their children are engaging with, including gambling. Each of the parents has a child aged between 11 and 17. “Parents are concerned, particularly around how children see gambling as a way to make money, and that comes back to the way that the ads are presenting gambling as a fun, social and easy way to make money,” McCarthy says. McCarthy and other public health experts say that, particularly in the online space, celebrity endorsements, influencer endorsements and “risk-reducing” promotions such as cash-back offers are having the most impact on young people, by prompting them to think that gambling has little or no risk attached to it. “Parents told us it is hard to … counter all the positive messages their children get [about] gambling, from such a powerful industry,” McCarthy says. “They think it’s the gambling industry as well as the government who holds the most responsibility and ability to implement change.” Along with comprehensive gambling advertising bans, including on team sports uniforms, experts say governments must tackle the way the gambling industry seeks to influence public opinion and policy. Like the tobacco industry, this includes political donations, corporate social responsibility strategies and lobbying. The independent MP Zoe Daniel has been advocating for publication of all ministerial diaries in real time so voters can see the industry representatives and lobby groups their elected representatives are meeting with. Guardian Australia asked the offices of the federal health minister, Mark Butler, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and the social services minister, Amanda Rishworth to provide details on the number and nature of meetings they have held with gambling industry representatives, including gambling companies, broadcasters, other media organisations and sporting codes. None of the ministers’ offices would provide the information. “To refuse to do so sits uncomfortably with the prime minister’s post-election promise to ‘change the way’ we do politics,” Daniel says. “If it’s good enough for state governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania to publish minister’s diaries so should the Albanese government. “We do know that gambling outfits, media companies and sports organisations have ready access to ministers … this is not the case for advocates for a ban on the scourge of gambling advertising.” Betting at school Georgia*, a high school teacher, says online gambling games have become the “new normal” among her students. “I have witnessed high school students in grades as young as year 7 play games that are designed like gambling machines,” she says. “I have seen older students in the last four years gamble on horse racing ‘games’ and then from there, witnessed year 12 students placing proper bets during class time and some of them monitoring their cryptocurrency in class. “It appears to be a new normal. They are unable to stop themselves from checking their devices in class because of this. It is incredibly concerning.” Melanie*, who has been teaching for 12 years, says before the Covid-19 pandemic she had never known a student to bet on sports for money. But it has become a relatively new pastime of her students and she believes their high exposure to gambling ads and apps online is partly to blame. “My year 12 class, who’ve recently finished, were super addicted to gambling apps on their phones,” she says. She describes her students as “pretty well-rounded students”. “They’re academic, they play sports, they’re not just sitting at home on a computer all the time. But then somehow, I think, because they were at home [during Covid-19], not able to do those things for a long time, somehow they got hooked on to this gambling stuff”. They aren’t gambling in class because it is a no-phones school but Melanie says they talk about gambling openly, including about how much money they have lost and won. “There are also many students who go to the pokies once they turn 18 as a thing to do on a weekend night,” she says. “Many younger students are highly addicted to video games that give you tokens or coins … they are not gambling but the likeness of these games to gambling is hard to deny.” *Names changed Are you a parent or teacher concerned about youth gambling?

2023-10-03T14:00:17Z,"‘Before, after and in class’: teachers say they are grappling with a growing gambling problem in Australian schools",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/04/australia-youth-gambling-crisis-schools,"Addiction to gambling and other harmful products such as vaping is affecting children’s ability to learn and concentrate at school during a critical time in their brain development, the CEO of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, Dr Chris Duncan, has warned. “I’m teaching many kids with chronic mental health issues related … [to] these areas,” he said. “The state of mind of kids is being altered because of these harmful industries. “And when kids are in a certain sort of mental state, they’re not conditioned to learn anything at school, they’re not able to focus,” he said. This week a Guardian Australia investigation revealed a 16% increase in the number of young people seeking help for gambling, with youth entering adulthood with debt and depression. It’s a trend that education professionals say they are seeing evidence of in classrooms. Duncan said it can be frustrating to see media reports about Naplan results “and wringing our hands about schools not doing enough, and the teachers not being good enough”. “But these are the issues teachers are dealing with,” he said. “Organisations are using technology to get kids addicted to stuff. “Many video games … verge on gambling in terms of the noises and the kind of rewards in the game. And we would argue it’s a process of normalisation or conditioning at work.” Teresa* told Guardian Australia she was working at a “decent” high school last year and witnessed the “massive gambling problem in the soon-to-be grads”. “The ones over 18 all had sports bets app accounts and largely encouraged younger teens to sign up,” she said. “They gambled before, after and in class, they often took money from younger peers to make bets for them. The teachers did their best to educate and discourage, but it was prolific.” A former student, Alex*, told Guardian Australia that at his private boys high school in Melbourne “there was consistently a group of 15 to 20 boys on Sportsbet either skipping classes or [using it] during lunch”. “They would get their parents or older siblings to sign them up and then proceed to use their allowance money on it,” he said. “It was spreading in popularity with even younger boys by the time I graduated.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The chief executive of Independent Schools Victoria, Michelle Green, said gambling among school students both in public and private schools was “exacerbated by relentless saturation advertising” by gambling companies. “The growing incidence of gambling by young people, including school students, is an issue of serious concern to all schools and parents, regardless of sector,” she said. “Principals and teachers know this is a growing problem. “It’s clear from the proliferation of gambling in society that this is not an issue schools can tackle on their own – it’s a community-wide problem which requires a coordinated response, including from governments.” A study on sponsorship of sport by various industries including food, alcohol and gambling, published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, found: “There is strong evidence to suggest that children, especially those under eight years old, are extremely susceptible to marketing because they do not have the experience or cognitive skills to critically evaluate the messages being promoted.” A professor of public health with the Australian National University, Emily Banks, said: “Addiction pathways are set down in adolescence. “You are setting up patterns by gambling in adolescence that set up feedback loops for addiction,” she said. “It’s why these industries actively try to get people addicted as teenagers, because then they have lifetime customers. The scale of the problem is huge.” In a school-wide bulletin issued to the Carey Baptist Grammar School community in Kew, Victoria, the deputy head of senior school, Christian Gregory, wrote he was “quite startled with the sophistication of gambling the students know and conduct regularly”. Gregory wrote that a student asked him who he thought was going to kick the first goal in an upcoming footy match, and he responded ‘Kosi Pickett’. “The following Monday when I bumped into this particular student, he thanked me for this info and said it was a cracking multi,” Gregory wrote. A multi bet combines a series of bets into one wager. “Gambling among school students is on the rise,” Gregory wrote, adding that the school was among several in Victoria trying to raise awareness of gambling among youth. Prof Alex Russell, a principal research fellow with CQUniversity’s experimental gambling research laboratory, said young people were bypassing the requirement to be over the age of 18 to access gambling products. While there were age checks at the door at physical establishments, Russell said school age youth were either using fake IDs or finding smaller venues that don’t check as often or as rigorously. Meanwhile, online platforms make it even easier to get around the age requirements as they don’t check age each time a bet is placed, Russell said. “With online, once you’ve got an account you’re pretty much good to go. If you can get through that initial check, then you’re able to gamble.”Russell said there were also “real grey areas” when it comes to the digital environment. For example, loot boxes in video games were “pretty much a gambling product”, Russell said, but they were still not treated as such. A spokesperson for the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) said social media and streaming services were popular ways to target young gamblers. “This raises an additional concern as these types of services provide a dynamic and accessible platform for influencers and are typically accessed by younger demographics,” the spokesperson said. Many of the illegal services that Acma investigates are in jurisdictions overseas with minimal, if any, regulatory oversight. “The digital environment also provides opportunities for offshore operators to avoid enforcement actions, and for consumers to access blocked sites through the use of virtual private networks and other tools.” Website blocking is effective in disrupting – although not preventing – the illegal gambling services being provided into the Australian market, the spokesperson said. In July, the standing committee on social and legal affairs delivered its report from its online gambling inquiry, recommending a progressive ban on all forms of advertising for online gambling, with tighter restrictions on advertising during news and sports broadcasts. But the New South Wales government declined to endorse the inquiry’s call for a total ban within three years. Dr Jonathan Hallett, from Curtin University, is investigating youth exposure to gambling marketing and said comprehensive regulation beyond that called for by the inquiry was needed to protect children. “Policy should also take into account the broad range of contemporary gambling marketing tactics, including political donations, corporate social responsibility strategies, and lobbying,” Hallett said. “Legislation should aim to actually prevent children and young people from being exposed to gambling marketing. This would entail comprehensive bans on all forms of marketing for gambling products. This includes a complete ban on gambling sponsorships during sporting events, and on team wear.” Effective regulatory oversight also requires an independent body, uninfluenced by the gambling industry, with appropriate resources and penalties for breaches, he said. *Names changed to protect identities Are you a parent or teacher concerned about youth gambling?

2022-12-26T18:41:05Z,How price pressures lead to exploitation of workers | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/dec/26/how-price-pressures-lead-to-exploitation-of-workers,"Your editorial (21 December) about Tesco’s garment supply chain is welcome, but the global garment production system of downward pressure on prices and labour costs, unreasonable lead times, subcontracting and denial of workers’ rights is neither news nor accidental. Global brands decided in the 1980s to move production from democracies that protected workers’ rights to dictatorships that didn’t. A vast corporate social responsibility (CSR) and “social auditing” industry grew, but paternalism and snapshot workplace audits are no substitute for proper labour relations and public labour inspection, and the Rana Plaza factory disaster confirmed earlier research showing that much social auditing is technically incompetent. The Guardian’s repeated application of “exploitation” as a moral rather than an economic category, however, weakens understanding: extracting profit from labour is the foundation of capitalist economies. In 1998, the declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work of the International Labour Organization clarified the obligations binding on its 187 member states to protect, respect and realise the rights to freedom from forced labour, child labour and discrimination at work and, above all, the rights to organise and bargain collectively, and their essential purpose: “to enable those concerned … to claim a fair share of the wealth they have helped to generate”. This year, occupational safety and health became the fifth category of these fundamental rights. Most workers in the world are still denied those rights in law or practice. If businesses had not wasted decades and billions of dollars constructing CSR facades to protect their brand image and share value, but instead had invested with trade union organisations and governments in constructing labour relations systems grounded in collective bargaining, public labour inspection and decent work, then value chains delivering social and economic justice would today be underpinning sustainable, rights-based development.

2023-07-14T14:00:03Z,How food companies ‘sweetened the world’ – and increased the risk of disease,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/14/how-food-companies-sweetened-the-world-and-increased-the-risk-of-disease-acc,"The bright red bottle of Sting, an energy drink, catches Sunita Devi’s eye when she finds her local shopkeeper has run out of the biscuits she hoped to buy to fuel her son through his homework. She cannot read the English label, but 10-year-old Ajit says it sounds healthy. “Stimulates mind, energises body” the bottle proclaims. It’s the type of marketing that helps shop owner Vasu Gupta sell energy drinks – mostly to families who have migrated from the countryside to a slum in Govindpuri in the Indian capital, Delhi. But the drink, which is made by PepsiCo India, is not quite as beneficial as it sounds. A 250ml bottle contains 17g of sugar – a third of the daily intake recommended by the World Health Organization, although there is nothing on the packaging to warn about its high sugar levels; and the small print on the back says the drink is not recommended for children. Drinks and snacks claiming to be good for consumers are concerning food campaigners working in India and elsewhere in the developing world, who say that food companies are getting away with marketing ultra-processed foods, high in sugar and salt, by promising health, height, strength, energy and even happiness. The result, they say, is a crisis in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the form of rising diabetes and hypertension and poorly nourished children, which reaches even into the countryside – once considered to be unaffected by “western” diseases linked to sedentary urban life. The link between unhealthy diets and ultra-processed food and drinks prompted the WHO to issue guidelines this month recommending that governments restrict marketing of foods high in fat, sugar and salt to children, because of the harmful impact on their health and nutrition. Arun Gupta, head of the thinktank, Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest – India, says there is a “ticking timebomb” in the country, as NCDs increase and food corporations continue to misleadingly market processed foods. “They sell happiness, they sell it as ‘this is the modern world’ … everybody wants their child to grow well, tall and free from disease. Those aspirations are actually used, emotionally exploited,” he says. Gupta says he routinely finds foods marketed towards children that make significant health claims, but when analysed are high in sugar and highly processed, such as a whey protein product called Supermilk targeted at children as young as four. The brand behind it, Gritzo, markets its product with adverts that suggest it can aid a child’s development into an athlete, as well as a video with an actor portraying a “smart mom” claiming that traditional food “is not necessarily good enough for today’s generation”, and promoting Supermilk. However, when Gupta studied the ingredients, he discovered there were 50.8g of sugar per 100g – more than half the contents before milk is added. The product also recommends adding more sugar to taste. He points out that even the protein content could be harmful. “It’s possible that a kid’s regular, home-cooked food provides adequate protein for them,” he says. Additional protein could cause dehydration by putting a strain on kidneys, and children with poor digestion could also have difficulty processing high levels of protein. Ashish Verma, another Govindpuri store owner, says PediaSure, a protein shake which claims to help growth, immune functions and brain development, is also popular with parents. “Parents want energy bars and beverages that will keep their children strong and healthy. Some years ago, Horlicks advertised that it could help children pass exams and we finished our stocks in two days,” says Verma. The maker of PediaSure, Abbott, is fighting a class action lawsuit in the US disputing its assertion about boosting height, yet for some consumers the chance that these products can live up to their “clinically proven” claims keeps them buying them. Gupta says celebrities are often used to promote ultra-processed foods as an alternative to traditional food. In December, he wrote a letter complaining to Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan after he promoted a biscuit brand as equal to homemade bread for busy parents. Gupta has focused on tackling misleading marketing for children’s foods, and has fought against companies marketing baby formula as an alternative to breastmilk. In 1991, he established the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India, but says it is hard to keep up with the pace of marketing campaigns. “The market has become very aggressive in terms of promotion. The industry has used every tactic,” he says, adding that while India has a law limiting the marketing of baby foods to children under two, companies persist in promoting them. “They continue to put their money into marketing, for example getting to the health workers – there have been reports of paying cash, there have been reports of helping with services. We are unable to control that because the government is not very serious.” The NCD alliance, a global network driving action on non-communicable disease prevention and care, accused corporations of benefiting from Covid by using it to increase awareness of their brands, such as through donations of their products during lockdowns. Research published in the WHO’s journal in May showed that baby foods are a particular concern. While there are global regulations in place to stop the marketing of breastmilk alternatives to children under six months, it found “growing-up” formulas were commonly marketed at children above that age. According to the research, more than 90% of sales of growing-up formula took place in low- and middle-income countries in 2022. This trend has helped fuel the amount of sugar bought through baby and infant foods, which doubled in developing countries from just over 400bn grams in 2010 to about 800bn grams in 2021. Nutritionist Barry Popkin, who co-authored the research, says food corporations have “sweetened the world” by encouraging snacking in markets where it was previously rare and through high-sugar and salty foods marketed at very young children. He says these foods can end up being a leading source of calories but are nutritionally lacking while also giving children a taste for addictive sweet and salty foods, increasing their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases. The WHO’s new guidance on marketing unhealthy foods says poor diets were responsible for about 8 million deaths linked to NCDs in 2019. “When you get undernutrition as an infant it stunts you for life, it affects your body composition and it increases the amount of fat around the heart and liver, which we call visceral fat, and that’s the most dangerous fat,” says Popkin, because of the fat’s link to problems such as insulin resistance, which is the cause of type 2 diabetes. “So when you see countries like India, Nepal and African countries, where you see an increasing amount of these products fed to infants, let alone two- to four-year-olds, you’re just feeding their obesity and enhancing their desire for sweetness – and it carries over to later life.” According to Popkin, widespread snacking is a relatively new trend that was pushed through the marketing of multinational food companies during the 20th century in high-income countries, to the point where it has become normal. Those markets, he says, have become saturated and so the companies began looking at the rest of the world. “Industry was marketing it, pushing it, making it available, making the prices attractive, giving it away in schools, at sporting events. That’s how they grew the sugary beverage market and that’s how they grew other snacking markets,” he says. “During Covid, in every country I’ve worked in, they were giving away junk food and sugary beverages to the poor, saying ‘this will help you’.” Public health researcher Edwin Kwong was part of a team that looked at how large corporations target developing countries by buying local competitors and investments such as production plants. This also gives them sway over governments when fighting against food regulations by touting the economic benefits and employment they bring. However, Kwong says any claims they make about economic or social benefits of their companies are simply to drive more market share. “The only corporate social responsibility of corporations is profits, it’s to shareholders. So for them, it is a market to grow profits, that’s why they target them. It’s as simple as that,” says Kwong. He says companies should be held responsible for rising NCDs in developing countries and that NCDs are not self-inflicted “lifestyle diseases”, because aggressive marketing by “big food” has stripped consumers of their ability to make healthy food choices. He adds that while most people in developing countries understand the dangers of infectious diseases, they have not yet grasped the threat posed by NCDs. “I don’t think people would classify [NCDs] as an epidemic, even though it absolutely is; it kills a lot of people. It’s about trying to alert people around the world to this issue, and holding those responsible accountable. This includes these large transnational organisations whose profits continue to grow – the people responsible for maiming, injuring, killing a lot of people are not held to account,” says Kwong.

2022-06-06T10:23:32Z,How Texas punishes companies who ‘discriminate’ against gun manufacturers | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/06/how-texas-punishes-companies-who-discriminate-against-gun-manufacturers,"After a 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead, JPMorgan Chase, America’s largest bank, publicly distanced itself from the firearms industry. Its chief financial officer reassured the media that the bank’s relationships with gunmakers “have come down significantly and are pretty limited”. That was then. This past September, a new Texas law went into effect that bans state agencies from working with any firm that “discriminates” against companies or individuals in the gun industry. Texas’s new pro-gun industry law requires banks and other professional service firms submit written affirmations to the Texas attorney general that they comply with it. What was JPMorgan to do? Sticking with its high-minded policy of “significantly” reducing business with gun manufacturers would result in exclusion from Texas’s lucrative bond market. Texas sold more than $58bn of bonds in 2020, and is currently the second largest bond market after California. (I’ll come back to California in a moment.) JPMorgan Chase had been among the top bond underwriters for Texas. Between 2015 and 2020, the bank underwrote 138 Texas bond deals, raising $19bn for the state, and generating nearly $80m in fees for JPMorgan, according to Bloomberg. Yet since the new Texas law went into effect in September, the bank has been shut out of working for the state. JPMorgan’s dilemma since Texas enacted its law has been particularly delicate because Jamie Dimon, its chairman and CEO, has been preaching the doctrine of corporate social responsibility: repeatedly telling the media that big banks like JPMorgan Chase have social duties to the communities they serve. (On Wednesday, Dimon dismissed claims that such an approach is “woke.”) So what did JPMorgan decide to do about financing gun manufacturers, in light of the new Texas law? It caved to Texas. (Never mind that last year, the bank’s board granted Dimon a special $52.6m award – which is almost three-quarters of the fees the bank received from underwriting Texas bonds between 2015 and 2020.) On May 13, one day before the Buffalo mass shooting and less than two weeks before the Texas shooting, JPMorgan sent a letter to the attorney general of Texas, declaring that the bank’s policy “does not discriminate against or prevent” it from doing business “with any firearm entity or firearm trade association based solely on its status as a firearm entity or firearm trade association,” adding that “these commercial relationships are important and valuable”. The Texas law barring the state from doing business with any firm that discriminates against the gun industry is the first of its kind in the country. But similar laws, described by gun industry lobbyists as “Find” laws, or firearm industry nondiscriminatory legislation, are now working their way through at least 10 statehouses, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. This year, Wyoming passed a law that allows gun companies to sue banks and other firms that refuse to do business with them. The lesson here is twofold. First, pay no attention to assertions by big banks or any other large corporations about their “social responsibilities” to their communities. When corporate social responsibility requires sacrificing profits, it magically disappears – even when it entails financing gunmakers. But secondly, no firm should be penalized by pro-gun states like Texas for trying to be socially responsible. How to counter Texas’s law, and other Find laws in the pipeline? Lawmakers in progressive states such as California (whose bond market is even larger than Texas’s) should immediately enact legislation that bars the state from dealing with any firm that finances the gun industry. In other words, big banks like JPMorgan should have to choose: either finance gunmakers and get access to the Texas bond market. Or don’t finance them and gain access to the even larger California bond market. Bonus that comes with the second option: you get to claim you’re being socially responsible.

2022-04-17T17:25:34Z,The Guardian view on the future of buildings: make do and mend | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-buildings-make-do-and-mend,"A controversial decision by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to allow the demolition of a flagship Marks &amp; Spencer store on London’s Oxford Street is one of the highest-profile instances so far of what is certain to become a wider debate about embodied carbon. This crucial term, which refers to the carbon emissions of a building over its lifetime, urgently needs to be brought into wider circulation. In the UK, buildings are estimated to be responsible for 23% of all emissions. With its millions of Victorian and Edwardian terraces, the UK has some of the oldest housing stock in the world. So the idea of a “throwaway building culture”, as Will Hurst of the Architects’ Journal describes our contemporary attitude to construction, takes some getting used to. But developers, particularly of large-scale projects, routinely look for a blank slate on which to place a new edifice. Demolition is part of what the construction industry does. Emissions calculations are more complicated than in other sectors because of the role played by time. Arguments over the Marks &amp; Spencer decision, and other proposed demolitions such as that of the fire-damaged Assembly Rooms in Derby, arise because short-term and long-term impacts have to be weighed along with other considerations. In environmental terms, the question comes down to whether the benefits of a new, energy-efficient building will offset the emissions of a demolition and construction project. Recycling, refurbishing and retrofitting are the way forward, and architects and engineers have come up with some ingenious solutions. One block of flats in Copenhagen reused the brick walls of a brewery by cutting them into panels. But such innovative examples of reuse aside, Lord Deben, chairman of the UK’s Climate Change Committee, was right to say last year that “we have to learn to make do and mend” as an alternative to pulling down buildings as a matter of course. Such a shift poses particular challenges in the dysfunctional UK, where property price inflation and rent extraction have, to a damaging extent, taken the place of economically productive activity. While the government has promised a new focus on embodied carbon, any shift in the approach taken by the construction industry will require economic incentives. Vague notions of corporate social responsibility will not cut it. Whole-life carbon assessments should form part of every planning process, with decision-makers empowered to reject schemes that do not meet strict standards. Changing the law to remove the tax advantage of new-builds over refurbishments is one obvious step. The size of this undertaking should not be underestimated. But nothing about the struggle against global heating is easy. Like his support for the Silvertown tunnel, Mr Khan’s refusal to prevent the Marks &amp; Spencer scheme sends a worrying signal. The challenge is to make such decisions, and the economic and political conditions that enable them, a thing of the past as quickly as possible.",Environment; Climate Change Committee; Architecture; Property; Construction industry; London; Marks & Spencer,Opinion
2022-05-30T23:00:01Z,Why one cat food brand has made it a priority to bring life back to our reefs,https://www.theguardian.com/dine-hope-grows/2022/may/31/why-one-cat-food-brand-has-made-it-a-priority-to-bring-life-back-to-our-reefs,"“What we’re interested in is: how do you mobilise community, the public and organisations into highly scalable conservation?” says Andy Ridley, CEO of Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef (known to friends as “Citizens”), a conservation organisation fighting for the future of this much-loved Australian icon. Through his work, a community has grown around the hope that life can thrive on the reef. It’s an immense task that requires action at a massive scale. But Citizens is just one part of what it calls the reef cooperative. Citizens works with a multitude of groups to make change, from tourism operators and rangers, to the traditional owners of sea country in and around the reef. One of these invaluable partners may come as a surprise to some: premium cat food brand Dine. The partnership between conservationists and global fast-moving consumer goods company Mars (parent company of the Dine brand) is a considered part of the company’s CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) – and a push to lead by example. Ridley says there is an urgent need for these types of relationships. Groups such as Citizens have the environmental insight, expertise and networks, while big business can support action with funding and momentum. Over the past few years Mars has restored more than four hectares at Hope Reef in Indonesia. “For the global issue, governments and major corporations are the biggest players,” Ridley says. “Because we’ve left things so late, there is an urgent need to massively scale up conservation efforts.” “You’re going to need to work with partners who can achieve scale,” he says. “It’s collaborative. You can’t do it on your own. It’s very practical.” Citizens’ work isn’t simply about protecting the Great Barrier Reef as it currently exists – action must be taken to restore it. Coral reefs and their marine ecosystems provide many benefits, at sea and on land. They protect coastlines from erosion and storms, feed and house diverse marine life, and support local tourism. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more than half a billion people worldwide rely on coral reefs for food, income and protection. In a healthy reef, the solid foundation is made up of coral skeletons and sometimes with loose coral rubble around. But when the reef is damaged, these areas of debris become more widespread, replacing more stable formations where coral can grow. Stabilising rubble is part of the recovery effort that may bring coral back to the reef. Alicia McArdle is Mars’s marine program manager, and part of the team working on stabilisation. It’s being done through technology called “reef stars”: hexagonal sand-coated steel structures that provide a stable base on which coral fragments can grow. As part of Dine’s Hope Grows program, reef stars are being installed at three sites across the Great Barrier Reef, where they will give coral, fish, plants and other marine life the chance to return. “Reef stars” are hexagonal sand-coated steel structures that provide a stable base on which coral fragments can grow. Alicia McArdle, Mars’s marine program manager, holding a “reef star”. “We need to stand up and start making a difference,” McArdle says. “Mars has a longstanding commitment to work with local communities, to try to work through complex problems and sustain the livelihoods of people within those supply chains. It’s nice to be part of an organisation that is committed to putting money into this, to actually try and make a difference.” Mars reports it has invested more than US$10m (AUD$15m) to support coral reef restoration. Their commitment is not a new endeavour, Mars has been working on reefs since 2006. Restoring reefs can only do so much with coral bleaching, caused by global heating. “We’re past the idea of waiting for governments to do the right thing,” McArdle says. “We have to take the initiative to put these things into our own hands and actually make positive change, otherwise we’re not going to see it. It’s about stepping up and taking action.” As part of Dine’s Hope Grows program, reef stars are being installed at three sites across the Great Barrier Reef, where they will give coral, fish, plants and other marine life the chance to return. In June, the reef cooperative returned to the Great Barrier Reef to monitor progress and see how much life has grown on the reef stars. And while this is an exciting project in itself, Ridley feels most hopeful about its potential to inspire even more action. “It’s not just the reef stars,” he says “You end up having other projects, being able to use the same infrastructure. You have groups of other talented people coming in to help and being involved. You engage more tourism operators, more scientists, more conservationists. It’s a catalyst to even bigger efforts.” Find out more about Dine’s sustainability pledges.",,Dine: Hope Grows

Smokers stub out nearly 800,000 metric tonnes of cigarettes every year, enough butts to cover New York’s Central Park. They are in every country on the planet, from city streets to rubbish tips, rivers and beaches. Cigarettes contain single-use plastics because they are engineered and manufactured that way. Butts take a decade to degrade, releasing more than 7,000 toxic chemicals into the environment. Wildlife is also at risk: researchers found partly-digested cigarette butts in 70% of seabirds and 30% of sea turtles sampled for one study. If cigarettes were treated appropriately as single-use plastics, they could theoretically be banned. It’s not just cigarettes leaving a plastic trail. In South Asia, smokeless and chewing forms of tobacco such as gutka and khaini are sold in plastic pouches, millions of which litter the environment. Vaping, electronic tobacco and nicotine products are creating a new wave of pollution, from the mining of materials for batteries to metal and plastic waste leaching into soil and water. In a report last year, the US Environmental Protection Agency highlighted how lithium ion batteries are entering municipal waste systems as consumers incorrectly dispose of electronic tobacco and nicotine products in the household bin, because they’re branded “disposable”. The problem is global. Despite pledges from tobacco companies that they will eventually stop selling cigarettes, 6tn are produced every year. And manufacturing, sales and waste from electronic tobacco and nicotine products are increasing globally as tobacco giants seek to replace lost revenue as smokers quit or die. The industry uses a range of corporate social responsibility initiatives to paint itself green. Clean-ups, anti-littering campaigns and other gestures distract the public. Partnerships with environmental institutes and ministries on reforestation and forest preservation projects mask how growing tobacco crops lead to deforestation and desertification in countries like Brazil and Tanzania. In Mali and Senegal in west Africa, the industry-led Project Waterfall sought to improve access to water. A similar initiative in Burkina Faso aims to provide drinking water, even though the country’s laws prohibit tobacco-sponsored initiatives. The last time the government evaluated tobacco use among the population was 2013, when almost one quarter of all men were smokers. In the US, around a fifth of adults smoke, while slightly less than a fifth of adolescents use e-cigarettes. The tobacco industry has funded conservation organisations that include Keep America Beautiful, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Center for Watershed Protection. In the Philippines, where more than 40% of men smoke, the tobacco industry has partnered with government agencies on environmental projects, including a river clean-up and an anti-littering campaign. If countries have ratified the WHO framework on tobacco control (a global health treaty) – and most have – this type of partnership is in violation. The treaty obliges government not to interact with tobacco companies other than when strictly necessary. This, of course, doesn’t stop tobacco companies from wooing policymakers. There are two main goals of public relations activities for tobacco companies. The first is that, from a regulatory perspective, they need to be able to manufacture, sell and profit from products that damage the environment. If electronic cigarettes were regulated out of the hands of children, it would not only protect them from addiction, but also protect the environment. The second is to portray themselves as sustainable to investors. British American Tobacco has featured on Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 20 years now and Philip Morris on the Climate Disclosure Project’s A List. An industry that creates nearly 800,000 metric tonnes of toxic waste a year from cigarette butts sits oddly with environmental sustainability. There’s no escaping the reality: tobacco waste continues to accumulate because these addictive products are not environmentally friendly but are designed to hook new customers and perpetuate consumption. This could change. A UN plastics treaty is on the table, offering a global mechanism to tackle the lifecycle of plastics. Many authorities around the world – including India, Rwanda and the US state of California – have put in place or are considering policies to ban single-use plastics. These policies should include the plastic waste coming from tobacco and nicotine products, including electronic products. Governments should also require the tobacco industry to clean up the waste that results from its products and pay for the environmental damage. And they can implement the WHO treaty, which has provisions to help governments protect themselves from being the targets of industry-sponsored PR campaigns. Governments, investors and the global community should refuse to accept the tobacco industry’s greenwashing sleight of hand. Despite sustainability claims, its new portfolio of products could end up further polluting in terms of energy consumption, materials and waste. Tobacco is killing us and the planet.

2021-11-23T18:01:23Z,Asda appoints former M&S boss Stuart Rose as new chairman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/23/asda-appoints-former-marks-and-spencer-boss-stuart-rose-as-new-chairman,"Asda has appointed Stuart Rose, the Conservative peer and former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, as its first dedicated chairman in more than 20 years. Lord Rose, who helped fight off a 2004 bid from former BHS and Topshop owner Sir Philip Green in his time at M&amp;S, is a retail veteran who has had stints at the boss of Iceland, Argos and former Topshop and Miss Selfridge group Arcadia, which he sold to Green in 2002. He was chair of the online grocer Ocado until May this year. His appointment comes nine months after the completion of the £6.8bn acquisition of Asda by private equity firm TDR Capital and Blackburn-based billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa who now co-own the UK’s third largest supermarket with US retail group Walmart. Rose will be Asda’s first dedicated chairman since the departure of Archie Norman who sold the supermarket to Walmart in 1999. Norman is now chair of Marks &amp; Spencer. Rose was knighted in 2008 for services to the retail industry and corporate social responsibility and was given a life peerage in 2014. He is already chair of EG Group, the petrol forecourts business which is also owned by TDR and the Issa brothers. The peer said: “I am joining the board at a hugely exciting time, as Asda builds on the incredible resilience it has demonstrated during the pandemic and embarks on the next chapter of its evolution and growth under new ownership.” He said the priority was to appoint a new chief executive for Asda, after the exit of Roger Burnley in the summer, and he was excited at the prospect of working with the Issa brothers to build on Asda’s heritage of food, fashion and general merchandise. Dame Alison Carnwath, the former chair of property group Land Securities and another EG board member has been made a non-executive director of Asda. She is a trained accountant who spent time in corporate finance for Lloyds and J Henry Schroder Wagg in New York. Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they planned to appoint further non-executive directors. “We are pleased to have Lord Rose and Dame Alison join the board of Asda. They have already provided invaluable support and wisdom to the board of EG Group, and we know their insight and experience will add huge value at Asda too. We are committed to ensuring this iconic business has the right governance and management framework in place to set it up for long-term success.”",Asda; Stuart Rose; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Marks & Spencer; Business; Ocado; UK news; Corporate governance,Business
2022-03-11T22:00:42Z,Chelsea are in crisis but there is no will to leave club on their knees | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/chelsea-in-crisis-but-there-is-no-will-to-leave-club-on-their-knees-roman-abramovich,"Everybody knew the sanctions were coming; they had been inevitable, according to UK government sources. Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, was in their crosshairs because of his links to Vladimir Putin, which had moved beyond the pale after Russia’s senseless invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich himself knew they were coming. Hence his decision to try to sell his UK assets, including Chelsea. But when they did arrive at 9am on Thursday, they were still able to blindside the Chelsea hierarchy. On Wednesday, they had certainly not anticipated the imposition of them the following morning. The club entered a state of shock. So many questions, so few answers. Some of the players were concerned about what the future held for them – given that one of the measures involved Chelsea not being able to operate in the transfer market or offer new contracts. Ditto many members of staff. What did it all mean? As the day progressed, the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, sent an email to the clubs. It was still early, nothing felt concrete, but there was a business-as-usual tone to his note. Masters reassured everybody that Chelsea would complete their remaining fixtures of the season. The integrity of the competition would not be compromised and it was a theme picked up by Thomas Tuchel. “As long as we have enough shirts and as long as the bus is full of fuel we will arrive and we will be competitive,” the Chelsea manager said. The players have been told to concentrate on what they can influence, which they did on Thursday night with the 3-1 win at Norwich, keeping them third. Next is the visit of Newcastle to Stamford Bridge on Sunday which, it is fair to say, will be flavoured by ownership issues. But what kind of Chelsea will emerge from the sanctions which have set them on a path to ruin? The first thing to say is that the world and European champions, who have won 21 trophies since Abramovich’s takeover in 2003 – more than any other English club during the period – will surely not be put out of business, however hard the financial restrictions that have been brought against them appear. There is still time to find a buyer and for them to stabilise the operation, especially if the deal were done by 31 May – when the club’s special licence to carry on is due to expire. There remain plenty of interested parties, who can only see Chelsea’s price dropping as sponsors pull out or consider their associations; as revenue streams are hit. Moreover, the government, which is effectively in charge of the sale – given the sanctions against Abramovich would not allow him to profit from it – have an interest in the transaction going through. They want Abramovich out for obvious reasons, including the optics, and they do not want to send Chelsea to the wall as they consider the club to be of cultural significance to the country. If Abramovich were to remain as the owner into next season, with sanctions biting ever deeper, that could happen. Could Abramovich dig in and take the ship down with him? Given everything we know about him and his love for Chelsea, his desire to hand over to responsible owners, it feels unlikely. And, in any case, the government have reserved the right to requisition the club, as a last resort, and sell it themselves. They have given Abramovich no room for manoeuvre, forcing him away, and, if there is financial pain for the club, it is at a level they believe they will get through. On a related point, as Chelsea potentially encounter difficulties in satisfying the league’s profit and sustainability rules, there does not seem to be a desire among the other clubs for them to be driven under. They recognise that a strong Chelsea is important for the collective brand. The league, meanwhile, is always loth to create a mess with points deductions, for example. Again, it is not good for the competition. If Chelsea were to fall foul of profit and sustainability, they would be expected to cite unforeseen circumstances, much as some clubs have claimed Covid writedowns: their books would have been sound but for the pandemic. Chelsea continue to try to process the sanctions and argue against some of them. Many areas of the business stand to be affected, with the government wanting to ensure that any revenue generated by the club cannot find its way back to the Putin regime. A part of the nervousness at Chelsea involves whether any more sponsors will follow the telecommunications and internet service provider Three in withdrawing support, at least temporarily. There are normally anti-embarrassment clauses in such arrangements and, from a corporate social responsibility point of view, the upside of standing by a tarnished individual is often outweighed by the downside. The Three deal is worth £40m a year, although it is unclear how much more, if anything, was due to Chelsea before the end of the season. The kit contract with Nike is the big one – it is worth £60m a year. The ticketing and merchandising sanctions should not hit too hard, as the end of the season looms, but there could be larger holes with the final portion of the broadcast deal and the prize money from the Premier League and Uefa to be frozen. If Chelsea were to finish third in the league, it would be worth about £34m. Then there are the sums that Abramovich would be permitted to invest within the parameters of the profit and sustainability rules – £105m over a rolling three-year period. That, plainly, has stopped and so, to repeat, it is imperative that the transfer of ownership happens with a degree of speed. What is clear is that Chelsea will live a different reality without Abramovich and there is a strong chance that it will not be as exciting. In football terms, he was the ideal owner: no money constraints; an individual motivated purely by aggrandisement, to succeed year after year. Abramovich’s day of reckoning has come. Chelsea have the memories and the conflicting emotions.",Chelsea; Roman Abramovich; Premier League; Football; Sport,Football
2023-04-22T12:00:09Z,Meet the Gen Z brand whisperers: ‘I come in and I’m like: don’t make some weird old-ass campaign!’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/22/meet-the-gen-z-brand-whisperers-weird-old-ass-campaign,"Just after April Fools’ Day in 2017, Pepsi debuted a short film that seemed to many like a bad joke. In the two-and-a-half-minute Live for Now advert, Kendall Jenner joined a protest against nothing in particular; the model marched with a laughing crowd who were waving signs bearing vague slogans like “Join the conversation”. At the climax, Jenner approached a stern police officer with a can of Pepsi, and a photographer captured the moment when she, apparently, achieved world peace. The advert was pulled a day after its release. Viewers accused Pepsi of trivialising Black Lives Matter and minimising police brutality; Martin Luther King’s youngest child, Bernice King, tweeted, “If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi.” The company issued an immediate apology: “Clearly we missed the mark … We did not intend to make light of any serious issue.” Multiple people would have signed off on the scripting, production, filming and release of this advert – and it seems that no one, at any point , thought it was a bad idea. Luckily, five years on, there’s now an easy way for companies to avoid making this kind of internet-breaking faux pas: grab yourself a Z-level executive. If the C-level are an organisation’s highest-ranking members – the chief executive officer (CEO), chief operating officer (COO) and chief financial officer (CFO), for example – the Z-level are their generation Z counterparts: young but not necessarily junior employees who advise companies on how to sell to their generation. Gen Z, those born from the mid-90s to the early 2010s, are touted as a demographic cohort unlike any other: experts have found them to be the most diverse, well educated and confrontational yet. Businesses are nervous about employing young people who are online and outspoken (in 2019, Forbes ran a piece entitled “Gen Z At Work – 8 Reasons to Be Afraid”), and heritage brands are unsure about how to market to them. That’s where the Z-level come in. Last June, New York PR agency Berns Communications Group established the Z Suite, a group of 35 students and influencers who provide brands with insights about Gen Z. In return, they are offered enviable networking opportunities, as well as hotels and transport (as of yet, they’re not paid for their time). At the same time, the largest PR company in the world, Edelman, set up its Gen Z Lab with a similar objective, wrangling 250 Gen Z employees and hiring 26-year-old British-American fashion designer Harris Reed as “ZEO” (it’s pronounced, in the US way, with a “zee”). Edelman has clients such as Dove, Unilever, Samsung and Shell, while Berns Communications works with Alibaba, Klarna and American Eagle among others. In April 2022, 21-year-old Z Suite member Clay Lute logged on to his computer and addressed 14 chief executives and 24 high-level executives from some of the world’s biggest fashion brands. Though he has yet to graduate from the New York fashion business school LIM College, Lute was faced with vice-presidents and board members decades his senior, all eager to hear what he had to say. Stephen Sadove – former chief executive of Saks and the call’s moderator – had asked Lute to give Gen Z’s perspective on sustainability. Lute discussed water pollution and mushroom leather (a vegan product that can be used to make shoes, bags and coats). He explained that even though he “didn’t come from a lot of money”, he was prepared to pay more for ethical products. He began writing about fashion as a teen and has worked as a stylist, influencer and merchandising intern for brands such as J Crew, Calvin Klein and Todd Snyder. It is difficult to believe he’s just 21 – he radiates the authority of a seasoned speaker twice his age. “I was sweating behind the Zoom camera,” Lute confesses. “People at that level being interested in what I had to say was fantastic.” The Z Suite and the Gen Z Lab offer advice on diversity, identity, inclusivity, social justice and climate change. The Z Suite operates like a thinktank, with discussions surveys and panels, while the Gen Z Lab directly helps brands with both advertising and corporate activism. As the purchasing power of “zoomers” grows – at the end of 2021, Bloomberg found they had $360bn (£290bn) in disposable income – companies are keen to cater to them. Gen Z advisers such as Lute also encourage brands to change their practices behind the scenes. “What I’m here to explain to them is that Gen Z as a consumer will abandon you if you’re not ethical,” he says. A 2021 survey by market research group Forrester found that 51% of Gen Z consumers in the US will do research into companies to ensure they “align with their position on corporate social responsibility” before making a purchase. Lute is passionate about supply chains, factory conditions, sustainability and diversity – he’s also worried about barriers that prevent women of colour from entering the fashion industry, such as childcare access. “Gen Z is often dubbed the woke generation or the generation that cares too much,” he says. “But we are the first generation to grow up in a fully digitised world. Since we had a phone, we were able to experience the perspectives of everyone around the globe.” Lute vividly recalls reading about the Rana Plaza disaster as a preteen; in 2013, the garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, collapsed, killing 1,134 people. “We’ve been forced to care,” Lute says, “because we’ve seen the suffering of an entire universe.” *** Harris Reed says he is part of the generation that is “really pivoting towards change”. If businesses don’t take notice, he says, they’ll fail. “Friends of mine will only purchase from companies where they know what their money is going towards,” he says. “Once your older clientele dies off, not to be rude, but who’s buying your product?” Reed is the world’s only ZEO. It’s a cute pun – in practice, the 26-year-old is the “cultural and creative adviser” for Edelman’s Gen Z Lab. He is also an “entrepreneur”, although he uses the word self-mockingly, putting his hands on his hips and jutting out his chin. At 15, Reed met publicist Kelly Cutrone at a book signing, and his father – Oscar-winning documentary producer Nicholas Reed – encouraged him to work with her. “I kind of lied about my age and told her that I was about to turn 18,” Reed laughs. Cutrone immersed him in the fashion world, and today he designs for his own company. He has dressed Harry Styles and had his work exhibited in the V&amp;A. Last September, he was appointed creative director for French fashion house Nina Ricci. Why did he add ZEO to his already frighteningly long CV? “A lot of the clients that Edelman has are people I would really love to challenge,” he says, his long auburn hair set against a black shirt, rings adorning every finger (the index and middle fingers of his left hand sport a chunky silver H and a chunky silver R). “My passion is to see how we can explore not only Gen Z and how they are communicated to, but how we can look at fluidity in so many different ways.” Reed is gender-fluid, uses he/him pronouns and came out as gay at nine. “I was in Arizona at the time and was constantly bullied and ridiculed. There wasn’t one day when I didn’t cry and eat my lunch in the bathroom stall as a little beat-up gay kid,” he says. Then, with a facetious eye roll and tongue-click, he jokes: “Throwback!” His generation, he says, demand that companies do more than “stick a queer person on a billboard” – they need to see organisations “actually giving back” to LGBTQ+ charities who support young queer and trans people. When we speak, Reed has been Edelman’s ZEO for a few months. He’s already pitched “controversial” projects to clients via the lab. “I come in and I’m loud and I’m crazy and I have my red hair and I’m floating all over the place and I’m like, ‘Use these photographers! Use these people! This is how we should communicate! Don’t make some weird old-ass campaign!’” He’s been giving “major companies” advice on how to explore gender fluidity. “I’ve been able to give feedback where I say: you’re not going to have a customer in 10 years if you keep your packaging super male with this font and really dark grey, and then your feminine one super girly and swirly and cute,” Reed says. One client he’s working with is “very open-minded” about exploring sexuality and even “visually exploring some topical issues that are going on in the United States about abortion” (for client confidentially reasons, he can’t go into the specifics). Reed wants the companies he works with to improve conditions for queer employees, so everyone can feel comfortable at work. It all sounds good on paper – which is perhaps the whole point. How does Reed handle the fact that businesses might do the right things for the wrong reasons? Does it matter that brands only want to improve the world if they can also improve their quarterly reports? “Whether a company wants to be sustainable or open for the right reasons doesn’t matter,” he says. “They have to step up or they’re not going to succeed.” In a December 2021 survey of almost 10,000 Gen Zs, Edelman found one in three wanted brands to take responsibility for wrongdoing; 90% wanted the brands they buy from “to get involved in causes that better the world”. Reed says ad campaigns will only land with Gen Z if brands do things properly: “I always tell people, ‘If you want to do something queer, pay a queer person a consultancy fee and it will be well received, because it will be authentic.’” So far, Reed has been pleased by the response from older generations. “I’ve met a couple of people who I was quite surprised were actually very passionate about this change,” he says. “Whether that passion comes from a little bit of fear, whether that passion comes from excitement, I can’t tell you.” *** After 3pm BST is the optimal time for the Gen Z Lab to meet via video – it has members from Dubai, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, France, Canada and the US, among others, so time differences have to be taken into account. On an overcast (at least, in London) Tuesday afternoon, 18 members of the lab meet three of Edelman’s senior staff to brainstorm ideas for a client. They sit in squares on the screen like an ensemble cast. There’s Jasmine Jordan in Chicago, a self-described “influencer whisperer”. There’s Judith Lleixà in Madrid, her hair tied back and her eyes scrutinising behind wire glasses. There’s Giselle Huasipoma, speaking unafraid and unfiltered from her bedroom, a rail of jackets and handbags behind her. “We have an opportunity from a global tech client who is interested in fashion and sustainability,” begins Kary Laskin, Edelman senior vice-president (while Reed often leads the lab, his schedule means he does not participate in every session). “They are interested in understanding fast fashion and how Gen Z evaluates that.” The client – I’m not told the name for confidentiality reasons – will shortly be working on a global multimarket campaign and the Gen Z Lab can “directly inform” how it is executed. Courtney Miller, Edelman executive vice-president, asks the Lab how they know if their fashion choices are sustainable; what cues they look for. Jordan, the first person to speak, says she checks labels to see if the material can be recycled and researches companies to see if they have sustainable practices. The second speaker, Lleixà, says she doesn’t have time to Google every time she wants to shop. She prefers to buy secondhand – that way she is doing the recycling and therefore consuming more “responsibly”. This doesn’t feel like something big brands would like hearing – that Gen Z would rather buy old clothes from a charity shop than invest in shiny new stuff. But evidently, knowledge is power. As of last summer, leading brands from COS to Gucci were selling secondhand products through their own resale programmes. If you can’t beat ’em, sell to ’em again. Next to speak is Huasipoma, an influencer marketing coordinator at Edelman’s offices in New York. She says she used to read labels but became disillusioned after realising “cruelty free” and “recyclable” claims were not always what they seemed. “I feel like I’ve been let down, and can’t really trust any brand,” she says. She feels some initiatives are just “a setup” – she used to work in retail and saw first-hand how hype about natural dyes contrasted with all the plastic packaging in the supply chain. This is corporate greenwashing – when companies make themselves look eco-friendly to the public but continue to tear up our planet behind the scenes. “I want to see inside a brand without having to work at the brand,” Huasipoma says when we catch up after the Gen Z Lab session. “I want to see step by step: where is this coming from and how does it land on my body? I want to see the whole process and make sure I feel morally correct when I’m wearing something.” But Gen Z won’t just call you out for dumping waste in the ocean or paying slave wages – Huasipoma says they’ll also laugh in your face for the crime of being cringe. “We will make fun of you, we kind of don’t care,” she says. “The most important thing for clients to understand is not being cringy.” Trying to cater to Gen Z by “being late to trends and things like that” can be disastrous. Pepsi aren’t the only brand to make a misstep: in 2020, Domino’s Australia dropped a “free pizza for Karen” campaign meant to capitalise on the slang term for angry and entitled middle-aged women (people complained that the company should find a more worthwhile cause and not reward already privileged people). Later that year, fashion retailer Gap was mocked when it marked the US presidential election by tweeting a picture of a half-blue, half-red (ie, half Democrat, half Republican) hoodie. *** Maya Penn was born in 2000. By 2008, she had founded her own sustainable fashion company. Maya’s Ideas began when she started making clothes from vintage fabrics lying around the house and, impressed, her parents encouraged her to sell them online. Penn coded her first website at 10 and personally answered emails from customers. She did her first Ted Talk at 12. Barack Obama commended her for “outstanding achievement in environmental stewardship”. It feels like she should be retiring, but she’s only 22. “I think that young people have more tools to express themselves and also to explore non-traditional career paths than they did before,” Penn says. She is a Z Suite speaker, and took part in a daylong forum in New York, which included talks on trends, sustainability and ethics, and a CEO-ZEO dinner. “When I started working in retail and fashion, the industry dictated what consumers wanted,” says Stacy Berns, the 56-year-old founder of the Z Suite. “Now, through technology, consumers dictate everything. And it changes quickly, so it’s even more important to connect Gen Z influencers and business voices.” Berns has seen 80-year-olds clamouring to chat with 20-year-olds, but don’t people like Penn feel their elders are passing the buck? “I’m someone who always calls for more intergenerational collaboration, because that is the way we’re going to see real change,” she says. When she consults for Fortune 500 companies, she impresses upon them that they have the power to change the world. “It’s important for them to really understand the urgency,” she says. “My generation are going to have to live with the consequences of what these companies are doing.” Ziad Ahmed runs his own Gen Z-led marketing agency, JUV Consulting, in New York. It won’t surprise you to hear that he set it up at 16. “I had no idea what I was doing in so many ways,” says Ahmed, 23. Clients didn’t necessarily get it either – back then, people referred to him as a millennial. But over the past few years, Gen Z has “made adults reckon with the power of our generation … We’ve seen young people mobilise against gun violence, against police brutality, against systemic injustice and racism, against climate injustice.” Ahmed says the more headlines that zoomers generate, the more clients clamour to understand them. At the start of the pandemic, JUV worked with JanSport on an “Unpack That Challenge”, which encouraged people to empty their backpacks and stay home to contain the virus. As part of the campaign, 10,000 backpacks were donated to poverty non-profit World Central Kitchen, which filled them with food and gave them to students in need. “We are so unapologetically a political company, it’s embedded into everything we do,” Ahmed says. But why bother with brand consulting? Why isn’t Ahmed just running an activist group? “I never expected to be in marketing,” he says. “But it has often been marketers who are first to say: ‘Please teach me, I need to understand culture, I need to understand Gen Z.’” He also works with “political change-makers” and non-profit leaders, and runs awareness campaigns. Not everyone is convinced by the marriage of marketing and activism. Alex Myers, the chief executive of communications group Manifest, called Harris Reed’s ZEO appointment “cringeworthy” and “a coal-fired smokescreen that’s fooling nobody” in a Medium blog. He noted the “nepotiZm” of 27-year-old Amanda Edelman’s appointment as the Lab’s Gen Z operating officer (or ZOO); Amanda is the daughter of the firm’s CEO, Richard Edelman. Myers also pointed out that Edelman works with the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association. Labs and suites created by PR agencies are not the only way executives are interacting with zoomers – things are also happening more quietly, behind the scenes. Reverse mentoring – where a junior employee educates a senior one – is increasingly popular. “I was really nervous in the beginning,” says 26-year-old Ammarah Dhorat, a team leader at credit management company Lowell, who reverse mentors its chief executive, Colin Storrar. Dhorat and Storrar have spoken about politics, social media and the cost of living crisis, and she’s suggested how internal communications could be improved. She’s even told him about her upbringing as a young Muslim, down to the curfews she had as a kid. “He knew certain stuff about my religion, but my journey, my upbringing, he found really interesting because if you were to compare it to how he probably parents his children, it’s quite different.” Storrar was surprised, for example, that Dhorat’s parents didn’t allow her to go to university, and was impressed by her subsequent career success. “I’m probably one of the first in my household to buy a house, go into property investment, and one of the first women in the family to break stereotypes, and he found that really informative and educational,” she says. After sharing all that, Dhorat is no longer nervous going head-to-head with the chief executive: “Now it’s like speaking to my neighbour.” Gen Z-ers who give advice to their elders seem remarkably confident, eloquent and far, far older than their years. But sometimes confidence can mask real fear. “I am scared when I tell a CEO they are wrong,” Ahmed says. “I would say I’m scared all the time.” It remains to be seen whether labs and suites will produce any meaningful change, or merely help companies better mask poor practices. Perhaps that is something else to fear. “I am scared that we care so much, and we advocate so loud, but that the world will not change in a way that it needs to,” Ahmed says. Reed isn’t so scared. Between June 2022 and Easter 2023, the Gen Z lab worked with 50 clients, contributing $14m to Edelman’s revenue. The lab has run events in Lisbon, Chicago and Hong Kong, and clients have invited “challenging” conversations. Reed says companies are more comfortable than ever “with being brave and being accountable.” While millennials have been characterised as suffering from burnout and impostor syndrome, Reed thinks his cohort are loud enough and confident enough to continue to provoke real change. “Because there are all these platforms now like Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, it’s no longer this polished system.

2021-09-02T12:19:45Z,Home Office spent almost £9m on deportation charter flights in 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/02/home-office-spent-almost-9m-on-deportation-charter-flights-in-2020,"The Home Office spent almost £9m on deportation charter flights last year, the Guardian has learned, including more than £500,000 for planes that never left the tarmac. At least 828 people were removed by air, more than double the 410 removed on similar charters in 2019. The department spent £8.2m on 47 charters to 24 countries in 2020, with 18 of those countries in Europe. The Home Office no longer provides specific figures when there are fewer than 10 people on a flight. Eleven of the flights had fewer than 10 people on board, meaning the exact number is unclear. Ministers also paid £575,748 for five flights that never took off – two to Spain, two to Pakistan and one to Somalia. Officials say that they paid less than the usual cancellation costs on these flights as some flights could be rebooked or rescheduled. Some of the flights to European destinations had people with criminal convictions on board, along with “third country” removals. These were mainly asylum seekers who arrived across the Channel in small boats and whom the Home Office sent back to European countries they had passed through en route to the UK. This arrangement ended post-Brexit and so far the Home Office has not secured any new agreements with European countries to return small boat arrivals there. The information, disclosed to the Guardian in a freedom of information response from the Home Office, said no children were removed on any of these charter flights. Officials say that the costs incurred on these charter flights included the cost of chartering suitable aircraft, onboard catering, use of departure airports’ facilities and policing. Not everyone the Home Office deports is removed on a charter flight, some are taken on scheduled flights. Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said: “These lavishly expensive flights make a mockery of good governance and value for money. But even worse than the economic waste, is the harm and pain they’ve funded. Semi-naked, self-harming refugees have been exported to face destitution across Europe and black British families unable to pay legal fees have been ripped apart by these flights. “At present, our deportation and removals system is unsafe &amp; unjust and any airline which believes in corporate social responsibility should refuse to operate it.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We make no apology whatsoever for seeking to remove those who abuse our hospitality and have successfully deported 7,985 foreign national offenders since January 2019. Charter flight operations are an important means to return disruptive individuals or where they are limited scheduled routes, particularly during the global coronavirus pandemic. “Unfortunately, late legal claims – which are often unfounded or without merit – can result in people being removed from flights at the last minute. Our new plan for immigration will stop the abuse of the system and expedite the removal of those who have no right to be here.”",Immigration and asylum; UK news,UK news
2022-03-16T09:00:26Z,Legal eagles: how climate litigation is shaping ambitious cases for nature,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/climate-litigation-lisbon-wetlands-aoe,"The Tagus estuary near Lisbon is Portugal’s largest wetland, a vital habitat and stopover for tens of thousands of migratory birds, including flamingos, black-tailed godwits and glossy ibis. It has also been earmarked as the site of a new airport, leading the environmental law charity ClientEarth and a group of Portuguese NGOs to sue Portugal’s government. When they get their day in court, they will argue that the authorities failed to properly consider how the project would affect an internationally protected nature reserve, and the knock-on effects on other countries visited by the birds. “If you destroy that site, you have an impact not only in Lisbon, but on all the sites up the flyway,” says Anna Heslop, head of wildlife and habitats at ClientEarth. “If the bird populations don’t arrive, they never get breeding.” While environmental lawsuits are not a new phenomenon – the earliest known case, a dispute over water resources, dates back 4,500 years – campaigners are thinking more deeply about how they can tackle the complex problem of modern biodiversity loss. Heslop says litigants are increasingly looking beyond a single site or narrow issue. “Those older school cases will continue. What we aim to do is to have a bigger impact across the whole, like every site in Europe or south-east Asia, or to push governments to be more ambitious. The trick for us is finding cases that will have a more strategic impact; I don’t think that was happening on the same scale before.” The lack of a strategic approach to date is partly a reflection of a wider misunderstanding of the scale of the global biodiversity crisis, says Heslop. “Climate change advocates have done a great job over the last 10, 20 years, of making people realise this is a massive issue and therefore they get more of the resources,” says Heslop. “But they’re twin and equal crises and if you fix climate change and not biodiversity, we’re all screwed.” Guillaume Futhazar, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, is part of a team that has been studying biodiversity litigation around the world and is publishing a book on their findings. They knew it was an important issue, but it was not getting the same attention as the growing wave of lawsuits on the climate crisis. Futhazar notes that laws governing different facets of biodiversity, such as endangered species, clean water or land use, are well established in many countries. But he says a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics, the increasingly central role of science in lawsuits and greater judicial awareness of the systemic nature of the problem are helping lawyers choose and structure their cases more carefully. Founded in 1971, the US NGO Earthjustice is no stranger to bringing environmental lawsuits in defence of wildlife and habitats. But, last summer, it launched a new initiative “laser-focused” on using the law to address major drivers of the biodiversity crisis. Timothy Preso, managing attorney of the organisation’s new biodiversity defense program, says it wants to partner with groups whose voices have been ignored in environmental litigation, such as indigenous and frontline communities, as well as raise awareness of critical biodiversity problems. The first case brought under the project was on behalf of the Ojibwe tribes of Wisconsin, challenging the state’s wolf hunting plans on the grounds that they conflict with treaties negotiated in the 19th century. “It raises really critical questions about wildlife management from the perspective of peoples who have been stewards of the environment in Wisconsin for about 15,000 years,” says Preso. “It’s a different approach to those issues.” Biodiversity campaigners are also learning from the success of climate litigation, which, Futhazar says, has “initiated a new creative way of thinking about how to deal with the environment”. Zaneta Sedilekova, a lawyer at Clyde &amp; Co, thinks biodiversity litigation will go through a similar arc to its climate counterpart, with campaigners targeting countries first and then companies. She sees pollination as being at the forefront of such cases because of its importance to food security, “an issue that Covid has really highlighted”. In 2019, Costa Rica’s supreme court ordered the country’s agriculture ministry to undertake a scientific study into the ecosystem impacts of neonicotinoids, while legal action has more recently been threatened against the French government for failing to implement strong regulations to curb the use of bee-harming pesticides. Just as the fossil fuel industry is now in the direct sight of climate litigants, biodiversity campaigners are targeting the private sector too. Last year, indigenous peoples from the Brazilian and Colombian Amazon and NGOs filed a lawsuit against French supermarket chain Groupe Casino for allegedly selling beef products linked to deforestation. Casino argued it took a “rigorous” approach to its supply chains. Heslop sees more corporate liability cases related to biodiversity on the horizon. “The traditional way of telling companies that they were doing the wrong thing environmentally was to convince them that they needed to have some corporate social responsibility,” she says. “But the approach we’ve now taken is to say, well actually you have a duty to your investors and they will be let down if you do this because you’ll end up with a stranded asset or you’ll be sued. We’ve made that narrative for climate and we’re currently looking at how those sorts of cases could be applied for biodiversity.” Just as attribution science is enabling climate campaigners to link the emission of greenhouse gases with the harms caused by subsequent global warming, Sedilekova says growing requirements for corporations to be transparent about their supply chains and to exercise due diligence will help draw a line between a product and biodiversity loss, and hold companies accountable. She adds that the “corporate veil” that has historically shielded parent companies from action against their subsidiaries is increasingly being lifted. “The more supply chain data we have, the easier it will be to trace that ecosystem damage to a jurisdiction which has fast and efficient judicial service or judicial provision which is not corrupted, and where the defendant has a lot of money.” Sedilekova admits it is still hard to persuade businesses that biodiversity litigation is a real risk, but argues that it could be a powerful tool to change corporate behaviour. “The importance of litigation is to not turn one ship around, but to set a precedent so that others don’t wait for it to happen to them.” In the Tagus estuary case, ClientEarth argues the project breaches EU law and could have catastrophic effects on the migratory birds. Heslop hopes the case will have a wider impact and could set a precedent for the protection of other species in the world. “Not just birds, but maybe dolphins or whales or others. That’s where what feels like a very local issue actually could have a huge impact if we’re successful,” she says.

He helped to pioneer work that set the tone for the way in which multinational businesses funded efforts to combat Aids. At Levi’s from 1988 to 2004, he expanded the company’s grant funding programme to support early projects to beat Aids and to promote education about Aids/HIV, particularly in southern Africa. Among the initiatives he supported was the Positive Lives project, a photographic portrayal of people affected by Aids that became a global phenomenon and was seen by millions. While at Levi’s he also founded, with the former European commissioner Étienne Davignon, a business network on corporate social responsibility called CSR Europe. Alan was born in St Andrews, Fife, to Alexander, a miner and trade unionist, and his wife, Jane (nee Barclay), who worked in a paper mill. After Kirkcaldy high school he went to Heriot Watt University, where his degree was in town planning but his education was in student politics. In 1977 he was elected Scottish president of the National Union of Students, and for two years from 1978-80 was deputy president of the NUS UK during the presidency of Trevor Phillips. From 1980 until 1983 he was secretary general of the British Youth Council, based in London, then moved to Brussels as secretary general of the Council of European National Youth Committees. There he met my sister, Moya Campbell, who in 2000 became his life partner and in 2008 his wife. In 1988, still in Brussels, he took up the job as director of community affairs at Levi’s and through that work in 1993 met Nelson Mandela, one of the proudest moments of his life. In 2006 he returned to the UK to become a director first at the Commission for Racial Equality and then at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, helping to shape the 2010 Equalities Act and working with businesses to promote human rights. He retired in 2015 and afterwards retained his trusteeship of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, and volunteered briefly as a prison monitor before developing a serious heart condition.

2021-12-10T14:28:59Z,This victory of Starbucks employees in Buffalo will reverberate across America | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/10/this-victory-of-starbucks-employees-in-buffalo-will-reverberate-across-america,"Workers in one Starbucks store, in Buffalo, New York, made history on Thursday by becoming Starbuck’s first unionized workplace in the US. It’s a watershed for the biggest coffee seller in the world, which operates 8,953 stores in the United States — and which has done everything in its power to keep its workers from forming a union. The vote itself was tiny. There were 19 baristas and shift supervisors who voted in favor of unionizing, 8 voted against. But it marked a huge victory, nonetheless. Starbucks had waged a massive anti-union campaign in Buffalo — sending out-of-town managers and even executives into stores to discourage unionizing, closing down some stores, and packing remaining stores with new employees in order to dilute pro-union employees’ voting power. For years, Starbucks workers have complained about the company’s labor practices, claiming that chronic understaffing has created a chaotic work environment, unpredictable hours, and difficulty in taking sick days. Despite episodic commitments by Starbucks management to change, the complaints have continued. They intensified during the pandemic when overstretched Starbucks employees had to deal with new health risks and safety protocols. The union election marks one of the highest-profile union wins in memory for US restaurant workers, who are among the least unionized in the country and whose pay and benefits are among the lowest in all of corporate America. It’s certain to encourage more unionizing efforts among workers in restaurant chains. What occurred on Thursday at one Starbucks store is part of a much larger pattern — a surge in strikes and labor actions across America. Kellogg’s striking workers are still holding the line and refusing to allow the company to separate employees into tiers (with newer workers getting lower pay and benefits). Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama will get another chance to unionize (the National Labor Relations Board found that Amazon used unfair labor practices in the recent election there). And 3,000 student workers at Columbia University have been on strike for six weeks to demand better pay and health care (on Monday, at least 100 members of the Columbia faculty joined them on the picket line). What’s going on? Partly, low-wage workers have more bargaining leverage now than they’ve had in years. As the pandemic recedes (let’s hope it continues to), consumers are spending at a higher rate than they have in over twenty months. To respond to this surge in pent-up demand, employers are seeking workers. At the same time, workers across America are taking a fresh look at their jobs. Record-high “quit” rates and near record low rates of labor-participation suggest that a significant number are asking themselves if they want to go back to their old jobs — and are answering “no.” Part of the “no” is an unwillingness to settle for their former wages and working conditions — especially in big companies (like Starbucks, Amazon, and Kelloggs) whose profits have been sky-high. (Or even in richly-endowed universities like Columbia.) That “no” is also reverberating across America in the form of strikes. Many of these workers were on the front lines in the pandemic, and now feel it’s time for their efforts to be rewarded. At a deeper level, I suspect the pandemic itself has caused many people to reevaluate what they’re doing with their lives and to set different priorities for themselves. For years, many big corporations like Starbucks have sold themselves as “socially-responsible” — offering consumers the soothing reassurance that in buying their products they’re somehow advancing the common good. That was always bullshit. Corporations exist only to make money. Corporate social responsibility is a jejune form of public relations. Starbucks’s aggressively marketed “socially responsible” business model turns out to be no different. When corporations like Starbucks fight their workers’ legal right to form a union, the PR veil is lifted for all to see what’s really going on. Starbucks calls its workers “partners,” but they’re not in fact partners. They don’t share in the firm’s profits. Between January and September of this year, Starbucks’s revenue soared to $20.9bn — compared to $17.3bn in the same period last year. Its president and chief executive officer, Kevin Johnson, made $14,665,575 in total compensation last year and is on the way to getting a far larger package this year. Yet current average hourly pay at Starbucks is $14, or $28,000 a year. It’s all about power — the power of workers to join together to gain the bargaining clout they need for better pay and working conditions, up against corporate power to keep wages so low that shareholders and executives can make even more. The victory at one Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York, is a small step on the long road toward rebalancing such power. • This article was amended on 11 December 2021 to clarify that Buffalo was Starbucks’ first unionized workplace in the US, not worldwide.

2021-06-30T19:14:59Z,Jessica Morris obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/30/jessica-morris-obituary,"The communications consultant Jessica Morris did much to give a voice to people who lacked one. In the years up to her death at the age of 57 from brain cancer, she made her illness the basis of a campaign to find treatments for others. In January 2016 she was hiking in a valley north of New York when she found herself trying to speak: “Sounds came out of my mouth, but they weren’t words,” she said later. That seizure led to a diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive form of brain cancer, for which the median survival rate is 14 months. Only 5% of patients survive for five years. Jessica counselled Tessa Jowell, the former cabinet minister, on the disease before her death in 2018. Senator John McCain died from it later that year; Beau Biden, son of the eventual president Joe Biden, had died from it in 2015, and Jessica worked closely with Biden Sr’s cancer initiative team to raise the profile of brain tumours. GBM is a rare and devastating condition, and pharmaceutical companies that might otherwise fund research have largely neglected it. Progress is challenging when a clinical trial takes longer than most patients have left to live. Shortly after her diagnosis Jessica set up Our Brain Bank, a charity dedicated to changing that situation, and recruited her neuro-oncologist, Fabio Iwamoto, to its medical advisory board. “Jessica knew that something needed to be done and that patients like her had enormous power,” Iwamoto said. “Despite being busy with the tumour treatments and looking after three children, Jessica found the time and energy to be a pioneering advocate of a new contract between the medical profession and the patient community.” Much as patient activists had with HIV/Aids in the 1980s, Jessica understood that those living with the disease held much of the information required to treat it. She devised the first smartphone app to help GBM patients gain control of their data. Individuals could use that information to manage their own treatment or to get a second opinion. It could also be pooled for research purposes. Jessica made information about clinical trials easily accessible and invited more world-class oncologists to join Iwamoto as medical advisers. By forging links between doctors and patients the world over, she hoped GBM would move “from terminal to treatable, powered by patients”. On the basis of responses from hundreds of patients and their carers, Our Brain Bank established what it termed a GBM bill of rights, calling for improvements in the standard of care and patients’ quality of life. In the UK, the first academic paper based on data gathered by the app is under review, prior to publication. Jessica donated her brain to research, to be conducted by Columbia and Harvard universities, where her many often experimental treatments took place. Born in Greenwich, south-east London, Jessica was the daughter of Elizabeth (nee Villar), a printmaker, and Bill Morris, an architect. Like her brother, Ben, also an architect, and sister, Frances, now director of Tate Modern, Jessica had a flair for the visual, winning a national art competition in 1977, but her true love was performance. Musical theatre at her school, now Haberdashers’ Aske’s Hatcham College, in New Cross, led to her joining the children’s troupe at the English National Opera for productions including La Bohème and Massenet’s Werther. Until the age of 18 she sang in St Alfege church choir in Greenwich, gathering cassock-clad choristers for illicit cigarettes. At Cambridge University she gained a history degree in 1985 and met Ed Pilkington, now chief reporter for Guardian US; they married in 1993. After university her galvanic sociability found its social conscience. In 1986 Jessica volunteered for the Solidarity Campaign in Nicaragua, where she summoned Ed to join her. They stayed for 18 months and built housing for rural families displaced by the Contra war. Upon her return to the UK Jessica realised that her facility for communication could enable her to articulate other people’s needs. She joined the British Refugee Council in 1987 and two years later became head of PR at the charity Shelter. Alongside its director, Sheila McKechnie, Jessica helped make homelessness a mainstream issue at the end of the Thatcher years. Relentlessly inventive, she found angle after angle every day, lobbying politicians and mortgage lenders alike. After McKechnie’s death in 2004 Jessica helped found the Sheila McKechnie Foundation, devoted to “unleashing civil society’s capacity to create profound, long-term change”. When Jessica went into the private sector in 1993, becoming a board director at the PR agency Fishburn Hedges and working for clients such as Barclays Bank, she was the first consultant to join from the non-profit world. As an independent consultant, she worked on reorganisation of the Equal Opportunities Commission with the then chair, Dame Julie Mellor, in 1999; became head of corporate social responsibility at HMRC in 2005; and advised a number of blue-chip companies on their corporate social responsibility programmes. In 2006, Jessica and Ed moved to New York with their children, Felix, Tess and Emma. Ed and I had been colleagues for many years, but it was as neighbours in Brooklyn that Jessica and I became close. After a break to establish the family’s new life there, in 2010 Jessica returned to communications work, championing sustainable cities for ITDP (the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy). Three years later she opened the first US office of the PR and marketing firm Fishburn, owned by the Omnicom Group. After founding Our Brain Bank, Jessica wrote a book, All in My Head, to be published next year. It recounts the strong sense of purpose she had discovered despite the upending of her family and professional lives. She is survived by Ed, her children, her siblings and her mother. • Jessica Jane Morris, strategic communications consultant and campaigner, born 22 July 1963; died 8 June 2021",Cancer; Cancer research; Charities; Voluntary sector; Media; Health; Society; Medical research; Science; UK news; US news; World news,Society
2022-04-28T11:37:42Z,"Private equity executive sought to undermine NSO critics, data suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/private-equity-executive-sought-to-undermine-nso-critics-data-suggests,"When Downing Street was recently named as the suspected victim of a phone hack by the United Arab Emirates using the Israeli-made spyware, Pegasus, few were surprised at who was behind the discovery. The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has for years been a thorn in the side of the NSO Group, deciphering the company’s sophisticated hacking tools and – crucially – identifying victims of the spyware. Ron Deibert, the longtime director of the Canadian research group, is one of the world’s leading experts on identifying digital threats against civil society. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, is among a relatively small group of experts globally who can identify which iPhones and Android devices have been infected with Pegasus, and which government clients are likely to have been responsible. It is unsurprising, then, that the pair were an intense focus at Novalpina, the London-based private equity group which took over NSO Group in 2019, and quickly sought to stem its reputation for enabling repressive governments to commit widespread human rights abuses. Using UK data protection laws, Deibert and Scott-Railton last year sought the personal data held on them by Novalpina. The results of their so-called subject access requests, recently shared with the Guardian, contain snippets of hundreds of emails and attachments that included their names. The released data, combined with information from other sources, sheds light on an apparent attempt by Novalpina partner Stephen Peel to gather information on and undermine Citizen Lab. In one case, he even reached out to George Soros, whose foundation is an important Citizen Lab donor, and complained about the researchers. Peel, a former British Olympic rower, was the architect of a drive to “establish a new benchmark for transparency and respect for human rights” when Novalpina acquired NSO in early 2019. Citizen Lab, meanwhile, had since 2016 been at the forefront of exposing the human rights abuses perpetrated by NSO Group’s customers, revealing, for example, how Saudi Arabia had used the company’s spyware to hack the mobile phone of a dissident who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi months before the journalist was murdered. Novalpina’s lawyers said in letters released to Deibert and Scott-Railton that they found 473 emails that contained Deibert’s personal data, which included some duplicates. 223 emails named Scott-Railton. They reveal how in February 2019, Novalpina and NSO retained the services of Vivek Krishnamurthy, who at the time was a lawyer with expertise in corporate social responsibility practice at the American law firm Foley Hoag. A source familiar with the matter said NSO paid the firm about $220,000 (£170,000) for its work. Krishnamurthy was recruited as a “specialist external adviser” to align NSO’s governance framework with the UN’s guiding principles on business and human rights (UNGP). However, the documents suggest there may have been another motive as well: Krishnamurthy was an alumnus of the University of Toronto, and years earlier had worked as a research assistant for Deibert, who had helped him secure a Rhodes scholarship. As a result, he was well-placed to try to cosy up to the NSO critic. A February 2019 proposal by Foley Hoag to provide legal services to NSO said Krishnamurthy’s prior relationship with Deibert meant he was in a “unique position to conduct outreach to Citizen Lab should the NSO Group find it desirable to do so”. The proposal acknowledged that NSO had “reputational challenges” and said: “Our goal is to help the NSO Group become seen as the world’s most ethical company in the surveillance space by establishing systems, policies, and procedures to ensure that it operates in a rights-respecting manner.” In a 1 March 2019 exchange, Peel emailed Krishnamurthy telling the lawyer it was time to “reach out to Deibert to find out what is going on”. The lawyer promptly replied that he would, adding: “He can be prickly, and he’s clearly worked up about NSO.” The following day, Krishnamurthy sent an email to his former mentor, explaining he had been hired to work on NSO’s human rights policies. He told Deibert he had “thought long and hard” about whether to work for NSO, especially in light of Citizen Lab’s recent work. “I would probably have said no were it not for my good friend Sir Mark Stephens,” he wrote, referring to the British lawyer – who is a CBE but not a knight – as “one of the world’s foremost human rights lawyers”. He said Stephens, a celebrated British lawyer who frequently acts in high-profile cases, with former clients including Julian Assange, Salman Rushdie, and Greenpeace, had assured him of Peel’s “deep personal commitment to human rights, and of his desire to see NSO operate in a rights-respecting manner”. Deibert declined the meeting. He told the Guardian he did not believe NSO Group or its owners had shown good faith in responses to Citizen Lab’s correspondence and questions, and did not wish to appear to legitimise the company. He also turned down an attempt three months later by Krishnamurthy to secure a face-to-face meeting with his old university mentor when – following an exchange with Peel informing him he would again seek out a meeting with Deibert – Krishnamurthy told Deibert by email that he wanted to see him while on family trip to Toronto: “You’d be having a drink with me in my capacity as your former student, and not as anything else!” Deibert said he found it “deeply troubling and disappointing” that Novalpina had employed a former student and research assistant seemingly to “surreptitiously weasel their way into gathering information on our activities”. Krishnamurthy, a faculty member at the University of Ottawa who was recently appointed to a Canadian government advisory committee on online safety, denied he was hired for that reason, but conceded that his prior relationship with Deibert was relevant for the work he could do for Novalpina “as a good faith broker” with the NGO community. He expressed “regret” that his work for NSO’s financial backers damaged his relationship with Deibert, describing his work for for the company as “the weirdest matter I’ve ever handled”. Stephens, who described Peel as a friend, confirmed that he suggested Krishnamurthy to the Novalpina executive, but he said he was unaware at the time of Krishnamurthy’s prior relationship with Deibert. He said he had previously worked for Peel, but not for Novalpina or NSO. Stephens praised Peel and criticised Citizen Lab for disproportionately focusing on NSO. “The practical result of what they [Citizen Lab] have done is to ignore and effectively divert attention from the other players in this marketplace and they have given them a completely free pass and I think that’s reprehensible,” Stephens said. Citizen Lab has, in fact, produced reports on a range of other cyber surveillance companies, and published reports on other digital threats to civil society, including Chinese government censorship and vulnerabilities in Covid-related applications. Its work has attracted funding from the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations, which was created by the billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The Novalpina documents released to Deibert include one email from Soros’s office that was forwarded by Peel to NSO in Israel. The document was redacted, but well-placed sources and other emails seen by the Guardian suggest the outreach to Soros may have been part of an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Peel to undermine Citizen Lab’s funding. In May 2019, Peel is understood to have raised Citizen Lab at a dinner with Soros in New York. He later followed up with emails in which he sought to discredit the Canadian research group. In one, he lambasted Citizen Lab’s research, claiming it was “an organisation unknown except for its attack on NSO”. He questioned the group’s motivations, tactics, and objectives, which he described as “a little less pure than we might of hoped”. One person familiar with the matter said they believed Peel’s unspoken aim could have been to get Soros to withhold his charity’s financial support for the researchers. A second well-placed source said they could not judge Peel’s motive, but they could not rule out that was his intention. Soros was ultimately unmoved by the criticism of Citizen Lab. A month after the dinner, the Hungarian-born billionaire advised Peel he should probably extricate himself from the NSO investment. Lawyers for Peel said these were “tenuous and unsubstantiated allegations” and that Peel was committed to “good governance and human rights”. Deibert said the documents suggested Novalpina’s commitment to aligning NSO with human rights principles seemed to be a figleaf. “We have seen enough of their obviously absurd denials in the face of evidence of abuse to understand they do not appear genuinely interested in human rights due diligence as much as making money and crafting a seemingly palatable public-facing image,” he said. “One can only conclude that the bottom line matters more than human rights for those lining their pockets from NSO Group’s sales – including, their executives, owners, and high-priced lawyers.” Krishnamurthy said in a written statement to the Guardian that he and his colleagues had believed when they were retained that Novalpina was serious about making “real changes at NSO”. “However, the NSO Group’s subsequent record of complicity in gross human rights violations shows how wrong we were. I regret my brief time advising Novalpina in 2019,” he said. Krishnamurthy added that he hoped leaders like Deibert and Citizen Lab would “succeed in bringing NSO’s extremely harmful activities to an end”. A US consultancy called Berkeley Research Group (BRG) took over management of the fund that owns NSO last July after an internal dispute between the founding partners of Novalpina.",Canada; World news; United Arab Emirates; Hacking; Technology; Data protection; George Soros; Jamal Khashoggi,World news

The unwanted item, processed online at one second past midnight on Christmas Day because it was too large, was the first in a torrent of festive returns for ZigZag Global, a company that specialises in handling online returns. Within an hour, 709 products had been returned online via ZigZag; at 3.51am a £99 off-the-shoulder dress was the first item to be deposited at an InPost locker, and when newsagents began opening at 10am, queues began forming at counters to post back unwanted items. Shoppers have sent back more goods than ever this Christmas as the cancellation of parties, the return to working from home and a shift to online shopping led to an enormous pile of unwanted goods. Since Christmas, returns have surged by 24% on the year before, according to ZigZag, which works with the likes of Boohoo, Selfridges and Gap. Fellow returns specialist ReBound has recorded even higher demand, with returns in December 40% greater than a year earlier. With up to half of clothing bought online returned to some retailers, the whole process is estimated to cost businesses about £7bn a year, according to a 2020 study by consultancy KPMG. It is tricky to measure the environmental costs, but the transport, storage and disposal of items that cannot be resold because they are damaged or dirty is likely to weigh heavily on brands’ carbon footprints, and poses troubling questions about the dark side of the online sales boom. Anita Balchandani at consultancy McKinsey says managing the flow of returned goods is a “sustainability imperative for the industry”, not just looking at the impact of the “last mile” delivery to, and from, homes – but also what happens to an item that is no longer wanted. While the percentage of items sent back by online shoppers dipped in the early days of the pandemic, it has since risen as trends have changed: easy-fitting tracksuits, popular during the start of working-from-home, have been ditched in favour of more structured items such as suits and dresses, thanks to the return of weddings and office working. Last month, online fast fashion specialist Boohoo was forced to slash sales and profit expectations, partly as a result of the change in habits. About 15% of electrical goods sent back after being bought online are disposed of, according to one major reprocessor, because either they are unfixable or not worth fixing or cleaning. Every brand or retailer has a different benchmark, but as it costs up to £20 to reprocess each individual item many returns lose retailers money. Many small products, unless still untouched in their original packaging, will never be reused. A considerable effort is involved in processing returns. Checking goods are in safe working condition, clean and that any software has been wiped of personal images or data, must be done manually and is a time consuming, sometimes tricky process. While some brands supply reprocessors with free parts to mend faulty items and avoid them being landfilled, others do not. A large expensive item, such a washing machine or even a food processor, is likely to be checked, fixed and resold – probably via an auction site such as eBay – for 15% or 20% less than its retail price. But the best that can be expected for most broken or used hair clippers or electric toothbrushes is that they are dismantled for recycling. Cosmetics are another tricky area. Unless they are completely untouched and in their original package, resale is not possible because of the hygiene risk. About 80% of returned clothing is likely to be resold without significant work – perhaps requiring new packaging or a steam. Of the rest, most can be reprocessed but about 5% is likely to be deemed unfit for resale, either because it is too damaged or potentially unhygienic – such as worn underwear or swimwear. Items that have clearly been on a night out, had tags removed or are marked with cosmetics may not easily be revamped for sale by the original retailer and, again, the value of that item will influence the decision over whether it is to be to put through a cleaning or mending process or ditched. Al Gerrie, the chief executive of ZigZag Global, says: “Fast fashion has about a six-week life cycle. If it spends three or four weeks off the shelf it is losing value in that time and, if it can’t make it back [in time], it will be less attractive or unsaleable. If it’s a Christmas-themed item, it may have to wait until next year.” Many unwanted items may be sold in bulk to charities or to resellers who then mend or repurpose them for sale on eBay or Depop. For the rest, the vast majority of major retailers now send those unwanted items to charities or for recycling, but a proportion is still thought to be either burned or sent to landfill despite a furore over such practice in recent years. However, pressure to behave more sustainably and to cut down costs is driving retailers to reduce the amount of unwanted goods. Laura Gee at another returns specialist ReBound, says: “Brands are on a learning curve. They are getting better at [reprocessing] as shoppers are becoming more sustainably minded.” Technology firms such as ZigZag and ReBound help retailers track returned items more closely, monitoring why a sale has not been successful and taking decisions on where and how to reprocess goods without necessarily bringing them all back to the UK, if sold overseas. Last year, eBay said it had seen a surge in retailers setting up their own online stores to clear unwanted products and seconds. Other techniques to reduce returns rates include posting customer reviews which flag how a garment fits, using avatars to enable virtual trying on of a dress or encouraging customers to bring an item back to a store where they can pick up, and try on, the alternative. Geerie at ZigZag says: “Even fast-fashion retailers are becoming more conscious about corporate social responsibility and being more sustainable and trying to recover product whenever possible. It is a shift in the market for the good but not at a low cost, they are definitely losing money on some products.” Change is partly being driven by the threat of legislation. In France, companies must monitor what happens to unsold goods and from this month are banned from destroying them. Other European countries are expected to follow suit. In the UK, charities called for an anti-waste law, to be introduced after Amazon was forced to deny it sent household goods such as laptops and TVs to landfill after employees were filmed by ITV last year placing such products into boxes labelled “destroy”. The company said the items were donated or recycled. Balchandani says better consumer education about the effects of buying more selectively will be key to reducing the wasteful merry-go-round of returned goods. “In a world where consumers are increasingly conscious of their carbon footprint I don’t think brands are doing enough talking about how do you consume more thoughtfully,” she says.",Online shopping; UK news; Christmas; Money; Consumer affairs; Life and style; Environment; Boohoo; Amazon; Business; E-commerce; Couriers/delivery industry; Internet; Technology; Ethical and green living; Ethical business,Money
2021-05-31T15:51:15Z,Walmart under pressure to add employee representation to its board,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/31/walmart-under-pressure-add-employee-representation-to-board,"US retail giant Walmart is facing increased pressure to add employee representation to its board, as a leading figure on the Christian left, the Rev William Barber of the Poor People’s Campaign, says he will press the company on the issue at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday. Barber is an influential civil rights voice on race and equality in America and is also set to hammer Walmart on its record of worker safety during the coronavirus pandemic as well as call for a wage rise for its gigantic workforce. Barber told Axios he plans to pressure the big box store chain, which employs more than 2.3 million employees, and is valued at close to $400bn, to tie the fate of workers who fell ill or died from Covid-19 to the company’s sick leave policies. In remarks seen by Axios, Barber will tell the meeting that there are “perhaps hundreds of your workers who are not alive today because of this vicious coronavirus that was allowed to spread through your stores, largely in secret, as your workers feared for their lives every day.” Barber will also say more workers suffered because “they were too poor to stay home from work, too afraid of retaliation to get the time off” and that the company’s workers should earn at least $15 an hour and “need to sit in places of power, where people are making decisions that will impact their lives for a long time”. In April, a Walmart employee, Cynthia Murray, filed a proposal for hourly employee representation. In a supporting statement, Murray said: “There is growing consensus that the presence of employees on corporate boards can contribute to the long-term sustainability of a company.” Walmart sought relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude the proposal from the board meeting, but the regulatory agency declined. The company, however, has said that it was working with third-party advisory councils to help shape its approach, including its human rights statement, and has over the past year raised wages, improved benefits, health and safety measures, and joined efforts involving racial equity. “We believe our workforce strategy is designed to promote upward mobility for our diverse workforce and is consistent with our broader goals and initiatives regarding racial equity,” the company said in a statement. A spokesman pointed to a series of corporate social responsibility programs and the Walmart Foundation, which received $1.4bn from the company in 2020. The Walmart proposal comes amid increased political support for employee representation. The Massachusetts Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren announced last year that she supports legislation which would require that workers elect 40% of board members. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has called for any company with $100m on its balance sheet to have 45% worker-elected board membership.",Walmart; Retail industry; Business; Coronavirus,Business
2021-04-21T07:00:03Z,Lesotho firm first in Africa to be granted EU licence for medical cannabis,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/21/lesotho-firm-first-in-africa-granted-eu-licence-for-medical-cannabis,"A company in Lesotho has become the first in Africa to receive a licence to sell medical cannabis to the EU. The country’s top medical cannabis producer, MG Health, announced it had met the EU’s good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, allowing it to export cannabis flower, oil and extracts as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. It will export its first batch to Germany later this year. The GMP guidelines are the minimum requirements a manufacturer or producer must meet to ensure products are safe and of a consistent high quality. They are used to control the licensing for sale of food and pharmaceutical and medical products. The company had hoped to receive accreditation last year, but Covid-19 restrictions prevented inspectors from travelling to Lesotho in June. The company is optimistic accreditation will open doors to business with more EU countries and other international markets. It has already received inquiries from France, the UK and Australia. A report in August last year forecast the European cannabis market will be worth $37m (£26m) by 2027. Located 2,000m above sea level in the mountain region just outside the capital Maseru, the company employs 250 people on its 5,000 sq metre farm. But it has plans to increase its workforce to 3,000, “which is almost the entire population of the community”, said Nthabeleng Peete, the company’s community liaison manager. “Corporate social responsibility developmental projects will also take off and eventually reduce crime and poverty among the villagers,” said Peete. MG Health’s chief executive officer, Andre Bothma, said: “We are sitting in a rural area where there is hardly any income. More business for the company will create a knock-on effect on the locals too, because we also acquire some products and services from the villagers. Some supply us with vegetables, milk and beans, among other [products]. An increase in the workforce means an increase in the villagers’ income, too.” The tiny mountain kingdom was the first in Africa to license the growing of medicinal cannabis in 2017. The crop is widely produced in the country, although cannabis possession and use is illegal.",Employment; Lesotho; Cannabis; Private sector; Global development; European Union; Africa; Europe; World news; Society,Global development
2021-10-07T05:00:44Z,Manager of fund that owns Israeli spyware firm not yet given access to sensitive info,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/07/manager-of-fund-that-owns-israeli-spyware-firm-not-yet-given-access-to-sensitive-info,"The US consulting firm that now manages the fund that owns a majority stake in NSO Group, the Israeli spyware maker, has not yet been granted clearance by the Israeli government to receive any sensitive information about the company. The clearance is required before any sensitive information can be shared because NSO is regulated by the Israeli defence ministry, and details about the company’s government clients and internal investigations are classified. Berkeley Research Group (BRG) was selected to take over management of the fund by a group of public investors in late July after an internal dispute between the founding partners of Novalpina Capital, the London-based private equity company that previously managed the fund and controlled NSO’s board. A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in London declined to comment. BRG did not respond to several requests for comment. The change in management of the fund followed months of internal strife at Novalpina. It also came after the publication of the Pegasus project, an investigation into NSO by a consortium of 17 news outlets that included the Guardian, Washington Post and the French nonprofit Forbidden Stories. The investigation revealed how human rights activists, journalists and lawyers around the world have been targeted by authoritarian governments using NSO’s hacking software, which is known as Pegasus. Traces of Pegasus have also recently been discovered on the mobile phones of five current French cabinet members, according to a report by the investigative website Mediapart. NSO has said its hacking software is only meant to be used by government clients to conduct legitimate investigations into serious crime. The company has denied that its spyware has ever been used to target French officials, and has also said it conducts thorough investigations of allegations of misuse when it receives “credible information”. Once installed on a phone, Pegasus can harvest more or less any information or extract any file. SMS messages, address books, call history, calendars, emails and internet browsing histories can all be exfiltrated. It can also turn a mobile phone into a remote listening device. The Guardian has also learned that Gunter Schmid, a senior adviser to Novalpina who had continued to serve as chair of NSO’s governance, risk and compliance committee (GRCC), recently submitted his resignation. According to a recent disclosure by NSO about its internal governance practices, the GRCC oversees NSO’s adherence to its human rights policies and leads investigations into complaints of abuse. Following Schmid’s departure, the GRCC now appears to include at least three members: Asher Levy, the executive chairman of NSO, Shalev Hulio, the NSO co-founder and chief executive, and Shmuel Sunray, NSO’s general counsel. NSO did not respond to queries about Schmid’s resignation or questions about BRG’s status with the Israeli government. Schmid was not immediately available for comment. According to its website, BRG is a global consulting firm that helps organisations manage disputes and investigations, deal with corporate finance issues and improve performance. The firm says on its website that it is “continuously looking for opportunities to make a positive contribution in our local and global communities”. BRG’s executive chairman is David Teece, a prominent economist and professor in global business at the Haas school of business at the University of California, Berkeley. A press officer at the university did not respond to a Guardian request for an interview with Teece. But the professor has previously expressed views on the role of corporations in helping to support democratic values. In October 2020, in an opinion piece that was published by the New York Times and focused on corporations’ social responsibility in the wake of “disturbing” developments in China, Teece called on companies “whose prosperity depends on liberal democratic institutions” to “reassess their strategic decisions to determine if they are, in any way, undermining those institutions”. He wrote: “[I]t’s about thinking ahead with a stewardship perspective and a deep care for democracy, open societies, justice and the rule of law. Other issues, except possibly those related to the environment, pale in significance.” BRG declined to respond to question about its corporate social responsibility policies. Two people familiar with the matter said the decision by investors to transfer management of the fund that owns NSO from Novalpina to BRG was heavily influenced by Tobias Read, the treasurer of the state of Oregon who recently launched a campaign to become governor. The Oregon state employee pension fund was one of the largest investors in Novalpina Capital, after committing about $233m to the private equity firm in 2017, before its acquisition of NSO. Rachel Wray, the Oregon treasury spokesperson, told the Associated Press in August that Read – who as the state’s chief investment officer has oversight of its multibillion-dollar pension fund – was “concerned” about reporting around NSO and was “involved” at the time in discussions around Oregon’s investment. In response to questions about whether Read had any concerns about BRG not yet receiving clearance by Israel, Wray said in a statement to the Guardian: “Treasury is one of many limited partners in this fund; as a limited partner, we do not control the investment decisions made by external managers at private equity funds.” She then directed enquiries to be referred to a spokesperson for BRG. The spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. It is understood that BRG has recently met managers of other portfolio companies owned by the fund that was previously controlled by Novalpina. While BRG has not yet been to Israel to visit NSO’s headquarters, or accessed classified information, it is understood that the consulting company has met Omri Lavie, an NSO co-founder who is based in the US. In a message exchange with the Guardian, in response to a question about whether he expected BRG to be involved in NSO in the same manner as Novalpina had been, Lavie wrote: “I guess you’ll have to wait and see like everybody else.”",Surveillance; Israel; US news; World news,World news
2022-01-07T09:30:35Z,"‘They want to remove us and take the rock’, say Zimbabweans living near Chinese-owned mines",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/07/zimbabwe-china-mines-pollution-evictions,"A convoy of trucks laden with huge black granite rocks trundles along the dusty pathway as a group of villagers look on grimly. Every day more than 60 trucks take granite for export along this rugged road through Nyamakope village in the district of Mutoko, 90 miles east of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. The air reverberates with blasts and heavy machinery noises as the mountain above the village is slowly reduced, slab by slab. Quarrying has been happening here since the 1980s. Mutoko stone is sought after for its lustre. It is a popular material for tombstones. An extension to the Danish royal library in Copenhagen, known as the Black Diamond, is clad in Mutoko granite. The Buja people who live here say that as mining companies extract wealth from the mountain, they leave behind a trail of damaged roads and bridges, hazardous pollutants and dirty air. Cracks can be seen on houses and blast debris is everywhere. Now 50 families in the village have been told by a Chinese mining company that they will have to leave their homes and land. People in four other villages in the district fear they will also lose their ancestral lands. Two families, including an 82-year-old villager and his wife, have already been relocated by Jinding mining company, which wants to build a polishing plant. “The 82-year-old man collapsed when he heard the news because he never anticipated it. He was later resuscitated at the hospital. This is how bad things are here,” says Claudine Mupereri*, 38. She says the man was told his house was within the area licensed to the mining company by the government. Zimbabwe’s Communal Areas Act gives the president power to decide the use of an area that makes up 40% of the country’s land, home to about 70% of the population. “These companies do not respect communities. If the government does not protect us, then where will we get the protection we need?” says Mupereri. Two other families were given $2,500 (£1,840) to rebuild their homes, but community leaders say this is insufficient. “There is uncertainty around this village. Right now, we do not have anyone willing to help us because our councillor does not want to help us. Anyone who dares to speak out is threatened. Whether they remove us or not, we are already scared to speak out,” says Anesu Nyamuzuwe*. The 40-year-old father of four fears losing five hectares (12 acres) of land, his only source of income. “I have a good farm with fertile soil. My farming always meets my household requirements. I had built a good home and I am close to Mutoko centre, so I am not sure if I will ever get such a piece of land again,” he says. “What is more important, investors or the villagers? We should have the right to reject these people from entering our community.” Jinding mining company in China could not be reached for comment. A manager and interpreter at the company’s plant in Mutoko says families who live within the 500 hectares the company is licensed to mine will be relocated, but adds: “the people who are giving out the claims [to mining companies] have a problem. Why are they giving them [companies] so much land? This land is almost 500 hectares, I am sure they already know that people live in this place.” Zimbabwe has enjoyed a close relationship with China for decades. But the bond between the two countries solidified when western states imposed economic sanctions on Robert Mugabe’s government. As credit and investments dried up, China stepped in. In 2018, Zimbabwe-Chinese relations were elevated from “all-weather friends” to strategic partners, paving the way for Chinese investors to pour money into the country, particularly in the extractive industries, where they have been accused of paying little attention to environmental damage by environmental and human rights activists. Those living near granite mines say companies are failing to restore the land after extraction. Open pits are left uncovered, endangering children and wildlife. Zimbabwe’s government has been accused of turning a blind eye to complaints because, critics say, it doesn’t want to anger its biggest investor. Mineworkers speak of poor working conditions. At another mine in Mutoko, workers give accounts of beatings and poor pay. “Imagine going to work every day for over 12 hours and getting $50 at the end of it all. When I get home I am tired. My home knows no peace,” one worker tells the Guardian. “My friend was beaten with a steel rod and another 17-year-old boy had his arm broken after coming to work late. He was given $250 as compensation after villagers complained.” In 2020, two workers were shot and wounded in Gweru, central Zimbabwe, allegedly by a Chinese miner after a quarrel over salaries. Evelyn Kutyauripo, a paralegal with the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (Zela), who has been rallying villagers in Mutoko to resist evictions, says local officials need to protect people. “I blame the headmen and the councillors because they are working with the Chinese. They should stand with the community,” she says, adding that companies were taking from communities and not helping them develop. “They are not developing anything in the community. They should have a strong corporate social responsibility because they are killing our environment. We are suffering, our houses are cracking and there is pollution. The government should come to see what is happening.” Another Chinese mining company, Shanghau Haoying Mining Investments, is also causing unease among Nyamaropa villagers. Last year, the company was reportedly given a government licence to mine granite on tracts of land belonging to local people. “I hear they want to remove us so that they take the rock, which is underneath, but the people do not want to. They will have to use guns to remove us here,” says Gladman Murape*, 34. Shanghau could not be reached for comment. Richard Ncube, a legal officer at Zela, says people in Mutoko were “extremely worried” about evictions. “The major challenge is they are living in the dark, and they are not sure what is going to happen.” He said people were too scared to challenge the company. “We have gathered that most of the communities [in Mutoko] are afraid to come forward and take these matters to court due to intimidation and fear of being victimised,” says Ncube. Attempts to challenge the mining companies elsewhere in Zimbabwe have had mixed results. In November, Heijin mining company lost its mining licence in Murehwa, a district about 55 miles from Harare, after local leaders complained to the government that the company planned to evict locals. In 2020, Zela was involved in the successful fight to overturn licences to mine coal in Hwange national park, the country’s largest national park, home to 40,000 elephants. Following protests, the government banned mining in all its national parks. However, in September, hundreds of people in Chikomba district, 80 miles south of the capital, were evicted from their ancestral homes to make way for a $1bn iron and steel mining project. The Zimbabwe government says it has not received any reports of abuse of workers in Chinese-owned mines, but it did encourage workers to report any incidents. Deputy mines minister, Polite Kambamura, urged villagers to approach the ministry if they had problems. “We haven’t heard of any Chinese company which has relocated people in Mutoko. If villagers are not happy, they may approach our provincial mining office in Marondera or come directly to the ministry,” he says. “We understand that if ever there is a company that wants to relocate the people, they should engage the community, to buy that social licence from the community.” Kambamura adds that an environmental impact assessment – to ensure the environmental, social, economic and cultural issues related to any mining project are considered before it begins – must also be conducted by the company and should address any concerns. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Mutoko leaders were also approached for comment. * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",Global development; Zimbabwe; Mining; Inequality; Human rights; China; Africa; World news; Workers' rights; Mining; Environment; Asia Pacific,Global development
2021-07-12T07:58:19Z,Taiwan tech companies buy 10m Covid vaccine doses in deal that sidesteps China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/12/taiwan-tech-companies-buy-10m-covid-vaccine-doses-in-deal-that-sidesteps-china,"Major Taiwanese tech companies have drafted a deal to buy 10m vaccine doses for Taiwan, sidestepping months of complicated geopolitical wrangling between Beijing and Taipei. The US$350m purchase from German manufacturer BioNTech is split between TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, and Foxconn, one of the world’s largest contract electronics makers, and its charity foundation. The two companies will donate the vaccines to Taiwan’s central epidemic command centre for distribution. The convoluted deal, formalised on Sunday, closes the loop on a saga that tied China’s long-held but rejected claim over Taiwan to the island’s desperate need for vaccines, and allows Taiwan to procure the China-linked vaccines without the government having to deal directly with China. Taiwan is suffering major shortages of vaccines, in large part due to global supply issues, but it has also accused Beijing of scuttling an early deal to secure 5m doses directly from BioNTech. Beijing denies the accusation, saying Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceuticals had sole distribution rights for the region including Taiwan, and that Taiwan was welcome to go through them. But to accept Chinese-made or donated vaccines would be “the kiss of death” politically for Taiwan’s ruling party, analyst Drew Thompson said last month. Despite never ruling Taiwan, China’s Communist party (CCP) government claims it as a province, which it vows to retake. The CCP has recently increased pressure and military intimidation of the island and its occupants. Taiwan has rejected China’s offers as fake altruism. China has accused Taiwan of putting politics above its people, while simultaneously lambasting doses donated by the US and Japan as foreign interference. Sunday’s deal will bring sorely needed doses to Taiwan without inflaming domestic or regional tensions. While Fosun claims exclusive distribution rights for Taiwan, the deal appears to have satisfied all sensitivities. On Monday evening, the two Taiwanese companies said the deal was made on three principles: “The vaccines must be made in the original production facility, marked with original labelling, and be delivered directly to Taiwan to ensure the vaccines meet Taiwan Centers for Disease Control standards and comply with relevant regulations.” A statement from BioNTech’s chief executive said the doses would be manufactured in Europe. Foxconn founder Terry Gou said he first proposed the donation in late May, and all legal documents were now signed to procure the vaccines “straight from the German factory”. TSMC chairman Dr Mark Liu said the donation was an act of corporate social responsibility. “[Taiwan’s] president Tsai has celebrated Taiwan as an island of resilience, but this deal shows how Taiwan can also be an island of resourcefulness,” said Margaret Lewis, a professor and China specialist at Seton Hall law school. “Part and parcel of being Taiwan is having to do creative problem solving because of its unusual and unique geopolitical status.” At the daily press conference on Monday, Taiwan’s minister for health, Chen Shih-chung, thanked the private companies for their purchase and planned donation, but declined to provide further details. The doses were expected to start arriving after late September in batches, the companies’ statement said. Earlier on Monday Fosun confirmed the deals were signed. “We are very glad to see that this vaccine jointly developed by Fosun Pharameceuticals and BioNTech can play a positive role in the prevention and control of epidemic situations in Taiwan,” it said in a statement. “We will work together with our partners to make safe and effective vaccines available to Taiwan as soon as possible, safeguard the health and safety of Taiwan compatriots, and help them return to normal life as soon as possible.” Chinese authorities are not averse to acts of extraordinary intervention in private companies, and Lewis noted that the deal’s success wasn’t assured until the doses landed. “But if Beijing intervened at this point it would be … so glaringly interventionist and so glaring that Beijing is putting politics above health.” Taiwan is responding to its only major outbreak of the pandemic, after the Alpha strain spread across the island, infecting about 13,000 people and killing more than 700. Just 0.3% of the population have been fully vaccinated while at least 14% have received at least one dose. Its existing supply of vaccines is largely propped up by donations from Japan and the US.",Taiwan; China; Vaccines and immunisation; Coronavirus; Asia Pacific; Health; Infectious diseases,World news
2022-07-19T10:00:47Z,What do we really know about the Russian roots of America’s biggest cannabis company?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/curaleaf-boris-jordan-russia,"New Jersey is far from Moscow. But when cannabis sales began in the Garden state on 21 April, one of the lucky seven companies to ring up the first purchases was managing rumors that it was about to be sanctioned following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. As Russian shells fell on civilians in Kyiv and Kharkiv on 24 February, a Twitter user started a rumor that Curaleaf – the largest cannabis company in the world, worth $4.22bn and with operations in 23 US states and several countries – was about to be sanctioned since its chairman and top investor had both made fortunes in Putin’s Russia. It wasn’t true. Neither man nor Curaleaf have been sanctioned, and all have stridently denied any current or ongoing association with the Russian state. However, there is an undeniable connection with the country. Boris Jordan, the company’s American-born chairman, spent most of two decades in Russia beginning in the early 1990s, where he earned a reputation as the country’s most prominent foreign investment banker – and, by his own admission, he “once had a close relationship with Putin”, who assumed the Russian presidency from Boris Yeltsin on 31 December 1999. That went sour, after the 2004 election, but Jordan maintained a presence in Russia, running an investment house and chairing an insurance company partially backed by the now sanctioned tycoon Roman Abramovich. Jordan took the insurance company public last year. Andrey Blokh, a Moscow-based dual citizen and longtime associate of Roman Abramovich, is Curaleaf’s second-biggest shareholder, according to publicly available disclosure filings. (At the peak of Curaleaf’s stock price, its holdings made the men paper billionaires. Even after shares in the company tumbled more than 60%, between February 2021 and the present, Jordan’s Curaleaf holdings are still worth $900m and Blokh’s $760m.) Before forming companies in 2014 that entered the cannabis industry in Las Vegas – firms that Curaleaf acquired in 2017 – Blokh was associated with Abramovich in several deals, including the 1998 purchase of Sibneft, a major oil company. Abramovich later admitted that the auction for Sibneft was rigged. There’s no suggestion that Blokh was so implicated. With licenses throughout the country, Curaleaf is positioned to eat a lion’s share of the US cannabis market, estimated to grow to $75bn by 2030. Yet the sources of its capital have not been closely scrutinized. ‘Oligarchic capital’ According to Louise Shelley, the founder and executive director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center and an expert in the flow of capital in and from Russia, there is reason to look closely at any business with historical financial links with Russian money. Speaking generally, Shelley, a professor at George Mason University in Washington DC, said: “Nobody has made money in Russia without, at the minimum, an accord or an accommodation with the Kremlin.”. The political realities in Russia qualify fortunes acquired and maintained since Putin’s ascent to power as what Shelley calls “oligarchic capital”. This is cash that flows from Russia with government approval – and, in some cases, a government cut – to western banks and investment vehicles based in countries with rule of law. While western firms doing business in Russia – and public spectacles such as the seizure of sanctioned oligarchs’ luxury yachts – have captured public attention, Shelley says, the historical movement of oligarchic capital into the US, UK and other western democracies has received less scrutiny. This is a criticism that can be applied to Curaleaf as much as to any number of other US and international businesses. Other experts on Russia and kleptocracy take a softer line than Shelley. “I find it difficult to go after people like [Jordan],” said Anders Åslund, an economist, former adviser to Boris Yeltsin and the former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, and author of the book Russia’s Crony Capitalism: From Market Economy to Kleptocracy. While Jordan earned himself a reputation as “the ugly face of western capitalism in Russia in the 1990s” and was certainly politically active in Putin’s first term – “What he did for Putin with [the television station] NTV in 2000 and 2001 was ugly,” Åslund said – Jordan has since kept a lower profile, staying out of politics and away from sensitive industries such as oil and gas, precious metals, and defense. And though richer or more prominent tycoons might have been more likely to be influenced by the government in some way, Jordan’s fortune may have been just small enough to stay under the Kremlin’s radar, Åslund added. Jordan’s wealth According to Forbes, Jordan is a “self-made” billionaire who “cut his teeth in investing” in Moscow in the 1990s. Blokh, whose wealth Forbes estimated at $1.9bn in 2021, dropped off the billionaires’ list this year, but the magazine described his fortune as also “self made”, noting his tenure as president of Sibneft – a major oil company that Abramovich resold to the Russian government in 2005 for more than 50 times its 1995 sale price – and his role in consolidating Russia’s dairy industry under the brand Unimilk, which was then sold to the French conglomerate Danone in 2010. Though Forbes does not identify sources of wealth for the two men beyond their Russian business interests and their more recent cannabis ventures, Victoria McEvedy, Jordan’s London attorney, identified “substantial business interests outside Russia”, including the consolidation of Telecity, a European data center, and energy companies active in the Bakken oil fields in Canada. “Together, US, Canadian and European assets represent more than 80% of Mr Jordan’s current portfolio,” McEvedy asserted. Shelley does not have any privileged or insider information about Jordan, Blokh, or Curaleaf in this context. Rather, she says, her critique applies to a general pattern, and she stresses that public awareness of the broader phenomenon as well as examination of various deal-flows are both in the public interest. Jordan and Curaleaf declined to be interviewed for this article. In a written response to questions sent to Curaleaf, McEvedy dismissed scrutiny of Jordan’s CV as “a broad fishing expedition”. “Boris Jordan is a native-born American of Russian and Ukrainian ancestry with business interests in the United States, Europe and Russia,” a statement McEvedy provided read in part. “His sole business interest in Russia is a minority stake in the shares of a retail insurance company that serves middle-class customers. “As a foreign investor and an American, he is not and has not been affiliated with the government,” the statement added, noting that Jordan had last lived in Russia in 2003 and had not been there since January 2022. “We call for responsibility and facts instead of speculation and innuendo,” McEvedy’s statement continued. “Attempts to associate us with the Russian government or its policies will be vigorously resisted. “As attempts to exploit the current outrage against those policies for competitive and personal advantage, this is a dangerous path for all and unfairly discriminates against Americans of Russian heritage.” Jordan told Barron’s in 2018 that he “split time” between Moscow and Miami Beach, where he had offloaded a $26m penthouse condo that year. (At the time, Forbes referred to him as a “Russian venture capitalist”.) And though he resigned as chairman of the Moscow-based Renaissance Insurance in March, he retains a 35% stake in the company. His lawyer says this company has no government contracts or commercial clients. Jordan also chaired an investment group called Sputnik, which erased its website after the invasion. The site currently consists of a landing page that says “We’ll be back soon! Sorry for the inconvenience but we’re performing some maintenance at the moment.” Attempts were made to contact Blokh including the sending of registered letters to his addresses in Moscow via Kazakhstan, since no mail services from the US or UK are delivering mail to Russia. No responses were received. Response to war Curaleaf’s Russian connections are not new, as McEvedy’s defense pointed out. In 2018, Barron’s published a story titled “One of America’s richest marijuana companies has deep Russian roots”. Yet Curaleaf and Jordan seem aware they’re in a delicate position. Immediately after the invasion – but in the middle of a slide in the company’s stock prices that had begun a week prior – Curaleaf launched a defensive public-relations push. Framed as a response to the untruthful social-media rumors that the company was going to be sanctioned, critics say these defenses contained crucial tells. In a press release issued a day after the invasion began, Curaleaf described Russia’s war of choice as the “Russia-Ukraine crisis”. Later, Jordan was interviewed for an uncritical 3 March Forbes article – titled, “No, the world’s biggest cannabis company is not Russian owned” – in which he described himself and Blokh, who lives in Moscow, according to business records in Ohio and Nevada, as “American patriots, who are very, very pro-American” and the war as a “catastrophe” and “disaster”. However, he has been criticized for failing to condemn Putin or the Kremlin explicitly as the aggressor in these press statements and on his Twitter feed; instead he is perceived to have adopted a sort of “both sides” tone. That’s revealing, critics say. Even more uncomfortable for Curaleaf is the fact that Jordan and Blokh managed to hold on to their fortunes and stay in Russian business even after Putin took power and started to flex state authority over capital ventures. Jordan said at the time that rising anti-Americanism after Putin won a second term as president in 2004 was troubling, according to 2007 diplomatic cables posted to WikiLeaks, and that he had come under attack in the Russian media because of his US citizenship. Those who held on to their fortunes and avoided the fate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his company, Yukos – which in 2003 was seized and sold off, and Khodorkovsky imprisoned – must have some Kremlin link, be it a rapport or outright cooperation, said Shelley, again without reference to the specific cases of Jordan or Blokh. McEvedy stridently denied any suggestion of any ongoing link to the Kremlin and reasserted Jordan’s US citizenship. Some Russian tycoons have, however, found themselves being made examples of. In April, the banker Oleg Tinkov was forced to divest assets in what he called a “fire sale” after criticizing the war in an Instagram post. Tinkov and Khodorkovsky are just some of the most prominent examples demonstrating the understanding of Russia as a “mob state”, popularized in the late Karen Dawisha’s influential 2014 book Putin’s Kleptocracy. Existing sanctions laws do not address the flow of oligarchic capital into US enterprises, which Shelley called a “growing concern”. Awareness campaigns like the Yale School of Management’s “Russia list”, which identified western-based firms doing business in Putin’s Russia, have discouraged capital investment in Russia. (Notably, Jordan’s companies are not on this list.) However, the reverse flow – Russian oligarchic capital that has been or is invested in businesses in the US, UK, and other countries that enjoy the rule of law – has not been subjected to the same scrutiny. Some say it should be. American authorities seem aware. On 28 April, the Biden administration unveiled a proposal for a broad new set of “authorities for the forfeiture of property linked to Russian kleptocracy”. However, Shelley, the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center’s director, is doubtful whether this would end the flow of oligarchic capital. Jordan funded his Curaleaf holdings through a second company, Gociter Holdings, that’s based in Cyprus. Shelley observes that “there still needs to be more vetting of investors, which is not part of the proposal”. ‘An obvious litmus test’ In her statement, McEvedy dismissed critiques of Jordan’s background as based on old news. That’s true, but the old news is not good. Jordan once claimed a close personal relationship with Putin, according to a US diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks, though it soured after Putin adopted a more bellicose, anti-American stance. And though Putin thought enough of the American to name him chief of a major television station – a role Jordan lost after Putin disliked his coverage of the Dubrovka theater massacre – notably, that did not mean the end of Jordan’s Russian investments. Nor did it appear to affect his respect for Putin at that time. In a 2007 Washington Post op-ed that McEvedy says the newspaper’s editors asked Jordan to write to explain Putin’s popularity, Jordan wrote that Putin and his party, United Russia, enjoyed broad popular support because they delivered results. At this point it was clear Russian elections were rigged, some so-called “opposition” parties were Kremlin cutouts, and the legitimate opposition, including dissidents and journalists, such as the former FSB agent Alex Litvinenko and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, were ending up dead. (The op-ed also stated Jordan was still “based” in Russia, which contradicts McEvedy’s claim he vacated the country in 2003.) Fellow bankers who knew Jordan during his 1990s-2000s heyday, when correspondents for the Financial Times and Washington Post profiled him and sought his opinion, say Jordan took pains to cultivate relationships with top government and business officials, some of whom are now sanctioned. And his caution towards Putin and refusal today to openly blame the leader as the aggressor fit that pattern of behavior, they claim. “He was a major player in Russia,” Bill Browder, another US-born investment banker who waded into the wild-and-wooly post-Soviet Moscow in the 1990s, told the Guardian. Browder has since become a prominent Putin critic since his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested and beaten to death in a Russian prison in 2009 after blowing the whistle on rampant corruption. Magnitsky’s name was later lent to the landmark 2012 act of Congress that sanctioned Russian business leaders tied to corruption in that country. Jordan appears as an unsympathetic character in Browder’s books about his experiences in Russia, but not without cause. Jordan served as a top adviser “to the richest oligarch, Vladimir Potanin”, and was an eager participant in the oligarch’s game, Browder said. Other top Curaleaf executives have ties to Russia. Peter Derby, named a company director in 2018, spent a decade in the country, according to a Eurasia Foundation bio. He founded Troika Dialog, Russia’s first investment bank, in 1990. Karl Johansson, who also joined Curaleaf as a director in 2018, was managing partner at Ernst &amp; Young’s operation in the former Soviet Union from 1995 to 2000 and worked for the company in Moscow from 2006 to 2014, according to his bio published on Curaleaf’s website. In addition to his managing to stay alive in Russian business and having in the past made significant deals with power players, such as Roman Abramovich, who have now been sanctioned, Jordan’s steadfast refusal to critique the Kremlin – and, maybe, end up like Tinkov or Khodorkovsky – is a key tell for Browder. “The very obvious litmus test to use for any person with close ties with Russia is whether they are willing to publicly criticize Putin for Ukraine,” Browder said. “And if you read Boris Jordan’s statements, is he publicly criticizing Putin, or getting even close to that?” “Unless he’s willing to do that, based on his past experiences, it raises serious questions about his potential relationships with high-level Russians,” he added. McEvedy, Jordan’s legal counsel, rejected this assessment. “As a foreign investor and an American, he is not and has not been affiliated with the government,” her letter read. “Mr Jordan opposes the violence, bloodshed and destruction in Ukraine and has called for negotiations to end the war and stop the suffering.” The American cannabis market For now, Curaleaf has amassed a commanding position in the marijuana industry as well as defenders in the industry and on Capitol Hill. Key lobbies say the company has demonstrated a commitment to marijuana legalization’s social-justice promises, including sharing the legalized cannabis industry’s new wealth with the marginalized people of color who suffered most during the drug war. In Washington, big marijuana companies are represented by an organization called the United States Cannabis Council, of which Curaleaf was a founding member. In a statement, Steven Hawkins, the group’s CEO, praised Curaleaf – which was found to have broken labor law during union organizing drives in Arizona and Massachusetts – “as a leader in corporate social responsibility” and brushed off questions about its principals’ backgrounds. “No geopolitical situation should be exploited for gain at the expense of individuals or companies that have nothing to do with the situation,” Hawkins’s statement said, adding: “We don’t condone bad-faith efforts to undermine the position of a reputable company.” Key Democrats who are members of the House Cannabis Caucus, including Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, who also co-sponsored the Magnitsky Act, declined to comment for this article. The only elected representative to comment was Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican representative, who last fall introduced the States Freedom Act, a GOP version of federal marijuana legalization. “Of course, I am wary of any foreign investment into the American Cannabis industry, especially given Russia’s recent actions in Ukraine,” a statement from Mace’s office said, added that the States Reform Act “is focused on American investment in American cannabis”. Other advocacy groups noted troubling oligarchic capital in real estate, technology, and other sectors. “It’s impacting the whole economy,” said Aaron Smith, the co-founder and executive director for the National Cannabis Industry Association, whose members are mostly smaller businesses. For now, ending federal cannabis prohibition and ensuring that Black and brown people harmed by the war on drugs benefit from marijuana legalization are bigger priorities than worrying about “nefarious sources of capital”, he said. “Barring sanctions or some action from the state department, it’s up to the consumer where to spend their dollars,” he added. “And I personally think consumers should favor Main Street cannabis and not Wall Street cannabis anyway, regardless.” The problem is that with Curaleaf, not everyone has that choice. And that’s by design. Like other big American marijuana companies, Curaleaf “maintains an operational footprint of primarily limited-license states”, the company reported in an annual investor filing in 2020, “… with natural high barriers to entry and limited market participants … helping to ensure the company’s market share is protected”.",Russia; Cannabis; Drugs; US news; New Jersey; World news; Society,World news
2021-11-12T14:17:52Z,Slapstick architecture: how a €3.99 Ikea salad bowl became part of the Rotterdam skyline,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/12/slapstick-architecture-ikea-salad-bowl-rotterdam-depot-boijmans-van-beuningen,"Inspiration often strikes at lunch in the office of Dutch architects MVRDV. It’s the one moment in the day when everyone breaks from their screens and comes together around a long communal dining table, spread with assorted salads, to eat and chat. One fateful day in 2013, during a lunchtime brainstorming session, the tableware would prove to be more inspirational than ever. Eight years on, a monumental Ikea salad bowl has been added to the Rotterdam skyline – a €3.99 Blanda Blank rising 40 metres high. “I was looking for something round,” says Winy Maas, the puckish frontman of MVRDV, describing the origins of the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen. This €94m (£80m) open archive for the city’s art museum now stands as a colossal mirrored bowl in Rotterdam’s Museumpark, reflecting the surroundings in a surreal panorama. “The interns had put a big rectangular block of Styrofoam on the site model,” Maas recalls. “It was too rude. I thought something round would be nicer to our neighbours, so I replaced it with a mug. Then we wanted to reduce the footprint, so I grabbed the stainless steel bowl, with its nice mirroring aspect. That was it.” Such is the design process in an office founded on whimsical spectacle. Maas revels in turning models upside down, or grabbing whatever is to hand and adding it to the mix. One project began as a cluster of blocks before he draped a cloth over the model, turning it into a lumpy hill. Another building, with house-sized blocks dramatically cantilevered from its side, was the result of a model of a grid of little towers being mistakenly placed horizontally on the table. The comical process is intrinsic to the practice’s quirky Superdutch brand, and key to their global exportability. (For the Depot launch, a dedicated press conference was held in Chinese.) As architectural slapstick, their work transcends cultural boundaries. Rotterdam, Maas thinks, is particularly suited to such eccentric form-making. “It is not a city with regular urbanism,” he says. It was flattened in the second world war, and the decades since have seen all manner of strange experiments, from rotated cube-houses on stilts to MVRDV’s own elephantine market hall (another result of a model being turned upside down). “It’s about making objects. Every generation makes its mark, and the next reacts.” This particular mark had a bumpy ride. MVRDV originally won the Depot project in 2007, with a design that looked like another Ikea classic, the Lack table. It was to be a gargantuan square platform on 35m-high legs, with cranes lifting crates up and down in a vertical ballet of storage, but it was deemed a step too far, even for Rotterdam. MVRDV won a second competition in 2014, but they were then disqualified after it emerged Maas had met the Boijmans co-director, Sjarel Ex, during the process. The architects challenged the ruling, claiming they had no unfair advantage, and were reinstated. The design faced a barrage of opposition from neighbours – the nearby Kunsthal director feared it would be the “cannibal” of the park – but the city gave approval, and has duly placed it on the cover of its tourist map as the latest star attraction. In the age of Instagram, this supersized salad bowl has already proved to be an irresistible selfie-magnet. On the blustery opening weekend, with icy winds whipping around the Depot’s streamlined flanks, Rotterdammers came in droves to photograph themselves reflected in its bulging skin. The idea was to create something akin to Anish Kapoor’s mirrored bean sculpture in Chicago, but cladding the Depot with seamless, polished steel proved far too expensive, so panels of mirror-coated glass were chosen instead. It creates a similar impression from a distance, where the skyline is captured in a compressed ball but, as you get closer, it’s more like a low-budget hall of mirrors. The Chinese-made panels are clipped on to the concrete bowl in a widely spaced grid, their warped surfaces giving it the look of a pound-shop Kapoor – one that comes with an annual window cleaning bill of €50,000. The architects say the ambition was to create a building that “seems to disappear into its surroundings”, but a 13-storey high mirrorball does anything but – as the neighbouring Erasmus hospital always feared. The hospital fiercely opposed the project, and it has now had to erect a screen to prevent children in the psychiatric ward having excessive visual stimulation. Maas promises that a row of freshly planted trees will soon help, but this gleaming ark is not an ideal neighbour for anyone wishing to retain their sanity. Once inside the big bowl, €20 ticket in hand, visitors are free to roam its six floors, where some of the 151,000 items in the Boijmans collection are visible through windows in the thick concrete walls. You get to glimpse racks of old masters, bits of Memphis furniture in crates, and piles of Yayoi Kusama’s red-spotted phalluses being examined by conservators. The collections were previously housed across seven different sites, including the flood-prone museum basement, so this is a distinct upgrade for the safety of the €8bn collection. To compensate for the loss of park, the building is crowned with a rooftop garden. When you reach the summit, it turns out that the promised forest is in fact a ring of trees around the edge, with a restaurant and rentable party room taking up most of the roof. The trees are thankfully faring better than those on MVRDV’s ill-fated Marble Arch Mound, here grown in a nursery with their roots intertwined for stability against the wind. Below, crisscrossing staircases leap their way up through the dimly lit atrium, which has the air of a Bond villain’s mineshaft hideaway. The vertiginous space is dotted with big glass vitrines featuring objects from the collection, where you can see the backsides of paintings and the undersides of sculptures. Views into the stores provide unusual juxtapositions – a pair of mating dwarfs next to a telephone – as the items are arranged by material and size, rather than chronology. There are no labels or captions (“This is not a museum,” I am told), but visitors can download an app and scan QR codes to find out about some of the objects. For a more behind-the-scenes experience you can also don a protective white coat and sign up for a tour, which takes you into one of the 14 store rooms, where a guide will pull out a single designated rack and tell you about the conservation methods. But don’t expect to view a Rothko or Bruegel – the stars of the collection are too precious to be wheeled out. Such is the reality of fragile art storage. It is a worthy ambition to open the back-of-house world to public view – an idea being followed by the V&amp;A with its Olympic Park Storehouse in London – but the truth is that you don’t actually get to see much. Most visitable parts of the building actually house the private art collections of corporations, such as Rabobank or the KPN phone network, which amassed a haul of Dutch contemporary art in the 1980s as part of its corporate social responsibility programme. There is a customs warehouse dock here, too, where imported works can be temporarily stored without import duties being paid. Such commercial aspects have helped to make the project stack up, along with €42m raised from private sources, but the hefty ticket price seems at odds with so much of the building being a corporate showcase to burnish big brands. There is also the more fundamental question of how well-suited a circular bowl is to the function of storing art. In the main semi-circular painting store, the curved geometry creates a pleasing fan-shape of racks, but in other wedge-shaped rooms the racks are forced to taper into unusable triangular corners, or fit around columns. The storage has been forced to fit the quirks of the building, rather than the other way around, which seems like an odd way to design an art store. “It’s not dysfunctional,” says Boijmans co-director, Ina Klaassen, “but we had a challenge. Of course a rectangular building would have been easier, but this is so much more fun. We wanted something iconic.” That is the museum’s achilles heel. It is currently engaged in a €260m renovation of its handsome 1930s building, led by icon-makers Mecanoo, whose wiggly shaped plan involves demolishing an entire (award-winning) wing that was only built in 2003, at a cost of €17m. Its architects, Robbrecht and Daem, are suing the museum to try to prevent demolition, and it’s hard not to view the proposal as an act of staggeringly wasteful vandalism, particularly given the climate emergency. Whatever the outcome, when the museum finally reopens in 2028, it will have the ultimate supersized selfie mirror to admire its new curves.",Architecture; Art and design; Culture; Netherlands; Europe; World news,Art and design
2021-01-18T06:00:22Z,Uighur campaigners to target 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics sponsors,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/18/uighur-campaigners-to-target-2022-beijing-winter-olympics-sponsors,"Campaigners fighting against the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China are to target private companies sponsoring the Beijing Winter Olympics in an attempt to persuade them to use their influence with the Chinese government ahead of the 2022 event. Uighur campaigners in 10 different countries are coming together to write to companies asking them to use their platforms to educate and inform the world of the persecution under way in Xinjiang province. The first to be targeted is the chief executive officer of Airbnb, Brian Chesky. Calling the Winter Olympics the “Genocide Games”, the campaign group would ideally like for Airbnb to withdraw its sponsorship, but will probably graduate their demands. The San Francisco-based Airbnb secured a £500m sponsorship of the Olympics starting with the Beijing Games. The digital campaign will include concurrent pictures of the typical accommodation available to Airbnb customers and that available to persecuted Uighurs held in detention camps. The aim of the campaign is to persuade the huge multinationals that they will pay a commercial price if they do not use their immense soft power to persuade China to rethink its stance. In its letter, the group broadly entitled End the Uighur Genocide Movement asks Chesky and his executive team to meet the campaigners virtually – including some of the people that have been forced to work in Chinese concentration camps and those whose loved ones have disappeared. The group acknowledges that Chesky’s corporate aim is to bring the world closer together, adding he has built his company around the theme of “belonging”. The authors of the letter say: “We are exiles from our country, unable to go home, unable to contact our loved ones.” They add: “All over the world, campaigners, politicians and celebrities are waking up to the horror of what is going on. There is now a real risk that that Airbnb’s brand will be stained by your association with the Genocide Games.” Rahima Mahmut, director of the World Uighur Congress, said Airbnb could either pull out of the games or use their involvement to speak out “clearly and unambiguously” against the attacks on the Uighurs and other Muslims. She added that staying silent on this issue was not possible for Airbnb. The campaign is being launched in America, the UK, Canada, Norway, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Japan and Australia. Other major multinational sponsoring companies for the Beijing Olympics include Allianz, Coca-Cola, Samsung, Intel, Visa International, Omega, Atos and Panasonic. Airbnb is facing the campaigner’s attention early partly because of the firm’s emphasis on corporate social responsibility. Chesky has also shown a huge personal philanthropic commitment, signing Bill Gates’s pledges to give the majority of his wealth away to charitable causes either during his lifetime or afterwards.

2021-06-27T12:03:28Z,Mining holds the key to a green future – no wonder human rights activists are worried,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/27/mining-holds-the-key-to-a-green-future-no-wonder-human-rights-activists-are-worried,"Interest in Dogger Bank was once restricted to insomniac enthusiasts for the BBC’s Shipping Forecast. Not any more. Today, the shallow sandbank, located 120 miles off the UK’s north-eastern shoreline, is home to the world’s largest windpower project. When fully operational, giant turbines will transmit 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough to power 5m homes, into the National Grid at prices well below current levels. Welcome to the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. Around the world, solar and wind now represent the cheapest source of new electricity generation – and prices are tumbling. Electric vehicle (EV) batteries are driving oil towards obsolescence. Stripped of government subsidies and corporate lobbying carbon-based fuels are a busted flush. The future of energy is green – and the future can’t come soon enough to tackle the climate crisis. In November governments will gather in Scotland for the Cop26 climate summit aimed at getting the world on track for achieving the 2015 Paris agreement goal of holding average temperature rises below 1.5C. That will take a fivefold increase in global renewable energy generation by 2030 en route to a zero-carbon world by mid-century. Can we decarbonise power and transport in time to avoid climate catastrophe? That will depend partly on the governance of a global mining sector tarnished by accusations of human rights abuse, environmental damage and financial corruption. Expanding renewable energy is a mineral intensive enterprise. Nature might provide the solar radiation and wind providing renewable energy, but the arteries through which the electricity flows are made of copper – and lots of it. Wind turbine gearboxes need manganese, platinum and rare earth magnets. EV batteries are made with lithium, cobalt and nickel. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), a mid-century zero-carbon world will take a sixfold increase in the production of these and other transition minerals by 2030. Prices are already surging. The supply chains through which transition minerals flow are highly concentrated. Small groups of countries – the Democratic Republic of the Congo (cobalt), Indonesia and the Philippines (nickel), Australia and Chile (lithium) – dominate production. But Chinese mining companies are rapidly increasing investments. In processing, China is the main game in town. Its refining companies account for more than half of the world’s cobalt and lithium production. Global value chains for EV batteries are dominated from top to bottom by Chinese suppliers. They account for more than 80% of the raw materials for advanced battery materials. That market structure explains why the prospect of a global mining boom is causing concern among human rights activists. “Make a list of the companies and countries producing transition minerals,” says Phil Bloomer, the director of the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), “and you have a window on egregious and systematic violations of human rights”. The centre recently published a survey claiming more than 300 serious allegations against 115 transition mineral mining companies, ranging from the violation of indigenous land rights, to water pollution, health threats, corruption and a systemic failure to consult local communities. Water-intensive lithium mining in the Atacama desert in Chile, the world’s driest environment, has triggered a wave of legal battles over water rights pitching indigenous communities against multinational mining companies. Nickel production in Indonesia and Australia is at the heart of battles over water pollution. Cobalt mining in the DRC has been linked to allegations of child labour, the financing of armed groups, and industrial-scale corruption linking multinational mining companies to politically connected intermediaries via a complex web of offshore shell companies. Current approaches to resource governance have followed a familiar pattern. Listed western mining companies and users of transition minerals report to shareholders through a bewildering array of voluntary arrangements and corporate social responsibility initiatives covering specific metals, countries, and financial transparency. Environmental, social and corporate governance investors have focused overwhelmingly on the environment and carbon footprint of mining, in effect downplaying human rights. None of which appears remotely fit for the purpose. The absence of Chinese companies leaves much of the supply chain hidden from view. Financial disclosure on links to offshore-listed companies is often limited. Meanwhile, human rights reporting standards are uneven, inconsistent and sometimes derisory. Constructive engagement with China is critical to transition mineral governance. The Biden administration’s drift towards a geopolitical natural resource nationalism setting western countries against Beijing is as short-sighted as it is futile. There are many areas in which Chinese policies need reform, including the use of debt to secure access to minerals in Africa. But for the foreseeable future, many batteries fuelling EVs like the batteries in your mobile phone and PC, are likely to be built through supply chains linking cobalt mines in the DRC and lithium mines in Chile to factories in China. Cop26 provides an opportunity for the EU, US and China to forge a new multilateralism. The starting point should be a shift towards mandatory human rights due diligence reporting. The EU has already announced an intent to move in this direction, potentially opening the door to sanctions against companies for breach of due diligence and legal redress for communities. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is similarly planning to make environmental and human rights disclosures mandatory. None of this is a substitute for effective national governance. But mandatory human rights reporting, allied to strengthened disclosure on shell companies and ownership of offshore enterprises, would help raise reporting standards and strengthen the hands of local communities and others defending human rights. The alternative is a wave of activist protest, legal challenge and investor hesitancy that will slow the development of the mineral resources needed to secure our climate future. That is an outcome none of us can afford. With the right governance we can ensure that the green revolution in energy does not become a new resource curse for the poor – without it, we all lose.

2021-05-21T07:00:01Z,"Biden’s global corporation tax plan is hugely popular, so why isn’t Britain backing it? | Polly Toynbee",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/21/biden-global-corporation-tax-popular-boris-johnson,"When something radical is proposed by an American president the idea stops being “leftwing” and soon becomes blindingly obvious common sense. Of course the world should agree a minimum corporation tax rate to stop a race to the bottom in which countries undercut each other, depriving themselves of tax revenues, needed now more than ever. Never waste a good crisis: there’s no better time for change than following this global disaster when every country needs to repair its economy. Adopting a universal tax floor ends once and for all the scandal of tax havens where apparently respectable companies, pretending to all kinds of bogus corporate social responsibility, hide their money from the citizens that sustain them. Joe Biden’s plan for an international agreement on a 15% minimum rate has gathered phenomenal support, including from Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan. Ángel Gurría, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the club of 37 rich nations, says a “once in a lifetime” deal is within striking distance and could be signed this summer. Here’s our national shame, yes, yet another one: Britain is the only G7 country not to back it. Yesterday, Labour tabled an amendment to next Monday’s finance bill demanding a review of the impact that applying this tax rate would have over the next few years. How much tax would it bring in, how much evasion and avoidance would it prevent, and what is the true size of the tax gap for the next two years? The government will refuse, of course. The figures would be as embarrassing as Britain’s refusal to back the Biden plan. Here’s the puzzle: why should Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak balk at this when they claim their own plan is to raise the UK corporation tax even higher, to 25% in 2023? It’s highly popular and it seemed one of the few measures that might give some substance to “levelling up” spending. Labour suspects, as do tax campaigners, that it will be quietly dropped under strong Tory business pressure. What other reason could there be for blocking a tax rise lower than the one they claim they will impose? Here’s one clue. Answering questions for the government in the Lords, the Treasury minister Lord Agnew, gave the game away: “Lower corporation tax rates are broadly a good thing. Personally, I do not like to see tax on productive activity, employment or any of the things that make a country prosperous … we should always aspire to lower tax rates, particularly on corporation tax.” What’s more he wanted to undercut other countries: “We will try to set it still at a competitive rate, so the US, Canada, Korea, Japan and Germany will all have higher rates than the one to which we are moving.” Analysis by the campaigning group Tax Justice UK says that the tax rise would have brought £13.5bn into the Treasury last year. This would rise to £22bn if the government did set it at 25%. A report from Church Action for Tax Justice, signed by a group of bishops and former archbishops, calls on the government to promote the Biden plan, saying it could raise $640bn globally, more than 27 times what it would cost to vaccinate the whole world. The government has made various excuses, including that Biden is not doing enough to see that the big tech companies are taxed in each country where they earn their profits. The UK introduced its own digital services tax (DST) ahead of any international agreement, but Robert Palmer, the head of Tax Justice UK, points out that our DST raises a puny £500m a year. Tory tax phobia is a more likely explanation, and a refusal to be prevented from undercutting others in future. But another reason is Britain’s responsibility for so many tax havens. This would end that archipelago of British-sponsored tax avoidance in places such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Britain itself is a money-laundering centre, with far laxer implementation of rules and lower fines than the US imposes on its banks. Britain is blocking what the Tax Justice Network calls “the best opportunity for a generation to curb corporation tax abuse across the board”, standing against the world in defence of tax havens. Inflicting this shame on ourselves is odd: this is highly popular and would yield fat sums for whatever else Johnson wants to spend money on – a few more bridges, perhaps. No one knows with this government who is influencing ministers, who has their ear, what deals are struck or what winks and nods point to post-ministerial lucrative careers. With emails, texts and WhatsApps zinging about unseen by their officials, we may never know why. But Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, rightly sees this as prime territory – a popular tax to raise urgently needed funds, which Labour would spend better. Labour’s 2010 corporation tax rate was 28%, now it’s 19%. Returning to that old rate will feel right if Biden succeeds in raising the US tax to 28%, as he plans, yielding $2.5tn over 15 years for his great spending programme. For those who think Labour is done for, just count the ways this government is accumulating own goals. • This article was amended on 21 and 25 May 2021 to correct the name of the group Church Action for Tax Justice and to change the minimum global corporation tax rate proposed by the US from 21% to 15%.

2021-05-20T17:30:46Z,Stay for good: six social enterprise holiday spots around Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/may/21/stay-for-good-six-social-enterprise-holiday-spots-around-australia,"Many hotels have feel-good corporate social responsibility programs that support charitable causes. But those that take a sound sleep one step further – operating purely to fund initiatives that make the world a better place – are harder to find. From a social enterprise hotel running training programs for young people with disabilities, to a bush camp run by a not-for-profit wildlife conservancy, these places offer getaways that keep on giving. Mornington Wilderness Camp, Western Australia Managed by not-for-profit organisation Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Mornington Wilderness Camp welcomes nature-loving visitors to enjoy an isolated, down-to-earth escape in one of Australia’s most precious wilderness areas. Visiting this 3,000 sq km sanctuary in the Kimberley helps to support the protection of threatened species such as the rainbow-hued Gouldian finch and the small-yet-feisty northern quoll. A remote spot only accessible by 4WD during the dry season, the camp is open from May to September and is beloved by birdwatchers (200-plus species have been recorded at the sanctuary). Whether you stay in a safari tent or roll out a swag at the unpowered creek-side campground (no fires, pets or drones allowed), all guests are welcome to perch themselves at the camp’s bush bar to share an ale and a tale as the sun sets. • Campsites at Mornington Wilderness Camp cost $26.50 per adult ($12.50 per child) per night. Safari tents start at $325 per night and include a two-course dinner, buffet breakfast and lunch hamper. Hotel Etico, New South Wales Heritage charm meets modern social enterprise at Hotel Etico, a 15-room hotel that occupies the stately Mount Victoria Manor in the Blue Mountains. Modelled on a program that began in Italy, Hotel Etico supports young adults with intellectual disabilities to gain training and experience that will open up career paths within the hospitality industry. Whether you’re passionate about supporting disability inclusion or just looking for a cosy fireplace to relax by after a day of hiking, Hotel Etico is open to guests from June 2021. • The full rate for a standard room at Hotel Etico is $199 a night, breakfast included. Cape York Peninsula Lodge, Queensland From fishing for barramundi to day tripping to Thursday Island (Waiben) aboard a ferry, there are many reasons to visit Cape York Peninsula Lodge, a community-owned hotel located in the remote Queensland township of Bamaga, Cape York. The multilingual community here speak Kala Kawa Ya, Torres Strait Creole and English, so a visit is a chance to pick up a few new phrases too. Whether you fly into Northern Peninsula airport or drive there in a 4WD (don’t forget to check weather conditions beforehand), every stay at this lodge benefits the Bamaga community. Run by not-for-profit Indigenous company Bamaga Enterprises, the lodge and other associated businesses help to finance community infrastructure and needs such as school uniforms, playgrounds and education scholarships. After a challenging year in 2020, the lodge is expecting the upcoming dry season to be busy, so book well in advance. • Simple cabins at the Cape York Peninsula Lodge start at $145 per night, while deluxe rooms with views of Mosby Creek start at $279 per night. Port Stephens Koala Sanctuary, NSW Rise and shine with the koalas and support the rehabilitation of sick and injured native wildlife, by booking a stay at Port Stephens Koala Sanctuary’s new glamping tents. With an aim to support the long-term sustainability of koalas in the wild, the glamping tents were opened at the council-operated koala hospital and sanctuary in September 2020. Set within bushland located at the edge of One Mile Beach and Worimi Conservation Lands sand dunes, the four-star glamping tents feature en suites, kitchenettes and an outdoor deck for stargazing. • Glamping tents at Port Stephens Koala Sanctuary start from $460 per night. Djilpin Arts, Northern Territory Beswick (Wugularr), 112km from Katherine, is the home of the Jawoyn people, who received native title to their lands in 1991. Nowadays, Beswick has around 500 residents from all over the Northern Territory and beyond, including many talented artists who show their work through the not-for-profit Aboriginal corporation, Djilpin Arts. Founded by late actor, musician and community leader Balang TE Lewis, Djilpin Arts is home to a museum, gallery, cultural centre and four National Architecture award-winning pavilions featuring queen beds, air-conditioning and verandas to kick back on. As a community enterprise, all profits help to support local artists who make prints, carvings, jewellery, fibre art and contemporary textiles. Alcohol is restricted in this community so don’t expect champagne on arrival, and before you go, be sure to apply for a visitor’s permit from the Northern Land Council. • The pavilions at Djilpin Arts sleep up to four people and cost $165 per night. Renmark Hotel, South Australia Legend has it that Harry “Breaker” Morant once rode his horse into the bar of the Renmark Hotel, a grand, old pub that has been owned by the farming community of Renmark since 1897. As Australia’s first community-owned hotel, this Murray River stalwart has generated funds for the town for more than a century, with donations and sponsorships supporting everything from flower festivals to sporting teams. Overseen by an elected board of locals, the handsome building was given an art deco makeover in the 1930s. These days, the hotel has a laid-back bar and bistro, museum and accommodation options ranging from simple motel-style rooms to spa suites with Murray River views. • Motel-style rooms at the Renmark Hotel start from $115 per night, while rooms with a river view start at $160.",Australia holidays; Travel; Australasia holidays; New South Wales holidays; South Australia holidays; Western Australia holidays; Queensland holidays,Travel
2021-01-21T14:41:55Z,Former M&S boss Stuart Rose named chair of EG Group,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/21/former-m-and-s-boss-stuart-rose-to-chair-asda-buyer-eg-group-issa-brothers,"The billionaire brothers buying Asda have hired the former Marks &amp; Spencer boss Stuart Rose to chair their EG Group business. EG, a chain of 6,000 petrol stations owned by the Blackburn-based Issa brothers and the private equity group TDR, has appointed Lord Rose as non-executive chairman with immediate effect as Zuber and Mohsin Issa prepare to expand with the Asda acquisition. The veteran retailer also chairs the online groceries firm Ocado but is due to stand down in May after more than eight years. The appointment is a boost to EG’s corporate credentials and its expansion ambitions. The Issa brothers are buying Leeds-based Asda, Britain’s third largest supermarket chain, from the US retail group Walmart for £6.8bn, also in tandem with TDR. EG has expanded rapidly in Europe and the US and has more than £7bn of debt. In October the group’s auditors, Deloitte, resigned, sparking concerns about EG’s governance and management. The group, which was founded as Euro Garages 20 years ago by Zuber and Mohsin Issa, and is now 50/50 owned with TDR, also has investments in businesses including David Lloyd Leisure and Stonegate, the UK’s biggest pub owner. EG made sales of more than €20bn (£17.7bn) in 2019 and generated underlying profits of €910m. KPMG took over as auditors when Deloitte stepped aside. The Competition and Market Authority has embarked on a phase 1 investigation into the Asda deal. The regulator is looking at whether the acquisition will lead to a “substantial lessening of competition” in the UK, and must decide by next month whether to step up its investigation. Rose said: “The Issa brothers are great British entrepreneurs of enormous drive, vision and ambition. EG’s board has asked me to develop appropriate governance structures for a business of this scale. The business has exciting development plans and exceptional prospects in the years to come.” During his 40-year career in retail, Rose worked for Burton Group, Argos, Booker and Arcadia. He was knighted in 2008 for services to the retail industry and corporate social responsibility, and was given a life peerage in 2014. He is a former chairman of the British Fashion Council and of the outreach charity Business in the Community. The Issa brothers said: “We have plans to create significant convenience and food service opportunities for our customers, and Stuart’s retail and consumer experience will provide invaluable insight and support.” EG also has its eyes on Caffè Nero, which appointed KPMG in September to help it negotiate rent cuts with its landlords. However, EG’s bid for the 800-strong coffee shop chain was rejected in November and Caffè Nero filed instead for a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that allows retailers to cut rents and shut outlets. The CVA was passed with backing from most Caffè Nero landlords, but some were unhappy and filed a legal challenge funded by EG two weeks ago. A court date has not yet been set. The group of landlords contesting the CVA includes Alan Sugar’s commercial property firm Amsprop. As part of Caffè Nero’s financial restructuring, its founder and controlling shareholder, Gerry Ford, has paid £5m into a fund that can be accessed by the firm when it is needed. Under EG’s takeover proposal, landlords would be repaid in full for rent arrears.",Stuart Rose; Asda; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Business; Mergers and acquisitions; UK news,Business
2021-01-04T10:46:54Z,New-sprung: the project turning PPE offcuts into Covid patient mattresses,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jan/04/project-turning-india-ppe-offcuts-mattresses-covid-patients,"At the height of the pandemic in the Indian state of Kerala, fashion designer Lakshmi Menon, 46, heard that every new Covid care centre had to have 50 beds. Mattresses were in short supply. Every time a patient was discharged, the mattress had to be incinerated. “I thought: that’s a lot of mattresses and a lot of burning,” says Menon. Menon’s solution was to collect the mountains of plastic pieces from factories that make PPE – all the little bits left over after cutting. Women then braid the bits into rope-like plaits 6ft long. The braids are laid out in a zigzag and the ends tied together. The result is a light, soft, washable, hygienic mattress for just 300 rupees (£3) – half the price of a normal one. The women of Arayankav near Kochi, where Menon lives on a rubber plantation, get jobs, the environment is protected and Covid clinics get mattresses – “shayya” in Sanskrit. The idea of using waste scraps came to her when she was driving to Kochi in February and saw children sleeping on the road. A few days later, she visited a friend who runs a fashion house and saw heaps of waste fabric of different sizes. “That’s when I thought I could use braiding to make mattresses for the homeless. Braiding allows you to use every single bit of fabric of different sizes. Even the tiniest bit can be incorporated and everyone knows how to tie a plait,” she says. In March, she made 20 mattresses and handed them out to homeless families. Then lockdown happened. Her friends in design and fashion lost business overnight. Workers were laid off and things looked grim. Menon forgot about the fabric mattresses, until she went to a friend’s tailoring unit in July and saw that he had started making PPE. In the corner lay a mountain of plastic pieces. Menon’s eyes gleamed. “I picked them up and found they were cleaner, softer and more dust-free than fabric scraps. It was the best material I could have wished for,” she says. Her friend was delighted when Menon took the scrap pieces. He had been struggling with how to dispose of them because burning was out of the question. At the same time Kerala, overwhelmed by the pandemic, ordered the setting up of 50-bed Covid centres across the state and village councils scrambled to find enough mattresses. Apart from the Covid centres that have bought them, Menon is working with NGOs to provide shayyas to homeless shelters and rough sleepers on the principle that “everyone deserves a good night’s sleep”. India’s 1.7 million homeless people normally sleep on the ground, usually on a thin mat. Students in India who are part of Enactus, the international not-for-profit organisation set up by accountancy firm KPMG, are working on making the mattress widely available. “We also feel that yoga centres might be interested in buying them as they are soft and light and easily rolled up,” says Ishartek Pabla, operations head of Enactus at Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies. Menon is unlikely to meet a shortage of raw material. India has become the world’s second-largest PPE manufacturer, with more than 1,000 manufacturers producing 4.5m pieces a day, the country’s textile ministry announced this week. Menon’s shayya has been taken up by UN staff who will include it in a list of Covid innovative ideas that can be easily replicated. Several Indian corporations have also contacted her. “These big companies have to fulfil their corporate social responsibility objectives and the mattress provides a good way of proving income for rural women in a sustainable way with no need for any equipment. Nothing really. Just a bit of space,” says Menon.

2021-02-18T07:15:27Z,Educating Zimbabwe: illegal ‘home schools’ defy lockdown in townships,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/18/educating-zimbabwe-home-schools-defy-lockdown-in-townships,"It’s Friday morning and Help Mabwe is preparing to give the day’s illicit lessons. Round the back of his house the teacher has created a classroom out of some old canvas and some wooden poles. A few broken chairs and benches, and an ancient chalkboard complete the furniture in Mabwe’s backyard college in Kuwadzana, a township 15km west of central Harare. Faced with schools being closed indefinitely across Zimbabwe, this garden classroom is the only option for many children and young people in Kuwadzana. Schools in the country were closed in March 2020. Some began to reopen in October for pupils taking exams, but all were then shut indefinitely in January as the cases of Covid began again to rise. The closures led to an almost 10% drop in the number of children passing their national grade seven exams last year. More than 80 schools recorded no passes at all. “The home schools are the answer to the current dilemma that we find ourselves in,” says Mabwe, as he welcomes students arriving for a sociology lecture. At Mabwe’s home college, students pay $10 (£7.25) a month, while the poorer children, mostly orphans, can study for free, he says. “There are instances where parents cannot afford lessons. We can have a gentleman’s agreement. There are some children who are orphans, so we take about 10 and teach them for free. “This is also part of our corporate social responsibility. We are in the community and want to serve the community. We are not driven by money, but we are driven by the need to better lives.” Some of his students arrive having not eaten. “It is one of the contributing factors to a poor pass rate. I wish I had the resources to feed some of them,” says Mabwe. Home schools have sprouted up across Harare’s townships, but the government has warned teachers not to open their own classrooms, saying that these are illegal under lockdown rules. The government has banned gatherings of any kind because of the recent rise in case numbers. Since the pandemic began, Zimbabwe has recorded more than 35,000 coronavirus cases and 1,400 deaths. Before Covid, the government was already beginning to crack down on teachers establishing private colleges, or charging fees to hold extra classes outside the normal school day to subsidise low wages. Unregistered private colleges have been subject to frequent raids by the police and council officials. Some officials have demanded bribes to allow them to continue operating, teachers say. “Despite the setbacks, we are registering good results,” says Mabwe. “We have problems with authorities. The council and educational officials always harass us but at the end of the day we want the children to win. We want education to win. “We are passionate about teaching. There are several teachers, teaching as backyard schools but they are producing good results.” During lockdown, the government wants pupils to learn through online classes and radio lectures, but internet access is considered a luxury and costs are prohibitive for poorer families. “Trying to conduct online lessons does not work,” says Moud Maenzanise, a teacher who has transformed her veranda into a teaching area for five students. “At times, a teacher needs physical contact with a student because [otherwise] you will be producing a half-baked student. “There is a need to assess the physiological capacity of the student and online lessons do not provide for that. We need to build the whole person, but we cannot do that online. Online lessons are for the affluent north, but here in the ghetto parents cannot afford that.” She adds: “We are always making sure that we are improving. We would like the government to give us the recognition, instead of having constant running battles with them. It’s an issue of over over-regulation.” Mernard Mapuke, who has turned his garage into a makeshift classroom, says thousands of children in townships risk dropping out of school. “Each time I talk to some of these children, I can tell they are no longer interested in school. The only solution is to help them in their homes while we wait to return to school. If not, we are breeding a very dangerous society,” says Mapuke. “There is absolute poverty here … but we want the ghetto child to understand that education will end endemic poverty, which is associated with the ghetto. We always instil in them a culture of believing in themselves. Therefore, we need to conduct these lessons,” he says. But the president of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), Raymond Majongwe, described the schoolteachers setting up home schools as “bad apples” who were exposing children to Covid-19. “The real tragedy is that quality assurance becomes a problem in these schools. But a vacuum has been created by the closure of schools, so people are responding to that. Even bad apples find themselves also teaching,” says Majongwe. “We need proper systems. This is the reason why hospitals cannot just open everywhere, the education system should be like that also. These backyard schools cannot be the solution.” Majongwe urged the government to address teachers’ grievances over pay and conditions to ensure better exam results this year. Teachers in Zimbabwe are paid the equivalent of $50 a month. Last year, they downed tools over pay and a lack of personal protective equipment at schools. Mabwe has vowed to continue running the college in the tent at his home. “These backyard schools are their pupils’ only hope.”",Global education; Global development; Coronavirus; World news; Zimbabwe; Africa,Global development
2020-11-27T06:00:18Z,Black public figures urge airlines not to carry out Home Office deportation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/27/black-public-figures-urge-airlines-not-to-carry-out-home-office-deportation,"Eighty-two black public figures have written to airlines who have worked on deportation charter flights urging them not to carry up to 50 Jamaicans the Home Office wants to deport next week. Signatories include the author Bernardine Evaristo, model Naomi Campbell, historian David Olusoga and actors Naomie Harris and Thandie Newton, as well as lawyers, broadcasters and NGO chiefs. Leading Windrush campaigners including Michael Braithwaite and Elwaldo Romeo have also signed. The letter has been sent to six airlines known to have previously worked with the Home Office on deportation charter flights. It urges the airline chiefs to refuse to operate the flight on 2 December, the second Jamaica deportation flight this year, if they have been approached by the Home Office to do so, and to pause the operation of deportation flights to Commonwealth countries for the foreseeable future. They are calling on airlines that have previously operated these flights for the Home Office to state publicly that they will not operate next week’s flight. It is not known which airline the Home Office has engaged for it. Any airline that has agreed to transport the Jamaicans earmarked for deportation is urged to reconsider its position and to communicate this to government and the wider public. The public figures warned that if next week’s and other similar flights go ahead there is a risk of the unlawful removal of people who have the right to remain in the UK. One of the men deported from the UK to Jamaica on a charter flight in February 2020 was the grandson of a woman who arrived on the Empire Windrush and is still seeking to have his deportation order revoked. They added that the recent resignation of Alexandra Ankrah, the most senior black civil servant working on the Windrush compensation scheme, calls into question the Home Office’s competency to deal with the continuing injustices it has created. Concern is also expressed by the signatories about the fate of victims of trafficking. “The UK’s system for identifying victims of trafficking is in disarray, meaning that the government frequently seeks to deport people whose offences occurred by reason of their trafficking or forced labour,” the letter stated. It warned that some of those already detained and due to be deported on 2 December have physical scars and further evidence of being subjected to ill-treatment, or have had siblings killed in Jamaica, which puts them at grave risk if removed from the UK. “In an already challenging festive period … we ask you to reflect on whether the operation of this flight would comply with your corporate social responsibility values,” it stated. There is precedent for airlines ceasing to cooperate with the Home Office. In June 2018 Virgin Airlines announced that it would no longer be assisting the Home Office to deport people in the wake of the Windrush scandal. “We made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office. We believe this decision is in the best interest of our customers and people, and is in keeping with our values as a company,” the airline said in a statement at the time. The Home Office said: “We make no apology for seeking to remove dangerous foreign criminals to keep the public safe. Each week we remove foreign criminals from the UK to different countries who have no right to be here, this flight is no different. The people being detained for this flight include convicted murderers and rapists. “The UK only ever returns those who the Home Office and, where applicable, the courts are satisfied do not need our protection and have no legal basis to remain in the UK.”",Home Office; Immigration and asylum; Jamaica; UK news; Airline industry; Race,Politics
2021-02-09T06:30:04Z,Autism in India: how a pioneering jobs scheme is opening up opportunities,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/09/autism-in-india-how-a-pioneering-jobs-scheme-is-opening-up-opportunities,"Talking to people can be difficult for Rishabh Birla, but his last job demanded he did a lot of it. He has autism and finds making eye contact uncomfortable. For Birla, the rules of conversation are puzzling and he sometimes veers off course, alarming the other person. A 25-year-old postgraduate, Birla had been working at a cosmetics startup in Thane, not far from Mumbai. “The job involved communicating with different clients to keep track of their orders. It was exhausting to interact with so people every day,” he says. When he heard last year that Ernst &amp; Young (EY) was recruiting people with autism, learning disabilities, dyspraxia, Asperger’s syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to their Mumbai office, he applied. His decision was based more on wanting to experience a corporate recruitment process than any real expectation of securing a job, he says. After a specially designed process broken down into stages and spread over two months, Birla was offered a job as an analyst. “My family and I were elated. This is a major milestone in my life personally and professionally,” he says. The job offers to Birla and four others from a shortlist of 13 candidates were part of EY’s new initiative on neurodiversity, an umbrella term that refers to variations in neurocognitive functioning. Since EY pioneered recruitment of a neurodiverse workforce at its Philadelphia, US office in 2016, it has become more widely accepted within the company that neurodivergent individuals often have specialised contributions to make in the workplace, particularly in the booming sectors of artificial intelligence, robotics and process automation. Recruiting neurodivergent people is not about corporate social responsibility, but a business imperative. “We see a clear role for neurodiverse candidates in these areas,” says Amarpal Chadha, partner at EY’s People Advisory Services. “These individuals are often technologically inclined and detail-oriented, with strong skills in analytics, mathematics, pattern recognition and information processing – among the very skills businesses most urgently need.” When the impact of the first neurodivergent recruits to the Philadelphia office was assessed, their efficiency and productivity were comparable to those of other employees. But they were much better at innovation. One group identified improvements that cut the time for technical training in half, automating processes much more quickly. In one project, the perspective brought by a neurodiverse team was estimated to save 800 hours. In another, the combined time savings and quality improvements generated around $100,000 (£73,000) in cost savings. Projects expected to take up to five weeks were finished in three days. EY India adapted every step of the recruitment process to match the needs of neurodivergent candidates and gauge their potential. Informal and unscripted chats replaced a standard interview, allowing candidates to demonstrate their abilities in a more relaxed setting and over a longer period of time. At every stage, the process was paused to ensure a question had been understood. If not, it was rephrased. Instructions were given in clear, straightforward language. “The normal recruitment process here takes about a week – a series of interviews, including one with HR, one with the technical team and another with a partner,” Chadha says. “This had to be slowed right down. Each interview had to be broken up into segments to give candidates enough time to absorb and reflect. The process of hiring took two months instead of a week.” EY changed its technical assessment. “Instead of determining what specific knowledge and skills [candidates] had, we switched to broadly discovering how strong their aptitude was for learning new things,” Chadha says. Birla said he appreciated the extent to which the process had been customised. “It was supportive and patient. I felt EY understood my needs and heard my views as a neurodivergent person,” he says. According to the World Health Organization, one in 160 children globally have an autism spectrum disorder, and disproportionately high numbers of adults are unemployed. Action for Autism estimates that 18 million Indians are on the autistic spectrum, and jobs for this group are hard to come by. “The effort can collapse at the first hurdle – the interview. But we are working with some large companies and multinationals to encourage and support them in finding roles and we’re seeing progress,” says Preeti Siwach of Action for Autism. Pardeep Sharma, 25, lives in Delhi and used to visit the Action for Autism centre in Jasola, to learn soft skills. Siwach helped him to find work in housekeeping at a hotel chain before the pandemic struck. “He is a school leaver and I never expected him to get a job. If only more companies would realise that people with autism have something to offer. They can learn [and] they deserve an opportunity,” says his father, Sunil Sharma. Chadha says he has found that some of EY’s clients are intrigued by the new initiative. “Among our clients, in their own families they know of someone, a relative or a friend, with autism. They were keen to understand our policy and some have started replicating it,” he says.

2021-02-06T16:00:46Z,Forget Zuckerberg and Cook's hypocrisy – it's their companies that are the real problem,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/06/mark-zuckerberg-tim-cook-facebook-apple-problem,"Hypocrisy,” wrote Somerset Maugham, “is the most difficult and nerve-racking vice that any man can pursue; it needs an unceasing vigilance and a rare detachment of spirit. It cannot, like adultery or gluttony, be practised at spare moments; it is a whole-time job.” It is indeed, which is why many corporate leaders sometimes seem to struggle to find time for their day jobs – being chief executives. Here for example is Mark Zuckerberg the other day on a regular call with stock market analysts. “Our goal,” he declared, “is to give every individual entrepreneur and small business access to the same kinds of tools that historically only the big companies have had access to. One of the things I’m most proud of is that we build the tools so we can offer these same capabilities to small businesses, often for free. So when you hear people say that we hold a lot of data, that’s because hundreds of millions of businesses that would have otherwise had to do this individually and would have had no easy way of doing so are now using our services to help them reach customers. When you hear people say that we’re connecting data from lots of sources, that’s to help small businesses reach customers more efficiently.” Awww, shucks. Facebook holds gazillions of exabytes of data just so that it can help mom-and-pop businesses. Who knew? But now here’s Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, who doesn’t buy it. In his speech to this year’s Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference on 28 January, he said that “At a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement – the longer the better – and all with the goal of collecting as much data as possible. Too many are still asking the question, ‘How much can we get away with?’, when they need to be asking, ‘What are the consequences?’ What are the consequences of not just tolerating, but rewarding content that undermines public trust in life-saving vaccinations?” Cook doesn’t mention Facebook or Google, of course, though they are the companies he has in mind. But hang on – doesn’t Apple accept between $8bn and $12bn a year from Google for the privilege of making Google the default search engine on iPhones and iPads? In other words, as Ben Thompson points out in his Stratechery newsletter, accepting “money that is derived from the exact sort of advertising practices that Cook is decrying in his speech.” And so it goes on. Zuckerberg (who owns WhatsApp) ranted about “competitors who make claims about privacy that are often misleading”. Which competitors? Ah: Apple, whose “iMessage stores non-end-to-end encrypted backups of your messages by default unless you disable iCloud, so Apple and governments have the ability to access most people’s messages. So when it comes to what matters most – protecting people’s messages, I think that WhatsApp is clearly superior.” Which seems odd given the recent exodus from WhatsApp since Facebook announced some changes in the way data would be handled in future. Cook retorts by pointing out the way he stood up to the FBI after the 2015 San Bernardino shootings. These kinds of exchanges have become par for the tech course as public unease about the companies’ power has grown. In that context, the self-serving guff that senior executives routinely exhale looks awfully like hypocritical cant. Zuckerberg and Cook may well not be hypocrites for all I know, but viewing them through that moralistic lens is counterproductive: it directs our attention on to their personalities rather than on to the giant corporations that they run. And it is those corporations that lie at the root of our problems with digital technology. A few years ago, during a period when there was much heated anxiety about “superintelligence” and the prospects for humanity in a world dominated by machines, the political theorist David Runciman gently pointed out that we have been living under superintelligent AIs for a couple of centuries. They’re called corporations: sociopathic, socio-technical machines that remorselessly try to achieve whatever purpose has been set for them, which in our day is to “maximise shareholder value”. Or, as Milton Friedman succinctly put it: “The only corporate social responsibility a company has is to maximise its profits.” Given that, it doesn’t really matter whether those who sit at the top of giant tech corporations are saints, sinners or merely liars and hypocrites. Facebook could be staffed entirely by clones of St Francis of Assisi and it would still be a toxic organisation, relentlessly pushing to achieve the purpose assigned to it by Professor Friedman. So if we want to make things better, our focus has to be changing the machine’s purpose and obligations, not on trying to persuading its helmsman to attend to the better angels of his nature.

2019-10-08T16:30:25Z,To BP or not BP … Would Shakespeare have taken oil company money?,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shortcuts/2019/oct/08/bp-shakespeare-rsc-mark-rylance-simon-callow,"What, as Falstaff might say, a lot o’ ’pother. The Royal Shakespeare Company made waves last week by announcing that it would no longer take sponsorship from BP – ending a controversy that has dragged on longer than the most agonised production of Hamlet. Three years ago, Tate became the first major arts organisation to distance itself from the energy giant, leading to calls for others to clean up their act. Activists mounted protests and stage invasions. In the summer, Mark Rylance disassociated himself from the RSC, claiming that, if the Bard had any say in the matter, he would turn his back on dirty money too. Last week, the company finally caved. Applause all round? Not exactly. Writing in the Times, Rylance’s fellow Shakespearean Simon Callow has delicately pointed out that the Bard’s own hands weren’t exactly clean. Not only did the playwright and his colleagues take money from the dictatorial regime of King James I, they contentedly played at court for the monarch and his cronies, few of whom were fussy about human rights. Shakespeare’s troupe even renamed itself in honour of the new monarch, becoming the King’s Men almost immediately after James took power in 1603. Shakespeare was hardly a model of corporate social responsibility; he was a canny operator with an instinct for what would fly – whether to get bums on seats (he earned a share of the profits in his theatres), or by cosying up to powerful folk. Early in his career he managed to offend the influential Oldcastle family with a reference in one of his plays. Rather than risk annoying them further, he rushed through a rewrite. Other playwrights at the time landed in prison, or with their noses slit. Much later, Shakespeare was one of the landowners implicated in plans to throw poor farmers off common fields in Stratford-upon-Avon. He also had a zest for suing people, especially if his own money was involved. No wonder a Smithsonian article published a few years back is headlined “William Shakespeare, Gangster”. But Shakespeare was also sharp enough to have things both ways. One of the plays he wrote for James I, Macbeth, notionally flatters his new boss’s Scottish lineage – but the story of a blood-crazed Scot who murders his way to the throne is hardly the most flattering of mirrors. And then there is King Lear, first performed at court on Boxing Day 1606: the heartwarming yarn of a monarch who falls out with his family and advisers, then loses his wits and wanders naked in the wilderness. Merry Christmas, your maj! Did the present-day RSC have the nerve to speak truth to its paymasters quite so brazenly, rather than just walking away?

2021-02-12T01:19:14Z,Ties with Myanmar military put pressure on western companies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/12/ties-with-myanmar-military-put-pressure-on-western-companies,"Western companies are facing growing calls to break ties with businesses run by Myanmar’s military after last week’s coup threatened to cast the impoverished south-east Asian country back into full-blown dictatorship. The Japanese drinks company Kirin Holdings has announced it will abandon its involvement with a Myanmar brewery after a six-year partnership because of its close links to the military. Many western firms rushed back into the country to seize commercial opportunities presented by the opening up of a country of 55 million people after the return of democracy. But as the generals try to turn the screw on opposition, activists are criticising oil and gas companies that have set up highly profitable joint ventures with the Myanmar’s military chiefs to exploit mineral resources. French oil and gas company Total owns 31.24% of the Yadana offshore gas field while the US company Chevron owns 28% through a subsidiary. The rest is shared with a Thai company and the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE). The latter has an opaque structure, does not publish accounts and does not have a website, leading to accusations that revenues may not reach the public coffers and could instead be controlled by corrupt officials and the military. The National Resource Governance Institute, a not-for-profit organisation based in New York that monitors how nations use their mineral wealth, said that in 2013-14 only 880m Myanmar kyat ($600,000) of MOGE’s revenues were transferred to the ministry of finance out of a total of 1.3tn ($926bn). The rest was placed in “other accounts” where the funds are kept off-budget and beyond scrutiny. Total reported that it handed over €229.6m ($257m) to the Myanmar authorities in 2019, making it one of the biggest sources of revenue for a government wholly controlled as of last week by the military. “We call on all oil and gas companies to end their relationship with Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise and exit our country,” said Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for Justice For Myanmar. “Every day they stay in production they are earning much needed revenue for the military regime, fuelling brutal repression. We call on Total, Chevron and all other oil and gas companies to act now and stand with the people of Myanmar. If they continue business as usual we will hold you responsible for the brutality that the military inflicts on the people.” Total was not available for comment but its website says that since expanding into Myanmar in 1992 it has set up a “far-reaching corporate social responsibility program” targeting education, public health, job creation, micro-finance and access to energy. A Chevron spokesperson said it conducted its business in a “responsible manner, respecting the law and universal human rights to benefit the communities where we work. We support the people of Myanmar on their journey to a modern, peaceful, and prosperous nation. We are monitoring the situation closely and hope for a peaceful resolution through dialogue.” Many foreign companies, including leading British companies such as Unilever and Prudential, operate in Myanmar without doing business with the military. But the issue is a complex one, Australia’s former ambassador to the country said, and the urge to condemn some businesses should not obscure the fact that many had done trying to build human rights since the return of democracy. Christopher Lamb, who chairs the Australian Myanmar Institute, said it was “easy to take on a mining company but we have to look beyond that”. “It’s sometimes difficult to measure what they’re doing, but companies have contributed to opening up and transparency. They have helped to bring Myanmar into the fabric of international business,” he said. The military’s seizure of power on 1 February, along with the detention of the democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint from her National League for Democracy party, has provoked a furious backlash on the streets of Myanmar. After three days of public protests, organised despite an internet blackout imposed on the country, the military responded with a curfew but demonstrators took to the streets again on Tuesday in defiance of the ban. Pro-democracy activists have called for the outside world to put pressure on the generals and the US president, Joe Biden, has threatened to resume sanctions following the military coup. The pressure has already been enough for Kirin to withdraw from the troubled country, whose treatment of its minority Muslim Rohingya people was declared genocide by the UN in 2018. Kirin, the multinational owner of beer brands such as Kirin and XXXX, was one of the first global companies into the once-hermetic state after the first free elections in a generation in 2015, taking a controlling stake in both Myanmar Brewery and Mandalay Brewery in partnership with Myanma Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL). Bernstein Research valued Kirin’s stake in the joint ventures at between US$1.4bn and US$1.7bn. But it was always a difficult marriage: MEHL is controlled by the country’s repressive military and a UN investigation has found the company is overseen by the coup leader, senior general Min Aung Hlaing. Min Aung Hlaing was the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military when it waged its 2017 campaign against the Rohingya. He has been individually sanctioned by both the US and UK. In a statement Kirin said: “Given the current circumstances we have no option but to terminate our current joint-venture partnership with Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Limited, which provides the service of welfare fund management for the military.” The Amnesty International Australia campaigner Tim O’Connor said: “It’s only a shame it took a military coup d’etat for them to finally move on what was always a venture that delivered huge sums of money to Myanmar military and their leaders who are accused of the gravest human rights violations.”",Myanmar; Business; South and central Asia; World news; Myanmar coup,World news
2020-11-27T06:00:18Z,How the Covid vaccine success can fuel a sustainable UK economic recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/27/covid-vaccine-success-sustainable-economic-recovery-britain,"Most parents taking their children on a long road trip know this well. The excitement our kids feel about the destination is not necessarily matched by how they behave during the journey. This, along with how we respond, impacts how everyone feels at the destination. Like all of you, I am delighted about the remarkable progress in Covid-19 vaccine development. The light at the end of the dark tunnel is now shining a lot brighter after too many tragic deaths, crippling hospital admissions and endless disruptions to our normal lives. Yet we are not at our destination. The next few months have a material impact on our longer-term wellbeing. Most western democracies continue to struggle in striking the balance between public health, normal economic/social interactions, and individual freedoms. The inadvertent result is a serially inconsistent set of policy reactions. The UK’s initial resistance to lockdowns gave way to widescale restrictions to counter the threat facing the NHS. As infections fell, the policy pendulum swung to encouraging economic interactions, including the “Eat out to help out” scheme. The use of a more refined tier-based system to address the subsequent worsening in public health gave way to lockdown 2.0. As tempting as it is to point the finger at government mismanagement, a good part of the blame lies with us all. Even with better information about virus transmission, personal behaviours have insufficiently aligned assessments of individual risks with those faced by the community. The longer this mismatch continues, the more disappointed we will be in the destination. The key is to evolve a public/private effort that simultaneously progresses in five areas: Relief With Covid being the great unequaliser, the most vulnerable segments of our society are experiencing devastating erosions in health, livelihoods, and future opportunities. Policies need to be refocused to achieve more targeted and better monitored outcomes, accompanied by bolder redistribution efforts. Companies and households that have benefited need to join by stepping up more to their social responsibility. It’s the right thing to do and in their longer-term interest – not just to pre-empt a difficult future reckoning but also because it’s hard to stay a good house in an increasingly challenged neighbourhood. Living with Covid With infections declining, it is time to implement widescale pool testing and better contact tracing. More strategic, frequent and consistent communication needs to replace what too many regard as confusing messaging. Supported by greater individual responsibility, we can and should all take greater ownership for collective health and livelihoods. The next three areas ensure that what comes after vaccine dissemination is not disappointment. Too many will emerge out of the Covid tunnel with sharply depleted financial and mental resilience, and to an extent that was unthinkable just a year ago. Moreover, the UK’s political union is being tested. Already, the government is running record levels of debt, deficits and borrowings. The Bank of England’s balance sheet is bloated beyond recognition. Corporate leverage is high. Lower-income households have virtually no cushions. Unless economic activity bounces back quickly, durably and inclusively, the devastating impact of this year’s 10% plus contraction in economic activity will have a long tail, adding financial and political instability to what already is too long a list of woes. Upgrading human and physical capital The chancellor’s statement this week is a first step in this direction, including measures to modernise infrastructure and enhance worker retooling and retraining. We also need well-designed public-private partnerships, with big tech companies assuming greater ownership for productively countering the growing sense of marginalisation and alienation that is eating away at the fabric of our society. Household insecurity Among those having lost job security, some will find it very hard to recover. Those able to get back on their feet will be inclined to make sure that they and their families never find themselves wondering again how they will afford their next meal. Yet one person’s increased savings is another’s loss of income, undermining the demand engine that the economy needs to propel it forward. Governments and companies have a role to play in better aligning the two. Sustainability Coming into Covid, we had paid insufficient attention to the detrimental effects of the climate crisis, worsening inequality, insufficient corporate social responsibility, governance, and artificial financial stability. The post Covid-reset allows us to ensure that everything we do is consistent with fighting these secular menaces, either directly or through timely compensatory requirements. The promising vaccine news suggests we are closer to winning the war against Covid. By quickly embracing a set of five mutually reinforcing (and feasible) actions, this victory can be a prelude to a durable peace of robust and inclusive growth, true sustainability, genuine financial stability; and social wellbeing.

2021-05-30T20:00:03Z,"The $3bn bargain: how China dominates Pacific mining, logging and fishing ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/the-3bn-bargain-how-china-dominates-pacific-mining-logging-and-fishing,"One country dominates the Pacific’s resources extraction. Guardian analysis of trade data has revealed that China received more than half the total tonnes of seafood, wood and minerals exported from the region in 2019, a haul worth $3.3bn that has been described by experts as “staggering in magnitude”. The country’s mass extraction of resources comes as China has deepened its connections with governments across the region, amid a soft power push that sees it rivalling the influence of the US and Australia in the Pacific. China took more by weight of these resources from the Pacific than the next 10 countries combined, with experts saying China “would easily outstrip” other countries, including Australia, when it comes to “gross environmental impact of its extractive industries”. Data analysis reveals the extent of China’s appetite for Pacific natural resources. In 2019 China imported 4.8m tonnes of wood, 4.8m tonnes of mineral products, and 72,000 tonnes of seafood from the Pacific. The next single largest customer for the Pacific’s extractive resources was Japan, which imported 4.1m tonnes of minerals – mostly petroleum - 370,000 tonnes of wood and 24,000 tonnes of seafood. Australia imported 600,000 tonnes of minerals, 5,000 tonnes of wood and 200 tonnes of seafood. Shane Macleod, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, says that China is such a dominant customer of Pacific resources because of its proximity to the region and its need to power its economy. “They just have the appetite. They have the need for natural resources and they’re looking for sources and the Pacific is geographically close. It has the added benefit that the supply lines are shorter,” he said. “So you can look at the Ramu nickel mine in Papua New Guinea. That is providing raw material for China in the region, directly, without having to be transported from the other side of the planet.” From Solomon Islands, more than 90% of extractive resources go to China when measured by weight. And China regularly claims more than 90% of the total tonnes of wood exported by Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. Beyond direct imports of resources, data from the American Enterprise Institute shows more than US$2bn was invested by Chinese companies in Pacific mining in the past two decades. These include investments in the controversial Porgera, Ramu Nickel and Frieda River mines in PNG. The Chinese government has also sent billions of dollars in official finance into the region, including tens of millions for new marine and industrial zones. Comparing the Pacific’s exports China is the Pacific’s biggest customer whether measured by weight or US dollars. But Australia is close behind when measured in value – $2.8bn to China’s $3.3bn in 2019. This is due to the fact that many extractive products are heavy but relatively inexpensive commodities, like wood. “In terms of the gross environmental impact of its extractive industries, China would easily outstrip other industrial nations that operate in the Pacific region, including Australia,” says Prof Bill Laurance from James Cook University in north Queensland. “China’s mineral, timber, fossil fuel, food and other imports from Pacific Island nations are staggering in magnitude. They’re creating enormous challenges for sustainable development in the region.” ‘High-risk timber producers’ Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga and Palau all regularly send more than 90% of their wood exports to China. China’s size doesn’t neatly explain this concentration, as it takes less than 10% of the wood exported by Malaysia, a much larger producer. Malaysian companies also dominate logging in PNG and Solomon Islands. According to some estimates, illegal timber makes up as much as 70% of logs exported from Solomon Islands. As a very large and nearby country, China is a natural customer for the Pacific’s exports. But experts say the outsized take also has to do with China’s lack of laws against importing illegal timber, and poor accountability for environmental or social impacts. “Both [Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands] suffer from entrenched endemic corruption that has made it (so far) impossible to hold to account both the logging industry and the politicians profiting from them,” says Lela Stanley, a policy adviser at the NGO Global Witness. “They are known high-risk timber producers, and countries with more stringent laws on illegal timber should avoid them accordingly. Currently China has no law explicitly forbidding the import of illegally produced timber.” The logging that takes place in the region has huge impacts on communities. “Most of those logs have been produced illegally, often … through the violation of land rights. This is not an abstract concept in PNG but one with real-life impacts for countless people across the country. Most rural communities depend directly on their land and forests for at least some of their needs. When that forest vanishes, or is stolen, the impacts are severe.” While China’s new forest law, which came into effect in July 2020, aims to promote sustainable trade of timber, as well as to safeguard China’s forests, there are still concerns about some companies’ practices. “Even if the laws and rules change, it will take time and effective enforcement before the companies change behaviour,” Stanley says. Foreign-flagged fishing vessels Fishing is a huge source of income for many small Pacific nations. But they largely haven’t been able to capture the full value of this resource. Apart from Fiji, Pacific nations haven’t been able to move up the value chain into the processing of fish into more valuable products. Kiribati, for instance, receives up to 75% of its government revenue from fishing access fees and levies. But Kiribati directly exports very little – just 1,000 tonnes of seafood were exported to China in 2019. Foreign-flagged vessels, meanwhile, landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish in Kiribati waters. A survey of boats operating in the Pacific in 2016 found that Chinese-flagged vessels far outstripped those of any other country. China had 290 industrial vessels licensed to operate in the region at the time, more than a quarter of the total, and more than the 240 from all the Pacific nations combined. Outside of PNG, little of the offshore fishing in the Pacific is conducted by locally flagged ships. Rather, local fishing is concentrated in coastal waters. There are highly valuable species in these waters, according to Dr Hugh Govan at the University of the South Pacific, such as sea cucumbers. But Govan says many coastal fisheries are overfished or commercially extinct. The main market for sea cucumbers is southern China, but these were overfished to such a degree in PNG that the government had to halt fishing for several years. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, says China is “a responsible fishing country”, with “‘zero tolerance’ for violations of relevant laws and regulations committed by distant fishing vessels”. “We have … strengthened international cooperation, and done a great deal of fruitful work in jointly combating illegal fishing and promoting the sustainable development of fishery resources with other countries.” Mining disasters and scrutiny Measured by weight, Solomon Islands sends almost all of its mineral products to China, much of it aluminium ore. Minerals account for more than 90% of the value of PNG’s total exports, and it sends just over 30% by weight to China. Australia is also deeply involved in mining in PNG – controlling many of the largest mines, and importing $2.5bn of gold in 2019. Australia takes almost 100% of the gold from Fiji and about 80% from PNG. But when measured in weight these pale compared with the minerals exported to China. But the Lowy Institute’s Shane McLeod, argues that a significant difference between Chinese and Australian trading partners is how accountable companies are held for environmental and social issues. Large-scale mining operations in PNG have a horrific environmental track record, including disposal of mining waste at Anglo-Australian BHP’s Ok Tedi mine, at Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto’s Panguna and, more recently, at the Chinese-operated Ramu Nickel mine. Many foreign-owned companies have subsequently withdrawn from projects that have proven environmentally ruinous. “But Chinese companies operating abroad aren’t subjected to scrutiny from their home markets in the same way as companies from western nations are,” McLeod said. “Ok Tedi is a good example – the environmental disaster was a cause of major embarrassment for [BHP], with scrutiny from media eventually fed through to investors.” “Companies with a Chinese listing/investors do face pressure and scrutiny, but I think the way that manifests itself is opaque and unseen. It’s not clear to what extent an environmental issue would limit the operations of a resource project, for example. “I expect feedback for MCC [the Metallurgical Corporation of China, the operator of Ramu Nickel] comes through a political/governmental channel rather than, say, a journalist from China covering the environmental impact of a mine there.” China’s foreign ministry did not reply to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Last year the PNG government cancelled the mining lease of the part-Chinese owned Porgera mine, claiming that the country was not getting its fair share of major natural resource projects. The Chinese joint venture partner, Zijin Mining, “has flagged international political ramifications, warning the lease dispute could damage bilateral relations between [PNG] and China”. The next test of corporate social responsibility may be on the horizon, with proposed mines from both Australian and Chinese companies in PNG facing pushback for environmental and cultural reasons. Notes and methods Guardian Australia’s trade flow dataset was constructed using the 2019 version of the BACI database created by CEPII. The BACI database was in turn created using UN Comtrade data, directly reported by each country. Goods in the BACI database were identified using the HS17 version of the Harmonized System Codes. The Guardian classified goods as “seafood products”, “wood products” or “oil, metal and mineral products” based on keywords in the Harmonised System Codes. Aggregate trade flows were calculated by grouping data by exporter, importer and the category assigned by the Guardian.

2020-10-13T15:52:57Z,JCB challenged over machinery used to demolish Palestinian homes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/12/jcb-challenged-over-machinery-used-to-demolish-palestinian-homes,"The British heavy machinery firm JCB’s sale of equipment used in the destruction of Palestinian villages in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is being examined by a UK government body to determine whether its due diligence process complies with human rights guidelines set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The case is likely to test the degree to which multinationals are responsible if their export goods are sold by local distributors in ways that potentially infringe human rights. JCB, which has donated millions of pounds to the Conservative party and at least £25,000 to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign, can now enter into government-overseen mediation with the NGO that made the claim or it can outright contest the claim. The claim was launched by Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights last December after JCB refused to communicate with the lobby group over claims that its tractors were being used to tear up Palestinian villages. The little-known complaints procedure was set up in 2000 and is designed to give an avenue to press multinationals to abide by their corporate social responsibility undertakings as set out by the OECD. The National Contact Point quango, a subsidiary of the Foreign Office that oversees the complaints, issued a statement on Monday. It said that after examining the Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights complaint and hearing JCB’s rebuttal, it deemed that JCB had a case to answer in relation to some claims and that the issue fell within its remit. The chair of JCB is Anthony Bamford, a Conservative peer. The company gave Johnson £25,000 for his leadership campaign. Overall the firm has given the Conservatives more than £10m since 2010, according to the Electoral Commission. JCB had defended itself to the National Contact Point by saying that it simply sold its equipment to a third-party Israeli distributor, Comasco, and therefore had no responsibility over what was done with the equipment thereafter. It said it could not be sure that equipment that it had sold to Comasco had been used in the destruction of Palestinian villages or the construction of new illegal settlements. It added that its equipment was also used positively in the construction of hospitals, schools and roads. But the Palestinian legal group said Palestinian Bedouin communities in area C of the occupied West Bank were particularly vulnerable to demolitions and displacement in violation of their human rights. The OECD guidelines require firms to seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts directly linked to its business operations and products by a business relationship. It also asks them to have a policy commitment to respect human rights, and to carry out human rights due diligence. The director of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, Tareq Shrourou, said: “We welcome this initial assessment and the UK National Contact Point’s acknowledgment that there are serious human rights issues raised by our complaint under the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises which warrant mediation or thorough investigation. “JCB’s apparent failure to address the material and prolific use of its products in demolition and displacement incidents that cruelly impacts Palestinian families, and also its use in settlement-related construction which creates pervasive human rights violations, must cease immediately. “We look forward to constructively engaging with JCB and expect it will do the right thing by complying with its human rights responsibilities.” JCB said: “We are very pleased that the UK NCP has dismissed at the earliest opportunity any suggestion that JCB is involved in, or causes or contributes towards any human rights abuses whatsoever. There was no basis for the Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights to make their complaint alleging this. “As an organisation JCB does not condone any form of human rights abuse and we have a consistent record of providing urgent and substantial support in response to natural disasters around the world. “While the NCP will now examine JCB’s human rights due diligence process, it has made clear that its decision to do so is not a finding against JCB and does not mean that it considers that JCB has acted in any way inconsistently with the OECD guidelines. We welcome the opportunity of engaging further with the NCP on these matters.” JCB also pointed out that the NCP did not consider that the information provided by LPHR “demonstrated that JCB has caused or contributed to the issues raised”. • This article was amended on 13 October 2020 to clarify the text of the NCP’s initial assessment of the complaint against JCB and to add a comment from JCB in response to it.",JCB; Business; Palestinian territories; Israel; Middle East and north Africa; UK news; World news; Human rights; Law,Business
2020-12-02T16:30:34Z,Independent W-League has golden opportunity to lead the way on equal pay | Samantha Lewis,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/03/independent-w-league-has-golden-opportunity-to-lead-the-way-on-equal-pay,"“The W-League has missed the boat.” That is the sentiment floating around Australian women’s football circles as one of the game’s most challenging years stumbles to a close. Broadcast revenue is down, pre-Covid attendances had flat-lined, the NWSL has decided to strike out on its own, and the Matildas – who were central to the blueprint for the W-League’s future – have all but disappeared, lured to Europe by better wages, longer seasons and more competitive match minutes. So where does this leave the W-League? How does it fit into the rapidly-evolving women’s club landscape? What more, if anything, can it offer? The answer could lie, somewhat counter-intuitively, off the field. Contrary to public perception, the W-League is one of the most progressive women’s leagues when it comes to structural support for its athletes. It cannot compete with the massive wages, world-class facilities or brand prestige of Europe’s biggest clubs, but the W-League holds its own in other ways such as minimum salaries, increased medical and travel standards, income protection, health insurance, professional contracts and a maternity policy. In fact, when it comes to player empowerment and representation, Australia’s player’s union – Professional Footballers Australia – is one of the strongest and most effective in world football. They supported the Matildas in 2015 when they went on strike to protest contract insecurity and resource inequality; negotiated the W-League’s first collective bargaining agreement in 2017 as well as its renewal in 2019; and helped close the pay gap between the Matildas and the Socceroos last year. This sort of off-field support is markedly different from the nations and leagues the W-League is competing against. Spain’s top women’s league, for example, was paused in November last year after players went on strike to push for their first ever CBA, while the NWSL – whose union was not legally recognised until late 2018 – does not have a league CBA at all. On the international level, the US women’s national team continues to fight US Soccer after their equal pay lawsuit was denied, though they have this week reached an agreement for equal work conditions. Australia, meanwhile, is one of just six other nations – England, Brazil, Norway, Finland, Iceland and New Zealand – already with a form of equal pay for its national team players. It is here, then, that the W-League can be world leaders. While it may never compete with the on-field standards of rival leagues, Australia could stay globally competitive in another way: by offering the best off-field support and conditions for women athletes, including potentially becoming the first football league in the world to offer equal pay. The idea is not without precedent, albeit in different forms and codes. In 2017, for example, Lewes FC – a semi-professional, community-owned club in England – became the first in the world to split their resources equally between their men’s and women’s senior teams. That same year, Cricket Australia announced the same base rate of pay across its elite players; an investment that is now paying dividends in the form of sold-out stadiums and high viewing figures for the domestic seasons. In fact, Australian football already has the structural elements in place to make equal pay a reality. In 2019, a clause was added to the leagues’ CBA renewal which saw the introduction of a “same base pay for same base work” principle, where A-League and W-League players would earn the same minimum hourly rate as each other. However, the short length of the W-League season means that women players earn less than half of their A-League colleagues because they play less than half the number of games. But if the long-term plans of Australia’s newly-independent professional clubs – namely a 16-team, 30-round W-League – are realised, this “same hourly rate” principle (if it is carried into future CBAs) would ultimately result in equal pay. Instead of allowing it to be the consequence of other mechanisms, though, clubs could be ambitious by placing equal pay at the forefront of their new vision for the game. Indeed, in the lead-up to the 2023 Women’s World Cup – a bid which was based on gender equality principles – declaring equal pay as a guiding light for the W-League folds into the wider story that football is starting to tell about itself, where women are playing an increasingly important role both on and off the pitch. Equal pay for the W-League does not just make ethical or narrative sense, either; it also makes business sense. Major corporations and governments are hitching their wagons to the women’s sport train, pouring more money and resources than ever into the fledgling industry. For example, Football Australia this week announced today the addition of Priceline Pharmacy to its growing women’s football sponsorship group, which also now includes multi-billion-dollar companies like Cadbury and Pantene. At the other end of the financial scale, research suggests that consumers are increasingly attracted to sports clubs and leagues that engage in “corporate social responsibility,” or acting as vehicles for positive social change rather than, or alongside, simple profit-making exercises. Tapping into these national and international consumer trends could bring back the two key things that the game has struggled to retain in recent years – money and fans – while also potentially luring some of the world’s top players back to Australia in the process. So, while W-League may have watched the initial boat sail over the horizon, there is a much larger one headed its way. If Australia’s professional clubs still believe the league can be one of the world’s best, this may be the one it cannot afford to miss.",A-League Women; Women's football; Australia sport; Sport; Football,Football
2020-07-27T23:01:06Z,Sky Arts to become free to watch from September,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/28/sky-arts-to-become-free-to-watch-from-september,"Britain’s only television channel dedicated solely to arts and culture, Sky Arts, is to become free for everyone as part of what it said was a mission to “champion and celebrate creativity”. The channel has a dedicated, if sometimes niche, following and is available to Sky, Virgin Media and Talk Talk TV customers. That will change in September when it becomes available to all viewers at no cost. Sky Arts director, Philip Edgar-Jones, said the decision was motivated by a sense of corporate social responsibility rather than money or chasing viewers. Sky “is not as hard nosed” as some might think, he said. “There is a genuine desire to serve the public. I don’t get judged at Sky about viewing figures, I just don’t. That’s not why we exist.” Edgar-Jones said he wanted more people to watch the channel because it had a remit to make the arts more accessible. “There’s never been a stronger need or demand for the arts, nor a more important time to champion and celebrate creativity,” he said. Upcoming programme highlights will include a biography of the band the Style Council; an exploration of the life and works of Harold Pinter by his unlikely friend Danny Dyer; and a broadcast of one of English National Opera’s September drive-in performances of La Bohème. One of the channel’s most popular shows, Portrait Artist of the Year, returns with sitters who including Sir Trevor McDonald, singer Ray BLK and Normal People star Paul Mescal. In 2021 there will be a series bringing artists and communities together to create “the next great British landmark”. The channel also announced a series of £30,000 bursaries that will involve leading cultural figures supporting and mentoring diverse and emerging new artists. The arts and the people who work in the sector have been particularly badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Edgar-Jones said everyone involved had a part to play in helping the arts get back on their feet. “I think television has stepped up in a brilliant way during the crisis. The BBC’s culture in quarantine is marvellous, Grayson Perry’s Art Club absolutely brilliant, the National Theatre on YouTube, our own Portrait Artist of the Week where people have been joining in every Sunday. “Phase two is now helping people monetise their content.” Edgar-Jones said he saw Sky Arts as more than just a television channel. “A lot of what we do is not just about making TV, it is about creating new work which lives and breathes in communities and society in general. “We are in active discussions with artists across genres and we’re saying that TV could be your canvas, it could be your toolbox and you don’t have to make a programme. Do something weird and wonderful.” The change means many more people will be able to watch some of the channel’s most popular programmes and series including Treasures of the British Library, Tate Britain’s Great Art Walks and The South Bank Show, which it gratefully took over after it was cancelled by ITV after 33 years. Sky said the channel’s on-demand library of content would remain exclusively available to Sky and Now TV entertainment pass customers. • This article was amended on 28 July 2020. Sky Arts is not only available to Sky customers, as an earlier version said, but also to Virgin Media and Talk Talk TV customers.",Sky Arts; Television; Culture; Media; Television & radio,Media
2020-11-14T19:00:14Z,"Australian farm to hold 50,000 crocodiles for luxury Hermès goods questioned by animal welfare groups",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/15/australian-farm-to-hold-50000-crocodiles-for-luxury-hermes-goods-questioned-by-animal-welfare-groups,"The high-end French fashion brand Hermès wants to build one of Australia’s biggest crocodile farms in the Northern Territory that would hold up to 50,000 saltwater crocodiles to be turned into luxury goods such as handbags and shoes. But the proposal has come under fire from animal welfare groups, who say other fashion brands have moved away from using exotic animal skins on cruelty grounds. Advocates told Guardian Australia they had concerns about the welfare of the crocodiles, and that farming animals for luxury goods was “no longer fashionable.” The territory, a significant global supplier of crocodile skins, is already home to several crocodile farms owned by major fashion brands. Northern Territory crocodile industry figure Mick Burns is leading the proposal on a former fruit farm near Darwin purchased earlier this year by the company PRI Farming, of which he is a director. The NT government has already granted development approval for the project, with documents showing the farm would include an egg incubator laboratory, a hatchery, and growing pens, as well as wastewater treatment plants and a solar farm. According to documents submitted to the territory’s Environmental Protection Authority, the farm would employ 30 people and build from an initial 4,000 crocodiles to 50,000, which the ABC has reported would make it one of the biggest crocodile farms in Australia. An EPA statement to the Guardian said the project had been granted environmental approval, and that PRI had also indicated it would apply for a wildlife trade permit. Dr Jed Goodfellow, a senior policy officer at RSPCA Australia, said the society remained opposed to killing of any animal “where the purpose of their death is primarily to produce a non-essential luxury item like fur or skin”. He said the society was not aware of the details of animal welfare practices on the planned farm. But he said generally there were many welfare risks raised by crocodile farming in intensive conditions, “including injuries from close confinement, small individual penning arrangements, and the impacts of restraint and slaughter methods”. He said Australia’s national code of practice covering crocodile farming was “now over 10 years old and in need of review”. Nicola Beynon, of Humane Society International, said brands including Chanel, Mulberry and the owners of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger had adopted animal welfare policies “against using exotic animal skins such as crocodile”. “Consumers and fashion houses are walking away from animal cruelty as fast as they can,” she said. “It seems foolish to be investing in an industry that is no longer fashionable.” A 2017 report commissioned from Ernst &amp; Young by the NT government estimated the crocodile farming industry was worth $106m to the territory’s economy. It said NT’s crocodile skin producers “are known as ethical providers and have encouraged high-end fashion producers such as Hermès and Louis Vuitton to purchase local NT farms to secure their supply chain”. The report said crocodile eggs were harvested under licence from the wild, with juvenile crocodiles “nurtured to minimise stress and protect their skins”. The report said: “Finally, the premium end product, crocodile skins, then often ends up as some of the world’s most expensive and sought-after fashion accessories (handbags, shoes, purses and wallets) being worn in the finest establishments throughout the world with key markets in the United States and Europe.” Documents with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show PRI Farming is wholly owned by another Darwin-based company, which in turn is wholly owned by Hermès. Burns did not respond to a request for comment. Guardian Australia sent questions to Hermès and asked to speak to a representative, but did not get a response. A 2019 corporate social responsibility report from Hermès said the company owned three crocodile farms and “two hide processing and inspection sites” in Australia. The report said all the company’s crocodile farms were signed up to a best practices charter, and the company had worked across the industry to improve animal welfare standards which had been reviewed by a crocodile group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Hermès has an animal welfare policy which states: “The group has defined and implemented a very strict, science-based, animal welfare policy. This applies within its direct sphere of responsibility as well as for its external partners, with a specific supply-chain based approach.” In 2015, Burns helped the Northern Territory government develop a strategy to expand the region’s crocodile farming industry. That report said that in 2015 that Australia accounted for 60% of world trade in saltwater crocodile skins, with the territory responsible for two thirds of traded skins. Prof Grahame Webb, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature crocodile specialist group, told the Guardian crocodile farming had helped fund conservation efforts in the region. Webb said fashion houses had been “mercilessly attacked” by animal rights activists, but he said the companies had a “good story to tell”. “[Those companies] have to get more and more control over their supply chain so that they can guarantee the highest standards. “Hermès is a very conservative company – it’s them trying to do the right thing. Australia has an excellent reputation for its crocodile management program worldwide.” Webb said the scale of the new proposal from Burns suggested it would be able to produce about 15,000 crocodile skins a year. The harvesting of eggs from the wild population was sustainable, he said. Unregulated hunting of crocodiles in Australia drove numbers dangerously low until rules protecting them were introduced in the early 1970s, Webb has written. He said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the wild was now healthy and stable. “Our wild populations are full,” he said.",Crocodiles; Animal welfare; Northern Territory; Hermès; Australia news; Wildlife; Conservation; Fashion; Environment,Environment
2020-03-09T13:01:04Z,Mike Cannon-Brookes says staff will desert companies that do not speak out on social issues,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/10/mike-cannon-brookes-says-staff-will-desert-companies-that-do-not-speak-out-on-social-issues,"Company bosses need to speak out about environmental and social issues if they want to keep their staff and stay in business for the long term, Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-chief executive of Atlassian, said. Research done for Atlassian by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers showed almost a third of Australian and US workers were willing to quit their jobs if their employer acted in a way that did not align with their values. “The responsibility of business leaders to provide leadership in areas of the community and participate in leadership alongside government and other groups is something they should be aware of,” Cannon-Brookes said. The number of people willing to leave a company over its stance on social issues was “a lot higher than we expected across the generations”. “There’s a cost of inaction as much as there’s a cost of action here,” he said. Top issues for Australian workers were the cost of living, the long-running drought and access to healthcare. Mental health, the cost of healthcare, pollution and the climate crisis also featured heavily among workers surveyed in December, before the bushfire season hit its peak. “Anecdotally, and obviously in the media and other areas, climate change, long-term planning, listening to experts – there’s a lot of things that I think the horrific summer that we’ve had have highlighted in the minds of society in general,” Cannon-Brookes said. “People in society [whose] house was confronted by a bushfire emergency, they’re people that work in businesses. Businesses are collections of people; business leaders are people.” In the US, workers were most concerned with the cost of healthcare, the highest in the developed world at almost 17% of gross domestic product. Access to healthcare, mental health and poverty were among US workers’ top concerns, pushing environmental issues – including pollution and global heating – down the table. Cannon-Brookes has been outspoken calling for companies to take positions on economic and social issues. Grok Ventures, his and wife Annie’s private investment vehicle, has supported shareholder resolutions put forward by the activist group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, designed to put pressure on BHP to quit the Minerals Council. Cannon-Brookes said other business leaders often told him they agreed with his positions on social and environmental issues but felt they could never go public. “If we could remove some of the hesitation, the fear, some of the sense that this is going to be a negative thing for one’s business or one’s personal position, I think we’ll have better conversations as a whole,” he said. He slammed commentators who have called for business leaders to abandon social activism in favour of a narrower focus on generating returns for shareholders. “I’m not sure that the people who are theoretically commenting on returns to shareholders understand how returns to shareholders work,” he said. “Those returns are generated by the employees at some level in whatever business you are. “Attracting and retaining fantastic people is a non-trivial exercise in business nowadays. “There’s a huge correlation if you look at corporate social responsibility between profitable, sustainable businesses and those who care about their corporate social responsibility. “One of businesses’ goals is to stay in business, and to be a sustainable business you need to have fantastic people and take longer-term sustainable positions on a lot of issues.” He said the survey showed employees wanted their business leaders “not to hide in the corner when it comes to important issues for society at large”. PwC surveyed 1,300 Australian and 2,500 US workers across age groups and industries. A partner at PwC, Diane Rutter, said the research showed the risk of inaction for employers was high. “There is a vocal younger cohort or generation coming through the workplace that are personally engaged and quite vocal around societal issues, and their expectations of workplaces are equally high,” she said. Employers who thought they could ignore the data should also be aware there was a reward for taking action. “There’s a large portion of employees that agree that businesses known for speaking out on issues important to them are much more attractive as future employers,” she said. “We see that is significantly higher for Generation Z – so again, that generation coming through.”",Business; Climate crisis; Work & careers; Australia news; Guardian Careers; Mike Cannon-Brookes,Australia news
2021-08-26T05:00:39Z,A stunning second act! Meet the people who changed course in midlife – and loved it,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/26/a-stunning-second-act-meet-the-people-who-changed-course-in-mid-life-and-loved-it,"Alison Webster was once showing prospective students around the university where she was studying medicine when a sixth former said: “You’re so old – why are you even doing this?” Webster laughs at the memory, home after the end of a shift as an A&amp;E doctor. “I said, ‘When you go home, ask your mum if she likes her life. I bet there’s something your mum’s always wanted to do that she’s not had the opportunity to do because of you. Ask what her dreams were, and see if she has fulfilled them.’” Webster’s childhood dream was to be a doctor, but she didn’t do well in her A-levels, “so that got put to one side. But it was always in there.” She ran a music distribution company, but as she approached her 40s, the business was struggling and she had started to wonder what to do with the rest of her life. Was a career in medicine really out of reach? She looked into it, realised her A-level results wouldn’t matter because she had done well in an accountancy degree in her 30s, and applied to medical school. She started her medical degree at the age of 41. “I thought, I’ve probably got at least another 20 years of work so I might as well do something that makes more sense to me, rather than not stretching myself or enjoying it.’” Working through the pandemic has been “really difficult and emotional”, but she has thrived on the challenge. She says she doesn’t feel “brave” to have given up her former career (and says she was lucky to have a husband who earned enough to cover her seven years of study). “I just had to do it.” The pandemic has made many of us reevaluate our lives. One poll earlier this year found that three in five workers planned to make changes, either in the form of new qualifications and skills, or a total career change. Before, says Helen Tupper, CEO of Amazing If, a career development company, a common trigger was a life change or redundancy. Now, “as a result of Covid, people are unpacking their career more. I think it made people think, is this actually what I want to do? And if the answer is no, what else could I do?” The direction may not be obvious, but you can start to identify it, says the life coach Fiona Buckland. “You’ve got to take some time and space. You will not figure this stuff out in between your emails.” It doesn’t require a month-long sabbatical or even a week off – you could spend an hour a week, broken down into smaller chunks if necessary, for a bit of self-reflection. Buckland has a list of questions on her website that can help identify goals and values, but there are lots more online, she points out. “Questions like, what are you most proud of? What is the greatest service you’ve given? When do you feel most connected to yourself? People often start to think: what am I interested in? But it’s more important to think about your values, because they are your inner code. When you’re living your life according to your values, you feel aligned and when you don’t, that’s when you’re going to feel that kind of frustration or dissatisfaction. So a good thing to do is to think about a time you felt really alive.” Buckland gets her clients to do a visualisation exercise, imagining they are elderly and at the end of their life, and at a party to celebrate their achievements and the difference they’ve made. “As you go into this party, people come and thank you; what are they thanking you for? It tunes people in to what is meaningful. What would make a meaningful life, not always a happy one? It might be how you’re making a difference, and it doesn’t have to be world-changing stuff, it can be: ‘I really want to be there for my kids,’ or: ‘I want to make my neighbourhood a more beautiful place to live.’” To make a change requires courage (and some compassion, Buckland points out, because change can be difficult), but it can be done in smaller, regular steps rather than a giant leap. “That’s what makes change, not suddenly, ‘Right, I’m selling my house and running off.’” How do you know when it’s time? “You will feel it. There will be this kind of call,” says Buckland. “It might show up in dissatisfaction, or it might show up in excitement about something, so just listen out for it. The more that you are spending time with yourself, not distracted by phones and things like that, the more likely you are to hear that. You’re engaging different parts of your brain than the one that’s just reacting to everything, because it takes deeper thought, questions like: Where do I want to be in the next 10 years?” A callout to Guardian readers for this article revealed a range of changes for the better that people made in midlife, from losing weight to embracing new romantic relationships, or coming out as gay. It can be both frightening and exciting to embark on a second chapter, so who better to learn from than those who have done it? In her 20s, Elizabeth Hepworth was in a serious car accident that cut short her degree. She spent the next few years having reconstructive surgery on her face, and to save her sight (she lost her sight in one eye). She married, had three children and became “a Stepford wife. I was at home, supporting my husband in his career, looking after the family, vacuuming twice a day.” She was in her 30s when he walked out. “I sat at the bottom of the stairs and the children were howling around me, and – excuse my language – I thought, what the fuck am I going to do now?” Having to support herself for the first time in her life, she got a job at a solicitors’ office and, because she had some legal knowledge – her abandoned degree had been in English, French and law – she became a paralegal. She was given some simple conveyancing and divorce cases to work on. “I took to it like a duck to water,” Hepworth says. Then she went back to university to do a law degree. Her childhood dream was to be a barrister, but it would be a precarious self-employed position, so she became a solicitor, qualifying in her early 40s. In 2003, the chance came up to train as a barrister. “I absolutely grabbed it,” she says. By then, her children had grown up and she was “a bit more free. I thought, this is payback time – life is giving me my opportunity back again. It still sends shivers down my spine when I think about it – a sense of gratitude that fate had given me back something at the age of 55 that had been taken from me.” At 72, Hepworth is still working. “The one thing I would say to people is, do not consider age to be a barrier to do anything that you have always dreamed of,” she says. Making a change is “life-affirming. It is refreshing. You have a tremendous sense of self-renewal, which goes with your sense of self-achievement, and I would recommend it to anybody. I think older people have so much to offer because while we don’t have perhaps the physical tenacity, we have a great deal to offer in terms of life experience, which can be translated into helping others.” The pandemic was the driving force behind Robert Campbell’s decision to go from being a headteacher to a songwriter – that, and the heart attack he had had in 2019, at the age of 53. “I think it was directly linked to having a stressful job for all those years because I was actually quite fit – I did a two-hour fell run the week before.” He went back to work after five weeks, then coronavirus hit the country. Suddenly, working from home and with more time, he picked up his guitar and started playing between Zoom meetings, and coming up with songs. “The one regret I have in my life was not studying music at university,” he says. He decided that, after 30 years, he wouldn’t go back to teaching in September; this year he starts an MA in songwriting. It helps, he says, that he can rely on his partner’s salary (she is also a headteacher) and that his three children have grown up, with the youngest just graduating – many of the midlife life-changers I speak to have some financial stability and fewer caring responsibilities. Covid also made him reconsider what was important. With some part-time work, “I’m earning a 10th of what I earned, but if you’re prepared to accept compromise, then you probably can do things. Sometimes it’s our mindsets that hold us back, not practical issues. Fear. What will our friends say? What will our family say?” Be brave, he advises. “I don’t think life is: go to school, work 40 years, then you retire and wait to die. That age has gone, thankfully.” For Melanie de Castro Pugh, the trigger was getting a handle on her health. Like Alison Webster, she had wanted to be a doctor, “but I didn’t get into medical school so I studied biology instead”. In the middle of working towards a PhD, she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. “This was in 1998, and the management techniques weren’t anywhere near as good as they are now,” she says. She reluctantly had to give up her PhD and took a sales job, married, had a son and became a stay-at-home mother. A blanket ban that stopped people with insulin-managed diabetes from driving large vehicles was overturned in 2012, although individual ambulance services currently have their own policies and assessment processes around who is allowed to drive an ambulance. So, when her son was older, De Castro Pugh considered training as a paramedic. Her health had been a big obstacle to living her life to the full, but she started to manage it successfully through a very low-carbohydrate diet and an implanted insulin pump. She applied to Swansea University to do a paramedic science degree, and started in September 2019. “The first day I arrived, I was so thrilled to be back in that environment,” she says. “It was fantastic going to the library, being in lectures.” The pandemic put a stop to her university experience – though she continued to do placements – but she still loved it. Next month, she starts her first job. “I’m finally getting to do – at the ripe old age of 47 – what I’ve wanted to do since I was a little girl,” she says. “Never give up on your dreams just because life gets in the way.” Tupper, in her work as a careers development consultant (a business she started after a first career at Microsoft), advises people to “explore first, and build a bridge”. Doing your research means “you’re not making assumptions about a role that might not actually reflect the reality of it. You want to know that it’s going to be a good fit for your strengths and values.” Then, she says, “build a bridge, so it doesn’t feel like a giant leap into the unknown. Could you be mentored by somebody who does that role? Is there a side project you could do to give you some exposure to that?” Maureen Brettell did those things when she left her first career as a town planner. “I found that the reality was that I was standing in the middle of two people arguing about two inches where a fence line should be. I didn’t feel like I was doing anything to help people on the scale that I wanted to.” She had always wanted to be a teacher, so she spent time researching it, working at youth clubs and approaching schools to ask if she could volunteer before taking the leap and retraining. She is now headteacher of a school for young people with social, emotional and mental health needs, and loves it. “It’s the job satisfaction, actually feeling that my efforts are making a difference to people.” In her school, particularly, “these young people have so many things that have gone on in their lives, so many traumas, disadvantages; their little shoulders are bearing so much weight. Creating an environment where they can let go of that, I can look back every day and think I’ve given them a few hours where they felt safe, happy, wanted and loved.” Brettell thinks it is important not to make a change “on the spur of the moment. Think carefully, weigh up the pros and cons. Do your research, talk to different people – some will have had positive experiences, but it’s more important to seek out anyone who isn’t enjoying it because they will be able to give you a more balanced view.” Margot also found more meaning in teaching, having worked as an auditor at a publishing company. As part of the company’s corporate social responsibility programme, she volunteered to be a reading mentor for children in deprived areas of central London, and that soon became the highlight of her week. She started teacher training in her 30s. “I was really out of my comfort zone but it was worth it. Despite there being lots of stresses as a primary school teacher, there’s something uplifting when you have made a difference to one child who has managed to understand some mathematical thing, or you’ve done an assembly where they were all singing and dancing, and they have smiles on their faces. That’s something that I could never have got previously.” Margot has learned: “It’s important to be honest with yourself, and sometimes that’s hard and it’s easier just to carry on. When there is that small, nagging doubt, take time to explore it and see if it develops. It’s not always easy and it’s not always what you imagined it to be, but I think it ultimately moves you forward.” She thinks it made her more confident in her ability to make decisions when she decided to move back to Scotland, first to work in a school in Edinburgh, and then to step back from teaching and move to a farm in the Highlands, where she and her partner now have cattle and sheep, while she works as a supply teacher. “I think that going against what a lot of people were saying at the time, by becoming a primary school teacher – ‘Are you crazy, you’re going to have a drop in salary’ – and it working out, it probably did give me the confidence to then make another change.” She fulfilled a new dream by getting a dog. Some people, however, seem to almost stumble into happiness, with no grand plan. As a child, Jack Rawlinson had a train set but wasn’t very interested in it. “I had never thought of being a train driver,” he says. He had worked in IT for three decades. “In your 20s, you get on to a wheel, start earning a bit of money. Before you know it, you’re in your 30s, reasonably successful and it seems like you’re trapped.” He was approaching his 50s when he realised he couldn’t do it any more. “It was stressing me out: you can’t ever really leave it at the office, you’re always thinking about the next progress meeting. I thought, ‘If I don’t get out of this, I’m probably looking at serious health problems.” In 2010, thinking he might become a delivery driver, he saw an advert for trainee train drivers and the more he read about it, the more he thought it would suit him. “One of the things that had been driving me crazy about office life was Monday to Friday, nine to five. Being a train driver, you work in shifts.” It’s not for everyone, he says, but for him, “I’m not on the rat wheel”. Rawlinson says it is the only job he has ever had, “that I can honestly say I enjoy. It’s turned out so much better than I could have anticipated.” He laughs down the phone, at the end of one of his shifts. “Pure luck, really.”",Life and style; Work & careers; Teaching; Medicine; Education; Transport; Guardian Careers; Health & wellbeing; Mental health; Society; Training to be a barrister,Life and style
2020-10-08T15:01:20Z,Boohoo investors called upon to hold firm to account over promises,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/08/boohoo-investors-called-upon-to-hold-firm-to-account-over-promises,"Boohoo shareholders have been called upon to make sure the fast-fashion company keeps its promise to improve conditions in its supply chain after it emerged that a similar pledge to stop using unethical factories was made six years ago. In 2015, Boohoo’s annual report said the Manchester-based firm had launched a compliance team in May 2014 and introduced a traffic light system to rate suppliers, with the aim of ensuring all factories it worked with met strict standards within a year. It added that it had reduced the number of suppliers it worked with to aid compliance and had developed a corporate social responsibility plan with the charity Business in the Community (BitC). The online retailer admitted in its 2016 annual report that a fifth of its factories were still not audited and approved. Boohoo offered no update on any progress or on the traffic light monitoring system in its 2017 and 2018 reports. The company left BitC after one year. Boohoo said in those annual reports that it continued to expect factories to meet certain ethical standards, carry out audits and meet a code of conduct and its policy was based on the code of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), an alliance of retailers, trade unions and workers rights groups. It did not mention that it was not a member of the ETI, or that it cancelled scheduled meetings about joining in 2015. The 2015 promises echo some of those made last month in response to a damning report into Boohoo’s supply chain by Alison Levitt QC, who said she had found that executives knew about problems from late 2019 at the latest. Among measures to clean up its act, Boohoo has promised to reduce the number of suppliers, carry out audits and set up a supply chain compliance committee. Martin Buttle, at the activist group ShareAction, has written to 31 major investors who together control 29% of Boohoo, urging them to hold the company to account despite a surge in the company’s share price after the Levitt report was published. He warned that investors needed to look beyond Levitt’s assertion that Boohoo could “relatively easily” clean up its act and focus on the detail of the report, which outlines “multiple instances of abusive practices” and “direct warnings to Boohoo execs from their own auditors that workers were being subjected to appalling conditions”. “We want all investors to be fully aware of the failures of governance, supplier monitoring and management of the buying function within Boohoo, and to proactively monitor the company’s commitment and progress towards eradicating labour rights abuses,” Buttle writes in the letter. Nigel Venes, at the ETI, added that all stakeholders should also consider the findings of worker’s rights group Labour Behind the Label’s report into poor conditions in the Leicester factories Boohoo uses. “Consumers and investors involved with Boohoo should express their concerns about this kind of activity within the supply chain of one of the UK’s most profitable companies,” he said. “What is needed is a change of business practices. Will they do it? We want to see evidence of systematic changes and full transparency instead of further promises.” Former insiders at Boohoo claim the company knew about problems within its supply chain many years earlier, partly because of audits it instituted over the years. Some of these were paid for by suppliers and carried out by external companies, and some were carried out by Boohoo personnel. One well placed former staff member said the company was “completely aware” of problems at the Leicester factories right up to director level: “Anybody who came into contact with the ethical team, they knew those factories were non-compliant from many perspectives.” But they added: “They were not following a rigorous auditing programme. Some of the premises [in Leicester] would not have passed as it didn’t have suitable fire exits, the right distance between machines or fire extinguishers. There were a lot of [problematic] things other than wages. “I don’t think there was ever any really concerted effort [to improve conditions in factories] because of the cost implications and prices going up.” Another former employee claimed that staff had raised issues about overcrowding and fire safety in factories but that orders continued to go to those suppliers. “They [Boohoo] have known about this for years,” she said. Boohoo said its team had acknowledged to Levitt that more needed to be done to address its audit process at the Leicester factories and that it had “significantly advanced” work there to rectify issues far more quickly. It added that the board had set a timescale to implement changes recommended by Levitt and in the next few weeks would announce the appointment of a “respected and wholly independent individual” to oversee that change. John Lyttle, the chief executive of Boohoo, said the rapid growth of the company since 2014 had presented numerous challenges in ensuring the right team and framework was in place, adding that he was “genuinely sorry” that those working for some garment suppliers in Leicester had not been treated well. He said: “We are determined to implement Ms Levitt’s recommendations to help to rectify this and I am personally fully committed to doing so. We cannot do this in isolation, which is why our teams are working side by side with the local council, regulatory authorities and civil partners to affect the change required. Together we will be able to make a real difference.” The company is to be called by a parliamentary committee to give evidence at an inquiry into the fast-fashion industry. Boohoo said it had confirmed to the environmental audit committee that it would answer any questions MPs had. Carol Kane, a co-founder, gave evidence to an earlier investigation by the committee in 2018.",Boohoo; Corporate governance; Minimum wage; Business; Society; UK news; Ethical business,Business
2021-05-05T06:00:08Z,How has life changed for Manchester’s poorest children in 200 years?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/05/guardian-200-how-has-life-changed-for-manchester-poorest-children,"Two hundred years ago, the first edition of the Manchester Guardian carried shock figures that revealed the true extent of child poverty in the city. Leaked by a source identified as “NH”, they showed that official estimates of 8,000 children receiving free education – a proxy term for poverty – were wildly inaccurate. In fact, there were almost 25,000. Two centuries later, an investigation by the Guardian has found that official statistics of deprivation still mask the real numbers of poor children in Manchester. Despite being home to two billionaire football clubs and multimillion-pound apartments, in 2019 the city of the Guardian’s birth was still ranked as the second-most deprived local authority in England, after Blackpool. That was before the pandemic pushed thousands more families into poverty. In January 2020, when Covid-19 was still a distant problem, 31.6% of Mancunian children (28,276) were from such low-income backgrounds that they attracted the “pupil premium” and qualified for free school meals (FSM). A year later, that figure had risen to 37.8%, or 33,876 children, far higher than the national average, which in October had reached 19.7%. But experts working with young people in the city say that thousands more children are living on the breadline in England’s unofficial second city. A disproportionate number of the poorest children live a stone’s throw from the Etihad stadium, home to Manchester City, one of the richest football clubs on the planet. A short walk away from the pitch where players earn £350,000 a week is Miles Platting and Newton Heath, the most deprived ward in Manchester. It doesn’t look like a cradle of destitution. Near the Rochdale Canal – Manchester’s equivalent of the M6 during the Industrial Revolution, carrying barges of locally made glass and ropes, and dyed silk – there are smart new houses on sale for more than £300,000, each with off-road parking and electric charging points. Yet in the ground floor of an older tower block is Miles Platting Community Grocer, where struggling families pay £2.50 for a bag of food worth at least £12, and can pick up free sanitary towels, nappies and incontinence pads. Most of the customers are in work: Patsy O’Brien, who runs the shop, always anticipates a rush in what she calls “dinner lady hour”, when catering staff from the nearby school call by. Further north in Newton Heath there are well-kept clusters of social housing, including the Footballers’ Estate, where all the streets are named after the Busby Babes, the Manchester United players who died in the 1958 Munich disaster. Locals are very proud that the club was founded in Newton Heath by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot. “This is not a sink area,” says John Flanagan, a Labour councillor for 17 years. “Here you have £320,000 houses, mixed with good social housing. You look around and you think: where’s the poverty? The crime is that it’s all hidden behind closed doors. Sixty percent of the poverty here is the working poor. It doesn’t pay in this society at the moment to work.” What’s worse, he says, is “things are going backwards”. Growing up in Miles Platting and Newton Heath can take a decade off a child’s life – life expectancy is decreasing, according to Flanagan, with the average man now living to just 71.5, compared with 81.2 in the south Manchester suburb of East Didsbury. Levels of childhood obesity are high and finding fresh food is difficult: much of the ward is classed as a “food desert”, which means there are few places to buy affordable fresh fruit and vegetables. One in 53 Manchester children (2,336) were homeless in 2019, according to the council. At Manchester Communication Academy in Harpurhey, the nearest high school to Miles Platting, a “significant number” of pupils live in temporary accommodation, according to Patsy Hodson, the executive vice-principal. “The problem is hiding in plain sight, with homeless children alongside their peers in all north Manchester schools,” she said. “School staff often discover their situation accidentally as there is no formal communication. Many are living in extremely poor sub-standard housing with damp, disrepair and vermin infestation. Others are in B&amp;Bs or hostels which are unsuitable for families, and others simply ‘sofa-surf’, relying on friends and family.” There are 12,747 households on the Manchester waiting list for social housing, 6,981 of which are classed as having urgent housing need. The ward has the highest levels of child tooth decay in the city, according to Flanagan, and yet has one dentist, which is currently not accepting child patients or anyone entitled to free dental care. There is no gym since the leisure centre closed – along with its swimming pool, a library, the police station and four youth clubs – as a result of central government cuts to the local authority since 2010. A half-finished PFI regeneration project that ran out of money has not helped. Jamie Lees, who runs Active Communities Network (ACN), a sports project for young people in Newton Heath, believes there needs to be a rethink around the definition of poverty. It can mean children going hungry – like the boy who turned up ravenous for football last week. He had been excluded from school for a week “and it turned out that the only place he was getting fed was at school”. But it’s much more complicated than that, says Lees, surveying a football session at Ten Acres Lane. Appearances can deceive. “Lads here, they have nice shoes, better coats than us, but they live in houses with no heating. They somehow have two-grand dogs they can’t feed. Some of them drive around in nice cars with no insurance.” The free school meals data only tells part of the picture, he adds: “What about the mum who works three jobs but is never at home, whose son is now getting groomed by local gangs?” Three of the young men take a break from their game to talk. Newton Heath has “a lot morons”, says Gift Eichie, 20. Bachi Bah, 21, adds: “It’s not a place where you would like your kid to grow up. If you’ve just moved there, I guarantee you won’t last a week. People will try to do something to you.” His friend Abdul Bakare, 21, chips in: “It’s true. You see people coming in for Deliveroo on a bike and all the little kids try to rob them.” Asked to list the good things about Newton Heath, Bah comes up with “the shops. We’ve got Morrisons, we’ve got Asda.” They all hope their future lies elsewhere. Aaron Holleran, 25, was raised in Newton Heath, attended ACN’s football sessions and is now the project coordinator. “It’s a difficult place to grow up,” he says. “But for me, there’s always a choice. You can … go on to to bad things, or you can be strong.” Young people need better local role models, he says, rather than seeing their elders “at the job centre on Oldham Road … or getting roped into drugs, crime”. Richard Marsh, the chief executive of the Youth Zone, a youth club in north Manchester, says criminal exploitation of children has worsened. “We had an example the other day of a 15-year-old that got picked up with four adults in a car with firearms,” he says. “I think lots of elements of growing up in areas of disadvantage are traumatic experiences,” says Claire Evans, the chief executive of the youth and community charity 4CT, who has worked with young people in east Manchester for more than 20 years. “Six-year-olds knowing the difference between a gunshot and a firework – that’s what kids here are being exposed to, maybe not on a daily occurrence but it is something they are aware of.” Not all of these children count in the free school meals statistics, says Evans. “It’s like in the Manchester Guardian article 200 years ago, saying there were more kids in poverty than officially disclosed. I just think that’s exactly the way it is now.” Some children don’t officially exist. Marsh says a 15-year-old boy recently turned up who had never had his birth registered or been to school. This was not the child of recent immigrants. “He was white, indigenous,” said Marsh. Many families are in debt, from drugs or bad loans. Marsh tells a story of sending a youth worker out during the pandemic to give a child an iPad so they could do their homework. “He knew something wasn’t right so he hung on and within five minutes someone had come to take the iPad.” A lot of children are digitally poor. A report from Manchester city council during the third national lockdown in January found that there remained “a significant shortfall in devices/access to wifi in some schools”. At one primary school in Miles Platting and Newton Heath in January, nine months after the government promised to give laptops to all disadvantaged children, there were still 45 families with no home broadband and 80 children (13% of pupils) without devices. The council had already realised that if it distributed food vouchers only to those who qualified for free school meals, many children would go hungry during the school holidays. They broadened the criteria and received help from outside organisations, including Manchester City’s corporate social responsibility arm, City in the Community, which in March and April delivered 255 free tech bundles and £10,000 worth of food vouchers to 10 local schools, plus hundreds of laptops. Why so many parents can no longer feed their children is a huge cause for concern. Part of it appears to be the result of benefits sanctions, or people moving on to universal credit and being paid in arrears. But a significant issue is drug use, particularly the proliferation of strong marijuana, believes Evans. “Whole-family drug use is something that has changed over the past decade, particularly high-end weed,” she says. “Not weed that makes you a pleasant, jolly person, but weed that makes you wasted.” This affects parents’ abilities to shop and to feed their children, as well as get them to school. The latter is a particular problem in Miles Platting and Newton Heath, which has no secondary school and appalling local bus services. It is probably not a coincidence that the ward has one of the highest rates of persistent school absences in the city and has the lowest proportion of children (19%) achieving a grade 5+ in English and Maths at GCSE-level, as well as the largest percentage of residents with no formal qualifications (41%) in Manchester. The local primary schools are largely judged to be good and praised for helping disadvantaged children exceed their targets. But things seem to go wrong at secondary school. The nearest schools suspend alarmingly large numbers of pupils: St Matthew’s Roman Catholic high school in Moston excluded more than half of its pupils (54%) at some point in 2018-19, more than triple the average in Manchester secondary schools of 17%. Derek Purnell, a former church minister and a community worker for 40 years, believes Miles Platting and Newton Heath has not received its fair share of investment. More affordable housing has been promised by the council, and a new secondary school, but there have been many broken promises, he said, calling the ward “the Bermuda Triangle of Manchester. Everything that comes in, drops out.” Changing the culture is hard, says Purnell. “There are people here who are clever, but they have never had the opportunities or the encouragement. There’s this cultural mindset and you have to change their worldview. I said to one of my neighbour’s kids: why are you dropping out of school? And she said: tell me why I should when no other member of my family has carried on?”",Manchester; Poverty; Young people; Food poverty; UK news; Social exclusion; Greater Manchester; Society; The Guardian; Media,Media
2020-06-23T12:00:46Z,Jordan smoking rates highest in world amid claims of big tobacco interference,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/jordan-smoking-rates-highest-in-world-amid-claims-of-big-tobacco-interference,"Smoking rates in the Middle East kingdom of Jordan have become the highest in the world amid what public health advocates say is widespread interference in policy-making by multinational tobacco companies. More than eight out of 10 Jordanian men smoke or regularly use nicotine products including e-cigarettes, according to a government study carried out in 2019 in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found. Even excluding e-cigarettes and other “smokeless” products, the research showed 66% of Jordanian men and more than 17% of women were smokers, surpassing the most recent figures for Indonesia, which was long considered to have had the world’s highest tobacco usage. “The rates are dangerously high and a predictor of a future public health catastrophe,” said Firas al-Hawari, a physician and head of the cancer-control office at Amman’s King Hussein Cancer Center. The Jordanian figures contrast with those in Europe, the US and Australia, where smoking has been drastically reduced over the past three decades with the introduction of limits on tobacco companies’ power to lobby and advertise, as well as through awareness campaigns about the dangers of smoking. Industry analysts and public health advocates said Jordan’s rates were exacerbated by the influence of big tobacco, which they said was allowed to operate with comparatively fewer restraints than in the UK – as is the case in many of the lower- and middle-income countries where the majority of the world’s smokers now live. “These companies continue to exercise as much political power as they can in wealthy countries, but they’re more successful in lower-income countries where they face less transparency, can operate more in the dark and overwhelm whatever civic societies exist,” said Rima Nakkash, an associate professor of public health at the American University of Beirut. A Guardian investigation of tobacco industry conduct in Jordan has found: Tobacco lobbyists, including from British American Tobacco (BAT), are regularly involved in debating regulations for their products in Jordan to an extent that anti-smoking campaigners say is inappropriate. Jordan ranked second in the world for tobacco company interference in government, according to analysis by a civil society group. Claims that government officials were lobbied by tobacco industry executives on how they should implement public health legislation alongside offers of access to corporate social responsibility money. Philip Morris International has paid to refurbish schools in Jordan, provide children with school bags and run “career development” sessions for young people. PMI also featured on the social media feeds of the Jordanian prime minister, promoting its economic contribution to the country. ‘The tobacco companies actually sat at the table’ Tobacco company lobbyists have been accused of inappropriate involvement in shaping regulations on their products in Jordan. Meeting minutes seen by the Guardian show that lobbyists from BAT, Japan Tobacco International (JTI) and PMI attended a series of meetings last year to discuss standards for e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. Among the standards being decided were nicotine content, the size and composition of health warnings, the graphics and colours permitted on the packages, and whether the products could be labelled as less harmful than cigarettes or as an aid to quit smoking. “The tobacco companies actually sat at the table right across from us,” said Princess Dina Mired, a member of Jordan’s royal family, who attended the meetings in her capacity as the president of the Union for International Cancer Control. “They argued against every single standard.” The tobacco companies supported the adoption of regulation comparable to EU directives, according to meeting minutes, while anti-smoking campaigners said they were pushing for more restrictive standards on the products. Mired said: “There was a point when it became very clear that we were wasting our time. We all walked out as a protest. Nothing happened. [The meeting] continued.” Jordan is a signatory to an international tobacco-control treaty that obliges countries to protect their public health laws from tobacco company interference. A civil society group that monitors compliance with the treaty argues that the tobacco companies’ involvement in regulatory meetings in Jordan is an example of lobbying that is contrary to the agreement. PMI and JTI said in statements to the Guardian that it was normal and lawful for their companies to be consulted as stakeholders when relevant regulatory issues were being debated. “Our interactions with government officials in Jordan – like elsewhere – comply with all applicable laws,” PMI said. “In addition, we abide to our own international standards and practices which are stricter than many national laws. In any democratic society, the central objective of regulatory policy – ensuring that regulations are designed and implemented in the public interest – can only be achieved with full participation of those concerned.” JTI said its involvement in the meetings on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco was about providing assistance on technical and industrial standards. “These standards and specifications are very technical, accordingly, and as part of their bylaws, [Jordan’s standards organisation] involves related industries in the process of developing these standards and specifications to ensure applicability and alignment with international best practices, approaches and standards,” it said. “During such meetings, JTI always acts responsibly and to the letter of the law.” Mired said she felt that few of the public health advocates’ concerns were heeded by the committee, which was made up of various ministries and the chambers of commerce and industry. “We failed miserably. They didn’t take a single recommendation from us,” she said. Several former and current government officers said big tobacco had strong relationships with Jordanian MPs and officials, who are not obliged to declare their contact with the industry. Mervat Mheerat, the deputy health manager at the Greater Amman municipality, told the Guardian she was visited by a regional manager for a multinational tobacco company while she sat on a government committee that oversaw how tobacco products were displayed at supermarkets. “I was shocked when the regional manager came to me, and knew what I was saying in the meetings,” she said. Mheerat said she was asked to be “neutral” on some of the issues being discussed in the meeting, and was offered a donation of up to 1m dinars (£1.15m) for anti-smoking campaigns in the city, in what she felt was an exchange. “They approach each person in the style they like,” she said. “So for me, they know I am passionate about promoting health and raising awareness of the dangers of smoking. So they came and said: ‘Let us find some money for your campaign.’” Apparent conflicts of interest go to the heart of Jordan’s anti-smoking lobby. Emails seen by the Guardian show a senior member of a major public health group recused themselves from anti-smoking work after a family member became employed as a lobbyist for a multinational tobacco giant. ‘We are the second-biggest taxpayer in Jordan’ Company filings show big tobacco spends hundreds of thousands of US dollars in Jordan on sponsorship, including of many programmes aimed at young people. In one example, Philip Morris paid to refurbish 10 schools in the Amman neighbourhood where its factory is located, and provided children in 25 schools with bags and stationery. The national/WHO survey found that about 45% of Jordanian students aged 15 or under have used some form of tobacco. Philip Morris has also run careers training programmes, which were widely covered in local media and lauded at events attended by government ministers, local officials and senior police. Public health advocates argue such contributions launder the adverse health and economic impacts of the industry’s products. JTI said in a statement that its corporate social responsibility work strictly adhered to local and international laws and policies and that none of its programmes involved minors. PMI said its factory was located in an underprivileged area “where the local community has often requested much needed in-kind support and aid”. “It is saddening that even actions to improve the living conditions of people around our factory might be seen as a reason to attack us,” the company said. The industry casts itself as a major investor and job creator, an especially potent argument in a country with high unemployment, where tobacco taxes amount to around 18% of the government’s annual revenue. This message has been broadcast directly from government social media channels. “Philip Morris is the largest American investment in Jordan,” the company’s then general manager for the region, Fadi Maayta, said in a video posted by the prime minister’s office last year. “We are the second-biggest taxpayer in Jordan.” PMI said the video was one of several short interviews with local business leaders that featured on government social media. Research funded by the UK government has found that smoking costs Jordan £1.85bn a year in healthcare and loss of productivity, the highest per capita figure in the world, outweighing the approximately £1.03bn the industry pays in taxes, fees and wages to local workers. A Jordanian government source authorised to comment said tobacco companies did not receive special treatment compared with other industries and that anti-smoking awareness campaigns were continuing to try to change people’s behaviour.",Jordan; Tobacco industry; Business; Middle East and north Africa; World news; Smoking,World news
2020-08-12T22:05:37Z,Inside Missguided review – flimsy fashion doc doesn't mean business,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/12/inside-missguided-review-fast-fashion,"It’s the run up to Christmas and Missguided’s head of buying isn’t happy. A “Satan is my sugar daddy” T-shirt sample has been produced in a lacklustre colour. Such micro-dramas drive Inside Missguided: Made in Manchester (Channel 4), a documentary filmed in the fast fashion brand’s candyfloss-hued headquarters, a place where flamingo ornaments are omnipresent and meeting rooms are named after emojis. So far, so reality TV. What is unexpected is the timing. A month after the horrendous revelations about a Leicester factory supplying one of Missguided’s rivals, Boohoo, made headlines, is there any joy to be found watching women wearing bejewelled headbands haggling suppliers down from £7.50 to £7.40 a unit? The show’s propaganda-like tone doesn’t exactly read the room. The deadpan narrator is one of Missguided’s own staff, a funny touch at times (“The creative team have had three hours sleep, but no one gives a shit about that”), but one that doesn’t speak of balanced journalism. Missguided’s world is undeniably compelling, part-Google campus, part-Barbie Dream House. Motivational quotes glare down from the walls (“We only regret the things we don’t buy!”) and everyone has tonged hair and luxuriant eyebrows. The oft-mentioned backstory is that the company lost £26m in 2018 and must push harder than ever to regain its position. Ambition radiates from the screen as the mainly female staff devote their lives – in ever more imaginative and exhausting-looking ways – to the sale of bodycon dresses. “I like that it drains my soul,” says Treasure, the star of the show, a woman who looks like True Romance’s Alabama Whitman and sounds like Lily Savage. Treasure is reality-TV gold, her potty mouth – “We live and breathe and eat and shit Instagram and bloggers and influencers,” she says at one point, which sounds bad for the digestion – coupled with immense talent. On shoots, she arranges models’ bronzed limbs with the precision of Lucian Freud directing subjects for portraits. There is a lot of talk of working-class people being given opportunities they would never have had in the London-centric fashion industry. Treasure, who says she grew up skint and left school at 16, is now 28 and “regularly travels the world to the sickest locations”. Victoria, from Cumbria (“Known for Cumberland sausage, but definitely not for fashion”) says that working in fashion “like John Galliano” would have been impossible for her, but Missguided made it possible. The dream Missguided is selling to customers is presented as a class issue, too; the clothes a route to self-confidence for everyday women. As Victoria puts it: “We would all love to be dripping in Gucci and Louis V, but that’s not possible.” Female empowerment gets a lot of airtime, as the company seeks to move on from a reputation “that only hot, skinny girls wear our clothes” by filming diverse influencers talking movingly about overcoming obstacles and casting plus-size models. The company’s female-skewed workforce is presented as part of the same narrative. It sticks in the craw, though, when the narrator says that the company “may be owned by a man, but we are in charge”. It’s clear who is boss every time the founder, Nitin Passi, a largely affable man with a chillingly well-groomed beard, walks into the room. Behold his palatial apartment in Chelsea, west London, a Chanel surfboard propped up in the hallway; observe his benediction when he suggests lending the marketing department one of his cars – a £350,000 Rolls-Royce – for a press stunt. The programme does at least address the ethics of fast fashion, a step on from the BBC’s Breaking Fashion, which was slammed for giving the Salford label In the Style a free pass when it aired in September. In episode three, we learn that Missguided has “sharpened up our act because in the past we haven’t always got it right”, referring to a 2017 scandal in which one of its suppliers was found to be paying staff £3 an hour. “Historically,” the company’s corporate social responsibility manager says, “Missguided was the bad boy of the industry – people had a view that [we were] just trying to exploit people.” Now, we are vaguely assured, they are much more careful, as we witness a factory being audited. Perhaps – let’s hope – this one heartening exchange is an accurate representation of the entire, sprawling, pan-global Missguided supply chain, although the show offers no evidence that would prove it. It is more caught up with what the brand represents in a conceptual way – good vibes! Empowerment! – than what it sells and how that product is made. What it sells is textiles by the truckload, and the high volume of stock combined with the obsession with rapid trends is clearly an environmental nightmare. “It’s the customer designing all of the newness, not us,” Passi says at one point. “If we don’t do it, someone else will,” he adds. The whole thing feels as much an advert for the kind of fashion industry regulation the government has always resisted as it does an advert for Missguided.",Television; Television & radio; Culture; Fashion; Life and style,Television & radio
2019-12-29T09:00:33Z,The biggest business con of 2019: fleecing workers while bosses get rich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/boeing-amazon-business-ethics-robert-reich,"Corporate social responsibility is the second-biggest con of 2019 (Donald Trump remains in first place). Consider Boeing, whose board just fired its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, in order “to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders”. Restore confidence? Muilenburg’s successor will be David Calhoun, who, as a longstanding member of Boeing’s board of directors, allowed Muilenburg to remain CEO for more than a year after the first 737 Max crash and after internal studies found that the jetliner posed an unacceptable risk of accident. It caused the deaths of 346 people. Muilenburg raked in $30m in 2018. He could walk away from Boeing with another $60m. Boeing isn’t the only large corporation with a confidence problem. Until his ouster, Muilenburg was a director of the Business Roundtable, an association of 192 CEOs of America’s largest corporations. With great fanfare last August, it announced a “fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders” (emphasis in the original) and not just their shareholders. The Roundtable’s commitment came in response to growing public distrust of big corporations, and proposals from several Democratic candidates to rein them in. Another Business Roundtable director is Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors. Just weeks after making the commitment, and despite GM’s hefty profits and large tax breaks, Barra rejected workers’ demands that GM raise their wages and stop outsourcing their jobs. Earlier in the year GM shut its giant assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 50,000 GM workers then staged the longest auto strike in 50 years. They won a few wage gains but didn’t save any jobs. Meanwhile, GM’s stock has performed so well that Barra earned $22m last year. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is another member of the Business Roundtable. Just weeks after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary, announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce. The annual saving to Amazon from this cost-cutting move is roughly what Bezos – whose net worth is $110bn – makes in two hours. (Bezos’s nearly completed DC mansion will have 2 elevators, 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, and a movie theater.) GE’s CEO Larry Culp is also a member of the Business Roundtable. Two months after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, General Electric froze the pensions of 20,000 workers in order to cut costs. Culp raked in $15m last year. Last week the Business Roundtable issued a widely advertised Christmas message. It asserted that the success of the American economy “depends on businesses investing in the economic security of their employees and the communities in which they operate”. Sure. Just in time for the holidays, US Steel announced 1,545 layoffs at two plants in Michigan. Last year, five US Steel executives received an average compensation package of $4.8m, a 53% increase over 2017. Instead of a holiday bonus this year, Walmart offered its employees a 15% store discount. Oh, and did I say? Walmart saved $2.2bn this year from the Trump tax cut. The tax cut itself was a product of the Roundtable’s extensive lobbying, lubricated by its generous campaign donations. Several of its member corporations, including Amazon and General Motors, wound up paying no federal income taxes at all last year. Not incidentally, the tax cut will result in less federal money for services on which Americans and their communities rely. The truth is, American corporations are sacrificing workers and communities as never before, in order to further boost record profits and unprecedented CEO pay. Americans know this. In the most recent Pew survey, a record 73% of US adults (including 62% of Republicans, and 71% of Republicans earning less than $30,000 a year) said they believed major corporations had too much power. And 65% believed they made too much profit. The only way to make corporations socially responsible is through laws requiring them to be – for example, giving workers a bigger voice in corporate decision-making, making corporations pay severance to communities they abandon, raising corporate taxes, busting up monopolies, and preventing dangerous products (including faulty airplanes) from ever seeing the light of day. If the Business Roundtable and other corporations were truly socially responsible, they’d support such laws. Don’t hold your breath. The only way to get such laws enacted is by reducing corporate power and getting big money out of politics.

The discount retailer, which has almost 800 UK stores, pledged to remove cartoon characters from eight of its cereal ranges by spring. The company said it was prompted to take action after nearly three-quarters of parents said their children pressurised them to buy certain items in the supermarket, with more than half believing cartoon characters on packaging encouraged this. Many of Lidl’s cereals have unhealthy-sounding names that will not be changed – such as Choco Rice, Cereal Cookie, Choco Shells and Frosted Flakes – but the company says that over the last four years it has reduced the sugar content by 20%. Georgina Hall, Lidl’s head of corporate social responsibility, said: “We want to help parents across Britain make healthy and informed choices about the food they buy for their children. We know pester power can cause difficult battles on the shop floor and we’re hoping that removing cartoon characters from cereal packaging will alleviate some of the pressure parents are under.” In 2014, Lidl said it had become the first supermarket in Britain to remove sweets and chocolates from checkouts nationwide. Last summer, a survey published by a coalition of health groups found that half of food and drink products with popular cartoon characters such as Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol on their packaging were high in fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt. While unhealthy products featuring licensed characters can appear on shop shelves, they are not allowed to appear in advertising. Under UK rules, children cannot be targeted with adverts for products that are high in fat, salt and sugar, and licensed characters should not be used to promote such products.",Lidl; Obesity; Sugar; Children; Business; Retail industry; Society; Supermarkets; UK news,Business
2020-04-20T23:01:48Z,H&M tops 2020 fashion transparency index as 10 brands score zero,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/21/hm-tops-2020-fashion-transparency-index-as-10-brands-score-zero,"The H&amp;M Group, C&amp;A, Adidas/Reebok, Esprit, Marks &amp; Spencer and Patagonia are the world’s most transparent major fashion brands, according to the 2020 fashion transparency index from the campaign group Fashion Revolution. The annual report, now in its fifth year, ranks the amount of information companies disclose about social and environmental policies, processes and effects within their operations and supply chains. Puma, Asos, Nike and VF Corporation – the company behind brands including The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Wrangler – are also in the top 10. The joint lowest-scoring brands included Bally, Jessica Simpson (the pop star’s label), Max Mara, Mexx, Pepe Jeans and Tom Ford, all of which revealed nothing at all about their practices for 2020. The report investigates brands with a minimum turnover of $400m (£320m), scoring them based on a detailed analysis of 200 indicators ranging from human rights to the use of plastics. This year’s report investigated more brands than ever – 250, up from 200 last year. On average, brands achieved a score of 23%, up two percentage points from last year. The top-performing company, H&amp;M Group – which covers brands including &amp; Other Stories, Arket, Monki and Weekday – scored 73%, having scored 61% last year. The most improved brands included Monsoon, up 23 points this year, the Italian brand Zegna, up 22 points, and Sainsbury’s Tu, up 19 points. More brands than ever disclosed their suppliers, with 40% disclosing their top-tier suppliers, up from 35% last year. According to Sarah Ditty, the policy director at Fashion Revolution and the author of the report, it is not an examination of how ethical or sustainable the brands are, but rather measures their transparency. Although there were obvious “elephant in the room issues” about some of the top performers, including “producing too much” and not doing enough to improve workers’ low wages, Ditty said consumers should take heart from the fact that “some brands really are taking some significant steps”. Transparency is key to the creation of a cleaner, greener fashion industry, given its particular reliance on complex, multinational supply chains. These make it difficult for customers to make ethical choices and for stakeholders to hold brands to account when things go wrong. The index was launched as part of Fashion Revolution week, a series of events that commemorate the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster, when a large textiles factory collapsed in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, killing 1,134 people. The key takeaway for customers, said Ditty, should be to look at the “big swathe of brands that are not disclosing any information at all” about their operations and supply chains – “the people lagging behind, either because they are not prioritising the issues or because they are doing good things behind the scenes but not sharing it”. There is growing evidence, she added, that consumers from all groups “are more and more interested in ethical and sustainable issues”. Sharing information “might give customers a bit more trust in what they are doing”. The research was undertaken before the Covid-19 pandemic. The crisis has made the issues of transparency more pressing than ever, said Carry Somers, the co-founder of Fashion Revolution – millions of garment workers in Bangladesh face ruin as western brands cancel orders. “This crisis has started to bring to light some of the systemic problems within the industry and revealed just how fragile the system is,” said Somers. “There is no doubt in my mind,” she said, that companies “have both the resources and the ability – notwithstanding the moral imperative – to fulfil their commitments to their suppliers.” Companies’ corporate social responsibility documents, she added, “refer to suppliers as partners, but when it comes down to the wire one of these partners pays the price while the other cuts and runs”. As we come out of the other side of this crisis, Somers said, transparency will be vital “to start to build a more responsible industry”.",Fashion industry; Transparency; Life and style; Environment; Fashion; Global development; Ethical and green living,Fashion
2020-08-24T17:30:31Z,AMP sexual harassment scandal shows shareholders will insist on higher standards when directors don't,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/25/amp-sexual-harassment-scandal-shows-shareholders-will-insist-on-higher-standards-when-directors-dont,"The events that have unfolded at AMP over recent weeks prove company directors today need to be as worried about good corporate governance as delivering a strong bottom line. The resignation of the chair of AMP, David Murray, on Monday and the demotion of one of its senior executives over the company’s response to a sexual harassment complaint, is a clear indicator to boards that environmental, social and governance issues are now regarded by shareholders as inextricably linked to a company’s value as an investment. Shareholders are willing to use their voting power to insist on higher standards. Since 1 July, AMP has been facing a growing shareholder revolt over its decision to promote the man at the centre of sexual harassment allegations, Boe Pahari, to the head of one of its most important corporate divisions, AMP Capital. The company had been given a deadline of this Friday to respond to shareholders’ demands for action to be taken over Pahari’s appointment and to give more details on how it handled the sexual harassment complaint. Groups such as the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), representing major super funds, called for a public explanation of the company’s decision to promote a man who had been sanctioned with a $500,000 penalty, while his victim, Julia Szlakowski, had left the company, saying her decision to report him had made her career at AMP untenable. Some institutional investors were agitating for an extraordinary general meeting, which could potentially have led to board members being removed and further engulfed the insurer in controversy. A week ago Szlakowski outed herself, saying that was the only way to defend herself against what she saw as AMP’s trivialising of the events of 2017. In 2016, Szlakowski was named institutional director, unlisted, Americas and put in charge of North American distribution for AMP Capital’s infrastructure debt and equity strategies. She reported to Pahari, who then held the role of global head and managing partner, infrastructure equity, north-west region. Szlakowski was AMP Capital’s first US hire for AMP’s unlisted business, as well as the only woman on the North American distribution team, she says. Just six months into her new position, however, Szlakowski lodged a seven-page complaint with AMP, detailing a pattern of sexual harassment, which she says began in December 2016 and culminated in May 2017. “The conduct Ms Szlakowski alleged did not constitute an isolated incident of poor judgment, nor simple ‘comments’ that could be brushed aside as merely ‘uncomfortable’, as AMP and Mr Pahari had described in their public statement,” Szlakowski’s Australian lawyer, Maurice Blackburn principal Josh Bornstein, said in a statement on Monday. “The sexual harassment perpetrated against Ms Szlakowski was serious, persistent and wide-ranging.” Some details of her seven-page complaint have found their way into the media, including that Pahari referred to his “limp dick” when she turned down his offer to use his credit card to buy clothes, called another employee “a fag”, and asked her about the “oldest man she dated” in front of her colleagues. Pahari said in a statement earlier this year: “I genuinely regret that my comments made a colleague feel uncomfortable. It was never my intention, but I accept that they had an impact and I apologised and accepted the consequences. I have learned from the matter.” But Szlakowski says she wants the entire investigation report and her complaint made public by AMP. AMP on Monday released the conclusion of the 2017 internal report by Andrew Burns QC. “I find that there was poor judgment exercised by [Pahari] during this evening and one moderate and two minor incidents which overall added up to a relatively modest breach of the AMP workplace behaviour and equal opportunity policy,” he wrote. “However, this involved a senior manager who ought to have been observing a high standard of equality and diversity practice and who ought to have had a much better understanding of how his actions might be perceived by and may affect a junior colleague.” The issue for AMP is whether it has fully appreciated the seriousness of sexual harassment in the workplace, dealt with it appropriately and made the necessary adjustments to its corporate culture. Szlakowski said she was forced to engage private lawyers to get action, and the reporting has come at a high cost of her career at AMP. In contrast, Pahari was promoted. When the Australian Financial Review approached AMP about the promotion in July, AMP put out a statement saying: “The external investigation identified lower level breaches of AMP’s code of conduct for which Mr Pahari had appropriate consequences imposed, including a financial penalty and counselling for his conduct.” AMP said it had considered the matter prior to the appointment and the consequences applied to Pahari “were both significant and appropriate”. But that has not placated Szlakowski, who says AMP’s statement downplayed the impact on her. “There is nothing in AMP’s public statements that acknowledge that Ms Szlakowski was [allegedly] sexually harassed and traumatised and that her career with the company was prematurely finished as a result of what happened,” Bornstein said. Exactly what occurred at board level is not clear. Murray and John Fraser, a senior executive and the former head of treasury, have resigned. “These changes respond to feedback expressed by some major shareholders regarding the appointment of Mr Pahari as AMP Capital CEO on 1 July 2020,” the AMP board said in a statement to the ASX. Murray, however, in his public comments attached to the same statement, made it clear he considered the board should have stuck by its decision to promote Pahari, which he noted had been unanimous in July. “The board has made it clear that it has always treated the complaint against Mr Pahari seriously. My view remains that it was dealt with appropriately in 2017 and Mr Pahari was penalised accordingly. However, it is clear to me that, although there is considerable support for our strategy, some shareholders did not consider Mr Pahari’s promotion to AMP Capital CEO to be appropriate.” Murray said his decision to leave “reflects my role and accountability as chairman of the board and the need to protect continuity of management, the strategy and to the extent possible, the board”. Murray has been a long-time critic of attempts by the ASX and shareholder bodies to extend guidelines on good corporate governance to include corporate social responsibility principles. When Murray took over at AMP he told the AFR the ASX governance principles had led to directors being swamped by hundreds of pages of board papers and not having enough time to debate important strategic issues. “We will not be guided by the ASX corporate governance principles where they either weaken accountability or distract the company to less important issues,” he said. But that is a view increasingly not shared by the shareholders. “Today’s announcements are an acknowledgement by the company that significant change needs to occur. This is an important step in addressing concerns raised by investors’ and resetting company culture,” ACSI chief executive Louise Davidson said on Monday. “The company must now get on with the job of rebuilding public confidence, and in particular, the trust of their staff.” The activist group Australasian Centre of Corporate Responsibility said there should be no place in boardrooms for people such as Murray. “ACCR has always questioned the suitability of David Murray for chair of a modern ASX50 company,” the centre’s director, Brynn O’Brien, said. “Murray is a well-known climate sceptic. He waged a war against the ASX’s inclusion of ‘social licence’ in its corporate governance principles. It is quite ironic that AMP’s catastrophic social licence issues ultimately brought him down.”",Business; Sexual harassment; Insurance industry; Australia news; World news,Australia news
2020-06-21T09:00:12Z,'My life became a disaster movie': the Bangladesh garment factory on the brink,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jun/21/my-life-became-a-disaster-movie-the-bangladesh-garment-factory-on-the-brink,"As high streets across England opened this week and hundreds of people jostled through the doors of clothing shops, thousands of miles away in Chittagong, Bangladesh, Mostafiz Uddin is worrying about how to pay his workers’ wages. At Denim Expert Ltd, the sustainable clothing company he founded in 2009 as a sustainable apparels clothing company, hundreds of boxes of jeans are crammed against walls and packed to the ceiling. These boxes contain 38,000 pairs of Burton jeans, worth more than £200,000 that were ready for shipment in early March. But as the UK went into lockdown that month, an email pinged into his inbox that tore his life apart. Arcadia, the company run by billionaire Sir Philip Green, which owns the Burton brand alongside others including Dorothy Perkins and Topshop, told Uddin it was cancelling all its orders and would not accept any shipments from his factory. “After I read that email, my whole body was shaking, I just couldn’t believe what was happening,” he says. On top of the jeans packed and ready to ship, Uddin claims he had spent $340,000 (£275,000) on material to make another 60,300 pairs of jeans for Burton and Dorothy Perkins worth $425,000. He alleges another £1m had gone on material purchases based on projections of Arcadia orders he was told were coming down the line. “In total the Arcadia orders that had been placed at my factory were worth over $2.44m. All gone, in one day.” In a statement, Arcadia disputed Uddin’s claims, saying it only considered the £200,000 of finished jeans as a cancelled order and that it would now be paying for all the orders in production at Denim Expert. A spokesperson also said that Arcadia was not legally responsible for material purchased by Denim Expert Ltd for future orders. “It is completely inaccurate for Mr Uddin to claim that Arcadia has cancelled orders totalling $2m. The total value of orders we were forced to cancel as a result of the pandemic was closer to £200k for stock which was to be delivered between June and November,” said a spokesperson. Arcadia wasn’t the only brand that cancelled orders at Uddin’s factory as retail outlets closed across the UK. Peacocks, owned by Edinburgh Woollen Mill, refused to accept shipment of 15,100 pairs of jeans or pay for another 30,000 items of clothing that were already in production. The unprecedented cancellations from brands that Uddin had worked with for decades shattered his life’s work in a matter of weeks. Overall, 80% of his orders were gone with no compensation. In Bangladesh alone, fashion brands have cancelled an estimated £2.5bn of orders at more than 1,150 factories, with the country’s garment industry seeing an 84% decline in orders. Uddin says the cancellations had an immediate knock-on effect on his ability to pay his 20,000 workers, whose wages support more than 10,000 children and family members. “My life has turned into a disaster movie,” he says. “It doesn’t really help that the brands are saying they will pay in the future. I paid salaries to my workers and employees for the months of March, April and May as well as an Eid festival bonus by taking loans from the bank, friends and family. But there is no more possibility of getting further help. Every day the factory is getting closer to the brink of extinction.” Over the last few months he has also fallen behind on paying his utility bills. His bank will not lend him any money and his suppliers are demanding payment for the material they delivered just days before his business fell apart. The pandemic has exposed the way in which fashion suppliers like Uddin carry much of the risk in the global garment production model. Now, with shops reopening across the UK, many brands are beginning to re-order from their overseas suppliers. Arcadia has said that with its outlets reopening, it will now reinstate its order for the £200,000 of finished product from Uddin’s factory. Yet Uddin says that for many small businesses like his own, the damage has already been done. “The global garment industry is based on a system of debt and mutual trust,” he says. “We have to raise loans on the back of previous invoices and pay for all the material, the wages, the costs of the factory and the shipping all upfront.” “We can only raise an invoice when the goods are shipped and then the buyers have weeks before they have to pay us.” Uddin says that he is now finding it impossible to fulfil orders for new buyers. “The trust I have built up with my own suppliers and with the banks has been broken, and they will not work with me any more” he says. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has called on brands to honour their commitments. “Since the situation has started to heal a bit, stores are reopening, and we hope brands would cooperate with their suppliers and take all necessary arrangements to settle the outstanding payments so that factories can survive here and continue to produce,” says Rubana Huq, its president. Uddin’s business has been globally celebrated as an example of sustainable garment production, winning multiple awards and being cited by brands including Arcadia in their corporate social responsibility publicity. “I would just like to say to people who are going to the shops this week, please remember those who have been left behind,” he says. “The worst thing is that these big fashion brands know the impact of what they have done. They understand what is going to happen to workers if they don’t pay what they owe, and they simply don’t care.” A spokesperson for Peacocks said: “When the global crisis hit, we had already paid for the majority of future stock. At that point, we entered discussions with individual suppliers about the outstanding stock. We have now reached agreements with the vast majority of suppliers, and remain committed to finding a way ahead with the small number of remaining suppliers.”",Garment workers; Fashion industry; Coronavirus; Bangladesh; Retail industry; Philip Green; Global development; Business; South and central Asia; World news; Fashion,Global development
2019-11-18T20:00:43Z,"Big profits can fuel bad corporate behaviour, new research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/19/big-profits-can-fuel-bad-corporate-behaviour-new-research-shows,"Hubris and overconfidence caused by excellent financial performance is a major driver of irresponsible corporate behaviour, according to new research. Di Fan, a senior lecturer at the business school of the Australian National University, said his research showed companies making above-average profits were more likely to breach their environmental or social obligations than run-of-the-mill firms. He said internal corporate governance had failed to curb bad behaviour and, based on his earlier research of US companies, fines needed to be increased as much as sixfold to encourage better behaviour. Fan’s research, published in a paper co-authored with colleagues from Spain, Ireland and Hong Kong, comes amid fallout from widespread corporate misconduct in the financial services sector, and scandals over wage underpayment in various other industries. Company executives are under political pressure to resist activists who demand environmental, safety and governance issues be taken more seriously. Australia’s banks are facing billions of dollars in costs to remediate customers they ripped off by providing poor services including shoddy financial advice and junk insurance, while one of the country’s biggest retailers, Woolworths, says it will spend up to $300m to compensate a group of workers it has underpaid for as much as a decade. Fan said his research found that companies were more likely to breach environmental and social regulations if they were either financial under-performers or – counter-intuitively – over-performers. Under-performers were under economic pressure to “take shortcuts” to catch up financially, he said. But in the case of star companies, “we find that it is hubris behind this tendency”. “They are overconfident that when they do those illegal things they will not get caught,” he said. “They should have resources to maintain environmental and safety procedures, but we find that even though they have resources, they do not use them.” He said the internal control systems of companies had failed and it was up to regulators and shareholders to put pressure on executives to do the right thing. “Fines could be a way to do that,” he said. “In our earlier research we found that fines are actually quite low.” Tying executive pay to corporate social responsibility (CSR) measures has been controversial in Australia, with some large investment funds rejecting the use of so-called “soft” measures of performance. However, Fan said remuneration structures that forced chief executives to have skin in the game by owning a lot of shares in the company could help force better behaviour. “Practicing good CSR is an expectation from customers and shareholders,” he said. “If any CSR scandals come out, the share price will decrease. If the CEO has a lot of stock, those stock price decreases will immediately affect the personal wealth of the CEO.”",Business; Business; Crime - Australia; Australia news,Australia news

The findings in the annual – and seventh consecutive – food and drink report from Waitrose come as what we choose to eat assumes an increasingly important focus in the climate crisis debate, as consumers deliberately cut their meat consumption. It also shows that as the plant-based food revolution continues to sweep the UK, sales of vegan ready meals have leapfrogged their vegetarian equivalents. The Waitrose report is based on its supermarket and online sales this year, and a poll of 2,000 adults who shop across a range of retailers. It shows that sales of crumpets, once a humble teatime treat, have risen 30% this year, as chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi and Marcus Wareing have inspired shoppers with posh crumpets laden with lobster and cockle butter. Organic celery has also enjoyed a sales boost of 30%, thanks to juicing recipes from influencers which have made it an Instagram sensation. Skewered food is at the sharp end of fashion, as a result of street food trends and hipster kebab restaurants. Four out of five of the bestselling barbecue meat lines at Waitrose this year have been kebabs, while sales of metal skewers are up 9%. With Middle Eastern cookery also becoming more popular, searches for tahini – a paste made from ground sesame seeds and popular in Middle Eastern cooking – on Waitrose.com rose by 700%. Echoing this trend, sales of mixed pouches of grains such as chick peas, bulgar wheat, rice and quinoa for accompanying dishes are up by 36%. A fifth of British consumers report eating more spicy food, with 26% of people replacing salt on the table with chilli sauce or flakes – and even sprinkling chilli on ice-cream. One of the more unlikely new foods has been seaweed – including kelp, algae and nori – and another is the sea vegetable samphire, all of which add a distinctive savoury umami flavour to dishes. Searches for “aonori seaweed” are up 127% on waitrose.com. So-called “seaganism” – a vegan diet which includes sustainable seafood – has also become popular, as has “seacuterie” – a fish-based version of charcuterie using seafood which orginated in Australia. With a third of Britons now eating less meat and fish than they did two years ago, Waitrose said vegan ready-meals now account for 55% of sales of its ready-prepared meat and fish-free range, with vegetarian options making up less than half at 45%. Nearly one in three shoppers said they plan to reduce their consumption of meat and fish even more over the next two years, but when they do choose to put meat on their plates more than a quarter admit they want better quality products. Tor Harris, Waitrose head of corporate social responsibility, said: “We’re seeing a more considered approach to meat. Because some people are eating less of it, when they do eat it they want to really enjoy it. In the drinks aisle, the rise of craft beer means that sales of canned beer and lager now outstrip those in bottles. Ready-to-drink canned cocktails and wine in cans are also growing fast. Shoppers are also keen to drink pink, opting for blush gin , rosé wine, rosé vermouth and Cocchi Rosa, an Italian aromatised wine. Nearly one in 10 shoppers say they now take refillable containers to the supermarket for loose produce or deli items. • This article was amended on 6 November 2019 because an earlier version referred to the sea vegetable samphire as a seaweed.

2019-12-07T16:00:14Z,"Sorry, but I’ve lost my faith in tech evangelism",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/07/lost-my-faith-in-tech-evangelism-john-naughton,"For my sins, I get invited to give a few public lectures every year. Mostly, the topic on which I’m asked to speak is the implications for democracy of digital technology as it has been exploited by a number of giant US corporations. My general argument is that those implications are not good, and I try to explain why I think this is the case. When I’ve finished, there is usually some polite applause before the Q&amp;A begins. And always one particular question comes up. “Why are you so pessimistic?” The interesting thing about that is the way it reveals as much about the questioner as it does about the lecturer. All I have done in my talk, after all, is to lay out the grounds for concern about what networked technology is doing to our democracies. Mostly, my audiences recognise those grounds as genuine – indeed as things about which they themselves have been fretting. So if someone regards a critical examination of these issues as “pessimistic” then it suggests that they have subconsciously imbibed the positive narrative of tech evangelism. An ideology is what determines how you think even when you don’t know you’re thinking. Tech evangelism is an example. And one of the functions of an ideology is to stop us asking awkward questions. Last week Vice News carried another horrifying story about the dark underbelly of social media. A number of Facebook moderators – those who spot and delete unspeakable content uploaded to the platform – are suing the company and one of its subcontractors in an Irish court, saying they suffered “psychological trauma” as a result of poor working conditions and a lack of proper training to prepare them for viewing some of the most horrific content seen anywhere online. “My first day on the job,” one of them, Sean Burke, reported, “I witnessed someone being beaten to death with a plank of wood with nails in it.” A few days later he “started seeing actual child porn”. Facebook employs thousands of people like Burke worldwide, generally using subcontractors. All of the evidence we have is that the work is psychologically damaging and often traumatic. The soothing tech narrative is that Facebook is spending all this money to ensure that our social-media feeds are clean and unperturbing. So it’s an example of corporate social responsibility. The question that is never asked is, why does Facebook allow anybody to post anything they choose – no matter how grotesque – on its platforms, when it has total control of those platforms? You know the answer: it involves growth and revenues, and traumatisation of employees is just an unfortunate byproduct of its core business. They’re collateral damage. Or take machine learning, the tech obsession du jour. Of late, engineers have discovered that “bias” is a big problem with that technology. Actually, it’s just the latest manifestation of GIGO – garbage in, garbage out – except now it’s BIBO. And there’s a great deal of sanctimonious huffing and puffing in the industry about it, accompanied by trumpeted determination to “fix” it. The trouble is that, as Julia Powles and Helen Nissenbaum pointed out in a recent scorching paper, “addressing bias as a computational problem obscures its root causes. Bias is a social problem, and seeking to solve it within the logic of automation is always going to be inadequate.” But this idea – that bias is a problem for which there is no technological fix – is anathema to the tech industry, because it threatens to undermine the deterministic narrative that AI will be everywhere Real Soon Now and the rest of us will just have to get used to it. Worse still (for the tech companies), it might give someone the idea that maybe some kinds of tech should actually be banned because it’s societally harmful. Take facial recognition technology, for example. We already know that it is poor at recognising members of some ethnic groups and researchers are trying to make it more inclusive. But they still implicitly accept that the technology is acceptable. That tacit acceptance is actually buying into the tech-deterministic narrative, though. The question we should be asking – as the legal scholar Frank Pasquale says – is whether some of these technologies should be outlawed, or at least licensed for socially productive uses, like, say, radioactive isotopes are for medical purposes. And as regards some of the really dangerous applications of this stuff – for example face-classifying AI, which is already being explored (and, it seems, deployed in China as a way of inferring sexual orientation, tendencies toward crime, and so on just from images of faces – shouldn’t we be asking whether this kind of research should be allowed at all? And if anyone regards that as a pessimistic thought, then can I respectfully suggest that maybe they haven’t been paying attention? What I’ve been reading Listen up, libertarians Capitalism needs the state more than the state needs it – a terrific essay on Aeon by a great economist, Dani Rodrik. It should be required reading in Silicon Valley. His defects are manifest Big tech’s big defector: the title of an interesting New Yorker profile of Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who eventually saw the light, and is now repenting.

2019-10-10T18:35:23Z,BHP on brink of lobbying own goal in front of shareholders,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/oct/10/bhp-on-brink-of-lobbying-own-goal-shareholders-mining-fossil-fuel,"What’s the definition of victory at a shareholder meeting? The strict answer, when a simple majority is required, is one vote more than 50%. On that score, BHP looks safe. Early estimates suggest a resolution calling on the world’s biggest miner company to end its links to controversial lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry will attract support of only 20% or so. Yet such a victory for BHP’s board would be hollow. This is an Anglo-Australian FTSE 100 company whose chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, was widely praised for a speech in July in which he said global warming was “indisputable”. Mackenzie said BHP would spend $400m (£320m) on developing solutions to cut carbon emissions from its operations, which span iron ore, coal, aluminium, copper, uranium and oil. And, in a first for a large miner, he said the firm would set public goals next year to reduce “scope 3” emissions, meaning those generated by customers further down the economic chain. By the standards of the industry, BHP was seen as a leader. Yet, three months later, it finds itself in the firing line over an issue that looks the simplest to fix: cleaning up its lobbying operation by ensuring support is given only to bodies whose position is consistent with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. BHP was meant to have implemented such reforms as long ago as 2017. The Australian Centre for Corporate Social Responsibility, which filed the rebel resolution, says the company has failed to follow through. Standard Life Aberdeen agrees, more or less. “Failure to implement effective governance of its industry group lobbying activities serves to undermine the integrity of BHP’s climate leadership position and causes damage to its reputation,” Bill Hartnett, the investment firm’s stewardship director, said this week. Look at the big investment names in the same camp: Axa Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Aviva Investors,CalPERS from the US, ACTIAM, a big Dutch fund, and more. The Church of England’s pensions board, a high-profile member of the group, calculates that the declared rebels manage about £4.5tn of assets globally. That is some serious mainstream opposition. The row tends to focus on BHP’s membership of two organisations – the Minerals Council of Australia, the main lobby group for the country’s coal industry, and a related outfit called Coal21. For its part, BHP makes several arguments: that investors should wait for results of the latest review of membership of trade associations; that it got out of another body, the World Coal Association, after its 2017 study; and that “inside the tent” engagement has prodded Coal21 to change its constitution. Such pleas, though, feel too feeble, too finessed, and simply not what was promised. The last straw for the opponents seems to have been Coal21’s plan to launch a pro-coal advertising campaign in Australia, a tactic near-impossible to square with BHP’s public declarations on Paris. The first of two shareholder meetings takes place in London next week, so it’s not too late for the board to rethink. It should. BHP is on the brink of scoring a needless own goal. Dyson’s electric car was always going to be a struggle The sceptics were right. Designing and then building an electric car is hard, and has proved too hard for Dyson. The car itself was “terrific”, says Sir James, but commercial viability was out of reach. For the time being, it’s back to vacuum cleaners and hand dryers and, he hopes, pioneering new batteries. One must applaud the original ambition, of course, but the biggest obstacle always looked enormous – pure money. This was a £2.5bn venture, which sounds enormous until you remember what others are spending. Tesla, which has actual cars on actual roads, can still burn through $700m in an average quarter. Dyson was always going to struggle to match that spending. The Thomas Cook director with the most questions to answer Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business select committee, has started well with her Thomas Cook inquiry. She is summoning the company’s last three chief executives, the former chair, a brace of non-executives, the former chief financial officer and a pair of auditors. Do not, though, let the size of cast obscure a central point. Why didn’t Thomas Cook tap shareholders for more cash when its share price was flying (relatively) high. As late as May 2018, the company’s equity was worth £2bn and a £500m rights issue should have been possible. Frank Meysman, the chair for nine long years, is the director with most questions to answer. He was invisible when calamity struck.

2020-02-09T06:00:02Z,Michael Bloomberg is trying to buy the presidency – that should set off alarms | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/09/michael-bloomberg-donald-trump-presidential-election,"We haven’t seen his name on any of the ballots in the first four states, but that’s about to change. I’m talking, of course, about multibillionaire presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg has a chance of winning the presidency because his net worth is more than $60bn. The yearly return on $60bn is at least $2bn – which is what Bloomberg says he’ll pour into buying the highest office in the land. It’s hardly a sacrifice for him, but it’s a huge sacrifice for American democracy. Encouraged by the murky outcome from the Iowa caucuses and the notable lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, Bloomberg has decided to double his spending on TV commercials in every market where he is currently advertising, and expand his campaign field staff to more than 2,000. He’s not competing in the first four states with caucuses and primaries but focusing instead on 3 March. So-called Super Tuesday will be more super than ever because it now includes California, Texas, Virginia, Minnesota, North Carolina and Massachusetts – a third of all delegates to the Democratic convention. “It’s much more efficient to go to the big states, to go to the swing states,” Bloomberg told the New York Times. “The others chose to compete in the first four. And nobody makes them do it, they wanted to do it. I think part of it is because the conventional wisdom is, ‘Oh you can’t possibly win without them.’” Later, he added: “Those are old rules.” Yes, and the new rules are also to spend billions of your own money, if you have it. In January alone Bloomberg spent more than $300m on advertising for his campaign. That’s more than Hillary Clinton spent on advertising during her entire presidential run in 2016. It’s multiples of what all other Democratic candidates have spent, leaving even Tom Steyer, another billionaire, in the dust. The heart of Bloomberg’s campaign message is that he has enough money to blow Trump out of the water. As if to demonstrate this, Bloomberg bought a $10m Super Bowl ad that slammed Trump in the middle of the big game, then bashed Trump again in a national ad just hours before the State of the Union address. “The Real State of the Union? A nation divided by an angry, out of control president,” a narrator says. “A White House besotted by lies, chaos and corruption.” If Trump’s tweets are any barometer, Bloomberg’s tactics are getting under the thin-skinned president’s fragile epidermis. According to one Trump adviser, the president “thinks that money goes a long way” and those who believe Bloomberg has no hope are “underestimating him”. Another says Trump “takes money seriously. He’s a businessman.” The Democratic National Committee is ready to boost Bloomberg into the top tier. Last Friday it abandoned one of its criteria for getting on to the coveted debate stage – the individual-donor threshold, which was used for the first eight debates including this week’s event in New Hampshire – presumably because Bloomberg doesn’t take donations. To participate in the 19 February debate in Las Vegas, candidates will need to show at least 10% support in four polls released from 15 January to 18 February. Three candidates have met that threshold: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Bloomberg’s wall-to-wall advertising is giving him a good shot. Last Monday he tied with Warren for third place in a Morning Consult tracking poll. He’s in the top four in many Super Tuesday states. In Texas and North Carolina, he has overtaken Pete Buttigieg for fourth. He has the third-highest polling average in Florida, ahead of Warren, and fourth-highest in Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, whose primaries all fall after Super Tuesday. In the past week, polls have Bloomberg tied for second in New York and trailing only Biden in Missouri. He was also fourth in a Suffolk University poll of Utah, at 13%. Amazing what money will buy, if there’s enough of it. Bloomberg has some attractive public policy ideas: he’s for gun control, he wants to reverse climate change and he’s unveiled a plan to raise an estimated $5tn of new tax revenue from high earners and corporations, including a repeal of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and a new 5% “surcharge” on incomes above $5m a year. But he’s also a champion of Wall Street. He fought against the milquetoast reforms following the near-meltdown of 2008. His personal fortune is every bit as opaque as Trump’s. Through his dozen years as mayor of New York he refused to disclose his federal taxes. Even as a candidate for president, he still hasn’t given a date for their release. And, let’s not forget, he’s trying to buy the presidency. America has had some talented and capable presidents who were enormously wealthy – Franklin D Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt, John F Kennedy, for example. The problem lies at the nexus of wealth and power, where those with great wealth use it to gain great power. This is how oligarchy destroys democracy. The word “oligarchy” comes from the Greek word oligarkhes, meaning “few to rule or command”. It refers to a government of and by a few exceedingly rich people or families who control the major institutions of society. Oligarchs may try to hide their power behind those institutions, or excuse their power through philanthropy and “corporate social responsibility”. But no one should be fooled. An oligarchy is not a democracy. Even a system that calls itself a democracy can become an oligarchy if power becomes concentrated in the hands of a corporate and financial elite. Their power and wealth increase over time as they make laws that favor themselves, manipulate financial markets to their advantage, and create or exploit economic monopolies that put even more wealth into their pockets. Since 1980, the share of America’s wealth owned by the richest 400 Americans has quadrupled while the share owned by the entire bottom half of America has declined. The richest 130,000 families in America now own nearly as much as the bottom 90% – 117 million families – combined. The three richest Americans own as much as the entire bottom half of the population. According to Forbes, Michael Bloomberg is the eighth richest. All this has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the political power of the super-wealthy and an equally dramatic decline in the political influence of everyone else. Unlike income or wealth, power is a zero-sum game. The more of it at the top, the less of it anywhere else. In the election cycle of 2016, the richest one-hundredth of 1% of Americans – 24,949 extraordinarily wealthy people – accounted for a record 40% of all campaign contributions. By contrast, in 1980 the top 0.01% accounted for only 15% of all contributions. Make no mistake: the frustrations and insecurities that fueled Trump’s rise – and are still the basis of his support – have their origin in this power shift, which has left most Americans with a small slice of the nation’s prosperity and almost no voice in its politics. A half-century ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, those on the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. Those on the right sought greater reliance on the free market. But as power and wealth have moved to the top, everyone else – whether on the old right or the old left – has become disempowered and less secure. Today the great divide is not between left and right. It’s between democracy and oligarchy. Bloomberg is indubitably part of that oligarchy. That should not automatically disqualify him but it should set off alarms. If the only way we can get rid of the sociopathic tyrant named Trump is with an oligarch named Bloomberg, we will have to choose the oligarch. Yet I hope it doesn’t come to that. Oligarchy is better than tyranny. But neither is as good as democracy.

2019-07-18T14:25:45Z,Love Island is a ratings hit but a sustainable fashion disaster | Justine Porterie,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/love-island-fast-fashion-sustainable-new-outfit-bikini,"Like millions of viewers, I’m hopelessly addicted to Love Island in a way I never thought I would be. But my biggest problem is not so much with the show per se, it’s with fast fashion. Through omnipresent product placements and advertising, Love Island has turned into fast fashion’s biggest advocate. Every day, girls in the villa wear a new outfit, promoting the insidious idea that you cannot be seen in the same clothes twice. You can even shop for what the islanders wear in real time through the show’s app or via its partner I Saw It First, encouraging impulsive purchases. When Britons are already expected to buy 50m single-use outfits this summer, the show only adds fuel to the fire, or rather to the truckload of clothes that ends up in the landfill every second. The problem is our planet cannot take more £1 bikinis. When clothes are so cheap, they are usually made out of materials derived from plastic, such as polyester or nylon. These materials can take hundreds of years to decompose in a landfill, and release thousands of microfibres during each wash, which end up in our oceans. To keep costs down, the fast fashion industry has also been known for manufacturing in some of the lowest-wage countries, where labour and safety standards are particularly poor. Despite pledges for better working conditions in supply chains following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, this model remains prevalent today. Love Island has an incredible platform and the potential to influence millions of people. I wish the show used it to be a force for good, starting with fashion. The good news is there are a number of opportunities to get on the sustainable fashion path. Reducing our consumption of virgin fibres by reusing garments is essential to tackle the throwaway culture fast fashion promotes. More and more influencers are embracing the slow fashion movement, turning to what’s already in their wardrobe rather than buying new. If Emma Watson and Livia Firth proudly re-wear outfits on the most coveted red carpets, surely islanders could do the same in the villa. Far from the stigma it was once associated with, thrifting and upcycling are also becoming fashion statements. With the comeback of crafting, doing new with old is no longer seen as an odd thing to do. Wearing clothes that have had a previous life is an opportunity to look fashionable with one-of-a-kind pieces while reducing the need for new resources. Rather than a hundredth kissing challenge, what about harnessing the creative potential of our islanders behind a sewing machine? After taxis and hotels, the sharing economy is on its way to disrupt the fashion industry. New business models have arisen in the past 10 years making it possible to rent, borrow or swap clothes. Their success in the market shows that clothes do not need to be brand new to feel new to consumers. When new is the only option, alternatives to fast fashion do exist. A number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands have emerged, shedding a new light on the importance of better materials and fair working conditions in the supply chain. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has subtly turned into a sustainable fashion champion. It only takes one wear from her to make the sales of brands such as Veja or Reformation skyrocket. Could you imagine what would happen if Love Island did the same? It’s no secret that brand partnerships generate significant revenue for reality TV. But the climate crisis we are facing is very real too, and we know for a fact that fashion plays a key role in it. So now may be a good time for Love Island to embrace its corporate social responsibility, and rethink its partnership strategy in the light of the emergency.

2020-09-04T20:00:36Z,"Scott Morrison's friend, his Indigenous charity and the millions in defence contracts",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/05/scott-morrisons-friend-his-indigenous-charity-and-the-millions-in-defence-contracts,"On Valentine’s Day 2008, Scott Morrison, the man who was to become Australia’s first Pentecostal prime minister, rose to his feet to give his inaugural speech to parliament. He paid tribute “to those who have been instrumental in my journey” and had helped form “the values and the vision that I intend to bring to this house”. He moved on to name three “dedicated church leaders” who had “greatly assisted” him. They were Brian Houston of the evangelical mega-church Hillsong, the Reverend Ray Green, and Leigh Coleman. The Reverend Ray Green is a Uniting church minister. Morrison, with his parents, began his lifelong journey of faith in that church. Brian Houston is one of the world’s most powerful pastors, the founder and head of the Hillsong empire, which grew from its home in the west of Sydney to attract tens of thousands each week to celebrate in mega-churches around the world. Morrison’s relationship with Houston has been controversial. Houston was censured by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse for failing to report sexual abuse by his father. But the third man Morrison named in his maiden speech, Coleman, has remained largely obscured from public view. Yet just two years before Morrison entered parliament, Coleman’s work as CEO of Hillsong Emerge, the charitable arm of the Hillsong church, had been in the Labor party’s sights. Labor was probing the Howard government for vulnerabilities over its links to the mega-church amid fears Pentecostalism would lead to the rise of a new religious right. In 2005 and 2006 Leigh Coleman was mentioned many times in both the New South Wales and federal parliaments, but by the time Morrison stepped up in Canberra it seemed that nobody remembered him. But over the past five years Coleman’s name may have become more familiar in government procurement circles thanks to a company he founded and runs winning more than $43m in federal contracts, mostly from defence, while being a registered charity set up to address Indigenous unemployment and disadvantage. The company, ServeGate Australia, subcontracts the work out to conventional, almost entirely non-Indigenous consultancies and uses the profits to pay Coleman and other staff’s salaries so they can provide mentoring to a small number of Indigenous businesses. Two of the businesses being helped are run by ServeGate’s Aboriginal shareholders. The company’s website makes no mention of its charity status, and companies that received subcontracted work through ServeGate have told the Guardian they were not aware it was a charity. ServeGate said the website dated from before the company was a charity, and was soon to be refreshed. Coleman is a long-term family friend of the Morrison family. He says the last time he saw the prime minister was at the funeral for his father, John, “who I knew very well”. Before that, he had seen him only once in recent years, on a deeply personal matter. “I have certainly never used or misused my relationship with Mr Morrison.” ServeGate, he told the Guardian, is apolitical, and works with all sides of politics. Mentorship and microfinance Morrison has always been frank about his faith, and also insisted “the Bible is not a policy handbook”. But there are networks, both of people and ideas, that have informed him, and some of these are exemplified in the person of Coleman, who has spent his career in Christian-based charities operating in business mentorship and microfinance – providing small loans to the poor with the aim of helping them to start businesses or become self-employed. He has played a key role in bringing an idea originally aimed at the developing world to Australia, and to Indigenous communities. Particularly important is his work founding the charity Many Rivers, of which he was CEO until 2014. He left the board of Many Rivers to start ServeGate Australia. The Indigenous businesses that have been helped under the model give Coleman good reports. Daniel Browne, the public officer of the Sydney-based plant hire company Koori Cartage, says Coleman has given the business both spiritual and practical advice, and mediated contract negotiations with big companies such as Lendlease, after being introduced to ServeGate by the government agency Indigenous Business Australia. “Leigh has helped us businesswise and mentally and spiritually,” says Browne. “We had problems and I’d say ‘I’ve had enough,’ and he would say, ‘No, no, no, mate, hang in there, I’ll see what I can do.’ He pushed so hard for us, and never asked for a cent. …I love ServeGate to death.” Two other companies that ServeGate has helped are run by its Indigenous directors and shareholders – Hunter Valley man Victor Perry and West Australian Quinton Tucker. Perry, with his brother Laurie, runs the Wonnarua National Aboriginal Corporation in Singleton, and has a history of working with the coalmining industry, conducting Aboriginal cultural heritage assessments. The company he runs, Yunaga, provides civil and earthmoving services to the mining industry. He has also been a director of a group called United First People’s Syndications, which has described itself as unlocking Indigenous employment and business opportunities by brokering development on Aboriginal land. Perry said that he had known Coleman for years before he joined ServeGate and that Yunaga had benefited from business advice. “Aboriginal businesses need as much help as you can give them,” he said. Meanwhile ServeGate’s largest single shareholder is Tucker, who with his family has been a prominent Indigenous businessman in the Western Australian goldfields for many years. He is the head of the Burnna Yurrul Aboriginal Corporation (BYAC), also a charity, which has brokered labour hire contracts with the mining industry using the profits to provide training and housing for Indigenous mine workers. Tucker’s involvement with ServeGate follows a troubled period. In 2016 one of BYAC’s subsidiaries went into liquidation after a waste management contract with Glencore’s Murrin Murrin nickel mine was not renewed “by mutual agreement” according to Glencore. In the same year, the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations issued a compliance notice over a number of issues, including inadequate financial records and payments made but not supported by documentation. BYAC is still being monitored. Meanwhile, Coleman says that ServeGate is helping BYAC with “rebuilding their governance practices” as well as exploring new business opportunities. “We pick those that are most in need of help – not the easiest ones,” he said. Tucker did not respond to questions before deadline. Concerns about ‘black cladding’ There are in fact two companies called ServeGate. Only one of them is a charity. ServeGate Pty Ltd was established in September 2015, with Coleman and two co-founders, Bob Nattey and Roehl Oringo, as directors. They each hold an equal number of shares. This company, in turn, owned ServeGate Australia Pty Ltd, which was established two months later with the same directors. This is the company that is now a charity, and successfully pitching for government work. In late 2018, ServeGate Australia changed its ownership structure to introduce Perry and Tucker as shareholders and directors. The change meant that the company qualified as an Indigenous business, and so could benefit under government Indigenous procurement policies. The Indigenous Procurement Policy sets targets for business to go to Indigenous organisations, and mandates preferential treatment in some circumstances. Introduced in 2015, it has been a success, at least on paper. More than 1,000 Indigenous businesses have won over $1.084bn in commonwealth contracts since it started, compared to just 30 Indigenous businesses winning $6.2m in 2013. But the numbers obscure a problem. Supply Nation, the organisation that certifies businesses under the policy, has raised repeated concerns about what it calls “black cladding” – defined as non-Indigenous businesses “taking unfair advantage” of Indigenous organisations so as to benefit from the policy. In 2016, the former chair of the Prime Minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council, Warren Mundine, said white-founded companies were “scrambling” to set up joint ventures with Indigenous people, but it was unclear that this was seeing many Indigenous people benefiting, either from profits or jobs. ServeGate Australia, once it was majority Indigenous-owned, effectively had the front running for small contracts, and those in remote areas. “Defence has no option,” said one industry insider. “Everything is given a tick. They are on the panel, they are Indigenous, so effectively they tick all the boxes and they get the work.” Coleman denied this. He said that ServeGate gets its contracts because of the strength of its relationships with commonwealth government customers, built up over years by Oringo and Nattey in their previous jobs. ‘A very dear friend of mine’ Morrison’s maiden speech wasn’t the only time he praised Coleman. In May 2015, Morrison, then the minister for social services, told a Financial Counselling Conference about how, as a small boy, he had met the founder of the charity Opportunity International, David Bussau. “He has been a friend of my family and of me for many, many years.” This was the context, he said, in which he first met Coleman, “a very dear friend of mine”. Coleman was one of Bussau’s co-founding directors of Opportunity International and had “probably forgotten more about microenterprise development than most of us would remember”. “I remember as I would sit with Leigh and he would tell me the stories of lives changed,” he said. “It was tremendously empowering to hear these stories of him showing faith through the application and provision of a small loan to help someone realise their release from a life of welfare.” Coleman had “taken the learnings of Opportunity International” and how microfinance had “worked and worked and worked” in developing countries and was now applying it to Indigenous communities in Australia through his work for a charity he had founded, Many Rivers. Those who have worked with Coleman describe him as intensely well motivated as the result of his belief in the power of personal connections, and a conviction that his work is guided directly by God. Eduardo Jimenez is the current president of the Philippines microfinance charity Kabalikat Para Sa Maunlad na Buhay (Partner for a Progressive Life) or KMBI, and has worked with the Philippines central bank, the equivalent of our reserve bank, as a microfinance consultant. He met and worked with Coleman when he was with Opportunity International in the Philippines in the late 1990s. Jimenez, like most Filipinos, is a strong Christian, but Coleman, he recalls, was of a different order. Coleman believed his work in microfinance was being directly inspired by God. Recalls Jimenez: “He gave me goosebumps. “I remember we were walking one time in Makati (the business district of Manila) … he told me something like God had spoken to him and impressed upon him that I would be involved in changing the banking system in the Philippines … I am a follower of Jesus, but for the life of me I could not believe that God would do that.” Microfinance was booming on a wave of optimism about its potential for transformation in the lives of the poor. Even the World Bank was talking it up. But it soon became clear that the dream of tapping the entrepreneurial spirits of the poor with small loans was not a simple cure for structural disadvantage. By 2015, with the international industry worth between $60m and $100m, with an estimated 200 million clients, a World Bank research study concluded that the benefits were modest, and were unlikely to reach the poorest of the poor. None of this dimmed Coleman’s belief. From about 2001, while maintaining his personal connections with Opportunity International, he had moved on to work for the rapidly growing Hillsong church as CEO of its welfare arm, Hillsong Emerge. It was in this role that he first hit the headlines in controversies over federal government grants to Hillsong, leapt upon by Labor politicians. There were allegations he had taken advantage of an Aboriginal community organisation to get a grant, and concerns over whether money given for promoting Aboriginal business had been partly used for other programs of the Hillsong church. Coleman says today he has nothing to say about the old controversy concerning the Hillsong grants. He answered the claims and accusations at the time, including with a right of reply to the NSW parliament denying that he had taken advantage of the community organisation. “If any of the claims were brought to the authorities, they were certainly not pursued with me.” One grant was withdrawn, and two others discontinued, with work to establish microfinance pilots taken back in house to the government agency, Indigenous Business Australia. But once again, Coleman didn’t give up. By the time the Rudd Labor government came to power in 2007 – and Morrison was voted into parliament as the member for Cook – Coleman had left Hillsong Emerge and founded a new charity, Many Rivers Opportunity, with the express purpose of continuing the work that the federal government had dumped. It was to be his biggest success. The persistent theme of reviews of microfinance in Australia is that disadvantaged clients need intense ongoing support, and that this makes the model too expensive. Many Rivers claims to have cracked that nut. Its model, then as now, was to employ project officers to engage deeply with disadvantaged clients “walking alongside them” and assessing their suitability for business support. The Westpac bank provided the loans at its normal commercial rate of interest, but with Many Rivers standing as an effective guarantor. Government grants and corporate philanthropy funded the operating costs. Today Many Rivers claims to have helped 2,391 business owners since 2008. It has 38 microenterprise development managers over 32 regions of Australia. More recently, it has branched into Community Economic Development in regional and remote Aboriginal communities. The organisation has its critics. A case study of Many Rivers published by the academics Kelly Gerard and Melissa Johnston concluded there was little evidence that its model worked in lifting people from poverty. They argued that Many Rivers and other microfinance providers in developed countries benefited the banking, mining and retail sectors by boosting their corporate social responsibility credentials and, in the case of the banks, allowing them to access a difficult sector of the market effectively risk-free – because loans were usually guaranteed by the charities involved. Microfinance more broadly, they said, was a “key strategy in a neoliberal development policy, part of a suite of measures in welfare that had built a “poverty industry” while papering over the structural causes of disadvantage”. Federal government funding to Many Rivers, Coleman’s new venture, began under the Labor government, with a pilot program focusing on antidotes to the payday lenders who preyed on people who could not access conventional credit. When Morrison became the minister for social services at the end of 2014, the program shifted to being entirely about “microenterprise development”. Many Rivers got the bulk of the funding – a total of $6.74m over the life of the program, which has been extended and is now due to run until 2021. By last year, the Australian government had funded Many Rivers to the tune of $10m since its beginnings, including grants from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet’s Indigenous Advancement strategy, the Department of Social Services Community Development and Employment services programs, and the Australian Small Business Advisory Services program. Mining and resource companies have been some of the organisation’s best friends, contributing about $20m. Coleman says Many Rivers has proved that it represents value for money. Morrison talked the microenterprise program up at the Philanthropy meets Parliament Summit on 9 September 2015. He spoke of it as an example of his approach to social welfare, in terms which have since become familiar. “I will often say that the best form of welfare is a job, it is also a business – a business that that person can start and create and free them from a life where their choices will be constrained by the welfare system. They are empowered economically through their own initiative and enterprise.” It was a sentiment with which Coleman would only agree, but by now Coleman had left Many Rivers and moved on – to found yet another organisation putting those ideals into action. ServeGate Australia, the company to become an unconventional charity, was formed two months after Morrison’s speech. •This article was amended on 26 January, 2021, to correct the name of the Murrin Murrin mine",Australian politics; Scott Morrison; Indigenous Australians; Welfare; Australian economy; Business; Australia news,Australia news
2019-11-12T18:25:53Z,Is carbon neutrality the silver bullet fashion has been hoping for?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/12/is-carbon-neutrality-the-silver-bullet-fashion-has-been-hoping-for,"Tiny clutch bags, conceptual knitwear and carbon neutrality – the ideas that fashion chooses to embrace each season aren’t always those you might expect. But thanks to a recent shift, no doubt spurred on by the “Greta Thunberg effect”, carbon – as well as the practice of offsetting it – has become a hot topic for many of the biggest names in the fashion industry. At New York fashion week in September, luxury fashion designer Gabriela Hearst staged fashion’s first carbon-neutral catwalk show. Hot on its heels, Gucci announced it would go carbon neutral with chief executive, Marco Bizzarri, stating that “the planet has gone too far”. Next up, luxury fashion conglomerate Kering, owner of big-name brands such as Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, announced that its entire group would offset 2.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide in a bid to “become carbon-neutral within its own operations and across the entire supply chain.” It’s not just high-fashion that is looking to cut the size of its carbon footprint. In April, footwear brand Allbirds announced it would impose a carbon tax on itself. Not long after, San Francisco-based fashion company Everlane reported it had come up with a pair of carbon-neutral trainers. A small section of the industry is going one step further. October saw the launch of a brand called Sheep Inc, which is hoping to be the “world’s first carbon negative brand”, offsetting tenfold its emissions via investment in biodiversity projects. Another recent innovation has seen the creation of clothes made from what have been gorily called “carbon-sucking organisms”. Defined as “calculating your total climate-damaging carbon emissions, reducing them where possible, and then balancing your remaining emissions, often by purchasing a carbon offset: paying to plant new trees or investing in “green” technologies such as solar and wind power,” carbon neutrality is something some labels have been talking about for years. US brand Reformation has been describing itself as carbon neutral since 2015 and Ganni, a mid-range Scandinavian brand popular with millennial floaty frock lovers, introduced “climate compensated” clothing in 2016. Its website explained: “In order to do business, we can’t completely eradicate our emissions but we monitor our impact, reduce what we can and climate compensate the rest.” Carbon neutrality as fashion must-have hasn’t happened in a vacuum. The industry, which is responsible for “around 10% of all global greenhouse gas emissions,” according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has come under increasing scrutiny. If it were to continue to grow at current rates, it could use more than a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget by 2050. But is carbon neutrality and offsetting, with which brands are hoping to repent for decades of wrongs, the silver bullet many will be hoping for? “Carbon footprint” – an oft-repeated phrase that attempts to simplify the idea of how much carbon any given activity emits into the atmosphere – is far from simple to calculate. Flights are an easier prospect – as Maxine Bédat, founder of the New Standard Institute, recently told Vogue: “You can calculate the carbon footprint of a flight, but in terms of [the carbon footprint of] a fashion show, that data doesn’t exist.” Gabriela Hearst, for instance, factored in production, design, catering, power, waste and more. It can also prove tricky to calculate carbon emissions when it comes to clothes themselves. “Historically, brands have not had very good oversight or control of their supply chains,” says Alice Wilby, a sustainable fashion consultant. “How are you going to start implementing environmental audits like this? You’ve got to consider absolutely everything, from where your material is grown or sewn through to how it is turned into fabric, how it’s manufactured and how it’s transported.” Gucci acknowledges these difficulties, but is keen to push past them. “If we wait to be perfect, in terms of the calculation of impact or methodology, to me it’s just an excuse for not doing it,” said Bizzarri at the time of the brand’s carbon-neutral announcement. “More and more, we just need to act.” There have been problems with the offsetting schemes too. Companies carrying them out on behalf of the brands have come under fire – for reasons including claims of fraudulent activity, to causing damage to the communities living around their projects. With a lot of offsetting happening in developing countries, “there’s a track record of environmental and human rights abuses occurring,” says Wilby, “because of offsetting projects being set up in areas where indigenous rights are not respected and lands are used without approval.” Since the WWF and others set up Gold Standard, an organisation designed to ensure the integrity of these projects, the hope is that these schemes are improving. For its critics, offsetting can distract from the task of reducing carbon output in the first place, even when done responsibly. “It is important to note that offsetting isn’t actually tackling the reduction of a company’s footprint,” says Ilishio Lovejoy, project manager for policy and research at Fashion Revolution. “It is making the overall global situation ‘less bad’ by ‘doing good’ somewhere else.” Many of its naysayers also note the fact that offsetting prioritises lessening guilt over reducing actual harm. There is a privilege involved in being able to pay away your carbon, whether as a consumer or a company. Writing on the broad subject of carbon offsets as far back as 2006, Guardian writer George Monbiot compared it with the ancient Catholic church’s practice of selling indulgences. “It can send the message that, if you have enough money to buy your way out of the damage you are causing, you don’t need to take action or act as quickly to change your own practices,” says Lovejoy. Sara Arnold, a member of Extinction Rebellion’s fashion wing, says that “it’s better for companies to do it rather than to not do it, but let’s call it what it is: CSR [corporate social responsibility]. And that CSR shouldn’t be used to make people feel like their purchases don’t have an environmental impact.” For Sheep Inc’s founder Edzard van der Wyck, one problem is that carbon neutrality falls short. With the fashion industry growing more rapidly than the efforts to improve its environmental impact can keep up with, “the idea that we’re talking about carbon neutrality as this alpha and omega of sustainability is troubling”. Steps will need to be bold if fashion is going to clean up its act. Van der Wyck is sceptical of companies’ altruism. “If you look at how Gucci recently said it had invested $8.4m in a carbon-offsetting project … that’s 0.2% of their earnings … then Notre Dame catches fire and the next day [they donate] €200m.” He also thinks that companies need to be making sure their manufacturing is running on renewable energy, using the right, recyclable, materials. Carbon neutrality might, says Wilby, sound sexy – and she believes “it can work as part of a larger programme” – but without reducing carbon output “it cannot be the final goal. It just can’t.”",Fashion; Life and style; Climate crisis; Environment; Business; Retail industry,Fashion
2019-10-18T06:00:46Z,"Lawsuits, payouts, opioids crisis: what happened to Johnson & Johnson?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/18/johnson-and-johnson-opioids-lawsuits-product-recalls,"For decades, consumers worldwide have named the $347bn pharmaceutical behemoth Johnson &amp; Johnson as one of its most trusted brands. The company returned the favor, instilling its commitment to corporate social responsibility in a 75-year-old “credo” inscribed at company headquarters. “We believe our first responsibility is to the patients, doctors and nurses, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality.” The company has been a household name for more than 100 years with a reassuringly cozy image as the quintessential family brand of baby powder, baby shampoo and the maker of Band-Aids. But it is also the name behind a huge range of drugs and medical devices. And in recent years it has been clobbered by lawsuits and huge payouts involving a dizzying array of products, from an anti-psychotic drug to that famous talcum powder and even a patented opium poppy called Norman. Now, experts are concerned that one of the world’s most recognizable names and most reliable and valuable companies is caught in no less than an existential crisis, and the public is asking: what happened to Johnson &amp; Johnson? A series of product misfires and court judgments – with a potential 50,000 more to come and total potential liabilities of $15bn – is challenging both public trust and investor faith. The pharma giant has seen its reputation drop steadily from ninth place to 57th out of 58 leading pharmaceutical companies since 2014, according to one study by the UK reputation intelligence company Alva. Last week a jury in Philadelphia awarded $8bn in punitive damages to a man claiming that the company did not warn young men that taking its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal could cause them to grow breasts. After the judgment, which the company said it plans to appeal, lawyers for the plaintiff said: “Johnson &amp; Johnson is a company which has lost its way” and the jury had chosen to impose punitive damages “on a corporation that valued profits over safety and profits over patients”. Meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson went through five years of litigation over claims it failed to warn customers that its blood-thinner Xarelto increased the risk of internal bleeding. In March, Johnson &amp; Johnson and co-maker Bayer agreed to pay $775m to settle about 25,000 lawsuits, though neither of the companies admitted liability. In July, Johnson &amp; Johnson asked a judge in Trenton, New Jersey, to dismiss as many as 14,000 lawsuits alleging its talc-based baby powder causes ovarian cancer. According to the complaints, which have been moving through the legal system since 1999, the company failed to inform the FDA that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc – in one case at levels reported as “rather high”. Previous efforts to settle the cases have had mixed results and last year, a Missouri jury ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay $4.69bn to 22 women. Johnson &amp; Johnson says its baby powder is safe and does not cause cancer. And on Thursday, the company agreed to a $117m multi-state US settlement over allegations it deceptively marketed its pelvic mesh products, which support women’s prolapsed pelvic organs, but allegedly caused many cases of bleeding, pain and infections. An investigation concluded that the company violated state consumer protection laws by not fully disclosing the devices’ risks. But none of those risk as much discomfort as the company’s role in the US opioids crisis, which has claimed 400,000 lives. Earlier this month, it settled a major lawsuit in a significant climbdown over its prescription painkiller business, just weeks before a multibillion-dollar trial over the public health epidemic. Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay two Ohio counties a total of $20m to avoid the first in a series of federal trials testing whether opioid painkiller manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains are culpable for the worst drug crisis in US history. Although the settlement was relatively small, it potentially opens the door to payouts totaling billions of dollars to 2,000-plus other counties, municipalities and Native American tribes suing over the damage caused by the crisis. Dozens of states are also suing. This all follows a ruling in August when the company lost a civil trial over opioids, where a court in Oklahoma ordered it to pay $572m to the state. The judgment, considered a bellwether, was a defeat for the company on principle but was welcomed by investors who had feared an award as high as $2bn. The company said it would appeal against the ruling. While Johnson &amp; Johnson’s stock rose 2% after the verdict, the judgment presented a public relations problem for the company. In addition to selling Duragesic fentanyl patches through a subsidiary, Johnson &amp; Johnson had earned richly as a leading supplier of the opioid in Purdue Pharma’s prescription painkiller OxyContin, developing a special strain of poppy, called Norman, in its opium fields in Australia. The Johnson family are no longer major stakeholders in the company founded by Robert Wood Johnson in 1886, but the family interest is still valued at $6.3bn, putting them at #46 on Forbes’ richest families list. Senior patriarch Woody Johnson is the US ambassador to the Court of St James in Britain. But the family has avoided personal opprobrium, unlike billionaire members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma and have been personally sued and targeted by direct action protests over their philanthropy, led by the American art photographer Nan Goldin. “My problem with Johnson &amp; Johnson is that they did not give appropriate information with regard to the opioids they were distributing,” says Gail Box, whose son Austin was a University of Oklahoma football star who was prescribed opioid painkillers after back surgery and died of an overdose aged 22. “Johnson &amp; Johnson were not upfront about the risks,” says Box, whose husband Craig testified at the Oklahoma trial. “They said possibly 1% of people taking opioids would become addicted when they knew the number was far greater.” The opioids and Risperdal cases have meant a rough 2019 for Johnson &amp; Johnson. “The company has cultivated this reputation as this family-friendly, public-minded company, but these cases suggest otherwise,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “So there’s a huge public relations problem … there are 14,000 other cases involved with Risperdal, 15,000 talc cases, 25,000 pelvic mesh cases and possibly thousands of opioid-related lawsuits to follow. They can’t litigate all of them, so are they going to settle?” Looking back to the 1980s, says crisis management expert Bill Moran, Johnson &amp; Johnson set the standards for corporate responsibility with its swift handling of the crisis when cyanide-laced Tylenol (the company’s branded paracetamol) killed seven in a bottle-tampering spree, quickly withdrawing the product and redesigning the bottle amid a public awareness campaign. But now, Moran said: “With so many legal judgments against them they’re facing an existential crisis.”",Business; Opioids crisis; Law (US); Pharmaceuticals industry; Opioids; US news; Law,Business
2019-10-15T11:59:39Z,'We put 20 tons of nuts in the post': meet TV's most extreme superfans,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/15/we-put-20-tons-of-nuts-in-the-post-meet-tvs-most-extreme-superfans,"Modern fandom can seem an alien concept. Gone are the teens penning heartfelt letters to their favourite pinups. Today’s fans – or “stans”, named after the Eminem song about an obsessive stalker – are an online army ready to take on anyone that might threaten the object of their adoration. Most recently, fans of the cult Netflix show The OA have mounted a global campaign to have it reinstated after it was cancelled in August. Their tactics have taken fanaticism to the extreme: one demonstrator has even gone on hunger strike. Fandom and TV have long gone hand-in-hand. The television fan movement was arguably born with the 1966 campaign to keep a little-known new series named Star Trek on air. After low ratings for the first two seasons, NBC was ready to relegate the show to the trashpile. Hearing the news, husband and wife Betty Jo and John Trimble organised one of the first grassroots fan campaigns, kicking off a letter-writing chain that amassed over 110,000 missives and which led to the renewal of the show. Other fans have been far more extreme. Post-apocalyptic show Jericho was cancelled by CBS after one season in 2006, prompting its stans to send 20 tons of nuts to the network’s offices in protest. Inspired by a line from the final episode – predictably, “nuts” – the outpouring of nut-based feeling got the show one more season (albeit before it was axed again.) Sticking with the foodstuffs, sci-fi series Roswell was kept on-air for four seasons of plummeting ratings after fans bombarded its channel with bottles of Tabasco. As part of the “Roswell is Hot” petition, it is estimated that over 3,000 bottles of hot sauce were sent in total, until the campaign ran out of heat and the show was cancelled for good in 2002. When NBC threatened to axe high-school football drama Friday Night Lights in 2007, fans started sending streams of lightbulbs to their offices, as well as eye drops – a reference to the Dillon Panthers’ motto: “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” They saved the show for three more seasons. In 2018, the Andy Samberg-starring cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine was rescued from cancellation following a massive Twitter backlash centring around the hashtag #SaveB99. The same year, another Twitter campaign ensured a two-and-a-half hour marathon finale for the cancelled Wachowskis’ sci-fi series Sense8. Obscure tactics aside, what prompts such visceral reactions to these shows? For self-described “Brooklyn Nine-Nine fanatic” Jack Cartwright, it was much more than just an easy watch. “It might seem overblown to say this, but TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine genuinely provide an escape from the often brutal day-to-day of work and responsibility,” he says. “When it was cancelled, I had to get involved to try and keep it on air.” Cartwright, who is 27 and based in Leeds, turned to Twitter, regularly posting #SaveB99 and encouraging others to sign petitions to show the huge appetite for more. “When it got picked up by NBC, I was ecstatic,” he says. “It shows that while places like Twitter can be a toxic online space, they can also be a community for real, positive change.” Cartwright was joined in posting his support by celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Guillermo Del Toro – with Miranda eventually landing a guest spot on the renewed series. Showrunner Dan Goor responded to the campaign, calling them “the best fans in the world.” For fans of The OA, though, the future is still uncertain. Created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij in 2016, the sci-fi show centres around the reappearance of Prairie Johnson, a young blind woman missing for seven years who returns with her sight restored, now calling herself The OA. Cancelled after two seasons, the show built a dedicated following with many fans identifying with the diverse characters, including transgender Buck and disabled Dr Marlow Rhodes. When the cancellation was announced, “discord groups” sprung up to organise flash mob protests at Netflix offices and coordinate calls to the company, as well as fundraise $5,000 for a huge #SavetheOA billboard in New York’s Times Square. The campaign has the feel of an insurgent political movement, yet it’s all for a television programme. “I had never been so moved by TV,” fan and season-two OA writer Claire Kiechel says. “I didn’t know TV was able to do what The OA was doing – it thrilled my imagination, and gave me solace and hope at a time I had lost it.” She believes the outpouring tapped into the deeper meaning the programme had for many. “The cancellation of a show which, for a lot of people had become a therapeutic totem or beacon of hope, can feel especially personal,” she says. “What’s happening with the Save the OA movement is a microcosm of what’s happening in our larger society – the youth climate strikes, the calls for corporate social responsibility. We’re all looking at the narratives we’ve been living in and finding them lacking, and asking if we can come together for a better world. Stories matter and there is a moral responsibility that comes with telling them.” The responsibility is so marked that one OA fan, Emperial Young, decided to go on hunger strike outside Netflix’s LA offices for a month – taking Sundays off – to protest her belief in its wider implications for society. “If nothing else I hope people can come away with the idea that art has an important place in the world,” says Young. “A lot of entertainment is feeding into the cycle of despondency, reinforcing the idea that we are powerless. The OA helps fight the hopelessness. Narrative can be a driving force that shapes reality.” Nonetheless, Netflix has been unresponsive to the protests, while creator Marling seems to have cryptically confirmed the end of the show with a lengthy Instagram post, saying how the fans’ efforts have become its new driving force – something greater than the series itself. Perhaps this, not tons of nuts or light bulbs, is the legacy of fandom: creating communities beyond the shows they formed around. “TV execs are losing out on a great opportunity – instead of seeing fandoms as enemies, they should collaborate with them,” says Kiechel. “Regardless of what happens with the show, I am lucky to be a part of this community and relearn what I knew as a child: art changes people. A story can give you the container, the metaphor, the name you’ve been missing all your life.” McDonough is still helping to run the Save the OA campaign, mobilising their 1 million YouTube subscribers to fundraise and arrange flash mobs. Her message is clear: “We will keep going as long as it takes.” • This article was amended on 16 October 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the actor Andy Samberg as Adam Samberg.

2019-04-25T00:46:31Z,Chinese star Fan Bingbing reappears after nearly a year in wilderness,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/fan-bingbing-china-star-reappears-after-nearly-a-year-in-wilderness,"The Chinese megastar Fan Bingbing has appeared in public for the first time in almost a year, after a mysterious disappearance from the public eye believed to be linked to charges of tax evasion. Fan, who is one of China’s highest-profile actors, appeared at a Beijing gala on Monday night in honour of iQiyi, a popular video-streaming platform. This is the first sighting of the 37-year-old actor since July 2018, when she visited a children’s hospital. She stopped posting on all social media accounts around the same time. Fan, who has had a career spanning two decades and is best known in the west for her role in X-Men: Days of Future Past, posted a picture of herself on the red carpet of the iQiyi event on Instagram. It is Fan’s second Instagram post since 23 May 2018, after a post in February in honour of Chinese New Year. Fan’s disappearance from social media and public appearances, perplexed the world last year, sparking rumours she had fled China, was in prison or was under house arrest amid rumours of possible wrongdoing. Fan’s reappearance was met with mixed reactions. Her post about the event on Instagram received more than 170,000 likes, with people commenting that they were pleased to see her again. “She is back!” wrote one follower. However, SupChina reports that users of Chinese social media network Weibo reacted in an “overwhelmingly negative” way to the news, with comments including: “How dare she come back?”, “So we just pretend nothing happened?” and “These scandalous celebrities should be forever discarded by the audience!” In October, Fan was fined for tax evasion and she and her related companies were ordered to pay about 883m yuan ($129m) in fines and unpaid taxes after authorities found she failed to pay about 255m yuan in dues, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Fan apologised on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform, saying: “I sincerely apologise to everyone. As a public person I should be in compliance with the law and be an example for society and the industry. In the face of economic benefits, I should not lose my restraint and forsake administrative procedures that lead to violations of the law. “Without the [Communist] party and the state’s good policies, without the love from the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing,” she wrote. In September, concerns about Fan intensified when she scored zero out of 100 in the social responsibility category in the 2017-18 China Film and Television Star Social Responsibility Report, compiled by Beijing Normal University and the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Corporate Social Responsibility Research Institute. The study was believed to be an indication of the lack of favour Fan was held in by the administration and came amid a wider push by China’s Communist leaders to crack down on the entertainment industry and curb what it sees as “promoting money worship”, “distorting social values” and “misleading young people to blindly chase celebrities”.",China; Asia Pacific; Culture,World news
2020-01-18T07:00:21Z,Plane wrong: how your bosses should cut back on flights,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/18/plane-wrong-how-your-bosses-should-cut-back-on-flights,"Is your employer having the conversation about cutting back on flying? While activist Greta Thunberg’s emotionally charged speeches around the globe have gained headlines so, too, has her decision to shun air travel in favour of train and boat journeys, no matter how arduous. With flying one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions, more people are following Thunberg’s lead and rethinking the way they travel. But it’s not just about holidays – business trips are a big contributor to the problem, and discussions are taking place at companies up and down the UK about flying less and “clean travel” options. But with the value of the global business travel market forecast to increase from $1.3tn (£1tn) in 2017 to almost $1.7tn by 2023, according to an Allied Market Research report issued in November 2018, will large numbers of businesses really start to rethink the need to jet across from the UK to New York to set up a deal, or fly from London to Dublin for a meeting? The often exorbitant cost of train travel means that in cold, hard financial terms, it might be difficult to argue against, say, a £40 return flight from London to Edinburgh versus £240 on the train. And what about long-distance commuting to work? This week’s media coverage of airline Flybe’s woes brought a reminder that many of its passengers are weekly commuters hopping on flights to and from mainland Europe. “With more and more companies making their own ‘net zero’ pledges, business travel is bound to come under the spotlight before long,” says Cait Hewitt, deputy director of campaigning organisation Aviation Environment Federation. “We’re starting to get inquiries from the business travel-buying community (corporate travel buyers) to discuss what they should be doing about the impact of climate change on travel.” Some companies have taken action or are working on it, though it is fair to say that when Guardian Money tried to talk to large and medium-sized companies about business flights, many didn’t want to chat. However, some were prepared to spill the beans. London-based Lawson Conner, part of the IQ-EQ group, provides services and software to financial firms, and says it has reduced business flights by 75% over the last two years. “I used to fly quite a lot – I’d probably take about eight flights a month, travelling to Singapore and Hong Kong,” says Gerhard Grueter, co-founder and managing director of Lawson Conner, which employs 50 people in the UK. “That’s now completely cut.” The business has a “one person” international travel policy, where only one member of staff is allowed to attend global business meetings. The reduction in flights has, in part, only been possible because the company has offices around the world. “If clients are being served locally, if someone wants to speak to me, I don’t need to fly to New York – it’s not necessary,” says Grueter, adding: “If I was asked ‘what did you do in your job as a senior member in a firm, about the impact on the environment?’, I want to be able to respond. We have got to act now.” Two years ago, the engineering professional services firm WSP set itself a target in the UK to become carbon neutral by 2025. This involved tackling business flights, which have seen a 9% fall domestically, and a 16% drop overall. In 2018 it introduced an initiative encouraging non-travel and low-carbon alternatives rather than driving and flying, and banned flights under 250 miles. “When our staff book travel online, a pop-up asks whether they need to travel or could they use Skype,” says Claire Gott, UK head of corporate social responsibility (CSR) at WSP. “Also, our admin staff have been trained to challenge any travel. The first choice is by rail.” There’s also an internal carbon levy of £50 a flight on all domestic air travel, to be increased to £200 a trip, with this invested in CSR activities. Sabine Zetteler, owner of communications agency Zetteler, is on a mission to reduce flights taken by her 10-strong company. Zetteler says the London-based business has clients exhibiting all over the world, so in some cases flying can’t be avoided, but for short trips and design fairs, it plans to find more carbon-efficient means. For instance, in April 2019, five of the team travelled by train to Milan Design Week. “It took 12 hours longer and cost a few hundred extra financially, but it was liberating, bonding and important for us to try,” says Zetteler. As for this year, the company plans to visit fewer places and share the carbon offset charge for international meetings that can’t be avoided. Organisations, such as universities, are also looking at what they can do. Sion Pickering, social responsibility and sustainability projects coordinator at Edinburgh University, says business travel accounts for a sizeable proportion of its carbon emissions. “In 2018 during term time, staff and students travelled more than 66m business miles, emitting more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent),” he explains. “This is approximately 20% of our carbon emissions, and our third highest source after emissions from the electricity and gas we use to heat and power our campuses.” The university has already started discussions about whether the number of travellers can be reduced, and whether additional value can be found by extending trips slightly to combine multiple engagements. “By helping departments to understand how much they travel, we have started to increase awareness,” says Pickering. This year the university plans to introduce a series of measures to reduce emissions from business travel. A perk of taking the train: two extra days’ holiday Some businesses have signed up to Climate Perks, a new scheme that works with climate-conscious employers to offer at least two paid “journey days” per year to staff who travel on holiday by train, coach or boat instead of flying. These are for people to use to travel to and from their holiday destination. More than 30 companies have signed up so far, according to the charity Possible (formerly known as 10:10 Climate Action), which launched the scheme. These are for people to use to travel to and from their holiday destination. Crucially, these days don’t come out of your annual leave allocation – so if, say, you get 25 days’ holiday a year, you get those extra travel days on top of that. More than 30 companies have signed up so far, according to the charity. In return, employers receive accreditation “in recognition of their climate leadership”. “When it comes to cutting plane travel, the solution must be based in behavioural and social change because there is no real technological solution for cutting aviation emissions,” says Emma Kemp at Possible. Although it recently signed up to Climate Perks, the ethical insurer Naturesave launched a similar initiative more than a decade ago for trips to Europe. “In recent years we have seen it grow,” says the marketing manager, Nick Oldridge. “Over the period we have run the policy, a quarter of staff have taken advantage of the benefit each year, resulting in an additional one or two days’ annual leave per person.” While he concedes there is a cost associated with this, there are undoubtable benefits. “Those who use the scheme have reported they enjoyed their holidays more and rediscovered the pleasure of travel,” he says. “They are also proud of being able to demonstrate to their friends and relatives that they have an employer who takes environmental issues seriously.” One employee taking advantage of the scheme is finance manager Abha Wells, who has used it for trips to Scotland and Belgium during the past two years. “Not only was it better for the environment, but we were also able to take our bikes, which made it even better. Now the climate emergency has become so critical, I am planning to take more trips overland using the extra days from our policy.” While carbon offsetting is offered by airlines and others, Cait Hewitt of Aviation Environment Federation says this isn’t the answer to reducing emissions. “Offsetting might look like a cheap and easy response to the climate change impacts of business flights, but while a well-run scheme will do some good elsewhere in the world, it does nothing to solve the problem of aviation emissions.” “There are no green flights on the market today. Rather than offsetting, businesses should look hard at how to cut back on flight numbers, change staff expectations about flying, and then maybe put the money they have saved towards research and development into genuine solutions for zero carbon aviation, whether that’s zero carbon fuel, electric aircraft, or technologies for capturing and locking away CO2 from the air once it’s emitted.” Some of the things businesses and employees can do • Think about whether it’s essential to travel. Could you join the meeting by conference or video call? Is there someone who lives or works nearer to the event or meeting who could go? • If you have to go, could you get there by train? Any extra costs compared with flying can sometimes be offset by travelling on an overnight train and avoiding the cost of a hotel room. • If you do fly, travel economy (a business class seat has around three times the CO2 impact compared with economy, as a result of the extra space and weight it occupies, says the Aviation Environment Federation). • Try to choose the most efficient airline for the route. As well as showing you prices, websites such as Skyscanner display which flights are “greener” because they emit less CO2. This calculation is based on aircraft type, capacity and number of stops. • Don’t encourage extra flying by letting staff keep air miles.

2019-06-04T18:27:39Z,Packaging-free trial: Waitrose hits the ground running,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/04/packaging-free-trial-waitrose-hits-the-ground-running,"“We’d sold out of porridge oats and muesli by lunchtime and fusilli pasta is getting low,” said Tor Harris, pointing to the rainbow-like row of 28 vertical perspex dispensers filled with dried foods from red lentils to pumpkin seeds and quinoa. Harris, head of corporate social responsibility for Waitrose, was striding the aisles at the store in central Oxford to gauge customers’ reactions to the first day of the upmarket grocer’s most groundbreaking green initiative to date, aiming to reduce unnecessary packaging and single use plastics. “The idea is to find out how far our customers are prepared to shop in a completely different way and just how far they will change their behaviour,” she said. The shake-up – part of an 11-week trial – starts at the store entrance, where the cellophane wrap has been removed from all flowers and indoor plants and replaced with 100% recyclable craft paper and fibre-based pots. For those who have arrived unprepared for the opportunity to ditch all conventional packaging, reusable plastic containers are for sale ranging from tiny pots to 3.6-litre food canisters. In the fresh fruit and vegetable section, packaging has been removed from 160 lines – 75% of Waitrose’s fresh produce offering. Dozens of lettuce heads spill over a display, like a market stall. Pak choi, mangetout and spinach are piled high. Customers can put them in compostable bags or reusable cotton bags. Soft fruits and tomatoes, which are vulnerable to damage, are contained in cardboard punnets. At the back of the store is the refill station – where customers can bring in their own containers, tubs and jars to stock up on dried goods – with a 15% saving on the packaged alternative. Containers are weighed separately and the price is then calculated and printed on a barcoded sticker for payment at the checkout. Four different wines and four beers are available on tap to take home in reusable bottles. Customers can also grind any of four coffees to take away, while a large freezer contains loose frozen fruit. Ecover washing up liquids can be bought from a refill fixture. Waitrose chose Oxford for the experiment, according to Rachel Edmonds, the company’s customer proposition manager, “because it is a large and busy store, and one where we know there is a wide range of different shopping styles – everything from a major weekly shop to popping in for the ingredients for the evening meal.” Customers will be asked for feedback on the retailer’s website, Twitter and Instagram and the findings will determine which of the ideas will be rolled out to other stores. Customers were curious about the changes, and having heard about the initiative on the radio or from their newspapers, had arrived with their own containers from home. Hundreds of hand-written notes had been posted on to two noticeboards that asked for suggested improvements. “It would be better if cider was on tap,” read one. Pam Matthew, who lives nearby in Cumnor Hill, bought a bag of pumpkin seeds for £1.55. “I’d normally have to buy a much bigger bag than that, when I don’t need very much. I like the refill idea, but I’m a little bewildered by it and it is a bit time-consuming. Until I get used to it all it’s going to take me longer to do my shopping.” Claudia Reed, an accountant from Poland, said she was an instant convert. “It’s all very easy to use. We have refill systems back home in Poland and it makes so much sense” she said, weighing her bag of frozen blueberries, which cost 50p per 100g. “It’s greener and cheaper.” Christine Jacques, who was shopping with her daughter Katy, said she was more sceptical. “I think it’s going to take a long time to get used to. It actually feels quite old-fashioned. But it’s a matter of learning as you go along.” The supermarket has pledged to remove black plastic – the one used for microwave meal trays – from all its own-brand products by the end of 2019, and recently launched the world’s first home compostable ready meal packaging. Environmental campaigners welcomed the initiative. Daniel Webb, of the campaign group Everyday Plastic, said: “Offering less packaging through refill initiatives at major supermarkets presents a massive step towards reducing the amount of plastic being thrown away. Let’s cross our fingers that other supermarkets will follow.”",Plastic free; Waitrose; UK news; Retail industry; Business; Oxford,Society
2019-04-29T12:41:27Z,"Ferrexpo finance chief sold £400,000 stake on eve of share slump",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/29/ferrexpo-finance-chief-sold-400000-stake-on-eve-of-share-slump,"The chief financial officer of scandal-hit mining company Ferrexpo sold shares worth more than £400,000 the day before the FTSE 250 mining company lost almost a third of its market value. Chris Mawe sold 150,000 shares worth a total of £402,045 on Thursday, hours before accounting firm Deloitte resigned as auditor following a scandal surrounding potential misappropriation of money paid by Ferrexpo to a charity called Blooming Land, which supports local social and health projects in Ukraine. Deloitte’s resignation triggered a 28% fall in Ferrexpo’s share price on Friday. At the time of writing Ferrexpo’s share price was £2.07, about 23% below the £2.6803 price at which Mawe sold. In a statement to the stock market, Ferrexpo said Mawe had sold the shares “to settle tax and social security liabilities” which arose when he received the shares under his long-term incentive plan after the company’s 2018 annual results. Mawe joined the board of the company, which mines iron ore in Ukraine, in 2008. Ferrexpo said: “At the time of the decision and execution of the share sale, neither Mr Mawe nor the company had received Deloitte’s letter of resignation.” However, in a separate statement published by Ferrexpo on Monday, Deloitte said it had threatened to resign in January after Ferrexpo delayed an investigation into discrepancies in the charity’s bank statements. Deloitte, one of the big four accountants, warned Ferrexpo in October and again in November that it expected an independent forensic review into the discrepancies if Blooming Land did not provide the requested evidence. Ferrexpo, which is headquartered in Switzerland, appeared to agree that an investigation was necessary, Deloitte said, but the board voted in January not to start an inquiry. Instead, Ferrexpo wrote a letter to Blooming Land requesting further clarification. Ferrexpo only agreed to carry out a review after Deloitte’s threat to resign in January. The law firm Herbert Smith Freehills and BDO, another accounting firm, have been appointed to carry out the review, alongside Ukrainian lawyers. The scandal has wiped almost £300m from Ferrexpo’s market value after Deloitte raised concerns over $33.5m (£26m) in payments to Blooming Land, which carried out the mining company’s corporate social responsibility programme. The charity is linked to Kostyantin Zhevago, Ferrexpo’s founder, chief executive and largest shareholder. Deloitte had on Tuesday issued a qualified opinion alongside Ferrexpo’s twice-delayed annual report, saying it could not determine whether the charitable donations had been used for legitimate activities. Deloitte also had concerns that the charity was controlled by Zhevago. Ferrexpo paid Blooming Land $24m in 2017 and $9.5m in 2018. In total since 2013 the company has paid $110m to the charity, which was meant to be used to support diabetes prevention, eyesight care and care for the elderly. Ferrexpo said it stopped payments to the charity in May 2018, but three months later Deloitte found “a number of irregularities” which included “inconsistencies in copy bank statements provided by the charity”. Blooming Land partly blamed the inconsistencies on the June 2017 cyber-attacks on Ukrainian financial institutions, but Deloitte said it had concerns over the credibility of that claim. Ferrexpo said Zhevago did not have significant influence over Blooming Land “as defined under applicable accounting standards” or listing rules. Two non-executive directors of Ferrexpo resigned on Friday, piling extra pressure on the company. Mary Reilly and Bert Nacken previously chaired the company’s audit and remuneration committees, and both served on the four-member committee which was eventually tasked with overseeing an investigation into the discrepancies. Ferrexpo said it could not guarantee that no money had been taken for illegitimate purposes. Steve Lucas, its chairman, said: “At this stage we cannot conclude as to the ultimate use of all of the funds by the charity. “While there are indications that some funds could have been misappropriated, further work is required before any final conclusions can be drawn and the board would like to make clear that to date no conclusive evidence of misappropriation of funds has come to light.” Ferrexpo shares have traded on the London Stock Exchange since 2007. It was a member of the FTSE 100, but the company was demoted from the blue-chip index as iron ore prices fell.

2018-12-14T14:38:37Z,Waitrose to ban glitter from own-brand products by 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/14/waitrose-ban-glitter-own-brand-products-2020,"Waitrose has joined the crackdown on glitter by pledging to ban it from all own-brand products by 2020. The supermarket chain said its own-label cards, wraps, crackers, tags, flowers and plants will either be glitter-free or use an environmentally friendly alternative. It planned to use more vibrant foliage in its cut flowers to compensate for the lack of glitter, while new designs would be used for stationery, in particular cards and wrapping paper. Waitrose said three-quarters of its own-brand cards, wrapping paper, crackers and tags, as well as half of its flowers and plants, were already glitter-free. Most glitter is made from etched aluminium bonded to polyethylene terephthalate – a form of microplastic that can find its way into the oceans. As well as being an environmental scourge, the substance can pose a danger to people and animals. In January, a woman in Swansea was nearly blinded after glitter from a Christmas card worked its way into her eyeball. The BBC show Strictly Come Dancing banned the use of traditional glitter on the programme this year, while several nursery schools and music festivals in the UK have also axed it. “Reducing the impact of plastics on the environment is something our customers care passionately about,” said Tor Harris, the head of corporate social responsibility, health and agriculture at Waitrose. “While it is important to eliminate the use of glitter, we will find other ways to make sure our products sparkle at Christmas and throughout the year.” Meanwhile, Marks &amp; Spencer is introducing a biodegradable alternative to glitter across its fresh flowers and plant range. It could be in use as early as January after a successful trial.",Waitrose; Plastics; Business; Environment; Retail industry; Pollution; John Lewis,Business
2019-08-11T13:52:20Z,How a big French bank helped London tenants get back to work,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/11/lq-and-bnp-paribas-partner-up-to-get-tenants-back-into-work,"For a couple of years Nontando Mpofu, known to her friends as Lucy, struggled to find permanent work and often found herself reliant on the generosity of her church and food bank. “Life was a real struggle, and it was very hard for me to juggle everything – paying the rent and looking after my daughter as a single parent,” Mpofu, 40, says in the airy kitchen of her flat in Leytonstone, east London. “I got into quite a bit of debt and rent arrears.” Mpofu’s life changed last November when an unlikely alliance between France’s biggest bank and her social housing landlord helped get her back into permanent work with a job at Marks &amp; Spencer, and get her bank account into the black. “I was just scrolling through Facebook one day, and I saw a post from someone in the community saying: ‘If you’ve been unemployed for six months – get in touch, we can help’.” The message had been posted by a support officer employed by her landlord London &amp; Quadrant (L&amp;Q) , one of the UK’s largest housing associations which rents out close to 100,000 homes in London and the south-east. L&amp;Q employs more than a dozen people dedicated to getting its long-term unemployed residents such as Mpofu into permanent jobs. The team of support workers helped Mpofu perfect her CV, coached her through mock interviews, and helped her identify jobs suitable to her skills and circumstances. The L&amp;Q team also helps unemployed residents with buying clothes to wear to interviews and paying for travel. Matthew Corbett, the director of the L&amp;Q foundation, said the housing association was committed to helping its tenants into work because “it makes our communities happy and healthier” but also because L&amp;Q is contractually obliged to by its bank, BNP Paribas. France’s biggest bank loaned L&amp;Q £100m at a discount rate on the condition that the housing association helped at least 600 of its residents into work. BNP Paribas and L&amp;Q were unable to state how big the discount is, but Corbett said it was significant and would free up more money for the housing association to invest in its foundation. L&amp;Q, which was founded by a Church of England priest in 1963, smashed the target of getting 600 residents into work, and the loan will be extended for four years with L&amp;Q required to increase its job search effort by an additional 25 people each year. Accountants at PwC will audit L&amp;Q to verify that the housing association really achieved the target, which built upon its existing efforts to get residents into work. Social housing residents are twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the UK population on average, according to research by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Those who are in work are likely to be low-paid and in part-time jobs. The average weekly pay for housing association tenants is £250, compared to £232 for local authority tenants, £348 for private renters and £454 for owner-occupiers. Waqar Ahmed, L&amp;Q’s finance director, said: “Everything that L&amp;Q does begins with social purpose, and we believe that no one should be denied the opportunity to achieve their potential because of where they live. “BNP Paribas is exactly the sort of partner we are looking for, and we are delighted to have completed this ground-breaking deal with them. The team at BNP Paribas share our sense of social purpose, and our combined vision is going to help hundreds more people into employment every year.” BNP Paribas said the idea to offer the discount “sustainability-linked” loan came about after the bank’s change to its corporate social responsibility policy to do more to “create a positive impact in society”. Simon Gates, a senior banker at BNP Paribas UK, said the deal was the first to tie the terms of a loan to efforts to reduce unemployment. “It is the result of close collaboration to conceptualise and structure what represents a landmark deal for sustainable finance in the UK: to our knowledge, this is the first ever UK housing association loan that incorporates a concrete, positive impact metric. “L&amp;Q will be assessed on the actual impact realised in the community in terms of helping residents back to work. We think this is a watershed moment and we are honoured to support L&amp;Q as it continues its essential work of building affordable, high-quality homes.” After the success of the deal with L&amp;Q, BNP Paribas signed a similar deal this week with Optivo, another housing association which owns 47,000 homes occupied by close to 100,000 people. Gates said the Optivo loan was “about getting people back into work, which is good for individuals, families, the economy and society”. David Reynolds, the BNP Paribas banker who agreed the deal, said the French bank saw it as part of its “responsibility to align financing to reward worthy causes”. “From the top down, we are really focused on the positive impact banking can have,” he said. “It’s important for us to show that we support these sort of causes that are doing good for society.” Reynolds said the bank was putting aside a pool of money to support other social housing projects as well as other schemes aimed at improving the environment and cutting down on waste water. Greg Beales, the campaigns director of the housing charity Shelter, said it was important that banks such as BNP Paribas were making it easier for housing associations to build more homes particularly at a time of severe government cuts. “This shows the private sector stepping in to provide finance when the public finances have been incredible stretched,” he said. “Homes can help do so much more social good than just simply providing housing: they act as a platform from which people can improve their whole lives.” The terms of the Optivo loan have not been disclosed due to commercial sensitivity, but it is understood that the target will call on the housing association to significantly build on the approximately 1,000 residents a year it currently helps into work. On the frontlines helping Optivo residents find work are 17 Give Us a Chance employment specialists including Whitney Henry. Henry, who got her job through the same programme, said the most important aspect of her work was to give other residents “the confidence to believe in themselves”. “Some people have been out of work for a long time, and they have lost some of that confidence and belief in themselves,” said Henry, who works with residents on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, one of the most deprived parts of the UK. Her personal target is to get 50 people a year into work. Last year she found jobs for 126, including every member of a family of four. The father secured a job as a school caretaker, the mother got part-time cleaning work in the school, the daughter took an IT course before getting a job at PC World, and her brother is studying the same course while working at Greggs. “It is so rewarding when they get into jobs,” Henry said. “It’s probably the best feeling in the world that you have helped them achieve, and you feel like you have achieved with them. I am so proud of all them.”",Social housing; Unemployment; Housing; BNP Paribas; PwC; UK news; Communities; Society; Banking; Business; European banks; Financial sector,Society
2019-06-12T05:00:29Z,"Revealed: Mobil sought to fight environmental regulation, documents show",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/12/mobil-tax-exempt-donations-promote-interests-environmental-regulation-documents,"Oil giant Mobil sought to make tax-exempt donations to leading universities, civic groups and arts programmes to promote the company’s interests and undermine environmental regulation, according to internal documents from the early 1990s obtained by the Guardian. The documents shine a light on the ways corporations have used their money to buy influence, amass prestige and shape public policy through grants to academic programmes and advocacy groups. The documents come to light as ExxonMobil, formed when Mobil merged with Exxon in 1999, is now facing investigations by multiple state attorneys general over claims it failed to communicate known climate crisis-related risks to investors and the public. The documents, dated in 1993 and provided to the Guardian by the Climate Investigations Center, show the Mobil Foundation justified spending by detailing major “benefits to Mobil” they expected in return for more than 80 proposed grants for 1994 – a practice not-for-profit experts said may have violated federal law. The foundation wrote that its grants for not-for-profits could help Mobil fight environmental regulation, fund scientists whose work had been “favorably received by the industry” and prepare Mobil to defend itself against lawsuits following oil spills and industrial accidents. For example, in a one-page entry listing past Mobil grants, the company was successful in “having the National Safety Council Board of Directors pass a resolution opposing the mandating of any alternative fuel”, the foundation wrote. Grants for the council totalled nearly a quarter-million dollars, according to the entry, which recommended further grants for the coming year. The internal grant-making recommendations and records, many marked confidential, cover $1.2m worth of funding – about 10% of the foundation’s annual budget. More than two-thirds of the roughly 120 full-page grant recommendations predict specific benefits for the oil giant. Justifications for offering money to not-for-profits and universities included: “Global warming is likely to be the key international environmental issue of the 1990s,” the foundation’s internal records predicted in 1993, adding that climate regulation was “a real possibility within the next five years”. The foundation recommended a $25,000 grant to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University to help Mobil “develop personal relationships with some of the key experts on this issue” and enable Mobil to “participate in the debate on these regulations”. The Mobil Foundation recommended contributing a total of $25,000 to the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, saying the center had already effectively argued against tighter fuel economy standards and influenced America’s toxic air pollution laws, and its stances may help keep Mobil’s costs down in future. “Mobil’s environmental expenditures exceeded $1bn in 1992,” the document said. “Without a greater appreciation of scientific risk analysis, those costs will continue to escalate as environmental rules and programs are made excessively stringent in response to the public’s unfounded panic over relatively minor incidents.” The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia describes its Environmental Associates Program as “a group of corporate executives concerned about environmental effects of industrial activities”. The program was founded by Dr Ruth Patrick, who helped to draft the Clean Water Act, a major federal law giving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power to write rules to protect people against harm from water pollution. “Based on the contacts of the Academy,” the Mobil Foundation wrote, “the Environmental Associates Program has the potential to challenge the EPA behind the scenes on the effectiveness of a regulation for the environment and whether sound science supports the proposed law.” The Mobil Foundation recommended offering the National Research Council, part of the National Academies, funding for a study of an oil spill clean-up method, writing: “By helping to fund the study, Mobil may be offered the opportunity to participate or to receive early access to the findings.” Leaders of Mobil and its foundation had offered public hints that they expected to harvest benefits from the company’s charitable giving. “Should corporations ever engage in pure philanthropy, giving money away because it gives one a nice feeling and the shareholders don’t seem to mind?” Herbert Schmertz, Mobil’s vice-president of public affairs for about two decades and a former Mobil Foundation president, asked during a 22 September 1987 talk on philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. “I guess I’d answer that by saying I don’t know whether corporate philanthropy as I’ve sort of defined it, which is just to get a warm feeling, ever existed,” he said. “But if it did, I’d have to say that it’s a dying concept in terms of corporate giving.” A 1998 book thanking Richard Mund, who served as Mobil Foundation’s executive director from 1979 to 2000, for his edits offers a similar view of corporate grant-making, advising that companies “identify a significant business reason” for grants and “obtain as much business value from social investments as is allowable and practical”. Tax experts told the Guardian that the Mobil Foundation’s stated intent to benefit Mobil through “charitable” grants would have raised serious red flags for illegal self-dealing, had it come to light before the statute of limitations ran out. “The public would have a very hard time finding out any of this,” said Naomi Oreskes, author of Merchants of Doubt and a Harvard University professor of the history of science, adding that “typically one can only see the organization and amount, but no details of what or why”. “What I see here is a pattern of ‘charitable giving’ that is anything but disinterested,” she said. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “Our philanthropic arm follows all laws and required disclosures. The ExxonMobil Foundation has a strategic focus supporting education with an emphasis on math and science, promoting women as catalysts for economic development and preventing deaths from malaria.” A lawsuit filed in October by the New York attorney general alleges ExxonMobil defrauded investors for years about the risks climate crisis regulation posed for the fossil fuel giant. In January, the US supreme court allowed Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey’s investigation into how ExxonMobil described climate crisis risks to consumers and investors to move forward by refusing to hear the company’s appeal. A spokesperson for Healey declined to comment on the newly revealed documents, citing ongoing litigation. The ExxonMobil Foundation was also formed after the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil. Corporate watchdogs said issues associated with private industry’s use of not-for-profits to influence American policy have become more pronounced since the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the supreme court’s Citizens United decision, which protected political spending by corporations and which critics say fuelled a rapid expansion of so-called “dark money” advocacy groups whose funding is more difficult to trace. “It’s extremely troubling,” Lisa Graves, president of the board of the Center for Media and Democracy, said. “One of the primary rules for nonprofits is that they’re supposed to be in the public interest,” she said, “not for private benefits.”",ExxonMobil; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Business; Commodities; Climate crisis; Environment; US news,Business
2019-08-25T13:00:12Z,Throws of passion: how pottery became a refuge from our hyperconnected times,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/25/throws-of-passion-how-pottery-became-a-refuge-from-our-hyperconnected-times,"Pottery can’t help but feel miraculous: a lump of mud, set spinning on a wheel, transformed by motion and friction into something useful. “A potter is one of the few people left who uses his natural faculties of heart, head and hand in balance – the whole man,” wrote Bernard Leach, the father of British studio pottery. “Good pots require the ardour of vocation and the devotion of a lifetime.” No doubt. But on a first lesson at Turning Earth E10 – a 790 sq metre (8,500 sq ft), collective-run “pottery gym” on an industrial estate in Leyton, east London – a passable pot is just about doable in a morning. It requires about half a kilo of clay and a patient teacher, Natalie Smith, a relatively recent convert herself. Like many 21st-century potters, she uses Instagram (@throwing_pots) as a shop window for her fermentation jars and teapots. Sun streams through the skylights on to a scene of blissful purpose, decorated with Extinction Rebellion posters. A highly focused man at the next wheel is rippling through a Japanese-style dinner service with impressively slender walls; a recently retired woman paints a vase with a little more visible effort. Smith runs me through basics of water and pressure, the rituals of kneading the clay, positioning it on the wheel, “coning” up and down to ensure the clay is dead-centre. “This part drives people crazy to begin with,” she says. “Now I find it quite meditative.” Then comes the miraculous part, thumbing out a little hole, tickling out a wall. Each pot has an element of happenstance. You might end up with something vaguely urn-like and pretend that is what you were aiming for all along. You might accidentally step on the pedal – a common mistake – and watch your little miracle lurch back into mud. “Don’t worry, we recycle all the clay,” Smith assures me. I first noticed the re-emergence of pottery as a popular hobby while living in Los Angeles a couple of years ago: a friend invested in a wheel and began hosting ceramics-themed parties. It was a spell in California, too, that inspired Tallie Maughan, the founder of Turning Earth, to create her first “open-access” studio in Hoxton, a few miles south-west of Leyton, in 2013. The term “gym” refers to the membership model rather than the well-evidenced mind-body benefits of throwing clay – you can pay a not-inconsiderable £165 a month for a one-year contract that gives you access to materials at cost price, as well as a set of technicians who can help with the exacting glazing and firing process (other membership options are available). A number of studios have since opened along similar lines, including Clay Studio in Manchester; meanwhile, the BBC is relaunching its craft contest The Great Pottery Throwdown. It is not hard to see why pottery may appeal in these hyperconnected, terminally distracted times. It is literally impossible to look at your phone while you are making a pot. If you try to sneak a look at your mentions between throws, your phone will quickly become smirched in clay. Also, as Maughan notes, “generation rent” was brought up on home-renovation programmes – but a lot of us don’t own homes. “Pottery is something small and manageable that connects to that idea of home.” Social media has helped potters to establish low-overhead businesses – ceramicists such as Tom Kemp (@tom_kemp_) and Stine Dulong (@skandihus_london) command huge followings on Instagram. Elizabeth Macneal, the author of the bestselling novel The Doll Factory, has been selling the pots she makes in what used to be her writing shed for three years, mostly through Instagram (@elizabethmacneal). In 2016, while working as a management consultant, she found herself drifting into a pottery class during a project in Edinburgh. She soon became addicted. “There were about 100 people on the project I was working on. I had no idea what I was even supposed to be doing. But, with pottery, you are solely responsible for how it turns out. That’s so inviting when you’re disaffected by your job.” She finds that writing and throwing pots complement one another. “When I’m writing, sometimes it feels as if I’m not getting anywhere – I can delete a month’s work in about 10 seconds. But then I can go to the shed, throw 10 mugs and have something to show for it. It’s almost the opposite of writing. It’s mechanical and it’s repetitive, so you can let your mind wander. I often work out plot points that way and I like that primarily it’s functional. It’s relaxing. It doesn’t have to stand on its aesthetic merits alone, like a painting. Can I drink from it? Yes? Well, it’s a mug, then.” Louise Ogden, who in 2017 opened a small hand ceramics studio called Kiln off Gloucester Road in Bristol, echoes the point. “We’ve made ourselves so busy, but there’s not much output, is there?” she says. “We achieve bugger all.” She says opening an art-centred business off a busy high street was a risk, but one worth taking. “We have squeezed art out everywhere. It’s not in schools any more. And it’s such an antidote to the technological onslaught that has become the norm. It’s a very old thing, clay. People often say they feel like they’ve been in a spa for a full day.” Pottery, she suggests, challenges our post-industrial ideas about art, where we outsource all creativity and handiwork to a few specialists. “People often show up for classes protesting that they’re not creative, but they end up really surprised at what they’ve been able to make. Creativity is like a muscle. Children love to create. But unless you make a point of doing it as a grownup, it withers. The idea is that everyone is welcome there. It’s suitable for little babies up to elderly people.” For Maughan, who is writing a book on pottery, to be published next year, the connection goes back even further. “Ceramics is the oldest form of technology we have,” she says. “After cooking meat, baking clay was the first thing that humans did to chemically alter our environment on purpose. You can’t make rice without cooking it in some kind of vessel, so clay pots go hand in hand with agriculture – our whole evolution is connected to it. There’s only a short period of history in which people haven’t been connected with pottery. There’s something incredibly grounding about an experience that connects you with the past like that.” Maughan echoes the views of William Morris, the Arts and Crafts designer and socialist activist, who was born in 1834 not far from the site of Turning Earth E10. He argued that making beautiful things should be seen as a fundamental human need. “I do not want art for a few, any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few,” he wrote in Hopes and Fears for Art. While Maughan welcomes pottery’s popularity – US Vogue has declared it “the new yoga” and it has, perhaps inevitably, become the latest mindfulness trend in Silicon Valley – she is determined to ensure it doesn’t end up as “a middle-class hobby”, even if the associated costs clearly push it in that direction. “I am political; I did this for political reasons,” she says. “It’s called Turning Earth for that reason. We shouldn’t think of objects as nameless, faceless things, detached from process. We should think about how they got there, what their impact is and who was involved.” Her vocation is deep-rooted. She grew up with her mother in Rutland; her childhood involved no central heating, but lots of home-curing and potato-farming. “My dad died when I was six. My mum was quite an eccentric person who felt she needed to prepare us for a post-apocalyptic world. She had a pottery wheel and kiln in the conservatory. She formed her own Saturday morning pottery class and made me and my brother go every week.” Maughan wasn’t especially keen at the time, but when she took a pottery course as an adult she found it gave her an “almost mystical feeling” that was sorely lacking in her day job. She was then working as a corporate social responsibility consultant – advising multinational companies on how they could be more green and ethical – but she had become deeply disillusioned. “The whole thing came out of me thinking about climate change and feeling that we had to do something drastically different as a society,” she says. “It may seem counterintuitive, but I realised that we needed to start creating sustainable activities that people actually want to do, rather than trying to fix a system that was broken. If you look at the root cause of climate change, it’s unsustainable consumption. Why do people consume so much? The main reason is they’re not happy. So, what makes people happy? Once you start asking those questions, it inevitably leads you to questions about the inequity in society.” She notes that her studios have proved popular partly due to the squeezing of further education colleges. “One of the reasons we didn’t have this sort of culture before is that we’re used to having state-funded arts programmes, which has led to many people seeing art as a parasite and not something that can be an economic contributor.” She is committed to creating “art in the black” – art that funds itself – but balancing this aim with her desire to bring pottery to as wide an audience as possible clearly has its challenges. The next Turning Earth studio will be in Battersea, south-west London, in partnership with Big Yellow Storage and Wandsworth council, which will allow Maughan to offer funded places. “If we don’t do things like that, it will end up as one of those gentrification projects that divide society. We don’t want it to be that.”",Ceramics; Art and design; Craft; Life and style,Art and design
2018-09-14T23:01:38Z,Waitrose steps up action to remove plastic bags,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/15/waitrose-steps-up-action-to-remove-plastic-bags,"Waitrose &amp; Partners is to remove traditional plastic bags for loose fruit and vegetables and 5p single-use plastic bags from its stores by next spring. The supermarket said the move would cut 134m plastic bags, the equivalent of 500 tonnes of plastic a year. The fruit and vegetable bags will be replaced by a home compostable alternative, derived from corn starch, which the retailer said would look and feel similar to the current ones and could be placed in food waste caddies or broken down in landfill if put in a normal bin. Friends of the Earth welcomed the retailer’s attempt to reduce its plastic footprint but expressed doubt that compostable bags were the answer. Emma Priestland, a plastics campaigner at the environmental group, said: “It’s good to see big companies like Waitrose looking for ways to reduce the plastic in their stores. But compostable, bio-based bags aren’t necessarily the gold-star solution they first appear. This is a case of swapping one kind of single-use plastic for another, when actually removing the packaging entirely would be the best option. “Ultimately, to turn the tide on plastic pollution, we need to get rid of all but the most essential plastics, and we need action from government to make that happen.” The group’s concerns echo those of the UN’s top environmental scientist, Jacqueline McGlade, who said earlier this year that biodegradable plastic bags were a false solution. The 5p bags will be removed from six shops: Saxmundham, Gerrards Cross, Keynsham, Dorking, Newark and East Putney, from 8 October to help ensure a smooth changeover before Waitrose &amp; Partners phases them out elsewhere later in the year. Waitrose &amp; Partners has started to remove all takeaway disposable coffee cups from its shops; they have gone from more than 300 of its 348 stores. Waitrose &amp; Partners has also already pledged not to sell any own-label food in black plastic beyond 2019 and to make all of its own-label packaging widely recyclable, reusable or home compostable by 2025. The supermarket’s latest announcement comes amid mounting evidence that environmental concerns around plastic waste are moving up the priority list for shoppers when purchasing goods. The government is exploring extending the 5p plastic bag charge, as well as the possibility of aisles in supermarkets stocking products with plastic-free packaging.

The UK arm of Transparency International, a non-governmental organisation that campaigns against corruption, ranked 104 multinational companies, finding that four in five firms had “poor standards” in disclosing lobbying activities. Only one of the 104 companies analysed, the pharmaceutical company GSK achieved a top rating on the A to F scale for transparency of political engagement. None of the companies analysed – ranging from US tech firms, to FTSE 100 multinationals to Asian manufacturers – reported their global spending on lobbying in 2017. David Cameron, the former prime minister, said in 2010 that corporate lobbying would be the “next big scandal waiting to happen”. However, little has been done to enforce tougher standards, leading to a continuous stream of lobbying scandals. Facebook scored in the second-worst band, E, but was one of the worst performers with regards to “responsible lobbying”, which includes the visibility of activities and its values when lobbying. The US social media firm on Thursday admitted it had hired lobbyists to attack George Soros, the financier and philanthropist. Amazonand Google were both rated as having poor standards on lobbying transparency. Apple achieved a C, meaning its standards are fair. EY, Disney and Huawei all fell in rank F, as did digger maker JCB, software firm Sage and chemicals firm Ineos, which is run by Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man. Car manufacturers scored particularly badly, with Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota all in the bottom rank. Kathryn Higgs, the director of Transparency International’s UK business integrity programme, said: “There are some pockets where it’s clear that some companies haven’t thought about managing certain risks, such as the ‘revolving door’.” The report is highly critical of the “revolving door” between government and business, with 97 out of 104 of the firms ranking poorly on issues such as “cooling off” periods for former government ministers taking up employment in the private sector. MPs and anti-corruption campaigners have repeatedly criticised the weak controls on former politicians exercised by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which is tasked with reviewing politicians’ job moves. The revolving door is not limited to the UK, however. Members of the European parliament have no barriers to lobbying immediately after they leave politics, while the report highlights figures cited by author Mark Leibovich that in 2012 half of all retiring US congressmen went into lobbying, compared with only 3% in 1974. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy held the most meetings in 2017 with the firms monitored within government. The Department for International Trade, which was founded only in 2016, was second on the list, followed by the Treasury, according to Transparency International’s open database. Transparency International said almost a third of companies improved their political engagement policies after being approached for data, and another 17% pledged to do so. The organisation plans to repeat the review biannually. “Companies are increasingly realising that transparency [on lobbying] is the future,” said Higgs. A government spokeswoman said: “Since 2010 the UK has been at the forefront of opening up data to allow parliament, the public and the media to hold public bodies to account. This government openly publishes details of ministers’ external meetings on a quarterly basis.” She added: “Transparency is crucial for accountability, delivering the best value for money, cutting waste and inefficiency and ensuring every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent in the best possible way.” Honda said in a statement: “Our engagement with local and international governments and political organisations is carried out in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. Honda will continue to work closely with industry groups and political stakeholders in this spirit. Toyota, which also ranks in the lowest category, said it wanted to be “a good corporate citizen” and build “positive relationships with all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business partners, local communities, and employees”. It added: “The guiding principles at Toyota state that Toyota shall ‘honour the language and spirit of the law of every nation and undertake open and fair business activities to be a good corporate citizen of the world’. Toyota believes that by adhering to this principle in its actions, it can fulfil its corporate social responsibility and ensure compliance.”",Lobbying; Huawei; EY; Business; Accountancy; Politics; Technology; Financial sector; World news,Politics
2018-09-12T04:51:31Z,Concerns missing Chinese actor Fan Bingbing has fallen foul of authorities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/concerns-missing-chinese-actor-fan-bingbing-has-fallen-foul-of-authorities,"Concerns have intensified that one of China’s most famous actors, Fan Bingbing, who has not been in public for months, may be in trouble with the authorities after she came last in a ranking of social responsibility among celebrities. Fan scored zero out of 100 in the category in the 2017-18 China Film and Television Star Social Responsibility Report, compiled by Beijing Normal University and the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Corporate Social Responsibility Research Institute. It is the latest sign that the A-list actor, model and singer may have fallen foul of the authorities, with rumours that she has been detained for tax evasion. The study comes amid a wider push by China’s Communist leaders to crack down on the entertainment industry and curb what it sees as “promoting money worship”, “distorting social values” and “misleading young people to blindly chase celebrities”. Chinese authorities announced a pay cap in June, saying leading actors should receive no more than 70% of total wages for the cast. Only nine celebrities scored above 60 in terms of social responsibility, considered a passing grade, and the report said stars should promote “positive energy” and be more mindful they could cause “negative social impact”. Fan has not been seen in public in over two months, and has reportedly become caught up into an investigation over what are known as “yin-yang contracts” among stars, where one contract lists the actor’s real salary while another with a smaller figure is submitted to tax authorities. A report in the Securities Daily newspaper last week said she had been put “under control” and would “accept the legal judgement”, although it did not say what crime she had committed and the article was taken down shortly after it was posted. Fan’s studio has denied any wrongdoing. Fan, 36, is one of the biggest stars in China, and in a career spanning more than two decades has become a ubiquitous sight on advertisements hawking luxury brands such as Cartier and Mercedes-Benz. She is most famous outside China for her role in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past and is set to appear in a spy movie alongside Jessica Chastain, Penelope Cruz, Marion Cotillard and Lupita Nyong’o, though a release date for the film has not been announced. But despite the rumours dogging Fan, including that she has received a ban from appearing in films, she has not been formally accused of any crime. Her last public appearance was at a children’s hospital on 1 July. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on mass media both on and off screen. Censors routinely demand changes to content and have also hosted political indoctrination sessions for celebrities. Stars that promote the official Communist party line are often rewarded while those who step out of line are quickly punished.",China; Asia Pacific; World news,World news
2019-01-03T18:17:39Z,Ethical questions for ad industry and academia | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/03/ethical-questions-for-ad-industry-and-academia,"For decades universities have been falling down on the job of teaching people to think for themselves and selling themselves as trainers for enhanced income generation. It is an abomination if, as George Monbiot reports (Who is really making your choices? It may not be you, 31 December), they are supporting research into techniques for overcoming resistance to advertising. We should look to other institutions to provide reservoirs of resistance. They will not be specifically set up to combat the “hidden persuaders” that Vance Packard wrote about in 1957, but by groups who build community on other common interests. Perhaps the most successful is the Campaign for Real Ale, which took on the global beer producers who told us what to drink. My own city has many fine pubs, traditional and modern, which are obvious centres of resistance and not just on the beer front. What some will find more surprising is that there are some church communities around that encourage people to develop a capacity for scepticism, while helping them to stand up to the powerful forces of 21st-century global capitalism. Geoff Reid Bradford • George Monbiot’s warnings about the insidious power of advertising research being funded by publicly funded universities are well-made. We should remember that David Cameron was motivated by this growing body of research in establishing the Downing Street behavioural insight or “nudge” unit – allegedly aimed at exploiting the better side of human psychology with a view to improving citizens’ behaviour (such as sending n tax returns on time). Manipulating the behaviour of unsuspecting individuals was a wholly accepted premise. Indeed, the main nudge theorist, an American economist, won a Nobel prize in 2017, so his work has already had a considerable impact on a global scale. At a time when higher education is being commercialised like never before, with the financial stakes rising year by year, we must give the highest priority to the ethical scrutiny and control of publicly funded research and the individuals engaged in it. Gillian Dalley London • George Monbiot is right to point up the aggressive efforts on the part of corporations to control consumer responses. But he is too sweeping in tarring “universities” as a whole as contributing to this process. It is mostly business schools that conduct such research. Having worked for some decades in such establishments, I can confirm that apart from some lip service to wider social concerns, usually in areas such as business ethics, international management or (some aspects of) corporate social responsibility, the main purpose of most business school activity – and of the vast majority of research funding in the field – is to improve the success of individual organisations, without regard to wider implications. We need more academic regard, and more funding, devoted to the broad philosophical, social and political impacts of business if we are to see a brake on the corroding influence of modern advertising techniques. Paul Griseri La Genetouze, France • George Monbiot highlights an often hidden and insidious aspect of modern capitalism. In the early days of capitalism, advertising was used to simply make the wider public aware of a product, but with modern technology and psychological sophistication this has morphed into a highly persuasive operation, plugging in to human – and particularly children and young people’s – weaknesses. I remember when I first went to live in East Germany, long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, how the “grey” reality, so tediously iterated in the west, represented for me a freedom from unnecessary and intrusive advertising. I found it wonderfully refreshing. I could think my own thoughts, daydream and just observe the world of architecture, people’s activities and my whole environment untrammelled by gaudy, in-your-face hoardings and sexually exploitative imagery. Of course, there were the ubiquitous simplistic political slogans, but they were less obtrusive than commercial advertising and had little, if any, effect on a sceptical populace. Now it is not just hoardings, of course, but social media technologies that dominate our daily lives and corporate interests plug directly into our brains, creating addictions as pernicious as cocaine or opium. How quaint does the Big Brother concept in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four seem in contrast. John Green London • George Monbiot is quite right to complain about academics doing research that helps advertisers manipulate minds. But universities suffer from an intellectual and humanitarian scandal far worse than Monbiot seems to realise. Most would agree that a proper basic aim of academia is to help promote human welfare by intellectual, educational and technological means. If this aim was taken seriously, and pursued rationally, academia would give intellectual priority to the tasks of articulating our problems of living, including our global problems, and proposing and critically assessing possible solutions – possible actions, policies, political programmes, ways of living. Intelligent public education about what our problems are, and what we need to do about them, would be an absolute priority. The pursuit of knowledge and technological knowhow would be important, but secondary. No university in the world is organised along these lines. All take the first priority to be to acquire specialised knowledge. All around the world universities, in their whole structure, betray reason and, as a result, betray humanity. At present we do not have what we so urgently need: institutions of learning rationally devoted to helping us learn how to make progress towards a better, wiser, more civilised world.

2018-11-25T07:00:02Z,Rule by robots is easy to imagine – we’re already victims of superintelligent firms | John Naughton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/25/victims-of-superintelligent-firms-ruthless-behaviour-of-big-data,"In 1965, the mathematician I J “Jack” Good, one of Alan Turing’s code-breaking colleagues during the second world war, started to think about the implications of what he called an “ultra-intelligent” machine – ie “a machine that can surpass all the intellectual activities of any man, however clever”. If we were able to create such a machine, he mused, it would be “the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control”. Note the proviso. Good’s speculation has lingered long in our collective subconscious, occasionally giving rise to outbreaks of fevered speculation. These generally focus on two questions. How long will it take us to create superintelligent machines? And what will it be like for humans to live with – or under – such machines? Will they rapidly conclude that people are a waste of space? Does the superintelligent machine pose an existential risk for humanity? The answer to the first question can be summarised as “longer than you think”. And as for the second question, well, nobody really knows. How could they? Surely we’d need to build the machines first and then we’d find out. Actually, that’s not quite right. It just so happens that history has provided us with some useful insights into what it’s like to live with – and under – superintelligent machines. They’re called corporations, and they’ve been around for a very long time – since about 1600, in fact. Although they are powered by human beings, they are in fact nonhuman entities to which our legal systems grant the status of legal personhood. We can therefore regard them as artificial superintelligences because they possess formidable capacities for rational behaviour, reasoning, perception and action. And they have free will: they can engage in purposeful behaviour aimed at achieving self-determined goals. They possess and deploy massive resources of financial capital and human expertise. And they are, in principle at least, immortal: they can have life spans that greatly exceed those of humans, and some are capable of surviving catastrophes that kill millions of people. Just think of how many of the big German corporations of the 1930s – companies such as Thyssen, BASF, Mercedes, Siemens, Bosch, Volkswagen – are still prospering today. So if corporations are the superintelligences de nos jours, what can that tell us about living with superintelligent machines? On the positive side, such entities are capable of accomplishing astonishing things – from building a new city, road or rail network, to indexing the world wide web, connecting 2.24 billion people, scanning all the world’s books, launching heavy rockets into space (and bringing them back safely), etc. But these superintelligent entities have other characteristics too. The most disturbing one is that they are intrinsically sociopathic – they are AIs that stand apart from the rest of society, existing for themselves and only for themselves, caring nothing for the norms and rules of society, and obeying only the letter (as distinct from the spirit) of the law. That doesn’t means that corporations do not regularly dissemble, or proclaim their “corporate social responsibility”, ethical standards, environmental awareness or the “values” that are implicit in their brands. They do. For the most part, though, this is just cant, designed to burnish the public image of the corporation. The interesting thing about the tech companies is that, until recently, we failed to notice that they were just corporations too. At the beginning, we were entranced by their young founders with their open-eyed “missions” to avoid being evil, enable people to broadcast themselves, connect the world, organise its information and build global communities. We were likewise seduced by their colourful, playful workplaces, free gourmet food, on-site massages and prevailingly hipster ethos, so didn’t notice that under all that gloss there lurked ruthless capitalist machines intent on harvesting as much data on our daily existence as they could. Fortunately, after two years of scandals, the scales are now beginning to fall from our eyes and we are seeing these outfits for what they are: mere corporations. Anyone who has been on the receiving end of a tech company’s rage – as this newspaper was on the Friday night that we broke the Cambridge Analytica story – would be hard put to say what is the difference between Facebook and, say, a tobacco company whose cover had been blown. Which is why the recent revelations by the New York Times that Facebook had been employing a slimy PR firm to discredit the company’s critics by linking them to George Soros – a long-time target of antisemitic conspiracy theories – no longer came as a shock. When you’re a sociopathic corporation, the ends always justify the means. So the challenge we will one day face is whether we can design superintelligent machines that are better behaved.

2018-12-31T06:00:09Z,Advertising and academia are controlling our thoughts. Didn’t you know? | George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/31/advertising-academia-controlling-thoughts-universities,"To what extent do we decide? We tell ourselves we choose our own life course, but is this ever true? If you or I had lived 500 years ago, our worldview, and the decisions we made as a result, would have been utterly different. Our minds are shaped by our social environment, in particular the belief systems projected by those in power: monarchs, aristocrats and theologians then; corporations, billionaires and the media today. Humans, the supremely social mammals, are ethical and intellectual sponges. We unconsciously absorb, for good or ill, the influences that surround us. Indeed, the very notion that we might form our own minds is a received idea that would have been quite alien to most people five centuries ago. This is not to suggest we have no capacity for independent thought. But to exercise it, we must – consciously and with great effort – swim against the social current that sweeps us along, mostly without our knowledge. Surely, though, even if we are broadly shaped by the social environment, we control the small decisions we make? Sometimes. Perhaps. But here, too, we are subject to constant influence, some of which we see, much of which we don’t. And there is one major industry that seeks to decide on our behalf. Its techniques get more sophisticated every year, drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience and psychology. It is called advertising. Every month, new books on the subject are published with titles like The Persuasion Code: How Neuromarketing Can Help You Persuade Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime. While many are doubtless overhyped, they describe a discipline that is rapidly closing in on our minds, making independent thought ever harder. More sophisticated advertising meshes with digital technologies designed to eliminate agency. Earlier this year, the child psychologist Richard Freed explained how new psychological research has been used to develop social media, computer games and phones with genuinely addictive qualities. He quoted a technologist who boasts, with apparent justification: “We have the ability to twiddle some knobs in a machine learning dashboard we build, and around the world hundreds of thousands of people are going to quietly change their behaviour in ways that, unbeknownst to them, feel second-nature but are really by design.” The purpose of this brain hacking is to create more effective platforms for advertising. But the effort is wasted if we retain our ability to resist it. Facebook, according to a leaked report, carried out research – shared with an advertiser – to determine when teenagers using its network feel insecure, worthless or stressed. These appear to be the optimum moments for hitting them with a micro-targeted promotion. Facebook denied that it offered “tools to target people based on their emotional state”. We can expect commercial enterprises to attempt whatever lawful ruses they can pull off. It is up to society, represented by government, to stop them, through the kind of regulation that has so far been lacking. But what puzzles and disgusts me even more than this failure is the willingness of universities to host research that helps advertisers hack our minds. The Enlightenment ideal, which all universities claim to endorse, is that everyone should think for themselves. So why do they run departments in which researchers explore new means of blocking this capacity? I ask because, while considering the frenzy of consumerism that rises beyond its usual planet-trashing levels at this time of year, I recently stumbled across a paper that astonished me. It was written by academics at public universities in the Netherlands and the US. Their purpose seemed to me starkly at odds with the public interest. They sought to identify “the different ways in which consumers resist advertising, and the tactics that can be used to counter or avoid such resistance”. Among the “neutralising” techniques it highlighted were “disguising the persuasive intent of the message”; distracting our attention by using confusing phrases that make it harder to focus on the advertiser’s intentions; and “using cognitive depletion as a tactic for reducing consumers’ ability to contest messages”. This means hitting us with enough advertisements to exhaust our mental resources, breaking down our capacity to think. Intrigued, I started looking for other academic papers on the same theme, and found an entire literature. There were articles on every imaginable aspect of resistance, and helpful tips on overcoming it. For example, I came across a paper that counsels advertisers on how to rebuild public trust when the celebrity they work with gets into trouble. Rather than dumping this lucrative asset, the researchers advised that the best means to enhance “the authentic persuasive appeal of a celebrity endorser” whose standing has slipped is to get them to display “a Duchenne smile”, otherwise known as “a genuine smile”. It precisely anatomised such smiles, showed how to spot them, and discussed the “construction” of sincerity and “genuineness”: a magnificent exercise in inauthentic authenticity. Another paper considered how to persuade sceptical people to accept a company’s corporate social responsibility claims, especially when these claims conflict with the company’s overall objectives. (An obvious example is ExxonMobil’s attempts to convince people that it is environmentally responsible, because it is researching algal fuels that could one day reduce CO2 – even as it continues to pump millions of barrels of fossil oil a day). I hoped the paper would recommend that the best means of persuading people is for a company to change its practices. Instead, the authors’ research showed how images and statements could be cleverly combined to “minimise stakeholder scepticism”. A further paper discussed advertisements that work by stimulating Fomo – fear of missing out. It noted that such ads work through “controlled motivation”, which is “anathema to wellbeing”. Fomo ads, the paper explained, tend to cause significant discomfort to those who notice them. It then went on to show how an improved understanding of people’s responses “provides the opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of Fomo as a purchase trigger”. One tactic it proposed is to keep stimulating the fear of missing out, during and after the decision to buy. This, it suggested, will make people more susceptible to further ads on the same lines. Yes, I know: I work in an industry that receives most of its income from advertising, so I am complicit in this too. But so are we all. Advertising – with its destructive impacts on the living planet, our peace of mind and our free will – sits at the heart of our growth-based economy. This gives us all the more reason to challenge it. Among the places in which the challenge should begin are universities, and the academic societies that are supposed to set and uphold ethical standards. If they cannot swim against the currents of constructed desire and constructed thought, who can? • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",Advertising; Media; Universities; Higher education; Education; UK news; Research; Research funding,Opinion
2019-01-07T16:45:09Z,Half-baked: what Greggs’ vegan sausage roll says about Brexit Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/07/greggs-vegan-sausage-roll-brexit-britain-culture-wars,"It is the controversy that nobody understands, while at the same time understanding it utterly: the Greggs vegan sausage roll. Launched on 3 January, presumably to coincide with Veganuary, it got off to a flying start thanks to the ire of Piers Morgan, who tweeted: “Nobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns.” There is quite a lot packed into that tweet, if we want to go psychoanalytical on his ass: he has substituted “I wasn’t waiting for … ” with “nobody was waiting for”, signalling an ego out of control, then elided a dietary choice with political correctness. So, in Morgan’s world, you can police what other people eat by accusing them of trying to police what you think, which arse-on-backwards argument distills almost everything that is obnoxious and distinctive about our current politics. It was a culture-wars classic overnight: Angela Rayner, the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, agreed with Morgan, as did Julie Bindel, the writer and activist. Greggs sent a salty reply, a lot of people went on Twitter to despair of other people wasting their time on Twitter, and a few vegans asked: “Why do people hate us?” Which is fair. It was all so hotly contested that two things happened: first a conspiracy theory that, since Greggs was represented by the same PR agency that once did a book with Piers Morgan – Taylor Herring – it was probably all a concoction (it wasn’t – the PR for the roll was handled in-house); the second was that the vegan sausage rolls sold out. All over the place, from Brighton to Manchester. I had to walk a mile and a half to get one this morning, nearly a week in. You have to conclude it is creating a deliberate scarcity; you don’t get to be Greggs by failing to adapt to pastry demand from one day to the next. But here I go again, with the conspiracies. It pushed some buttons, this delicious flaky-pastry ersatz meat product, and they weren’t so much about veganism – or if so, only indirectly – as they were about politics and class. Greggs occupies a very specific place on the British high street, partly because it has a mission. I remember going to a meeting about the future of work – it was off the record so I couldn’t quote Mr Greggs Rep even if I could remember his name, but the gist was that it always tries to employ young people from the area of the shop, if it can. It wasn’t an insular or xenophobic point; it wasn’t about anyone driving or not driving down wages and conditions. It was that locals tended to be a bit younger, and it’s actually really hard, if you’re 18, to go up against a 22-year-old. But you still need a job, and you could still do a job, if someone would give you one. You can look at high streets from Eastleigh to Rotherham, which large chains have vacated, leaving nothing but charity shops selling nothing but secondhand fleeces, and there will always be one Greggs, sometimes two within 50 yards of each other. The company has become associated, not with corporate social responsibility, with all those nannyish and whitewashing connotations, but with the more ineffable quality of still giving a shit. McDonald’s has launched a vegetarian Happy Meal, but could never spark a controversy like this; it is too global, too disembodied, a citizen of nowhere in the true, rather than Theresa May, sense. It helps that Greggs’ roots are in the north-east of England (though don’t delve too deep into its history, since you’ll turn up the predatory paedophile Colin Gregg, the son of the founder, who somewhat interrupts the EDL narrative that only foreigners harm children). Set against the prevailing line on obesity – people who eat cheap, processed food are a burden on the NHS and should be ashamed of themselves – and you have the perfect storm of a divided nation. On one side is a company that still cares; on the other a faceless, finger-wagging elite who don’t understand anything about people’s lives or how delicious those sausage rolls really are. Every meaty controversy, from George Osborne’s pasty tax to David Cameron’s pretend-pasty eating, from the cancer scares of bacon to the blanket meat tax proposed by Oxford University at the end of last year, has a bead of this conflict in it: “Why don’t you poor people take better care of yourselves?” v “Why don’t you rich people just get permanently out of my face?” Then some rightwing antihero – Morgan, or Nigel Farage – rides to the rescue, saying: “We don’t judge! We’re team mind-your-own-business,” when in fact it was their wealth-supremacist worldview that created the division in the first place. Meanwhile, of course, pork is off on its own mission as the incendiary device in what has now been a long wave of Islamophobia (note: the pork is rarely delicious in this context, but it still tends to be processed). This is no flash in the pan – in 2012, a man was arrested in Crawley, West Sussex, for throwing ham at a mosque, while another man was arrested four years later for throwing a bag of rancid meat at a mosque in Finsbury Park, north London. There are more Reddit threads fantasising about keeping Muslims out of your house by smearing your door handles with bacon than you would credit. All of which is why the confusion last week about a protest outside Greggs – mistaken for a demo against the vegan sausage roll, actually a demo in support of Brexit – is understandable. That EDL contingent is heavily invested in pork as a kind of toxic talisman, capable of defiling the enemy while at the same time expressing everything that is great about Britishness. As a product that also offends vegetarians and probably feminists, it’s win-win. It is a perfect case study of the new tactics of the far right: take something that most people like; ascribe to the people who don’t like it feelings far stronger than they really have; roll it into a symbol of hard-nationalism and bigotry; then, with magnificent syllogism, declare that everyone who likes bacon ergo hates Muslims, and also, everyone who likes Muslims probably hates bacon. Gammongate, too, exploded from this tinderbox. On paper, the insult “gammon” was aimed at any angry red-faced man because his face was red like a big ham. The imputation professional offence-takers chose to hear was that it was any working-class man, which it wasn’t (it wasn’t confined to a class, although it was confined to men). But it did mean more than “red-faced”; it meant anyone overinvested in ham qua national identity. If a sausage roll and a vegan sausage roll could exist quite happily side by side, if honest, hard-working meat eaters and self-righteous vegans could all go to the same shop, that would be disastrous for this zero-sum worldview in which obliterating the other is entirely justified by the notion that, otherwise, you yourself, your identity, your honour, your right to brown sauce, will be obliterated. In which case, this may well have been a beautiful, devilish, vast political act by Greggs – never forget how total its sausage roll dominance is (1.5m sold a week). If it could dominate the vegan market like that, we might be looking at phase one in national healing: we can all think different things but like the same stuff. Who knew Arcadia was a diverse selection of baked goods? I did a taste test, by the way: the Quorn ones taste fleetingly like sausage but have a different texture, a bit firmer and less greasy. Truthfully, both are delicious. The steak and cheese roll, in counterpoint, is totally disgusting.",Veganism; Pork; Greggs; Vegan food and drink; Life and style; Food & drink industry; Business; Baking; Society; Politics; UK news; Food,Life and style
2018-05-30T23:16:55Z,FTSE firms' excuses for lack of women in boardrooms 'pitiful and patronising',https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/pitiful-views-on-women-in-boardrooms-permeate-ftse-firms,"Women aren’t a good fit in boardrooms, most of them don’t want the hassle of a big job and they don’t understand the complex issues discussed in board meetings. That is according to executives at the UK’s biggest firms, who have offered the excuses to explain why their boardrooms are dominated by men.

According to the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, the excuses given included: “I don’t think women fit comfortably into the board environment” “There aren’t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board - the issues covered are extremely complex” “Most women don’t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board” “Shareholders just aren’t interested in the make-up of the board, so why should we be?” “My other board colleagues wouldn’t want to appoint a woman on our board” “All the ‘good’ women have already been snapped up” “We have one woman already on the board, so we are done - it is someone else’s turn” “There aren’t any vacancies at the moment - if there were I would think about appointing a woman” “We need to build the pipeline from the bottom - there just aren’t enough senior women in this sector” “I can’t just appoint a woman because I want to” Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, an organisation that champions corporate social responsibility, said: “As you read this list of excuses, you might think it’s 1918, not 2018. It reads like a script from a comedy parody, but it’s true. Surely we can now tackle this once and for all. Maybe those that give credence to these excuses are the ones that are not up to sitting on boards and should move over: we are in the 21st century after all.” The independent Hampton-Alexander review is being led by Sir Philip Hampton, one of Britain’s most highly regarded bosses, who has challenged all FTSE 350 companies to make sure at least a third of their board members and leadership are women by 2020. He said excuses such as those highlighted in the government report were heard less now than a few years ago. “However, leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs – or quietly blocking progress – are really not much better.” The Department for Business said there had been some more tangible progress in recent years, with the number of women on boards having “more than doubled in the FTSE 350 since 2011”, according to the most recent statistics – released in November last year. “In that time, the number of all-male FTSE 350 company boards also fell from 152 to 10,” it said. • This article was amended on 31 May 2018.

2018-10-09T12:00:35Z,"Kenneth Olisa: ‘To improve social mobility, we need to raise children’s aspirations’",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/kenneth-olisa-social-mobility-raise-childrens-aspirations,"Improving social mobility may sometimes seem like an uphill task in a time of rising inequality but Sir Kenneth Olisa, chair of the judging panel for the second year running at the UK Social Mobility awards which take place next week, says this is all the more reason to focus on levelling the playing field. The 66-year-old, who was knighted in 2018 for services to business and philanthropy, has had a string of roles from running his own merchant bank to lord-lieutenant of Greater London. In 2016 he was named by Powerlist as the most influential black man in Britain. Olisa argues that creating better opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds like his should be a priority, including for business. People will tell you social mobility is a great idea, he says, “but just saying that and then not doing anything about it isn’t helpful. “The trouble I have found in business generally, [is that] I open my mouth about social mobility and people nod and say ‘oh it’s a very important thing, here’s what we’re doing in our corporate social responsibility programmes and then they carry on with whatever they were going to do before.” His own background – state-educated child of mixed race brought up by a single mother (his Nigerian father left while he was still young) in the 1950s, who went on to Cambridge – has informed his desire to promote inclusion and mobility. So, how does he respond to figures published last month showing that more than 14 million people live in poverty or research by the OECD showing that, far from improving, social mobility in the UK has stagnated? “I don’t consider that social mobility is a question of relative poverty and/or earnings power. Earning more money isn’t a measure of social mobility, it’s a measure of earnings. You don’t have to be a high earner to have improved your social standing, indeed many important roles in our society, such as magistrates, aren’t paid,” says Olisa. The Social Mobility awards, set up by Tunde Banjoko, founder of the Making the Leap charity in 2017, are intended to incentivise organisations to break new ground in opening up opportunity. The commercial logic for having mobility as a target is clear, Olisa argues: finding the best talent is ultimately good for competitive advantage and the bottom line. “If you’re going to have a national football team you go to find the best football players. You don’t say, well let’s have people whose parents play football or who knows somebody that I know.” Most sports “dig deep into the talent pool” (at least at participant level) while business “is way behind that”. Business just hasn’t thought about diversity enough and therefore recruitment is a matter of habit. “It’s not that people are evil. They’ve just always done it [the same way]. We’re trying to break them out of that habit,” he says. Second is that those in charge of recruitment tend to be middle managers “loaded” with multiple responsibilities, so adding something else to their list can seem to be just more work. Asked if awards aren’t just tinkering around the edges of a big problem, he says that a major reason they are useful is the emphasis on organisations being able not only to demonstrate that they have strategies in place to widen the pool of talent they recruit from but also a plan for developing talent. Breaking down barriers by fostering ‘soft skills’ such as networking are also a way businesses can drive change he says. “Even now, if you went to a great public school and Oxford or Cambridge you’ve got a higher chance of getting into a top job than if you didn’t. And that isn’t a meaningful filter in the 21st century.” What about the government’s Social Mobility Commission? “I don’t quite understand what went wrong within the Social Mobility Commission but I very rarely heard anything from them,” he says. “They didn’t really say very much. They were all about data.” Still, he’s more optimistic about its new chair, Martina Milburn, the former chief executive of the Prince’s Trust. “She’s a force of nature. [She’s] someone whose day job is driving social mobility by the bucket load.” He has praise too for former education secretary Justine Greening’s efforts to put the spotlight on the issue with her Social Mobility Pledge. “What Justine Greening did from a high position was to challenge people’s thinking. So I am therefore a huge supporter.” Asked whether he thinks the government is committed to fairness and social mobility, he replies: “Yes. But the answer doesn’t lie with legislators or regulators,” suggesting rather that, “it’s a matter of Darwinian principle that those who wish to survive and prosper will need to hire talented people from wherever they originate and not just people ‘who look like me’” . Olisa says that until his late 50s he would have said the colour of his skin was irrelevant. Only then did he realise the value of being a role model, not least for young people from minority ethnic backgrounds. But he laments that there is still “so much wasted talent” waiting to be tapped. “I look into the eyes of somebody who had a crap childhood and [who] ends up therefore with their trajectory so low it makes me weep. We need to be looking at ways of raising children’s aspirations.” Curriculum vitae Age: 66. Lives: London and Briantspuddle, Dorset.

2018-04-06T09:59:52Z,"Portugal futsal kings follow Ronaldo’s lead and offer lessons for England

",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/06/portugal-futsal-ronaldo-england-fa-jorge-braz,"‘There are no magic recipes,” declares Jorge Braz, head coach of Portugal’s futsal Euro 2018 winning team. Maybe not but certain ingredients can be familiarly potent: two European behemoths slugging it out for glory, the standout superstar forced off with injury, momentarily crushing the belief of Portugal’s Seleção, only for the team to regroup and wilfully, skilfully snatch a first European title. Portugal’s futsal squad repeated the exploits of the 11-a-side national team to make history in the small-sided game in February in Slovenia, edging out the serial Euro champions Spain. The preened prowess of Cristiano Ronaldo was not in the house. This was all about the team that rotate effortlessly around the majestic Ricardinho, the five-times futsal world player of the year nicknamed O Mágico (the magician). Like Ronaldo in the Euro 2016 final against France, Ricardinho hobbled off injured in the biggest game of his international career. “It was our moment,” recalls the calm and inspirational Braz. “We always believed it was going to fall our way.” Speaking to the Guardian at a recent English Football Association futsal conference at St George’s Park, Braz recalls the achievement. “It’s very curious that it happened almost the same way,” he says. “But at that moment I don’t remember [the Ronaldo 2016 incident]. I was thinking of so much in the match; I was extremely confident with the team. We worked very hard to be prepared. The hero here was the team.” It is this ruthless attention to detail and preparation that earned Braz an invitation by the FA to showcase his experience to 250 coaches alongside various FA futsal and football coaches and Marc Carmona, the head of coach education at Barcelona. Portugal’s first Euro futsal title caps a remarkable wider football hat‑trick – after the football Euros in 2016 and the Fifa Beach Soccer World Cup victory in 2015 – and is testament to a recent overhaul of youth participation in futsal and national team selection (more chances for homegrown players rather than naturalised Brazilians) by the Portuguese Football Federation. Although Portugal is a relative youngster in the world of futsal – “We have only 30 years of futsal … it is nothing,” says Braz – England could be said to be still learning how to walk. But the FA has finally – after a stuttering decade-long partial embrace of the Fifa-sanctioned version of five-a-side – made futsal one of the four pathways in its National Game Strategy. Mike Skubala, the FA’s futsal elite performance manager and England head coach, told the conference it was a “landmark moment”. He wants to build participation “from the bottom up” and eventually create a “twin-track” system whereby children play futsal and football at primary school age before specialising, as happens in Spain, Portugal and Brazil (where it is estimated that more people play futsal than football). The health and wellbeing benefits of more children playing more sport in school are undeniable. It is seen as a game in its own right – with adult teams (all non‑professional) in 10 national leagues, six male and four female, and a thriving university league culture – but it is as a development tool for young footballers that it is gaining real traction. Braz’s coaching masterclass at St George’s Park, working with the new England under-19s squad, focused on attacking one against ones and echoed many of the messages at the heart of the England DNA about bravery and ball mastery. “How can you create space to take advantage?” was a constant question to players. “Accelerate the ball”; “Go forward, take the advantage!” Braz believes England is on to something with its push to build mass participation in futsal and perhaps alter the DNA of tomorrow’s elite footballer. “There are no magic recipes,” he cautions. “Every country must build their own way. It’s about creating opportunities for everyone [to play].” But England has a few natural “advantages” (he likes this theme): the foul weather, the stirring passion for football and the Premier League riches. “Because of your climate, your strong winter, you have the necessity to play a lot of indoor. Futsal can give you a lot. “The English player has a lot of strength, is becoming more and more coordinated and technical. Futsal can give that. If that is a problem, that for so many years they say that English players are not so technical – like the Portuguese or Brazilian – then futsal can improve that a lot. You have to put some programmes in with the younger ages.” Schools and county FAs – “It’s our main interest in Portugal” – are crucial in building participation, he says. “We wanted to make futsal a very important sport in Portugal, with a lot of social relevance,” he explains. In 2011 the Portuguese Football Federation set out to make futsal “the most popular sport in school sports halls”. But the Premier League football clubs, many of whom have adopted futsal into their academy games programme, could also hold the key. “It’s another way, an elite way of going. England has so many passions for football, it’s a massive opportunity. If Liverpool, Everton, Manchester [clubs], if they have futsal squads, if it develops a little bit – OK you have to have good players and a good level for competition to be good – but that’s what happened in Portugal. Benfica v Sporting in futsal? That is crazy. Everyone wants to watch, everyone wants to go.” Skubala agrees. Premier League interest in setting up futsal clubs can only be a positive, he says. Besides, the clubs have a “corporate social responsibility” to offer alternatives for players released in their teens, he says. “It’s exactly what Barcelona do,” he says. “For a few million quid a year, they could have another professional unit for these kids to go into. “There is a corporate social responsibility for top-level clubs on how they keep kids in their club, when they’ve been in the professional game. So when they release players age 16, 17, 18, can they release them into another professional programme in the club, rather than dropping them out?” Back at the grassroots Skubala’s vision – like Braz’s in Portugal – is to overcome the problems of access and cost of indoor facilities. “We need to accept that. But we’re trying to build from the bottom up in the schools system … It doesn’t mean we’ll change the culture overnight but it’s a big step in the right direction.”",Futsal; Football; Sport,Football

I’m Tim Walker, and this is all the news that’s fit to type. If you’d like to receive the briefing by email, sign up here. Top stories: World laughs at Trump’s ‘accomplishments’ Donald Trump addressed the UN general assembly on Tuesday, boasting that his administration had “accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country”, which led many of the world’s most powerful people to laugh at him on live TV. Trump insisted the US would “reject the ideology of globalism and … embrace the doctrine of patriotism”. - Tough crowd. Trump is used to making speeches to diehard fans; he won’t take kindly to the UN’s open derision, writes Julian Borger in New York. - Plan for Iran. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said there would be “hell to pay” if Tehran continued to “lie, cheat, and deceive”, but other world powers have agreed a plan to sidestep the US sanctions. Trump dismisses Kavanaugh accuser Trump also used a televised meet-and-greet with the president of Colombia to disparage Deborah Ramirez, the woman who has accused supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis in her face at a party when they were both students. Ramirez “has nothing”, Trump said of the alleged incident, which Kavanaugh denies. “She was totally inebriated and all messed up and she doesn’t know.” - Frat boy or family man? Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle has become inextricably intertwined with the #MeToo movement, reports Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington DC. - A woman’s touch. The GOP has enlisted a female lawyer to question Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford when she testifies to the Senate judiciary committee on Thursday. All 11 Republicans on the panel are men. ‘America’s Dad’ gets three to 10 years for sexual assault Kavanaugh probably won’t thank Bill Cosby’s spokesman for claiming both men are victims of a “sex war”, thus linking the supreme court nominee to Cosby just as the 81-year-old comedian was led from a courtroom in handcuffs, sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for sexual assault. Cosby was found guilty of drugging and molesting Andrea Constand at his Philadelphia home in 2004. - ‘I had to testify.’ Cosby “took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it,” Constand wrote, in a powerful impact statement submitted at the sentencing hearing. Hurricane Florence still causing record floods in Carolinas A week after the storm abated, Hurricane Florence is still making waves in Georgetown, South Carolina, where 9,000 residents are bracing for record floods as water that fell inland finally reaches the coast. Officials said they expected nearby rivers to crest in the small hours of Thursday, potentially spilling up to 10ft of water into the streets of the small town, which had avoided the worst of the storm’s early impact. - Get out of town. The community was under voluntary evacuation on Tuesday night, though many at-risk residents vowed to stay put. - Death toll. Hurricane Florence and its aftermath have resulted in the deaths of more than 40 people in at least three states. Crib sheet - The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said he is prepared to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, “to break the shell of mutual mistrust” between the two nations. - New Englanders are conflicted about the region’s signature coffee-and-donuts brand’s decision to rebrand itself simply as Dunkin’. - A US Army reservist has been arrested on suspicion of spying for China, amid trade war tensions between the two superpowers. - The Bulgarian music star and convicted sex trafficker Ivan Glavchev has been ejected from the country’s Celebrity Big Brother contest following protests from women’s rights campaigners.

The social media giant has its first streaming hit on its hands with Sorry For Your Loss, a critically acclaimed drama about grief starring Elizabeth Olsen and Janet McTeer. It’s good enough that “you could realistically find this show anywhere: on HBO, AMC, Showtime, Netflix or Hulu,” writes Stuart Heritage. The man who beat Monsanto DeWayne Johnson may only have months to live, but his legacy could be felt for generations: he’s the first person to successfully sue Monsanto for hiding the cancer risks of its herbicides. Now he and the global agrochemicals company are locked in a fight to the death – literally – as Johnson tells Sam Levin in California.

2018-09-16T06:00:16Z,Woke business: have big brands found a conscience or a marketing ploy?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/16/woke-business-nike-colin-kaepernick-levis-pepsi,"What’s more American: blue jeans or guns? It used to be you didn’t have to choose. That was before the announcement last week by Levi Strauss &amp; Co, the 165-year-old denim company, of a partnership with Everytown for Gun Safety and other gun violence prevention groups. “While taking a stand can be unpopular with some, doing nothing is no longer an option,” the Levi’s chief executive, Chip Bergh, wrote. “Business has a critical role to play and a moral obligation to do something.” The National Rifle Association scoffed, declaring “a particularly sad episode in the current surge in corporate virtue-signaling”. “We can only assume that Levi’s accountants have determined that resulting skinny jeans sales will be enough to offset the permanent damage to their once-cherished brand,” the gun lobbyists said. The Levi’s move did not have the markings of a purely venal business play: Bergh, a former US army captain, has spoken out about guns before. But with Nike unveiling Colin Kaepernick as its latest spokesman the same week, and a startling wave of brands taking stands on issues they might previously have shunned, the NRA accusation had bite. Is this new brand bravery for real? And if so, what’s driving it? As consumers are roiled by Facebook fights and riven by mistrust in Donald Trump’s America, corporations have confronted the old question – of how to move product – with sometimes experimental answers, analysts say, and deeply mixed results. “More and more, consumers are looking for brands that stand for something and take a position, so that they can make a decision for themselves if that represents their identity and their values,” said Todd Fischer, a senior vice-president at GMR Marketing, a global agency. “Brands have been pulled deeper into the conversation.” But that conversation comes with risks and corporations sometimes get it wrong. The roll call of shame is topped by Pepsi, which in spring 2017 released an ad in which Kendall Jenner, the millennial model, led a group of (very handsome) protesters evoking the Black Lives Matter movement in a showdown with (very handsome) police. The standoff was resolved by a shared soda. “If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi,” Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, tweeted. The spot was abruptly canned. What was Pepsi thinking? Corporations in general are under increasing pressure to “take a stand in ways that go beyond the generic corporate social responsibility platitudes they used to be able to sort of hide behind,” said Michael Serazio, a professor of communications at Boston College. “We’ve evolved to a point in branding history where consumers purchase things not because of their utility but because of what it signals to other people in their social milieu. What you’ve seen over the last couple of years is this trend toward corporations taking more specific and more controversial political stances.” Many other corporations have dared to tread where Pepsi stumbled. Yuengling, the Pennsylvania brewery, endorsed Trump for president; Patagonia, the California-based clothier, sued Trump for annulling public lands; Delta Airlines and REI, the gear store, came out in favor of gun control; Adidas stood behind Kanye West, the inventor of the brand’s best-selling Yeezy shoe line, after his controversial statements about slavery and Trump. Burger King, meanwhile, made a Whopper commercial about net neutrality, and after Trump was elected, Heineken staged an excruciating series of conversations between strangers to assert “there’s more that unites than divides us”. With its recruitment of Kaepernick as spokesman, Nike seemed to go even further. As a leader of the movement among National Football League players to kneel during the national anthem to protest about police violence against people of color, the formerly star quarterback found himself ostracized by the league and attacked personally by Trump, starting when Trump was still a candidate. Featuring star athletes and others who have overcome various forms of adversity to become champions, the new Nike ad is narrated by Kaepernick and finishes with the tagline: “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.” The line induces either chills or nausea, depending on your tolerance for corporate plays at poignancy. It appeared to find the mark with consumers, Nike’s stock touching an all-time high on Thursday. Trump, for one, thought the ad did not work. “What was Nike thinking?” he tweeted. Patrick Rishe, the director of the sports business program at Washington University in St Louis, who interviewed 50 people in sports marketing and media for his recent book They Shoot … They Score, said the company had obviously done its research and was thinking it was going to sell shoes. “The messages that these companies are getting from their market research with millennials and Gen Z consumers is these people want their brands to be authentic, they want them to be culturally relevant, they have to be digital,” Rishe said. “Younger folks want brands to stand for something. ‘I don’t want to just see your logo. You’re just trying to sell me some shoes or shirts. I want you to stand for something.’ And when you take that leap of faith as a company, you are running risks.” America’s social and economic divisions predate Trump. But as a candidate and now as president, he clearly comprehends what corporations have also realized: taking definitive stands on divisive issues may alienate some people but it also inspires loyalty. Trump understands that he can make a stronger connection with consumers – ie voters – if he does not restrict the conversation to products or to policies. Instead of immigration, he talks about gang violence. Instead of Russian cyber-attacks, he talks about Hillary Clinton. Instead of criminal justice reform, he talks about football. It might not make sense for someone with urgent personal healthcare needs to vote for Trump based on a shared opinion about Kaepernick, just like it might not make sense for people to buy shoes because they admire Kaepernick. But it works. “The point of branding is to make a corporation into a human being,” said Serazio. “And that is fundamentally ridiculous. And yet that is the basis of our advertising, contemporary consumer culture.”",US news; Nike; Business; Activism; Colin Kaepernick; Pepsico,US news
2018-09-26T05:00:11Z,While economic growth continues we’ll never kick our fossil fuels habit | George Monbiot,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/26/economic-growth-fossil-fuels-habit-oil-industry,"We’re getting there, aren’t we? We’re making the transition towards an all-electric future. We can now leave fossil fuels in the ground and thwart climate breakdown. Or so you might imagine, if you follow the technology news. So how come oil production, for the first time in history, is about to hit 100m barrels a day? How come the oil industry expects demand to climb until the 2030s? How is it that in Germany, whose energy transition (Energiewende) was supposed to be a model for the world, protesters are being beaten up by police as they try to defend the 12,000-year-old Hambacher forest from an opencast mine extracting lignite – the dirtiest form of coal? Why have investments in Canadian tar sands – the dirtiest source of oil – doubled in a year? The answer is, growth. There may be more electric vehicles on the world’s roads, but there are also more internal combustion engines. There be more bicycles, but there are also more planes. It doesn’t matter how many good things we do: preventing climate breakdown means ceasing to do bad things. Given that economic growth, in nations that are already rich enough to meet the needs of all, requires an increase in pointless consumption, it is hard to see how it can ever be decoupled from the assault on the living planet. When a low-carbon industry expands within a growing economy, the money it generates stimulates high-carbon industry. Anyone who works in this field knows environmental entrepreneurs, eco-consultants and green business managers who use their earnings to pay for holidays in distant parts of the world and the flights required to get there. Electric vehicles have driven a new resource rush, particularly for lithium, that is already polluting rivers and trashing precious wild places. Clean growth is as much of an oxymoron as clean coal. But making this obvious statement in public life is treated as political suicide. The Labour party’s new environment policy, published this week, rightly argues that “our current economic model is threatening the foundations on which human wellbeing depends”. It recognises that ecological collapse cannot be prevented through consumer choice or corporate social responsibility: the response to our greatest predicament must be determined by scientific research, and planned, coordinated and led by government. It pledges “to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C”. But, like almost everyone else, it ignores the fundamental problem. Beyond a certain point, economic growth – the force that lifted people out of poverty, and cured deprivation, squalor and disease – tips us back into those conditions. To judge by the devastation climate breakdown is wreaking, we appear already to have reached this point. The contradiction is most obvious when the policy document discusses airports (an issue on which the party is divided). Labour guarantees that any airport expansion must adhere to its tests on climate change. But airport expansion is incompatible with its climate commitments. Even if aircraft emissions are capped at 2005 levels, by 2050 they will account for half the nation’s carbon budget if the UK is not to contribute to more than 1.5C of global warming. If airports grow, they will swallow even more of the budget. Airport expansion is highly regressive, offending the principles of justice and equity that Labour exists to uphold. Regardless of the availability and cost of flights, they are used disproportionately by the rich, as these are the people with the business meetings in New York, the second homes in Tuscany, and the money to pay for winter holidays in the sun. Yet the impacts – noise, pollution and climate breakdown – are visited disproportionately on the poor. I recognise that challenging our least contested ideologies – growth and consumerism – is a tough call. But in New Zealand, it is beginning to happen. Jacinda Ardern, the Labour prime minister, says: “It will no longer be good enough to say a policy is successful because it increases GDP if it also degrades the physical environment.” How this translates into policy, and whether her party will resolve its own contradictions, remains to be determined. No politician can act without support. If we want political parties to address these issues, we too must start addressing them. We cannot rely on the media to do it for us. A report by the research group Media Matters found that total coverage of climate change across five US news networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and PBS) amounted to 260 minutes in 2017 – a little over four hours. Almost all of it was a facet of the Trump psychodrama (Will he pull out of the Paris accord? What’s he gone and done this time?) rather than the treatment of climate chaos in its own right. There was scarcely a mention of the link between climate breakdown and the multiple unnatural disasters the US suffered that year; of new findings in climate science; or of the impacts of new pipelines or coalmines. I cannot find a comparable recent study in the UK. I suspect it is a little better, but not a lot. The worst denial is not the claim that this existential crisis isn’t happening. It is the failure to talk about it at all. Not talking about our greatest predicament, even as it starts to bite, requires a constant and determined effort. Taken as a whole (of course there are exceptions), the media are a threat to humanity. They claim to speak on our behalf, but they either speak against us or do not speak at all. So what do we do? We talk. As the climate writer Joe Romm argued in ThinkProgress this year, a crucial factor in the remarkable shift in attitudes towards LGBT people was the determination of activists to break the silence. They overcame social embarrassment to broach issues that other people found uncomfortable. We need, Romm argues, to do the same for climate breakdown. A recent survey suggests that 65% of Americans rarely or never discuss it with friends or family, while only one in five hear people they know mention the subject at least once a month. Like the media, we subconsciously invest great psychological effort into not discussing an issue that threatens almost every aspect of our lives. Let’s be embarrassing. Let’s break the silence, however uncomfortable it makes us and others feel. Let’s talk about the great unmentionables: not just climate breakdown, but also growth and consumerism.

2018-04-30T06:47:05Z,England's devolution plans leave local charities in the cold,https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2018/apr/30/england-devolution-plans-local-charities-cold,"Local charities are being shut out of devolution planning in England, voluntary sector leaders have warned after a survey found that only one in 20 grassroots groups believed they had been consulted on the process in their area. Failure to involve the local third sector means that emerging “devo” practices risk missing the opportunity to draw on the sector’s reach into communities and to make new structures fully representative. The warning comes in response to the third annual survey by Localgiving, the leading UK network for local charities and community groups. Of respondents in areas of England where devo has begun, such as Greater Manchester and the west of England, 5% said they could recall being consulted about the process. Among all 686 respondents, 27% thought the impact of devo would be positive and 17% that it would be negative, but the majority were unsure or believed it would have no significant impact. There were sharp differences in attitudes around the UK. Only 25% of English respondents thought the impact would be positive, rising to 35% in Wales and 56% in Scotland, where no one regarded it as negative. Chris Dormer, head of business development at Localgiving, said at the launch of the survey report that it was “crazy” for grassroots groups to be excluded from devo planning “when you think these are organisations helping so many beneficiaries, working close to the ground, having such knowledge”. Paul Streets, chief executive of Lloyds Bank Foundation, which supports hundreds of local charities across England and Wales, said the findings confirmed his “pretty bleak” view of the way devo was developing in pioneer English areas. The engagement of local groups in constructing Manchester’s recent homelessness strategy had been one encouraging sign, Streets conceded. But more usually charities were struggling to get their voices heard, especially if there was no effective local council for voluntary service or other umbrella organisation. “Even then, while an umbrella body can be really good, it’s not as good as the rich, bottom-up conversation you really need,” Streets said. Vicky Morgan, head of business development at Circle Collective, a London-based charity and social enterprise working with young people facing barriers to employment, said it was tough for leaders of small charities to find the time to lobby for involvement or to make the links that were needed. Corporate supporters could play a valuable role in helping local charities make their case, Morgan said. But while some businesses, like Sage Foundation, which sponsored the Localgiving report, did lend appropriate expertise, others had a limited view of corporate social responsibility and staff volunteering. The chief executive of one small charity present at the launch recalled a company having sent “20 people for a day to paint our front door”. The Localgiving survey, carried out last year, found that pressures on local charities continued to grow as a result of austerity. Almost four in five (78%) reported a rise in demand for their services over the previous 12 months and 48% said they had been forced to dip into their reserves. Fewer than half – 47% – said they were confident of staying afloat for five years. For the first time, Localgiving estimated the financial value of volunteers in the local voluntary sector, putting it between £7.5bn and £10.5bn a year – a range it describes as “relatively conservative” because it is calculated by pricing hours volunteered at the minimum wage, not the average.

2018-01-29T07:15:29Z,M&S one of UK retailers yet to renew safety deal in Bangladesh factories,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/29/ms-john-lewis-sainsburys-bangladesh-factory-safety-accord,"Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Debenhams, Next and Sainsbury’s are among a group of British retailers yet to join international rivals in renewing their commitment to a factory safety deal in Bangladesh. The legally binding Bangladesh accord on fire and building safety was set up after the fatal collapse of the Rana Plaza textile factory complex in 2013, which killed 1,135 people and is considered the world’s worst garment-industry accident. Bringing together more than 200 international fashion brands, factory owners and unions, it has seen more than $55m (£39m) invested in safety monitoring, training of health and safety committees, and site inspections by 200 trained engineers. Its signatories have also contributed funds for safety measures including improving structural design and installing fire doors and sprinkler systems. More than 1,600 factories are covered by the programme, which comes to an end in May, with just over 80% of the necessary safety work identified by initial inspections. About 60 major international brands using 1,200 Bangladeshi factories – including H&amp;M, Zara’s owner Inditex and Primark – have signed up to a new version of the accord. With only weeks to go until the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy, at least one major British company, Sainsbury’s, has decided not to sign up to the new deal. Several others are holding back amid concerns over costs and possible lack of support from factory owners and the Bangladeshi government. Two industry sources said the tough retail environment in the UK meant retailers were looking to limit corporate social responsibility spending. The original accord cost the largest brands $500,000 a year before further commitments to support any work needed in factories from which they source. The new deal will last for three years maximum with reviews every six months to assess whether the Bangladeshi government is ready to take over its work. Contributions will be capped at €300,000 (£263,000) annually. Sainsbury’s said while it would not be signing up, it remained supportive of progress in Bangladesh. “We remain committed to this issue and will continue to support local manufacturers, helping them reach the highest standards in safety,” a spokesperson said. M&amp;S, John Lewis, Debenhams and Next said they were in discussions and still considering their options ahead of May. Jenny Holdcroft, assistant general secretary of the international union IndustriALL, said: “Brands need to stay with the accord otherwise all the hard work and money they have invested will quickly be undermined.” She said that those brands that did not contribute were letting other more responsible companies “carry the can” for continuing the safety work. Holdcroft added that the deal was important as there was not yet a “credible regulatory system in place in Bangladesh that can take over the work of the accord and guarantee the safety of the factories”.",UK news; Retail industry; Bangladesh; Business; South and central Asia; World news; Marks & Spencer; John Lewis; Debenhams; Next; J Sainsbury; Rana Plaza; Supermarkets,UK news
2018-01-12T16:54:19Z,Never too old for new tricks: the joy of being a mature student,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/12/never-too-old-new-tricks-joy-mature-student-university,"Age is not a barrier when it comes to learning. About 40% of mature students studying at university are over the age of 30, some in their 50s and 60s. Many have mortgages, families and are in full-time employment. Although the prospect of returning to education, essay writing and mixing with younger students can seem daunting, having a few extra years on your peers can be a distinct advantage. Ucas says that universities are happy to accept older students as most arrive with high levels of enthusiasm, commitment and additional life experience. After an 11-year break from education, Philip Hodgson, 40, is studying for an MBA at Bath University. But he admits it’s been a challenge organising both family life and study. “There’s a lot of juggling. I have a young son and if he’s ill it’s a case of should I stay at home or should my wife, who works three days a week?” He believes, however, that the course will change his life and career. “I take it a lot more seriously than I would have done 10 years ago,” he says. After being laid off, single mum Jenni Smyth, 38, invested in her future by using her redundancy money to return to education. She took a full-time psychology course, and intends to go on to do a master’s. “When I first arrived at Manchester University I wanted the full student experience, and being older means I’m a lot more focused on academia and less likely to go partying. “I find being a student a little more flexible compared with work, and the kids love me being a student. Admittedly it’s hard work, and you have to get the books out at all hours, but it’s been a fantastic experience.” Smyth recommends seeking out support and advice on university websites. Manchester also arranges meetings with staff members during its adults returning to education sessions. Sarah Glozer, 34, returned to education twice. The first time she completed a master’s after working for a consultancy firm, and more recently completed a PhD at Nottingham University in corporate social responsibility. “I worked for four and half years for Cadbury, before returning for the PhD programme,” she says. “They were both full-time courses, which allowed me to be fully immersed in the role.” Her advice? “Getting back into academic writing doesn’t take too long. Just play to your strengths and focus on your areas of interest.”",Postgraduates; Students; Mature students; Education; Higher education; Careers; Professional supplements,Education

2018-09-01T23:05:07Z,Mother of Pearl: 'I struggled coming into the fashion industry – I’m not a natural fit',https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/02/no-frills-label-style-with-a-conscience,"When Amy Powney was 10, her parents moved the family from a house in a village in Lancashire to a caravan on a five-acre field with no electricity or running water. Her dad dug a borehole; they erected a wind turbine. Amy and her older sister cut cabbages at six in the morning and saved up their £1.50-an-hour for Reebok Classics and Kappa Poppers to make them look like everyone else, despite the fact that they travelled to school in a handmade trailer attached to the back of their dad’s bike. “Imagine taking phones off your kids now,” says Powney with a laugh. “Well, that’s like what happened to us. We went from a house where you could turn the lights on with a switch, to a caravan where if the wind wasn’t blowing, we couldn’t watch Home and Away.” Flash forward 20-odd years and Powney, 34, is nursing a pink cocktail in the dusky bar of a flash London hotel. She is creative director of the London fashion label Mother of Pearl – as seen at London Fashion Week twice a year and sold in some of the most prestigious stores in the world – having in 12 years worked her way up from the bottom of the company to the top. Last year she married Nick Prendiville, who is a retail consultant, and they live in a beautiful house in Walthamstow, east London, with their puppy. And, as it turned out, you can take the girl out of the field, but you can’t take the field out of the girl: something never sat right with Powney and her career in fashion. “I struggled coming into this industry,” she says, squirming. “I’m not a natural fit. You sit at dinner and don’t have the same stories. When I’m talking about cutting cabbages at six in the morning, that’s not what other people at the table are talking about.” More than class-consciousness, the ethics of the industry itself have made her uncomfortable. It’s no secret, much as it might be overlooked, that fashion manufacturing is one of the most environmentally damaging industries in the world, contributing to plastic mountains, harmful emissions, burnt surplus stock, animal cruelty, intensive farming, unsafe working conditions and unfair wages. While she loves the creativity and adores clothes, those evils have always nagged at Powney. “My upbringing probably set off a process in me,” she says. “When you can’t just go and switch a light on and off, you have questions about where the power comes from.” Back in the early years of the new millennium, Powney had charged into her degree course at Kingston University raging about the absolute state the world was in. Having read Naomi Klein’s 1999 anti-consumerism book No Logo, she was determined to do an organic, ethical graduate clothing collection. “My tutors thought I was mad,” she says. Very few designers were doing ethical fashion at the time – Katharine Hamnett, and some pioneering and daring small labels, fuelled by good will and obstinacy, but with zero industry or state support and little consumer awareness. Powney did what she could. “I used 100% wool, 100% alpaca and reused a few fabrics I’d got from mills,” she says. “I did it. But because it was all so new at the time, you couldn’t just go and get a job in that area. There weren’t any.” Landing an assistant role in 2006 at Mother of Pearl, founded by Maia Norman, was a good compromise. “I thought, it’s a small company, we make quality product, print our silks in the UK, I know all the factories. From a corporate social responsibility level that was pretty good,” she says. “I wasn’t working for the high street or burning clothes. And I fell in love with the company.” But by the time consumers finally started catching up with ethics Powney, now creative director, wasn’t in a position to act according to her values. Mother of Pearl had grown and the demands of fashion retail in a digital world were fierce. “There were too many collections, too much product and me and the staff were really struggling,” she says. A respite came in the form of the 2017 British Fashion Council/Vogue Fashion Fund award, that won the business £100,000. Powney took the opportunity to change the retail sales offering back to twice yearly, giving herself time to work on a passion project called No Frills. Two years later and that core collection of sustainable, ethical, traceable clothing has just gone live. “With No Frills I wanted to be able to say to the consumer, ‘If you’d like to purchase a garment and know where it’s come from, where it’s been, what materials are in it, how it’s been washed and how the people who have worked on it have been treated, we can do that for you,’” she says. The whopping 34-piece core collection – from T-shirts to tailoring – uses Powney’s design signature – feminine, street-influenced and decorative (ironically, featuring a lot of frills as well as pearls) but with sustainability at the fore. Powney has traced her supply chains to alpaca farms in Peru and wool farms in Uruguay, and has sourced her cotton from farms in Turkey. “Normally a designer goes to a fabric supplier for fabric,” says Powney. “But if you say to that supplier, who’s usually Italian, ‘Can you tell me where that came from?’ they’ll say, ‘No idea.’ It wasn’t grown in Italy, of course. And it was probably bought from China, but China probably bought it somewhere else. Maybe it was dyed in Italy, or woven in another European country and went back somewhere else to be finished. But by the end you’ve been around the world three times!” Powney and her product developer started with geography. “Who grows what? Who makes what? We looked for territories or countries that did the full 360, so that we only used one country or maybe moved it once more for another stage,” says Powney. “We wanted a small supply chain that we could vet.” In terms of design, No Frills elevates the ethical clothing choices available now, which tend towards the casual and simple. “I wanted to use good fabrics to bridge the gap between the very T-shirty/denim-type brands and the luxury brands of the world. Could I give the woman something that’s sustainable but a bit more design-led?” Included in the collection are MoP signatures like the Jewel Trouser, now using an ethically sourced denim, and a ruffle blouse from certified organic cotton, as well as a double-breasted tailored trouser suit in soft floral jacquard, made from a blend of organic wool and cotton. A brilliant bonus is that for all its ethics, it’s cheaper to buy than the mainline collection (with prices from £90.) Most of it will never go into sale. “It’s carry-over or trans-seasonal styles that you can wear at any time,” says Powney. “Our aim is that 70% of our business will be No Frills in the next few years.” There’s also a revolutionary way of shopping for it, with a new website enabling customers to filter the whole Mother of Pearl offering (not only No Frills) via 10 sustainable attributes (natural fibres; organic; recycled; digitally printed; traced from field to final; traced from fabric to final; low carbon emissions; low water consumption; respect for animals; mulesing-free (mulesing is an inhumane practice carried out on sheep suffering from flystrike). “Some of our products will only touch one of those attributes,” says Powney. “It’s not greenwashing – it’s honest. I just got to a point where I wasn’t happy about the way things were and wanted to do something about it.” She knows there are a million wrongs in the fashion industry and it’s going to take more than her small business to make an impact, but on a personal level she is happier about her place in it. “I never wanted to be a face,” she says. “I never wanted to go out and talk about myself or my outfit. That wasn’t me. But now I’m telling a story I want to tell and I’m fine about that.”",Fashion; Fashion industry; Ethical business; Business; Organics; Environment,Fashion
2018-05-29T16:51:32Z,After kneeling: the ways NFL players can protest despite the new rules,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/29/nfl-protests-taking-a-knee-alternatives-new-rules-fines,"“All team and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem”: that is how the NFL worded their edict that players who kneel during the national anthem will be fined. We all know what standing looks like, but what about respect? That’s likely to become a crucial question as NFL players look for new protest tactics that won’t endanger their careers or lead to financial penalties for their teams. Can respect still be shown while raising a fist, linking arms, or bowing heads – as some sports teams have done when the anthem has played in the past year? The Guardian spoke with experts in non-violent protest to ask how players might express resistance in light of NFL edict. “They have a number of options,” says Dr Adolphus Belk, a political science professor at Winthrop University. “They can continue to kneel, raise their fists and dare the league to enforce this policy. Or they can engage in some other kind of demonstration: bowing their heads during the anthem or adopting a position of prayer.” Belk says there’s another option the might cary even greater symbolic weight than taking a knee, while also complying with the NFL’s new ruling: “They can all stay in the locker room … they can engage in an act of civil disobedience by being absent, en masse, without falling afoul of the policy. It would make for a striking visual.” Hawk Newsome, the leader of Black Lives Matter’s New York branch, thinks players need to go further: he recommends making an impact by not showing up. Newsome says: “I call on all black NFL players not to show up the first day of work for the first day of season. Send a message, let them pay that fine. And what’s the NFL doing with all these fines? Are they investing them in programmes in the community? I think that’s a question we need to see asked too.” Money raised from NFL fines have traditionally been distributed by the NFL Foundation for programmes including youth football – though not specifically social justice causes. Some people believe the desire to protest could be greater in the upcoming season, now that the NFL has doubled-down on its position and explicitly silenced black protest. By the end of last season, very few players were openly protesting during the anthem, and the issue had become less prominent in the league. But the NFL’s new stance is likely to intensify resistance from players, particularly as many view Donald Trump’s consistent attacks on black NFL players as the reason for the new policy. “The president has said that players who kneel during the anthem should be run out of the league, he’s called them SOBs, he more recently said they need to be run out of the country,” says Belk. “He’s now challenging people on their personhood. He might elicit a response that people weren’t inclined to give him in the first place.” Newsome agrees that the president’s involvement has upped the ante. “The president should be paying more attention to race relations in America and less about what happens on the football field. Now the NFL have doubled down. They had the chance to be a shining star in corporate social responsibility. They could have created programmes in the community. Instead they chose to oppress us. Telling a player to hide in the locker room, stand or pay a fine is an act of oppression.” Newsome, who made headlines after speaking to a Trump supporters at a Washington DC rally, thinks that the majority white fanbase of the NFL makes an irresistible opportunity for groups trying to advance equal rights. “Black people already know that racism exists … we have to invoke empathy in white America. We need them to take action.” He says the NFL is a perfect stage on which to do that. The threat of police brutality is not just theoretical for NFL players and other sports stars – they are not strangers to harassment from law enforcement. “If we go back to what started the demonstrations in the first place, the extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of law enforcement, it’s still happening, not just to US citizens, but to football players themselves” says Belk. He points out that in the past two months Desmond Marrow, a former NFL player, and Sterling Brown, of the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks, have both been victims of excessive police force. Marrow said police “knocked my teeth out, slammed me on my head and choked me out until I was unconscious” when they arrested him in a parking lot in Georgia. The officer seen choking Marrow in a video of the incident was fired for use of excessive force and a felony charge against Marrow was dropped. Last week eight officers were disciplined and an apology was made to Brown after footage emerged of him being tasered by police after a supposed parking violation. Brown was not charged with any crime and the video of the incident does not show him raising his voice or resisting arrest.That’s why the actions that NFL players take next matter: the difference between a knee, a fist, an abstention and a boycott is more than just symbolic. It’s life and death. “Black folk know quite well that it could just as easily be them,” says Belk. “There’s no amount of economic attainment or success that is going to isolate you from this kind of treatment. For those reasons, the issue will continue to come up.”",NFL; US sports; Sport; Protest; Black Lives Matter movement; US news,Sport
2018-05-23T06:26:45Z,Manufacture. Sell. Deploy. Commemorate: is this how we should memorialise war? | Paul Daley,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/may/23/manufacture-sell-deploy-commemorate-is-this-how-we-should-memorialise-war,"Our national cultural institutions stand on the sculpted face of the capital, Canberra, with a symbolism that reflects a practical purpose to serve as the memory and conscience of the country. They have become accustomed to doing more with less as so-called “efficiency dividends” have compounded regular budgetary cuts forcing staff freezes and losses, halts in digitisation and compromises in the storage of collection items. Most of these institutions – the National Library of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, the national archives, gallery, portrait gallery, the Museum of Australian Democracy and the Australian War Memorial – now find themselves faced with a stark choice: start doing dramatically less with less or find money elsewhere. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Most have long embarked on money-raising projects involving corporate donations and private philanthropy. The national library, for example, now generates a quarter of its income from non-government sources; when it was no longer possible to support its prestigious Harold White Fellowships with public funds, the institution’s donors and supporters stepped up. Just how well – or otherwise – the institutions stand to cope in the more medium term after faring badly under the present federal government that has little demonstrated commitment to cultural policy, will become apparent amid the evidence of a parliamentary inquiry into Canberra’s national institutions. Specifically the inquiry is considering “the range of innovative strategies that Canberra’s national institutions are using to maintain viability and relevance to sustainably grow their profile, visitor numbers, and revenue ...” So how and from where should these institutions – which tell the stories of 60,000-plus years of continental Indigenous civilisation, the history of Australian literature, public discourse, civil society, government and engagement in foreign wars – seek money? The inquiry has already, albeit perhaps unintentionally, sparked controversy after receiving a submission from the Medical Association for the Prevention of War (parent organisation of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winners, the International Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons) that criticises the War Memorial for accepting donations from arms manufacturers. The organisation’s national president, Sue Wareham, is a tireless critic of the memorial’s acceptance of such funds. For years many others – including myself in this column – have criticised the decision by AWM director Brendan Nelson to seek money from those who make the weapons that kill and maim civilians in war and the many others in uniform that the memorial commemorates. It’s an element of a bigger picture as I see it – the militarisation of Australian culture and history at the expense of other national foundation narratives, including Indigenous continental civilisation and frontier wars, which the memorial refuses to acknowledge in its exhibits. Comparisons, mostly hypothetical and with which current and perhaps some past directors and their many institutional supporters will disagree, abound, of course. What legitimacy do the manufacturers of sugary drinks and cereals have, for example, in the promotion of good nutrition and the risk of diabetes? Given the significant cuts to scientific/medical research and university funding in recent years, should Big Tobacco take a role in funding cancer research? It will be compelling to see how the committee handles the issue of seeking money from the merchants of death (support for all things Anzac and war memorial have a long tradition of obscurant bipartisanship) and how the various directors manage questions about where any fundraising bottom line might exist for them. The submissions, including the War Memorial’s, are here. Nelson – articulate, genial and often very persuasive – is, like Wareham, a former medical doctor. He’s also a former defence minister and federal opposition leader. He is impeccably connected politically and to the defence/weapons industry. His political sway is critical at a time when he’s seeking $500m to expand the memorial. Nelson’s term expires in May, 2019 – just after the federal budget that could deliver the memorial the funding for his big expansion. He did a long, compelling interview with Hamish Macdonald on Radio National Breakfast this week. It’s worth a listen. Asked if it was part of the memorial’s remit to seek funds from weapons manufacturers, Nelson said: It certainly is. In fact I regard it as part of corporate social responsibility ... you need to know that I have actively gone seeking money from these companies and there are a number of them that I’m very concerned won’t support us ... When Australians are deployed ... whether it’s into war of peacekeeping or humanitarian disaster relief we expect them to be equipped with the very best possible equipment that is available to them and I think it is extraordinarily important ... that these companies have a responsibility itself to completing the loop, to explaining what is being done in the name of our country ... and also the impact it had had upon them. The loop? Manufacture. Sell. Deploy. Commemorate. Brendon Kelson was the War Memorial’s director from 1990 to 1994 after a distinguished career in the public administration of national cultural policy and institutions. He writes in his submission to the inquiry: “The Memorial should not be in the business of seeking or accepting funding or sponsorships from the manufacturers of weapons of war. It is at odds with all the Memorial stands for and an affront to all who served and died for the nation, those who returned with shattered lives and the damaged families left behind. It amounts to an institutional loss of moral compass ... The Memorial should be obliged to take steps to extract itself from present funding and sponsorship arrangements with military industries and not enter into any further deals.” Stay tuned.

I rang up the organiser and said: “I can come, but I’ll have to bring my baby.” He was eight months old and used to sit in a high chair. We get a lot of young mothers who are embarrassed to be there; having a baby at the table immediately makes a connection. Straight away, you are talking about sleep, or lack of. Before I started, I thought I was socially aware. Actually, I had no clue. I was living in my own little bubble. My boys come home from school. “Can I get a snack?” “Of course you can.” It has been a massive eye-opener. Quite a few asylum-seeking families who come to our food bank had babies of the same age. The bittersweet thing is they are still coming, so we see their babies grow up. The mums remember my little boy. He will turn three in May. I see lots of single gentlemen in their 60s, who have lived in Sheffield their entire lives, had a health condition and can no longer work. They say: “It’s all fine.” Then you will hear the voice crack and the tears start. They say: “I’m sorry, I tried not to come.” At first I used to come out and cry. Now, it’s more like anger. Things aren’t getting better for these people, our guests. I talk to my boys about it. I hope that, by talking, the next generation will think differently. Abdalkarim Sama, 66 Sufra NW London food bank I worked in engineering all my life. My last firm, where I was manager, closed down. It was winter and it was so boring at home. One day, I went to the supermarket and they were collecting for Sufra. I asked if they could give me a volunteering job. It was so interesting to meet new people. If you help, you feel good. I thought: I’ll carry on here. It’s the opposite of engineering, isn’t it? There, you are working with machines, delivering stuff, forklifts, supplying car parts to other engineering companies. I work five days a week; it’s nearly a full-time job. It keeps me out of trouble and I get exercise. My father used to do the same thing in Uganda. He used to help local people who were in trouble with food. There was one guy who asked for food. After he had his soup, he said: “I feel like a king.” It made me very happy. We tell people: “This is your right. You need it, so take it. Don’t feel embarrassed.” Anybody who walks in and says they want to eat, we give to them. Nobody goes hungry here. Benjamin Russell, 40 Clapham Park food bank, London It was my partner, Liberty, who inspired me. When she became very poorly a few years back with lupus, she found herself having to use the food bank to get by. Last year, she started to volunteer. I’m a scriptwriter and she said: “You’re spending so much time in the library. Why don’t you come and help?” My instinct was: that’s not for me. I’ve never done much charity work. I wasn’t sure what it would involve. But it’s quite something working down there. It really gives you a focus. Everyone digs in and does their best. It’s pretty heart-wrenching at times. You have to bite your lip and offer support. I’m not as good at that as the more experienced people. Some people moan about the quality of the food. The biggest problem is that, because you can’t do fresh stuff, the quality isn’t great. Liberty is trying to get people to donate dried herbs and spices so they can be added to stews. But please, no tins of beans. We’ve got cupboards of them. Kelli Kennedy, 24 Oasis food bank, London For my MA, I researched food insecurity. I had no intention, when I came to the UK from California, to focus on that. But I read a lot of articles about food banks. After my degree, I felt compelled to do something. On my first day, I sat with the food bank users while they waited for their parcels. People can request items – whether they prefer tea or coffee, are vegetarian or don’t have a stove. If you are in food poverty, you still have preferences. I’ve been surprised by how open people are. Even if their stories are sad, it makes me feel more connected. When I talk to immigrants, it makes me conscious of the fact that, because of my visa, I am not eligible for benefits, either. I, too, would have to rely on my community. It’s only recently that I’ve felt London is the place I call home. Lizzy Hall, 49 The Hygiene Bank, nationwide I didn’t plan to set up the Hygiene Bank. In August, I sent a WhatsApp to some friends saying I was collecting toiletries for food banks. They shared it. I started getting messages saying: “I hear you’re collecting …” My partner has a shoe shop in Sevenoaks, Kent, so people dropped donations in. Then they said: “Have you got anywhere apart from the shoe shop? Have you got anywhere apart from Sevenoaks?” Four months on, we have 65 projects nationally and have provided 6.3 tonnes of essential toiletries. On my first visit to a food bank, a woman walked in with two children in school uniform and said: ‘Ooh, shall we get a toothbrush?!’ For these things to be considered treats was unfathomable to me, but they can change the world for one person. Who can present their best self if they aren’t feeling good? It’s isolating, humiliating. These are the words I hear all the time. If we can remove this one symptom of poverty – hygiene poverty – people can integrate. They can go to school, go to that interview. I met a woman who was living in a hostel with two children, getting food from a food bank. She had been married, had a home. Then her husband died unexpectedly – as did mine, seven years ago. Everything collapsed in my life, but my finances didn’t. I thought: “Imagine trying to deal with that on top of the grief.” I was left comfortable, which means I have time to do this. Part of me thinks my whole life has led me to this. Jewel Ahumibe, 68 Sparkhill food bank, Birmingham When the food bank started, my husband and I were invited to the opening. This is supposed to be a rich country. But I feel blessed to be able to help. I make sure the area is nice for the clients. You don’t rush, you let them take their time. I give them a hug. Some are crying. You say hello, introduce yourself, offer a drink. We say: have a look in the bag. If there is an item you don’t like, we will try to swap it. You have to be ever so careful. We’re giving them pasta, but can they cook it? They might not have the money for electricity or gas. Maybe one of the group might bring along bread. A loaf of bread is a special thing. You haven’t got to cook it. You can just eat. Yunus Khalifa, 30 Anesis North Point church food bank, Coventry I volunteer with Penny Appeal, which organises biryanis for the food bank. We distribute about 150 of them. They are almost always gone. I try to make sure we’re being joyful and put a smile on someone else’s face. You don’t talk to them like “a homeless person”, you just talk to them like a person. Sometimes I see people I’ve grown up with, gone to school with, and think how quickly life can change. The church that organises it gives a little talk before they distribute the food. A little prayer in Jesus’s name. Faith is a part of it. Being a Muslim, I’ve got nothing against this; we follow Jesus as well as Muhammad. My wife is from India. She came over here two years ago and had this image of England as having no poverty. When I expose her to stuff like this, it helps her to understand. You can’t do as much as you want to do, but even a small action gives back to a community. Spiritually, it helps me, it strengthens me. Joyce Leggate, 66 Kirkcaldy food bank, Fife I retired after 40 years in the NHS, working as a midwife with drug users and people who experienced deprivation. I could see the effects of not having money, not having a break in life. A number of people I worked with during their pregnancy come to the food bank, so I get quite a lot of cuddles. Some of the babies are mums themselves now. The way I think is: if you can do something to help, why wouldn’t you? Kirkcaldy is an area of high unemployment. There are a lot of second- and third-generation unemployed families. Last month, we issued nearly 1,000 food parcels. The public in Kirkcaldy is so generous. Anything that is a bit different is appreciated. People are so grateful for jam. Just now, we are getting packets of shortbread. It’s humbling to be able to make somebody’s day that wee bit better. Mike Scott, 54 The Goodwin Pantry, Hull We call it a food pantry; the difference between us and a food bank is that we charge a fee of £3. There was a lot of consultation with single parents and people who are these days referred to as “the working poor” (which is not a phrase I like). We charge so that people feel they can maintain their dignity. The pantry is based on the Great Thornton estate. It’s like a shop. We’ve got fresh items – leeks, mangoes, onions, tangerines. We’ve got ambient food, tinned food, frozen food. We’ve got people making friends. When we get to know attendees, we can dig a bit deeper, find out what the issues are and hopefully develop a wraparound project. Every few months, we have cooking demonstrations. We’ve got about 170 members. We get new ones every week, which to my mind is very alarming, given the increasing numbers of millionaires. Many years ago, I worked for a private business and the boss was a millionaire. I worked my backside off for peanuts. I was 29 when I went to university to study social work. It just sits with my values. I enjoy my work immensely, but I’ve never seen it as bad as this in terms of the rank poverty. Eileen Whitehorn, 71 Wallingford emergency food bank, Oxfordshire This is an affluent area. I’m from the north and the first thing I noticed was all the BMWs and Audis here. The senior school has what they call a links worker. One pupil had turned up at school and he hadn’t showered because he had no running hot water. The links worker knew I was attached to a church and asked if we could help, so we did a hamper for the family. Then I emailed the council to say that it was appalling that a mum was living in those conditions. Eventually, they got social housing. A friend of mine and I were talking about it and we decided to start a food bank in Wallingford. That was eight years ago – she’s now our manager. The universal credit [rollout] has been appalling. One guy was in hospital; he had had a stroke. He rang up and left a message to explain and they sanctioned him. It took nearly nine months to sort out. He had a young family. You can’t judge people till you know their circumstances. I grew up near Halifax in a very poor home. My dad liked his drink. We didn’t eat. The three eldest worked, so they got fed. But the three youngest didn’t. Mum would send us to the shop to get food on credit. I’m not complaining. I’ve seen a lot of life. But I never expected in the 21st century that I would be working in a food bank.",Food poverty; Poverty; Food banks; Society; Fuel poverty; Energy bills; Homelessness; Social exclusion; Housing; Volunteering; Voluntary sector,Society
2019-08-11T10:00:46Z,No Logo at 20: have we lost the battle against the total branding of our lives?,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/no-logo-naomi-klein-20-years-on-interview,"Some political books capture the zeitgeist with such precision that they seem to blur the lines between the page and the real world and become part of the urgent, rapidly unfolding changes they are describing. On 30 November 1999, mere days before the publication of Naomi Klein’s debut, No Logo, the epochal “Battle of Seattle” began. Tens of thousands turned out to protest against the World Trade Organisation, and the global corporate interests it represented, and were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Seattle’s mayor declared a state of emergency, and a massive “no protest zone”, as the violence continued, while the chief of police resigned. Reading No Logo back then in my first year at university was hugely formative; the book, mixing eye-opening reportage with sharp-tongued analysis of consumer capitalism, was a bible for understanding the world my generation was growing up in and the motor behind a new kind of grassroots politics. The battle lines were clear, as ordinary citizens around the world stood in opposition to corporate greed, sweatshops, union-busting, “McJobs”, privatisation and environmental destruction: and the avatar for them all, the increasingly unavoidable logos of western “superbrands”. No Logo was published on the cusp not just of a new millennium, but a new phase of globalisation, in which household names such as McDonald’s, Nike, Shell, Starbucks, Disney, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Microsoft could trample over workers’ rights, local laws and civic opposition in pursuit of ever bigger profits, as western outsourcing crashed against the shores of the developing world, leaving behind human misery and environmental ruin as the tide rolled out. The book charted the dramatic rise in the west of youth-oriented, cool-hungry consumer capitalism, in which companies sold an idealised lifestyle, not the physical product on the shelf. With the factories and production lines moved out of sight, and out of mind, the superbrands could focus their North American and European operations on ever more elaborate and intrusive marketing schemes and protecting their brand through censorship and legal action. In one infamous case, Disney sued a small-town creche for painting an unauthorised mural of their characters. Privatisation, Naomi Klein observed in No Logo, “slithers into every crevice of public life”. Caustically funny and polemical in places, Klein’s book won plaudits for her dogged research and reportage, from the candid and stomach-turning declarations of the brand gurus and snake-oil sellers to first-hand reporting from the sweatshops in the developing world’s semi-lawless “export processing zones”. It became a new truism, for those of us schooled in No Logo’s worldview, that corporations were becoming more powerful than governments. Where previous generations had focused on the oppressive strictures of militarism, racism, nuclear power or patriarchy, the superbrands now became synonymous with all that was wrong with the world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, they roamed across the globe unhindered and their marketing-first mentality took over party politics too: New Labour, reflected a piece in ad-land bible Campaign marking the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, was “perhaps the most brand-savvy political project in British history”. No Logo had a global impact far beyond anything Naomi Klein – only 29 at the time and unknown outside her native Canada – had expected. It became a bestseller in the UK (among numerous other countries) and was translated into more than 30 languages, with more than a million copies in print worldwide. The instant success propelled her to fame and Klein’s subsequent books The Shock Doctrine, No Is Not Enough and This Changes Everything were all bestsellers (her newest, On Fire, making the case for a green New Deal, arrives in September). No Logo inspired numerous musicians and artists: Radiohead were so swayed by the book that they toured Europe in a tent to avoid corporate-sponsored venues and considered naming their 2000 album No Logo, before finally alighting on Kid A. The book did so well, in fact, that Klein’s publisher tried to persuade her that they should copyright the title and logo; others, seemingly oblivious to the irony, even proposed a No Logo clothing line. Incredulous, Klein declined. A backlash from the corporate world inevitably followed: most famously, the Economist published a cover feature riffing on Klein’s book jacket design, with the splash “Pro Logo: Why brands are good for you”. But the protests continued, as in Seattle usually organised around gatherings of the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF or the G8. In the press, these were often described as “anti-globalisation”, though the activists preferred “the global justice movement” – they weren’t against internationalism, they argued, they just wanted it done very differently. “No Logo hit at this moment when a global movement was exploding and taking mainstream commentators entirely by surprise,” says Klein on the phone from the west coast of Canada. “It felt a bit like a dam breaking – every month, there was another massive demonstration, across the world, not just in the global north.” She had real trouble finding a US publisher for the book, she recalls. They would tell her how much they loved the manuscript, but that there would be no interest in it: “The perception among media and cultural gatekeepers in the late 90s was that young people were completely apolitical.” What strikes me, rereading the book now, is not that Klein was wrong in her diagnosis, but that the changes she was documenting are so much worse than we could have ever predicted – from PepsiCo exploring the idea of broadcasting its logos into space to KFC buying festival DJ slots for Colonel Sanders. We have reached an audio-visual climax of total brand dominance, as if Piccadilly Circus or Times Square were simply laboratories for how our world would look in the 21st century. So what happened to the focused anti-corporate anger Klein describes in the book? In an age of synergistic “brand personalities” with “strong voices”, integrated social media strategies, trend forecasters and micro-influencers, have we given in to the total branding of every aspect of our lives and culture? The critical moment for the global justice movement, when it was perhaps still to reach its full potential, arrived with the 9/11 attacks in the US less than two years later and the wholesale change in the political conversation that quickly ensued. The west was swept up by George W Bush’s “you’re with us or against us” rhetoric, the “war on terror”, the rise of surveillance and the neoconservative adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. The urgency of the anti-war movement absorbed western energies. As well as shifting activists’ focus away from the sportswear and fast food brands, the Bush-era crackdown drove a wedge between the more radical anti-capitalist activists on the one hand and the bigger NGOs and trade unions. “When governments started equating the global justice movement with terrorists, a lot of them got spooked,” Klein says. “What had been so exciting about these coalitions was they were so diverse: you had scruffy anarchists, big shiny mainstream NGOs and auto workers’ unions all alongside one another, doing really hard and sometimes fractious work to find common ground, but they did it. In South America, India and elsewhere, these movements continued, but the north left them behind.” While our minds were elsewhere, the superbrands ramped up their cannibalisation of every aspect of our cultural lives. Earlier this year, KFC bought a five-minute DJ slot for Colonel Sanders – or a man in a cartoonish Colonel Sanders outfit – at major American dance music festival Ultra. Logos hover everywhere we look, like spots in our peripheral vision. It is strikingly rare, in 2019, to encounter an unbranded, unsponsored cultural experience. Every festival, programme, public-awareness campaign and event has a series of “partners”, a cluster of familiar icons at the bottom of the poster. Every charity is led by its marketing team. Every TV programme is “brought to you by…” – a name other than its production company. This reaches even more flagrant extremes as the companies that were initially paying for product placement in films and TV programmes become original content-creators. Where once we might have seen Jerry Seinfeld ostentatiously drinking Pepsi and wearing Nike trainers in an episode of his sitcom, we now have Pepsi Max TV and Nike TV channels on YouTube, producing their own content: not just adverts, but short documentaries, featurettes, competitions and interviews, with viewcounts often in the millions. Corporate brands swamp our digital lives, resulting in the uncanny spectacle of their social media accounts bantering with one another on Twitter, sassily posting pop culture gifs and responding to breaking news events “in voice”. Many of them have also developed their pre-existing corporate social responsibility programmes into a performance of “wokeness”, to both generate headlines and head off some of our boredom and scepticism. Whether it’s Dove soap challenging body fascism in the beauty industry or Gillette attempting to tackle toxic masculinity in the name of selling razors, our woke pounds are there for the taking. On another level to its rivals in this regard is Nike, most recently harnessing a portentous mixture of feminist (“breaking every single glass ceiling”) and self-help rhetoric via Megan Rapinoe and the US women’s football team. When the company made headlines last autumn with its Dream Crazy advert that featured NFL star Colin Kaepernick, controversial for kneeling during the national anthem in protest at police racism and brutality, the reports underneath told their own story. First, the advert was widely reported as appearing in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Just Do It campaign, a landmark purely because it was three decades since a previous ad campaign. Second, Nike CEO, Mark Parker, responded to the controversy by telling Marketing Week he was proud of the ad: it was a success because it drove “record engagement”. Not sales – brand engagement. “We’re motivated to inspire our consumers to connect and engage,” Parker continued. Not buy trainers. Inevitably, some were unhappy that Kaepernick allowed his bold political protest to be co-opted by Nike. For Klein, that’s unfair. “It’s obviously complex, but I think the athletes deserve a lot of credit for pushing back against their usual gagging,” she says, comparing Kaepernick to Robbie Fowler’s 1997 “support the dockers” T-shirt (a gesture of solidarity with striking Liverpool dockers that earned him a fine) and Megan Rapinoe wearing a Nike football shirt with civil rights activist Audre Lorde’s name on the back. “From Nike’s point of view, these ventures are not ‘brave’, this is what they have always done – this is literally their brand. But it’s also not as simple as a corporate co-option, because in response to being told ‘shut up and play’, what these athletes have shown is that it’s really powerful when they don’t. “Kaepernick is an incredible activist and what he’s done is historic – and he’s also given away a huge amount of money to grassroots groups. That doesn’t let Nike off the hook, but I think just condemning Kaepernick for taking their money is ridiculous.” In the UK, this balancing act is reflected in Stormzy’s simultaneous role as high-profile Adidas brand ambassador and outspoken critic of the Conservative government, the Daily Mail and others. Plied with free Adidas merchandise since he was an underground grime MC, cut him and you suspect he would bleed three stripes. When Paul Pogba signed for Manchester United (who also wear Adidas) in 2016 for a record £100m, the deal was announced by a special Adidas-produced video featuring the two of them, soundtracked by Stormzy, a perfect piece of four-way brand synergy. But did this affiliation stop Stormzy putting in one of the most powerful and controversial political performances in living memory at the 2018 Brit awards, calling the political establishment “criminals” for their betrayal of the victims of the Grenfell fire? Of course not. “When musicians and athletes don’t accept the idea that because they have corporate sponsors, they have to keep quiet, it can take us to some interesting places,” Klein avers. There are two things driving the brands’ ongoing territorial expansion. The first is that consumer capitalism is boring and so constantly requires innovative, ever more ridiculous stunts to hold our increasingly fragmented attention. That’s why “experiential marketing” (PR stunts, in old money) is the ad-land buzzphrase. Senior marketeer Hilary Bradley told Campaign magazine last autumn that millennials in particular needed “memorable experiences” to help them “emotionally connect” to a product. The second is that consumer capitalism is insatiable – it is the same reason businesses are pushing for cities to function around the clock, to fit in more shopping and advertising time, trying to effectively “colonise the night”, an idea the American art critic Jonathan Crary explored in his 2013 book 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep. In April, the news broke that PepsiCo was working with a Russian “space startup” to look into projecting its logos into the night skies via a series of satellites. Like all empires, consumer capitalism always requires new territory to conquer. And we are often unwilling subjects. Consumers, marketing executive David Lubars told Klein in No Logo, in a moment of perfect candour, “are like roaches – you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.” Since 1999, the spray has become considerably more potent and it’s getting everywhere. Not just trainers, razors and soft drinks, but places, spaces, charities, local councils, human beings: all of them need a brand identity, because all of them are pitching themselves in the global marketplace. As the public sphere becomes ever more emaciated by cuts, corporations step in. Brands are literally filling in holes in the road with their logos: in Louisville, Kentucky, KFC filled in a plague of potholes, stamping them with a stencil that read “Re-freshed by KFC”. They paid what is small change in advertising terms – $3,000 – to fix 350 potholes in the city, or buy 350 adverts. “Cities are struggling all over America and you do what you can,” Louisville’s mayor, Jerry Abramson, told NPR. “We’re fortunate to have such an outstanding corporate citizen in this community.” Occupying physical space beyond a billboard has always been appealing; when Adidas signed its “tier one” £40m London 2012 Olympic partnership deal, it cannily struck an agreement to plant inner-city sporting “AdiZones” (outdoor gyms), and thus its logos, in public spaces across the country, for up to 20 years. It was a nod to the idea of trickle-down athleticism made by the Games, leaving what are essentially semi-permanent, 3D billboards in public spaces, in return for a minuscule investment – and some free publicity to boot. This was just the latest iteration of a 1990s scene Klein describes in No Logo – Nike marketeers visiting inner-city basketball courts in mostly black neighbourhoods in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, branding the courts with the company’s logo, and giving out trainers to the most stylish alpha males, in a pre-digital version of “influencer” culture. One vital trend that was just emerging when No Logo was published and is now a near-universal experience – for those entering the job market, at least – is that of self-branding: commodifying and selling yourself, carefully “curating” your “socials” and general online presence, in response to the frenetic demands of the gig economy (the number of self-employed young adults in the UK has almost doubled since 2001). “It was really only celebrities who could actually be their own brand, in 1999,” Klein says. “The idea that a high-school student could have a ‘personal brand’ would have seemed absurd. “The biggest change since No Logo came out is that neoliberalism has created so much precarity that the commodification of the self is now seen as the only route to any kind of economic security. Plus social media has given us the tools to market ourselves non-stop.” This worries Klein because it hinders solidarity: “Brands don’t cooperate very well – they’re built to be selfish and proprietary.” In her position as the Gloria Steinem chair at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Klein has been teaching a course to undergraduates called The Corporate Self, tracing the journey from the birth of branding, and her own No Logo, up to Shoshana Zuboff’s acclaimed book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, published in the UK in January. Zuboff may do for big tech what Klein did for the superbrands 20 years ago. They watch and critique the Colin Kaepernick ads, Klein says, comparing them to the Michael Jordan equivalents from the 1980s and 90s. “It’s been fun to talk to them about surveillance capitalism, because they’ve grown up with it – they’ve grown up in it – and to follow the emerging ways people are confronting the tech giants.” She recently brought in as speakers some of the organisers of 2018’s Google walkout protest, in which thousands of the corporation’s employees walked out of work in protest at the handling of sexual harassment and gender inequality. It is functionally harder to live life away from 2019’s insatiable tech super-corporations, and some of the superbrands Klein covered in 1999 seem almost quaint in their aspirations to be part of our lives. It is certainly much easier not to buy a fizzy drink or eat at McDonald’s than it is to function day to day without helping generate profits for one or all of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft. Proud of yourself for not buying books or gifts from Amazon? Fair enough, but it is also the largest cloud service provider, with a 32% market share; your favourite activist website is probably using Amazon Web Services. “We’re more globally connected than ever before,” Klein says, “and also less connected to who makes our clothes, who grows our food, and I think part of that is down to information overload. And in terms of what social media is doing to our ability to stay focused, to not see the world in terms of these matrices of our own marketability and consumability, whether it’s views or likes or retweets…” She sighs. “Well, I think this may be the death of us. It’s not that people don’t care, it’s that they care for five seconds. That acceleration of emotion, and attention – it’s a pretty big shift in 20 years. “I think the next big battles will be over the information commons: the entire business model of these tech giants is an extractive model, based on people’s unpaid labour. It’s been the most incredible bait-and-switch, to simultaneously say, ‘Don’t be evil’ and persuade us to live our lives in public and online and share everything.” There is, however, one small part of our relationship with brands that the internet and social media have perhaps democratised – the ability to control the memes of production. “In No Logo, in the ‘adbusting’ chapter, I was writing about a few daring guys with ladders, defacing billboards,” she laughs, “and now you have millions of people able to do parody ads and share them with everyone, instantaneously.” While the images of black-clad protesters on the streets of Seattle in 1999 may have marked a rupture of sorts, the rapid decline of the global justice movement it heralded is not something to be entirely mourned by activists, Klein says, because another kind of progress has been made. “It’s easy to lose sight of just how hegemonic neoliberalism really was, in the late 1990s. There is an ascendant democratic socialist left in the west now and it’s liberalism that is in crisis.” The global justice movement was, she says, a movement of “nos” and not a lot of “yeses”. “It’s taken a while to get the political and intellectual confidence to not only say ‘no’ to the ravages of neoliberal austerity, but to propose bold and imaginative structural transformation. “The real sea change between then and now is that that critique of corporate power is utterly mainstream. If you look at the US presidential candidates, not just Elizabeth Warren’s or Bernie Sanders’s campaigns but even some of the more mainstream candidates – everybody has to talk about breaking up big tech and standing up to the fossil fuel companies.” Maybe it’s partly that our relationships with the companies behind the logos have changed dramatically since 1999 too. Another example of a new trend recorded in No Logo that’s become commonplace is the gig economy, or precarious work. People have no reciprocal relationship, no give and take, with their big-name corporate employers. In the Fordist era of production-line factory jobs after the war, many workers may have had miserably mundane nine-to-fives but at least those came with stability, pensions and as jobs for life. The gig economy is shattering any lingering sense of trust in or fidelity to corporations. “Wide-scale public rage at oligarchic power is very mainstream now,” Klein says. And that surely can’t be good for the brand. Perhaps it is a function of age, but recalling the world No Logo described when I was 18 – a world before 9/11 and the “war on terror”, before the global financial crisis and before the gig economy and big tech set the terms of your employment and social life respectively – does feel like harking back to a more innocent time. It would be easy for me to get an Uber to a WeWork office, order some Deliveroo and finish this article on Google Docs, while I stream Spotify, taking a break to browse Facebook and Instagram on my Android phone, finesse my personal brand on Twitter and wonder where the No Logo revolution all went wrong. But it was never as simple as merely boycotting brands you vaguely disapproved of; the thrust of the book, and the global justice movement in general, was not about making more tasteful shopping decisions, but understanding how corporations shape our lives and culture and using that knowledge to try to, at least, stop them from running riot. The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1990s and this time, thanks to books such as No Logo, we can’t say that we didn’t know.",Naomi Klein; Politics books; Books; Social media; World news; Marketing & PR; Media; Advertising; Politics; Globalisation; Google; Facebook; Social networking; Technology; Digital media; Gig economy; Canada,Books
2018-01-04T11:27:42Z,Waitrose bans sale of energy drinks to under-16s,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/04/waitrose-bans-sale-energy-drinks-to-under-16s-children,"Waitrose has become the first UK supermarket to ban sales of so-called energy drinks to under-16s, amid concerns about high levels of sugar and caffeine and their impact on children’s health and behaviour. From 5 March, customers buying drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre will be asked to prove they are over 16. Drinks such as Red Bull, Relentless, Monster Energy and Rockstar have become increasingly popular. Children and teenagers consume them more than adults, even though under industry labelling guidelines any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a high caffeine content warning and state it is not recommended for children. The compulsory health warnings read: “High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding women or persons sensitive to caffeine.” The move makes Waitrose the only UK supermarket to introduce a sales policy aligned with the guidance on energy drink packaging. In early 2015, Morrisons ended its trial ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-16s, which it had rolled out to just six stores. Last month the teachers’ union NASUWT called for the sale of the drinks to under-16s to be banned. Its national official for education, Darren Northcott, described the beverages as “legal highs” that helped to fuel bad behaviour in schools. Also seeking a ban are medical experts, including the charity Action on Sugar, as well as the TV chef and food campaigner Jamie Oliver. Simon Moore, Waitrose’s director of technical and corporate social responsibility, said: “As a responsible retailer, we want to sell these products in line with the labelling guidance. “These drinks carry advice stating that they are not recommended for children, so we’re choosing to proactively act on that guidance, particularly given the widespread concerns which have been raised about these drinks when consumed by under-16s.” The Food Standards Agency warns that energy drinks can contain high levels of caffeine, usually about 80mg in a small 250ml can – similar to the amount in three cans of cola or a mug of instant coffee. As well as caffeine, they sometimes contain ingredients such as glucuronolactone and taurine, as well as vitamins, minerals and herbal substances. Some of the smaller “energy shot” products can contain 80-160mg of caffeine in a 60ml bottle. Katharine Jenner, campaign director at Action on Sugar, at Queen Mary University of London, said: “We are delighted to see that Waitrose is leading by example with its ban and hope that other retailers will follow suit immediately. “Energy drinks are completely inappropriate for children to consume, form no part of a healthy balanced diet, and should be banned for under-16s across the board.” She pointed out that its study published last month in BMJ Open revealed that the sugar, calorie and caffeine content in energy drinks was far too high. “Just one can of Rockstar Punched (500ml) contains 78g sugar – that’s nearly 20 teaspoons. The consumption of energy drinks is a huge contribution to sugar intake, which is linked to the development of obesity and various types of cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes, and is rotting our children’s teeth.”",Sugar; Society; Sugar; Waitrose; Business; Obesity; Children; Health; Food; Life and style; Young people; Schools; Education; John Lewis; Retail industry; Supermarkets,Society
2018-06-08T22:00:05Z,Australia's banks dodged the financial crisis. Then they got complacent,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/09/australias-banks-dodged-the-financial-crisis-then-they-got-complacent,"When Australia emerged from the global financial crisis unscathed, David Bell had more reason to smile than most. Bell, as the chief executive of the Australian Bankers’ Association for nine years, helped lead the sector through its most turbulent period in recent history. Australia’s banks were heaped with praise when they landed feet-first from the financial chaos, lauded for avoiding the hugely risky sub-prime investments that proved so irresistible across the rest of the developed world. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Now, almost a decade on, Bell believes that success may have laid the seeds for Australia’s current banking crisis, a confluence of scandals that have forced high-profile resignations, sent share prices tumbling, and prompted criminal charges and a $700m penalty. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Bell said a sense of complacency developed in post-financial crisis Australia across the banks, government, and regulators. “It’s one of those classic judgments of hindsight … it’s that boiled frog syndrome where you don’t realise it’s happening to you until it’s too late,” he said. “Looking back, I think that’s possibly an explanation. We did well – the paradox is that the sense of complacency developed, not just for the banks, but with the regulators, the policymakers, the industry association.” It’s a view shared by others who have sought to trace the sector’s path to the current carnage. The former treasurer Peter Costello has spoken of how the financial crisis made bankers feel like infallible geniuses. It was this belief that led them to lose their way and venture into peripheral profit-making areas, outside of banking’s core business. “In the aftermath of [the crisis] some of these bankers started to believe it was due to their genius, they should take the rewards and they took the eye off the ball, which was the customer,” Costello told the Australian in May. Costello believes the reputational damage being done in the current royal commission is greater than anything the sector faced in the global financial crisis. It’s hard to disagree. Scandals are now being exposed on a weekly basis, either via the press or through the forensic questioning of the royal commission’s counsels assisting, Rowena Orr and Michael Hodge. The damage is immense. Take AMP, for example. It is now facing four class actions as a result of its fee-for-no-service scandal and the subsequent misleading of the corporate regulator. The wealth manager’s chief executive, Craig Meller, and chair, Catherine Brenner, have both been forced from their roles. About 30% has been wiped from the company’s share price in the past three months. The money laundering scandal at Commonwealth Bank has cost the country’s biggest bank a $700m fine and also its chief executive, Ian Narev, who announced plans to stand down days after Austrac revealed the litany of violations in August 2017. This week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission charged executives at ANZ, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank for cartel-like behaviour over a capital raising in 2015. The revelations show no sign of abating. The ABC last week reported on the way that Macquarie Bank was classing everyday Australians as “sophisticated investors”, allowing their money to be used in high-risk investments, and charging huge fees in the process. On Monday, Guardian Australia revealed how BT Financial Group, Westpac’s wealth management arm, discovered it was missing hundreds of files for customers it was supposedly providing with financial advice. In what one insider described as a “cover-your-arse” exercise, BT then scrambled to either recover or recreate customer files to comply with financial advice laws. Fairfax revealed CBA’s Dollarmites scandal, and reported that one of Australia’s biggest mortgage brokers, Mortgage Choice, was facing a revolt from franchisees over its conduct. Scandal is becoming a near-permanent feature of the sector. Jeff Morris, the CBA whistleblower, wrote in Fairfax on Wednesday that Australia was reaching “peak banking bad”. So is the sector in free-fall? When and how will the constant stream of crises end? The University of Sydney’s human rights law chair, Prof David Kinley, believes the banks need to return to their role as the “economy’s servant not its master”. Kinley launched a new book this week titled “Necessary Evil: How to Fix Finance by Saving Human Rights”. In it, he argues that banks have developed an unnerving culture of exceptionalism, which fosters a kind of nonchalance about the impacts of their behaviour. “The world of finance has become so confident of its role as the élan vital of the economy that it seldom need concern itself with the exogenous consequences of its actions, up to and including the possibility of its own collapse,” he wrote. To fix this, he recommends, banks must put the notion of corporate social responsibility at the centre of their practices. The managing director of Market Economics, Stephen Koukoulas, believes punishments need to be placed more squarely on bank leadership. Koukoulas said simply fining banking institutions, while necessary, did little to deter misconduct. “We’ve seen massive fines in the UK and the US, tens of billions of dollars in fines. Look at them now, they’re doing fine. It’s 12 months profit, it’s six months profit. It’s neither here nor there,” he said. “But the individual who put the bank or the economy in that position is still there.” He predicts there will be a period of self-imposed change in the sector, particularly around the payment of bonuses and commissions. Some signs of change are already emerging. There’ll also be a period of further regulatory change, Koukoulas said, when the royal commission delivers its report. He said customers may drift away from the big four, but that trend will be tempered by their market dominance and the cost and effort required to change. “There’s not a lot of alternatives we can turn to,” he says. Bell is cautious about over-regulating the sector. He says too much intervention will end up hurting consumers and small business, who will struggle to get finance when they most need it. He, like Costello, believes the best way to repair the damage is for banks to return to their traditional business: borrowing, lending, and managing the risk in between. “I think there is almost a need to go back to the basics,” he said. “Banks should actually focus on their customers, and doing the right thing by their customers. They should stick to banking and avoid some of the peripheral things they might be involved in.” It’s a process that has begun already. Many banks have exited the wealth management space and promised wholesale overhauls of their bonus schemes and performance targets. Whether they have learnt the lessons that went unheeded after the GFC remains to be seen.",Banking ; Australia news; Australian economy; Banking; Business; Business,Australia news
2018-03-29T06:30:07Z,I work therefore I am: why businesses are hiring philosophers,https://www.theguardian.com/business-to-business/2018/mar/29/i-work-therefore-i-am-why-businesses-are-hiring-philosophers,"Who should a business leader turn to in times of crisis? You might presume a lawyer or a coach – but how about a philosopher? Busy executives in Silicon Valley and beyond are enlisting the services of “practical philosophers” to help them work through difficult decisions. “This is a generation of pioneering philosophers, if you like, entrepreneurial philosophers,” says Prof Lou Marinoff, who has been advocating philosophy with businesses since 2000, and has worked with organisations such as the World Economic Forum in Geneva and Davos and the Comisión Federal de Electricidad in Mexico. He doesn’t offer solutions; he asks questions that help the client gain fresh perspectives and insight. There’s a focus on critical thinking and examining values to explore what’s right and fair. “These are very intelligent people, who are also overworked, more so than most of us. And they don’t have enough time to reflect. A lot of what we do is to create reflective space,” says Marinoff, professor of philosophy at the City College of New York and author of Plato, Not Prozac! Applying Eternal Wisdom to Everyday Problems. Marinoff is also president of the American Philosophical Practitioners Association, which has trained 400 philosophers to practise this kind of service. In the UK, Joe Garner, chief executive of building society Nationwide, formerly of BT Openreach and HSBC, has worked over a number of years with Prof Roger Steare, philosopher in residence at Cass Business School and author of the book Ethicability. When Garner spoke to the New City Agenda group in Westminster last October about decision-making, he insisted that values – the mutual’s social conscience – must be part of the process. “It’s about logic, it’s about the law, but it’s also about love.” Steare has also consulted for large multinationals, including BP following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. One can quite see why big corporates – whose failings have wreaked devastation – might want to interrogate their principles. But what use, in truth, is a philosopher – whose focus is on ethics – to a businessperson or entrepreneur, whose overriding purpose is to make a profit? “There’s an assumption there that profits and philosophy are incompatible,” says Steare. “The tension is not between philosophy and profit, but between deep wisdom and short-term profit maximisation, instead of long-term sustainable value creation.” In sectors such as technology, where businesses can grow at breakneck speed, it’s perhaps a way of holding leaders to account: are their founding principles holding fast, or being subsumed by a race towards profit at any cost? A philosopher can “direct a business toward innovation that combines a good purpose and a real business opportunity”, says Christian Vögtlin, associate professor in corporate social responsibility at Audencia Business School in France. “Philosophical thinking can also guide technology [entrepreneurs] to define boundaries; this can range from questions about privacy rights to teaching virtual intelligence systems about humanistic values,” he adds. Marinoff works with senior leadership teams and managers, as well as CEOs. This might take the form of creating a mission statement, implementing a code of ethics in an organisation or working on corporate responsibility. But why would a company choose a philosopher over another type of business coach? A philosopher can nudge and question, take leaders on uncomfortable journeys, even be a disruptive force – and they should, suggests US-based Andrew Taggart, who consults for organisations in Silicon Valley on how to use philosophy in a practical context. “Doing philosophy as a way of life is inherently challenging and can, at times, be deeply puzzling,” he says. “I see it as my responsibility to push you to think harder and much more clearly about yourself and the world.” In the midst of business pressures, are you someone who will pursue the truth, even if it means discovering painful things about yourself? A tough question, especially when shareholders and HMRC are banging on the door for your quarterly accounts. Short-term financial accounting requirements, are, says Steare, one of the underlying problems facing leaders who wish to be ethical, because what benefits people and the planet in the long term is not usually going to be what’s required to turn a profit in the short term. Bringing a philosopher on board is not for the faint-hearted: the practical application of philosophical thinking, Taggart explains, demands that business leaders interrogate the role played by their product or service in the global scheme of things, “not only to see whether something makes sense in the marketplace, but also to see whether its existence is actually justified”. Practical philosophers tend to be employed as consultants at the moment, and it’s still quite niche, but Marinoff says he would love to see corporates employ their own in-house “chief philosophy officer”, or “philosopher in residence”. “We’re not that expensive compared to other professionals,” he laughs. “There are composers in residence, poets in residence and artists in residence – why not a philosopher in residence?”",Business to business; Business; Philosophy books; Management; Work & careers; Technology sector; Guardian Small Business Network,Business to business
2018-06-25T05:00:52Z,Child labour rampant in tobacco industry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/revealed-child-labor-rampant-in-tobacco-industry,"Child labour in tobacco is rampant and on the increase in poorer countries, a major Guardian investigation can reveal, despite claims by multibillion-dollar companies that they are tackling the issue. Evidence from three continents shows how children aged 14 and under are kept out of school and employed in hard and sometimes harmful physical labour to produce the tobacco leaf that fills cigarettes sold internationally, including in the UK, US and mainland Europe. Families are trapped in generational poverty while salaries at the top of the industry run to millions of dollars a year. The companies say they monitor child labour and remove children from the fields to go to school, but experts have told the Guardian that the numbers are going up, not down, as tobacco growing increases in Africa and Asia. The consequences for children are lifelong. “I wanted to be a nurse,” said one 14-year-old girl in Malawi, who spends her days weeding under a hot sun with a heavy hoe. Families see no option but to use their children in the fields as unpaid labour. Many are in debt to landowners and landlords and have to stay on from one season to the next, unable to break the cycle of deprivation. “No effective actions have been taken to reverse this scenario,” said Vera Da Costa e Silva, head of the secretariat of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a key body tackling an industry that kills more than 7 million people a year. “What happens is that tobacco farming gives its profits to the industry but gives very low incomes to the tobacco growers themselves.” The tobacco firms say they are doing everything they can to end exploitative child labour. But it is a scandal for which the multinational companies have a direct responsibility, she said. “There is a double burden – the burden of child labour itself and the burden of working on a deadly product that ultimately affects the children themselves.” Silva said about 1.3 million children a year were working in tobacco fields in 2011 and, according to the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO), the numbers are rising with a shift in tobacco growing from some of the better-off countries to some of the poorer. It declined between 2000 and 2013 in Turkey, Brazil and the United States, said the report to the organisation’s governing body in February 2017, but increased in others, such as Argentina, India and Zimbabwe. Given that child labour in agriculture occurs more often in low-income countries, the ILO report said, “this shift in production may have resulted in increased child labour and other decent work deficits in tobacco production. Although there are no estimates of the number of child labourers in tobacco globally, surveys indicate that in impoverished tobacco growing communities, child labour is rampant.” The Guardian’s investigation found: In Malawi: Children being taken out of school to weed the tobacco fields and harvest the leaves by parents who live in dire poverty. Some families in straw huts are paid nothing for 10 months until the tobacco crop is sold after the harvest. They live on a pail of maize a week provided by their landlords and must raise money to mill it by extra piecework in the fields, often also done by the children. In Mexico: The Guardian saw children working in seven of 10 plantations visited in March in the Nayarit region, despite progress being made by industry and government to tackle the problem and keep children in school. In Indonesia: The Guardian visited tobacco farming communities in Lombok and talked to child workers, including a 14-year-old who told of chest health problems her family linked to working in the fields. The US Department of Labor lists 16 countries where children are suspected to work in tobacco. Human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch have documented child labor in the tobacco fields in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Brazil and most recently Zimbabwe. Experts say the very low prices paid to farmers in countries like Malawi make child labour inevitable. BAT and JTI tobacco firms say light work in the fields that does not affect health or education is acceptable for 13-15 year olds. Campaigners say they should not be anywhere near tobacco before they are 18. The average income of a tenant farmer in Kasunga, one of the biggest tobacco-growing areas of Malawi, for 10 months of work was 223,710 kwacha (roughly $380 or £286 at current rates) according to a study in 2017 by the Centre for Social Concern, a Malawian NGO. Each kilo of tobacco is estimated to provide enough for 1,200 cigarettes; tenant farmers in Kasungu last year earned 200 kawacha (30 cents or 23p) per kilo when the crop was sold. Tenant farmers are at the bottom of the tobacco food chain. They agree to work for a year for a contract farmer who has land, which he may own or have leased. That farmer’s contract is with one of the big leaf-buying companies – Alliance One, Universal (in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf) or Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The leaf-buying companies agree to purchase tobacco from their contract farmers and supply seed, fertiliser, pesticide and tools. The leaf buyers say they tell them not to employ children. Alliance One said the elimination of child labour is a “top priority”; Universal said it is committed to fighting child labour. The leaf-buyers are fulfilling orders from cigarette manufacturers – British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco. The tobacco giants have their own corporate social responsibility schemes. They say they monitor child labour and build wells or schools. But Professor Marty Otañez, of the University of Colorado in Denver, an anthropologist who has studied tobacco farming in Malawi for many years, said the welfare projects were “pushing out goodwill on behalf of tobacco companies to address some of the problems but avoid the harder issues of leaf prices and living and earnings”. All of the four major companies say they are doing what they can. “BAT takes the issue of child labour extremely seriously and agrees that children must never be exploited, exposed to danger or denied an education,” said a spokesperson. “We do not employ children in any of our operations worldwide and make it clear to all of our contracted farmers and suppliers that exploitative child labour will not be tolerated.” Imperial Tobacco said: “Child labour is unacceptable and we make every effort to stop it happening in our supply chain.” PMI called child labour an unacceptable reality. “We are committed to eliminating child labor and other labor abuses wherever we source tobacco,” said Miguel Coleta, the company’s sustainability officer. “We have been working to tackle the root causes of child labor head-on and have achieved a global reduction of child labor incidents on contracted farms over time. We welcome continued systematic scrutiny of our efforts and recognize we cannot succeed alone. This requires serious and lasting efforts by all stakeholders, including government and civil society.” JTI also said child labour was endemic to agriculture but had been decreasing in areas where it directly contracted farmers. “The reality is that child labor stems from a combination of social, economic and regulatory causes. At JTI, we don’t pretend to be able to solve the problem of child labor on our own, but we are doing our utmost to play our part in solving the problem, working with others,” the company said.",Tobacco industry; Child labour; US news; UK news; Europe; World news; Business,World news
2018-02-02T07:00:47Z,Why giving back is the best way forward for businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/feb/02/why-giving-back-is-the-best-way-forward-for-businesses,"Companies are increasingly incorporating corporate social responsibility (CSR) into their business plans, using initiatives such as teaching kids in developing countries to code. In 2011-13 Fortune 500 companies spent $19.9bn (about £13bn) a year on initiatives that had a positive impact on society or the environment. And while some worry CSR could threaten financial performance, a growing body of evidence suggests it actually provides numerous benefits. For one, it can help you attract and retain talent. Research by marketing agency Cone Communications found that nearly two-thirds of young people won’t take a job at a company with poor CSR practices. The survey of 1,000 people found 75% of millennials would take a pay cut to work for a responsible company, and 83% would be more loyal to a business that enables them to contribute to solving social and environmental problems. “To attract and retain talent, you need to show you are doing all you can to give back to the communities you operate in,” says Richard Donovan, head of corporate responsibility for the UK and Ireland at Experian. The credit agency’s UK employees volunteered nearly 12,500 hours in 2016-17 to support community and financial education programmes, and its social innovation programme has helped more than 9 million people globally since 2014 – by supporting people to pay off unmanageable debts in Brazil, for example. But CSR is not just recruitment PR; it also has a tangible impact on a company’s bottom line. Companies that integrate climate-change management into strategic planning, for example, see an 18% higher return on equity than those that don’t, according to a study by CDP, a non-profit that helps companies with environmental disclosure. “While there are many reasons why a company might achieve good results, it’s clear that companies leading the way on sustainability can and do perform well financially,” says Paul Simpson, chief executive of CDP. Enterprise software company SAP’s 1,800 UK employees can take part in Africa Code Weeks in 35 countries, helping young people develop technical skills and promote economic development. “I do not believe CSR undermines our financial results,” says Tom Loeffert, HR director for the UK. “By providing the opportunity for employees to do meaningful work, we have seen higher levels of engagement and productivity. CSR can also help us win new deals and, ultimately, grow our business.” For the greater good: six CSR drives Google’s Project Loon Forming a network of floating satellites near space, Loon will provide internet access to some of the 4.1 billion people across the globe who do not have it. Toms shoes For every pair of shoes sold by the company, a pair is donated to someone who needs them. Toms has shipped 75m pairs, which has contributed to protecting more than 2 million children from hookworm, an intestinal parasite typically acquired by walking barefoot on contaminated soil. Asda’s wonky veg box To tackle food waste, the UK supermarket group last year began selling imperfect vegetables via a “wonky veg box” priced at £3.50, 30% cheaper than standard lines. Farmers may benefit by getting money for produce such as misshapen carrots, which are often chucked away. Nu Skin’s Nourish the Children Employees and customers can purchase and donate a nutrient-rich food to people suffering from malnutrition and famine. Since 2002, the company has donated more than 550m meals to malnourished children across the globe. Ikea’s brighter lives for refugees campaign Last year, Ikea funded a solar farm to bring renewable energy to the 20,000 Syrian refugees living in the Azraq camp in Jordan. Each family can now power a fridge, TV, fan and lights, as well as charge their mobile phones – essential for contacting family overseas. The solar farm will save $1.5m (£1.1m) and reduce CO2 emissions by more than 2,000 tonnes per year. Heineken’s responsible consumption Heineken wants to brew a better world. The beer maker invests 10% of its media budget in some countries on advertising to encourage responsible alcohol consumption. It also committed to invest €200m over five years on a campaign to combat drink-driving.",Top Employers UK; Guardian Careers; Professional supplements,Guardian Careers
2019-06-17T05:00:11Z,Where does your plastic go? Global investigation reveals America's dirty secret,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/recycled-plastic-america-global-crisis,"What happens to your plastic after you drop it in a recycling bin? According to promotional materials from America’s plastics industry, it is whisked off to a factory where it is seamlessly transformed into something new. This is not the experience of Nguyễn Thị Hồng Thắm, a 60-year-old Vietnamese mother of seven, living amid piles of grimy American plastic on the outskirts of Hanoi. Outside her home, the sun beats down on a Cheetos bag; aisle markers from a Walmart store; and a plastic bag from ShopRite, a chain of supermarkets in New Jersey, bearing a message urging people to recycle it. Tham is paid the equivalent of $6.50 a day to strip off the non-recyclable elements and sort what remains: translucent plastic in one pile, opaque in another. A Guardian investigation has found that hundreds of thousands of tons of US plastic are being shipped every year to poorly regulated developing countries around the globe for the dirty, labor-intensive process of recycling. The consequences for public health and the environment are grim. A team of Guardian reporters in 11 countries has found: Last year, the equivalent of 68,000 shipping containers of American plastic recycling were exported from the US to developing countries that mismanage more than 70% of their own plastic waste. The newest hotspots for handling US plastic recycling are some of the world’s poorest countries, including Bangladesh, Laos, Ethiopia and Senegal, offering cheap labor and limited environmental regulation. In some places, like Turkey, a surge in foreign waste shipments is disrupting efforts to handle locally generated plastics. With these nations overwhelmed, thousands of tons of waste plastic are stranded at home in the US, as we reveal in our story later this week. These failures in the recycling system are adding to a growing sense of crisis around plastic, a wonder material that has enabled everything from toothbrushes to space helmets but is now found in enormous quantities in the oceans and has even been detected in the human digestive system. Reflecting grave concerns around plastic waste, last month, 187 countries signed a treaty giving nations the power to block the import of contaminated or hard-to-recycle plastic trash. A few countries did not sign. One was the US. A new Guardian series, United States of Plastic, will scrutinize the plastic crisis engulfing America and the world, publishing several more stories this week and continuing for the rest of 2019. “People don’t know what’s happening to their trash,” said Andrew Spicer, who teaches corporate social responsibility at the University of South Carolina and sits on his state’s recycling advisory board. “They think they’re saving the world. But the international recycling business sees it as a way of making money. There have been no global regulations – just a long, dirty market that allows some companies to take advantage of a world without rules.” Where America’s recycling lands Plastic only came into mass consumer use in the 1950s, but in the Pacific Garbage Patch it is already thought to be more common than plankton. Officials around the globe have banned particularly egregious plastic pollutants, such as straws and flimsy bags, yet America alone generates 34.5m tons of plastic waste each year, enough to fill Houston’s Astrodome stadium 1,000 times. Of the 9% of America’s plastic that the Environmental Protection Agency estimated was recycled in 2015, China and Hong Kong handled more than half: about 1.6m tons of our plastic recycling every year. They developed a vast industry of harvesting and reusing the most valuable plastics to make products that could be sold back to the western world. But much of what America sent was contaminated with food or dirt, or it was non-recyclable and simply had to be landfilled in China. Amid growing environmental and health fears, China shut its doors to all but the cleanest plastics in late 2017. Since the China ban, America’s plastic waste has become a global hot potato, ping-ponging from country to country. The Guardian’s analysis of shipping records and US Census Bureau export data has found that America is still shipping more than 1m tons a year of its plastic waste overseas, much of it to places that are already virtually drowning in it. A red flag to researchers is that many of these countries ranked very poorly on metrics of how well they handle their own plastic waste. A study led by the University of Georgia researcher Jenna Jambeck found that Malaysia, the biggest recipient of US plastic recycling since the China ban, mismanaged 55% of its own plastic waste, meaning it was dumped or inadequately disposed of at sites such as open landfills. Indonesia and Vietnam improperly managed 81% and 86%, respectively. “We are trying so desperately to get rid of this stuff that we are looking for new frontiers,” said Jan Dell, an independent engineer, whose organization The Last Beach Cleanup works with investors and environmental groups to reduce plastic pollution. “The path of least resistance is to put it on a ship and send it somewhere else – and the ships are going further and further to find some place to put it,” she said. Take Vietnam. Minh Khai, a village on a river delta near Hanoi, is the center of a waste management cottage industry. Rubbish from across the world, inscribed in languages from Arabic to French, lines almost every street in this community of about 1,000 households. Workers in makeshift workshops churn out recycled pellets amid toxic fumes and foul stench from the truckloads of scrap that are transported there every day. Even Minh Khai’s welcome arch, adorned with bright red flags, is flanked by plastic waste on both sides. In 2018, the US sent 83,000 tons of plastic recycling to Vietnam. On the ground, America’s footprint is clear: a bag of York Peppermint Patties from Hershey, with US labeling, and an empty bag from a chemical coatings manufacturer in Ohio. “We’re really scared of the plastic fumes, and we don’t dare to drink the water from underground here,” said Nguyễn Thị Hồng Thắm, the plastic sorter, wearing thick gloves, a face mask and a traditional Vietnamese conical hat to protect herself from the sun. “We don’t have money so we don’t have any choice but to work here.” While the exact health effects of workers’ exposure to plastic recycling operations have not been well studied, the toxic fumes resulting from the burning of plastics or plastic processing can cause respiratory illness. Regular exposure can subject workers and nearby residents to hundreds of toxic substances, including hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, dioxins and heavy metals, the effects of which can include developmental disorders, endocrine disruption, and cancer. Once the plastic is sorted by workers like Tham, others feed the scrap into grinders before putting it through densifiers that melt and condense the scrap so it can be molded into pellets. The Vietnamese prime minister, Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, ordered a tightening on scrap standards in July 2018, and legal monthly imports were cut to one-tenth of what they had been. As of April, more than 23,400 shipping containers of scrap remain held up in customs. But business continues to boom in Minh Khai. Tham said that scrap is still arriving from Haiphong, northern Vietnam’s largest port, and other parts of the country every day, and records show a significant rebound in imports. As countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand banned imports, records show the plastic waste fanning out to a host of new countries. Shipments began making their way to Cambodia, Laos, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and Senegal, which had previously handled virtually no US plastic. The Guardian found that each month throughout the second half of 2018, container ships ferried about 260 tons of US plastic scrap into one of the most dystopian, plastic-covered places of all: the Cambodian seaside town of Sihanoukville, where, in some areas, almost every inch of the ocean is covered with floating plastic and the beach is nothing but a glinting carpet of polymers. “I cannot accept plastic being imported into our country,” said a resident, Heng Ngy, 58. Ngy and his wife live in a wooden house on stilts that seems to hover on a sea of plastic. A pungent stench wafts up to the open-aired rooms. Cambodia’s waste problem is believed to stem from its own use of plastic and a lack of any system for dealing with it. No one interviewed in Sihanoukville had any idea that plastic recycling was being exported from the United States, and what happened to the plastic after it arrived is unclear. Experts estimate that 20% to 70% of plastic entering recycling facilities around the globe is discarded because it is unusable – so any plastic being recycled at Sihanoukville would inevitably result in more waste there. Alex Gonzalez-Davidson, the co-founder of the Cambodian environmental organization Mother Nature, said his organization had not been aware of the issue. But “if it works, they will bring more and more”, he said. For now, shipments of plastic appear to have tailed off. How plastic waste fuels a global business How does your plastic get from your curbside to a village in south-east Asia? Through a trading network that crosses oceans and traverses continents. It’s a network that is complex, at times nefarious, and in which few consumers understand their role. Now, that network is at a breaking point. Plastic’s first stop on its months-long journey is a recycling facility where it is sorted into bales based on its type – soda bottles, milk jugs and clamshell-style containers, for instance, are all made of subtly different kinds – and readied for sale. Waste plastic is a commodity, and recycling brokers search across the US and abroad for buyers who will want to melt the plastic down, turn it into pellets, and make those pellets into something new. In the past, it made economic sense to ship the plastic to Asia, because shipping companies that transport China’s manufactured goods to the US end up with thousands of empty shipping containers to carry back. In the absence of American goods to fill them, the companies have been willing to ship out America’s recycling at rock-bottom rates. Steve Wong, a Hong Kong-based businessman, is one of the middlemen who connects your recycling with international buyers. “At one time, I was one of the biggest exporters in the world,” he said, worth millions. Now, Wong said, his company, the Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling, was deep in debt. Wong’s problem is hardly a lack of supply. Each month the equivalent of thousands of shipping containers worth of recyclable plastics, which used to be exported, are piling up all over the United States. Nor is his worry a shortage of demand for plastic. It is desperately needed by factories in China for manufacturing into myriad new products – from toys and picture frames to garden gazebos. What is nearly killing his business is the fact that many countries have soured on the recycling industry, after unscrupulous operators set up shop, operating as cheaply as possible, with no regard for the environment or local residents. “In our industry, if you do it properly, you save the environment,” Wong said. “If you do it improperly, you destroy the environment.” As far as profits go, the numbers just barely favor recycling. Wong said he might spend $150 to buy a ton of plastic scrap from a US recycler. Once it is shipped abroad, sold to a processor, turned into pellets and then again shipped to a manufacturer, the seller might ask as much as $800 per ton. Yet the cost of similar virgin plastic, which is often higher quality, is just $900 to $1,000 a ton. Wong believes the answer in the future will be to process the material closer to the United States. That is why he has planned trips to meet with government officials in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and why, on a recent Wednesday, Wong crisscrossed back and forth through heavy traffic in the Mexican city of Monterrey, located about 150 miles south of Laredo, Texas. Wong, a trim 61-year-old dressed head-to-toe in khaki like a safari hunter, was working to set up a new plastics recycling factory for an investor who hopes to one day process US plastic. At one reseller – a corrugated-metal warehouse piled floor-to-ceiling with plastic that included shimmery sheaths of wrapping from US retail stores – Wong wanted to test the quality of the supply. He filled a baggie with ground-up flakes of black plastic from picking crates, then took a cigarette lighter and lit one of the flakes on fire. He carefully sniffed the smoke to get a sense of what variety of plastic it was. At Wong’s next stop, an existing Monterrey recycling processor, you could get a sense of the work the new factory might do. A rudimentary plastic processing machine stretched 40ft across the bare dirt of the warehouse floor. The processor takes rejected car parts and grinds them up into confetti-sized flakes. Workers feed these flakes into a flume that channels them past a heater to melt them. The melted plastic is pressed into long, white strings, which are stretched across the room and allowed to harden. At that point, they are chopped into pellets a little bigger than rice grains. Wong said he would like to build more modern factories with up-to-date systems for eliminating toxic releases to the air and water. But he said he was sure that many of his less scrupulous competitors would keep exporting on the cheap. He suggested that even in countries that had banned plastic imports, the material continued to be smuggled in. “Recyclers have set up factories in all these countries, but they don’t have enough supply. So, even though it is smuggling, even though it is not legal, they still have to do what it takes to get the plastic.” With US plastic landing in countries that have never seen it in such quantities, local residents are crying foul. In the Philippines, about 120 shipping containers a month are arriving in Manila and an industrial zone in the former US military base at Subic Bay. Records indicate they were filled with plastic scrap shipped from such places as Los Angeles, Georgia and the Port of New York-Newark. From the Manila port, shipping records and Philippines customs documents show, some of the US plastic was transported to Valenzuela City. The area, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital, is known as “Plastic City” and residents are increasingly concerned about the number of processing factories sprouting in their midst. “You smell that?” said a shopkeeper, Helen Lota, 47, as she stood in front of her neighborhood convenience store at noon one day last month. “That’s nothing. It’s worse towards evening. It gets suffocating,” “There are times it’s really hard to breathe. Many of us here are getting sick,” said Lota. “I had my daughter’s cough checked in the hospital. But the X-ray is clear. The coughing must be caused by the smell.” Noticing Lota complaining about the plastic problem, passersby stopped to chime in. “My mother’s cough won’t go away, probably because of the smell,” said Renante Bito, 38. Yet recycling is also one of the area’s biggest income sources. Officials and residents interviewed by the Guardian said they had assumed the plastic being processed in their town was the Philippines’ own waste. None realized that some of it was being shipped from the US. Representatives for the factories receiving US waste declined to be interviewed. In Turkey, US plastic imports may be putting an entire profession at risk. Since China closed its doors, the amount of plastic recycling Turkey takes in from abroad has soared, from 159,000 to 439,000 tons in two years. Each month, about 10 ships pull into the ports of Istanbul and Adana, carrying about 2,000 tons of cheap US scrap plastic that is no longer wanted by China. Most of it comes from the ports of Georgia, Charleston, Baltimore and New York. Some of it is described in shipping records as “Walmart film scrap”, the clear cling wrap used to secure huge pallets of products sold by Walmart. (Walmart declined to comment on the issue.) These cargo ships join dozens of others from the UK and other European countries. Their arrival is closely watched by Turkey’s scrap pickers, who number in the hundreds of thousands and travel the streets collecting scraps from houses and businesses to resell to factories for manufacturing into products such as plastic bags. Now, the scrap pickers say, the factories are buying cheaper and cleaner plastic from the foreign recycling coming in on ships. Piles of their unsold, locally collected plastic are building up in urban storage yards. They have organized a campaign to stop the flood of foreign plastic, getting friends who work in the port to take videos of materials being offloaded and conducting their own ad hoc investigations. “There are 500,000 street collectors in Turkey, working almost like ants to collect the waste,” said Baran Bozoğlu, head of Turkey’s Chamber of Environmental Engineers. Yet he said the “uncontrolled and unlimited” import of foreign recycling was leaving these local recyclers without markets for the scrap they collect. “It’s like we have flour and water and, instead of making our own bread, we import bread from abroad! Does that make any sense to you?’ Every day, Eser Çağlayan, 33, wheels his giant white collecting bag through a booming business district along the shores of the Bosphorus strait, hunting for treasures that people throw out, along with the usual plastic and paper scraps. In the past, Çağlayan, a 20-year-veteran of the scrap-picking trade, was able to feed his family of five with the $800 or so he made every month. But this year, he said, his income was down by about a third due to the competition from cheap, imported recycling. ‘‘I want to tell people in US this: recycle in your own yard,” he said. “Don’t bring down our income and put us all in danger of hunger.’’ How people are fighting for change The environmental and social ramifications of America’s plastic exports are shocking even to those in the industry. Bob Wenzlau is considered one of the founding fathers of the US curbside recycling system, having helped to launch the program in Palo Alto, California, in 1976. Curbside recycling “was started with a really good intention; I used to feel so proud,” said Wenzlau. Now, after learning of the effects the nation’s exports are having overseas, he said, “my heart aches, because the system is doing harm”. Wenzlau recently convinced the Palo Alto city council to pass a measure requiring the city’s recyclers to report on the social and environmental consequences of any recycling that goes to foreign countries. Even in San Francisco, long hailed for the high percentage of waste it is able to recycle, the head of the city’s waste disposal provider has said that the system is failing. “The simple fact is, there is just too much plastic – and too many different types of plastics – being produced; and there exist few, if any, viable end markets for the material,” Michael J Sangiacomo of Recology recently wrote in an op-ed. A study released this spring by the environmental group Gaia documented the human toll of US plastics exports on the countries that receive them. “The impact of the shift in plastic trade to south-east Asian countries has been staggering – contaminated water supplies, crop death, respiratory illness from exposure to burning plastic, and the rise of organized crime abound in areas most exposed to the flood of new imports,” the report found. “These countries and their people are shouldering the economic, social and environmental costs of that pollution, possibly for generations to come.” For many experts, the most frightening example of how an out-of-control recycling industry can overwhelm a country is Malaysia. Immediately following the China ban, it became the go-to destination for US plastic and is still paying the price. In the first 10 months of 2018, the US exported 192,000 metric tons of plastic waste to Malaysia for recycling. Some of the factories had licenses to process foreign waste. Some only had licenses to deal with Malaysian plastic waste but secretly processed foreign waste. Often, such “processing” actually meant illegally burning plastic, with the toxic fumes inhaled by Malaysians living near unlicensed factories and dump sites. In October, the Malaysian government announced plans to immediately stop issuing new permits for importing plastic waste, and to end all plastic waste importing within three years. Even so, thousands of tons of junk plastic remain heaped on the landscape, left behind by unscrupulous business operations. On the outskirts of Jenjarom, a town in the district of Kuala Langat, where local authorities shut down 34 illegal factories last July, a land manager struggled to get rid of 10ft-high piles of plastic left under a corrugated roof by illegal importers of foreign waste. Nearby, a huge field of foreign plastic had been abandoned by the former renters: Chinese illegal factory owners, who left without warning following the crackdown. And the illegal importation of US waste is continuing. According to the environmental minister Yeo Bee Yin’s accounts to the local press, many shippers simply change the codes on the documentation for their cargo containers to make it look like they are sending virgin plastic, which isn’t regulated, instead of the same old recycling scrap. The continued arrival of foreign plastics is no surprise to Pang Song Lim, a 44-year-old civil engineer who lives in Sungai Petani, a town of half a million in the north-west state of Kedah. Officials say there may be 20 illegal plastic-processing factories there. Every evening at sunset, Lim prepares his house and his nose for the onslaught from the burning of foreign plastic waste nearby. Foul smoke engulfs homes and a local school. “It’s normally after eight o’clock,” Lim said. “Burned plastic … acidic … it hurts my chest. I try to seal my windows and block under the door with carpet.” “You wake up at midnight because of the smell,” said Christina Lai, a Sungai Petani activist. “One day this land will be taken over by rubbish and not humans.” Lead reporter: Erin McCormick (Oakland, California and Monterrey, Mexico) Reporters: Bennett Murray (Hanoi, Vietnam), Leonie Kijewski (Phnom Penh, Cambodia), Carmela Fonbuena (Manila, Philippines), Gökçe Saraçoğlu (Istanbul, Turkey), Jamie Fullerton (Jenjarom and Sungai Petani, Malaysia), Febriana Firdaus (Jakarta, Indonesia), Kimberley Brown (Quito, Ecuador), Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu (Accra, Ghana), Redwan Ahmed (Dhaka, Bangladesh).

2018-03-14T23:29:12Z,"If business leaders want to regain our trust, they must act upon climate risk | Ian Dunlop",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/if-business-leaders-want-to-regain-our-trust-they-must-act-upon-climate-risk,"Business leaders seem astonished that community trust in their activities is at an all-time low, trending toward the bottom of the barrel inhabited by politicians. To the corporate leader dedicated to the capitalist, market economy success story of the last 50 years, that attitude is no doubt incomprehensible and downright ungrateful. But it is hardly surprising given continuing scandals and declining ethics across the corporate and banking worlds, driven by the pernicious impact of short-termism, rising inequality and undue political influence; in large part the outcome of the oxymoron of “pay-for-performance” remuneration. So how is trust regained? The need for stronger leadership, ethics, greater transparency, open communications and improved culture feature prominently in current responses. But a far more fundamental requirement is ignored, namely that business must lead on really critical issues, particularly the point raised long ago by economist Kenneth Boulding: “Anyone who considers economic growth can continue indefinitely in a finite system is either a madman or an economist”. The constraints Boulding anticipated have now arrived, as burgeoning population and economic growth crash into global biophysical limits which cannot be circumvented. Those constraints, encompassing resource shortages, biodiversity loss and pollution in various guises, do not feature in the capitalist economic lexicon, as technology and the market are supposed to overcome all as we march toward the sunlit uplands of the neoliberal nirvana. In the real world, the entire growth model under which Australia and global economies operate, is no longer sustainable; it sowed the seeds of its own destruction some time ago and is rapidly driving itself into the ground as growth rates decline. This is the great “black elephant” of business and politics; a known, knowable fact that no one wants to acknowledge – the unmentionable in the recent Business and Governance Summits around the country, as our leaders strive to compound the problem with self-defeating subterfuges to maximise growth, not least corporate tax cuts and trade agreements. To the community, these constraints are increasingly obvious as the quality of life for the average person deteriorates in myriad ways. The rhetoric of much-vaunted corporate social responsibility no longer holds water when our supposed leaders are not prepared to address the issues that really count for our survival, let alone prosperity. These range from basic considerations such as ensuring food and water availability, to the creation of genuinely sustainable global societies. However, the first priority must be human-induced climate change, manifest as the lack of an atmosphere into which we can continue dumping carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation, without causing catastrophic consequences. Climate change is accelerating far faster than expected, to the point where it now represents an existential threat to humanity, that is a threat posing permanent large negative consequences which will be irreversible, an outcome being locked in today by our insistence on expanding the use of fossil fuels. This should be a major concern in Australia given that we are more exposed than most, but instead our leaders would have us embark on massive fossil fuel expansion. Already one of the world’s largest carbon polluters when exports are included, Australia is complicit in destroying the conditions which make human life possible. There is no greater crime against humanity. The economic and social impacts will be devastating unless that policy is rapidly reversed. The unprecedented hurricane season in the Atlantic, bushfires in the Californian winter, extreme heat in many parts of South Asia and rapid heating of the Arctic with associated instability in the northern hemisphere weather system, are only the most recent portents of what is to come. The worst outcomes can only be avoided now by emergency action, akin to restructuring economies on a war-footing. It finally seems to be dawning on corporate and investor leadership that climate change is a real and present danger which is not going away. Company directors are personally liable for failing to assess and act upon climate risk, but the greenwash continues. Major corporates parade their credentials in support of serious climate action, but none of their scenarios and policies are in line with the Paris objective of constraining global temperature increase “well below 2.0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.50C”. Fortunately, as understanding of the risks improves, regulatory pressure mounts. The recommendations triggered by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, via the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) are gradually being taken up, with companies voluntarily disclosing the impact which a 2C policy framework would have on their organisation, assuming such a framework was ever put in place (by governments?). Progress, but reactive and certainly not leadership. The question that must be answered is: “what are you doing proactively as a company to create a 2C world” – more realistically closer to 1.5C, as it is now patently clear that 2C is far too high? If business genuinely wishes to regain trust, it must proactively face up to the challenge posed by climate change and initiate emergency action. Beyond that, it must open up honest debate on a new economic model to replace conventional growth. It is the only way business will be sustainable in the 21st century with a real social licence to operate.

2018-05-24T05:00:44Z,The trouble with charitable billionaires,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/24/the-trouble-with-charitable-billionaires-philanthrocapitalism,"In February 2017, Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in the headlines for his charitable activities. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by the tech billionaire and his wife, Priscilla Chan, handed out over $3m in grants to aid the housing crisis in the Silicon Valley area. David Plouffe, the Initiative’s president of policy and advocacy, stated that the grants were intended to “support those working to help families in immediate crisis while supporting research into new ideas to find a long-term solution – a two-step strategy that will guide much of our policy and advocacy work moving forward”. This is but one small part of Zuckerberg’s charity empire. The Initiative has committed billions of dollars to philanthropic projects designed to address social problems, with a special focus on solutions driven by science, medical research and education. This all took off in December 2015, when Zuckerberg and Chan wrote and published a letter to their new baby Max. The letter made a commitment that over the course of their lives they would donate 99% of their shares in Facebook (at the time valued at $45bn) to the “mission” of “advancing human potential and promoting equality”. The housing intervention is of course much closer to home, dealing with issues literally at the door of Facebook’s Menlo Park head office. This is an area where median house prices almost doubled to around $2m in the five years between 2012 and 2017. More generally, San Francisco is a city with massive income inequality, and the reputation of having the most expensive housing in the US. Chan Zuckerberg’s intervention was clearly designed to offset social and economic problems caused by rents and house prices having skyrocketed to such a level that even tech workers on six-figure salaries find it hard to get by. For those on more modest incomes, supporting themselves, let alone a family, is nigh-on impossible. Ironically, the boom in the tech industry in this region – a boom Facebook has been at the forefront of – has been a major contributor to the crisis. As Peter Cohen from the Council of Community Housing Organizations explained it: “When you’re dealing with this total concentration of wealth and this absurd slosh of real-estate money, you’re not dealing with housing that’s serving a growing population. You’re dealing with housing as a real-estate commodity for speculation.” Zuckerberg’s apparent generosity, it would seem, is a small contribution to a large problem that was created by the success of the industry he is involved in. In one sense, the housing grants (equivalent to the price of just one-and-a-half average Menlo Park homes) are trying to put a sticking plaster on a problem that Facebook and other Bay Area corporations aided and abetted. It would appear that Zuckerberg was redirecting a fraction of the spoils of neoliberal tech capitalism, in the name of generosity, to try to address the problems of wealth inequality created by a social and economic system that allowed those spoils to accrue in the first place. It is easy to think of Zuckerberg as some kind of CEO hero – a once regular kid whose genius made him one of the richest men in the world, and who decided to use that wealth for the benefit of others. The image he projects is of altruism untainted by self-interest. A quick scratch of the surface reveals that the structure of Zuckerberg’s charity enterprise is informed by much more than good-hearted altruism. Even while many have applauded Zuckerberg for his generosity, the nature of this apparent charity was openly questioned from the outset. The wording of Zuckerberg’s 2015 letter could easily have been interpreted as meaning that he was intending to donate $45bn to charity. As investigative reporter Jesse Eisinger reported at the time, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative through which this giving was to be funnelled is not a not-for-profit charitable foundation, but a limited liability company. This legal status has significant practical implications, especially when it comes to tax. As a company, the Initiative can do much more than charitable activity: its legal status gives it rights to invest in other companies, and to make political donations. Effectively the company does not restrict Zuckerberg’s decision-making as to what he wants to do with his money; he is very much the boss. Moreover, as Eisinger described it, Zuckerberg’s bold move yielded a huge return on investment in terms of public relations for Facebook, even though it appeared that he simply “moved money from one pocket to the other” while being “likely never to pay any taxes on it”. The creation of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – decidedly not a charity organisation – means that Zuckerberg can control the company’s investments as he sees fit, while accruing significant commercial, tax and political benefits. All of this is not to say that Zuckerberg’s motives do not include some expression of his own generosity or some genuine desire for humanity’s wellbeing and equality. What it does suggest, however, is that when it comes to giving, the CEO approach is one in which there is no apparent incompatibility between being generous, seeking to retain control over what is given, and the expectation of reaping benefits in return. This reformulation of generosity – in which it is no longer considered incompatible with control and self-interest – is a hallmark of the “CEO society”: a society where the values associated with corporate leadership are applied to all dimensions of human endeavour. * * * Mark Zuckerberg was by no means the first contemporary CEO to promise and initiate large-scale donations of wealth to self-nominated good causes. In the CEO society it is positively a badge of honour for the world’s most wealthy businesspeople to create vehicles to give away their wealth. This has been institutionalised in what is known as The Giving Pledge, a philanthropy campaign initiated by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in 2010. The campaign targets billionaires around the world, encouraging them to give away the majority of their wealth. There is nothing in the pledge that specifies what exactly the donations will be used for, or even whether they are to be made now or willed after death; it is just a general commitment to using private wealth for ostensibly public good. It is not legally binding either, but a moral commitment. There is a long list of people and families who have made the pledge. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are there, and so are some 174 others, including household names such as Richard and Joan Branson, Michael Bloomberg, Barron Hilton and David Rockefeller. It would seem that many of the world’s richest people simply want to give their money away to good causes. This all amounts to what human geographers Iain Hay and Samantha Muller sceptically refer to as a “golden age of philanthropy”, in which, since the late 1990s, bequests to charity from the super-rich have escalated to the hundreds of billions of dollars. These new philanthropists bring to charity an “entrepreneurial disposition”, Hay and Muller wrote in a 2014 paper, yet one that they suggest has been “diverting attention and resources away from the failings of contemporary manifestations of capitalism”, and may also be serving as a substitute for public spending withdrawn by the state. Essentially, what we are witnessing is the transfer of responsibility for public goods and services from democratic institutions to the wealthy, to be administered by an executive class. In the CEO society, the exercise of social responsibilities is no longer debated in terms of whether corporations should or shouldn’t be responsible for more than their own business interests. Instead, it is about how philanthropy can be used to reinforce a politico-economic system that enables such a small number of people to accumulate obscene amounts of wealth. Zuckerberg’s investment in solutions to the Bay Area housing crisis is an example of this broader trend. The reliance on billionaire businesspeople’s charity to support public projects is a part of what has been called “philanthrocapitalism”. This resolves the apparent antinomy between charity (traditionally focused on giving) and capitalism (based on the pursuit of economic self-interest). As historian Mikkel Thorup explains, philanthrocapitalism rests on the claim that “capitalist mechanisms are superior to all others (especially the state) when it comes to not only creating economic but also human progress, and that the market and market actors are or should be made the prime creators of the good society”. The golden age of philanthropy is not just about benefits that accrue to individual givers. More broadly, philanthropy serves to legitimise capitalism, as well as to extend it further and further into all domains of social, cultural and political activity. Philanthrocapitalism is about much more than the simple act of generosity it pretends to be, instead involving the inculcation of neoliberal values personified by the billionaire CEOs who have led its charge. Philanthropy is recast in the same terms in which a CEO would consider a business venture. Charitable giving is translated into a business model that employs market-based solutions characterised by efficiency and quantified costs and benefits. Philanthrocapitalism takes the application of management discourses and practices from business corporations and adapts them to charitable work. The focus is on entrepreneurship, market-based approaches and performance metrics. The process is funded by super-rich businesspeople and managed by those experienced in business. The result, at a practical level, is that philanthropy is undertaken by CEOs in a manner similar to how they would run businesses. As part of this, charitable foundations have changed in recent years. As explained in a paper by Garry Jenkins, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota, this involves becoming “increasingly directive, controlling, metric-focused and business-oriented with respect to their interactions with grantee public charities, in an attempt to demonstrate that the work of the foundation is ‘strategic’ and ‘accountable’”. This is far from the benign shift to a different and better way of doing things that it claims to be – a CEO style to “save the world through business thinking and market methods”, as Jenkins puts it. Instead, the risk of philanthrocapitalism is a takeover of charity by business interests, such that generosity to others is appropriated into the overarching dominance of the CEO model of society and its corporate institutions. * * * The modern CEO is very much at the forefront of the political and media stage. While this often leads to CEOs becoming vaunted celebrities, it also leaves them open to being identified as scapegoats for economic injustice. The increasingly public role taken by CEOs is related to a renewed corporate focus on their wider social responsibility. Firms must now balance, at least rhetorically, a dual commitment to profit and social outcomes. This has been reflected in the promotion of the “triple bottom line”, which combines social, financial and environmental priorities in corporate reporting. This turn toward social responsibility represents a distinct problem for CEOs. While firms may be willing to sacrifice some short-term profit for the sake of preserving their public reputation, this same bargain is rarely on offer to CEOs themselves, who are judged on their quarterly reports and how well they are serving the fiscal interests of their shareholders. Thus, whereas social responsibility strategies may win public kudos, in the confines of the boardroom it is often a different story, especially when the budget is being scrutinised. There is a further economic incentive for CEOs to avoid making fundamental changes to their operations in the name of social justice, in that a large portion of CEO remuneration often consists of company stock and options. Accepting fair trade policies and closing sweatshops may be good for the world, but is potentially disastrous for a firm’s immediate financial success. What is ethically valuable to the voting and buying public is not necessarily of concrete value to corporations, nor personally beneficial to their top executives. Many firms have sought to resolve this contradiction through high-profile philanthropy. Exploitative labour practices or corporate malpractice are swept under the carpet as companies publicise tax-efficient contributions to good causes. Such contributions may be a relatively small price to pay compared with changing fundamental operational practices. Likewise, giving to charity is a prime opportunity for CEOs to be seen to be doing good without having to sacrifice their commitment to making profit at any social cost. Charitable activity permits CEOs to be philanthropic rather than economically progressive or politically democratic. There is an even more straightforward financial consideration at play in some cases. Charity can be an absolute boon to capital accumulation: corporate philanthropy has been shown to have a positive effect on perceptions by stock market analysts. At the personal level, CEOs can take advantage of promoting their individual charity to distract from other, less savoury activities; as an executive, they can cash in on the capital gains that can be made from introducing high-profile charity strategies. * * * The very notion of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, has been criticised for providing companies with a moral cover to act in quite exploitative and socially damaging ways. But in the current era, social responsibility, when portrayed as an individual character trait of chief executives, has allowed corporations to be run as irresponsibly as ever. CEOs’ very public engagement in philanthrocapitalism can be understood as a key component of this reputation management. It is part of the marketing of the firm itself, as the good deeds of its leaders come to signify the overall goodness of the corporation. Ironically, philanthrocapitalism also grants corporations the moral right, at least within the public consciousness, to be socially irresponsible. The trumpeting of the CEOs’ personal generosity can grant an implicit right for their corporations to act ruthlessly and with little consideration for the broader social effects of their activities. This reflects a productive tension at the heart of modern CSR: the more moral a CEO, the more immoral their company can in theory seek to be. The hypocrisy revealed by CEOs claiming to be dedicated to social responsibility and charity also exposes a deeper authoritarian morality that prevails in the CEO society. Philanthrocapitalism is commonly presented as the social justice component of an otherwise amoral global free market. At best, corporate charity is a type of voluntary tax paid by the 1% for their role in creating such an economically deprived and unequal world. Yet this “giving” culture also helps support and spread a distinctly authoritarian form of economic development that mirrors the autocratic leadership style of the executives who predominantly fund it. The marketisation of global charity and empowerment has dangerous implications that transcend economics. It also has a troubling emerging political legacy, one in which democracy is sacrificed on that altar of executive-style empowerment. Politically, the free market is posited as a fundamental requirement for liberal democracy. However, recent analysis reveals the deeper connection between processes of marketisation and authoritarianism. In particular, a strong government is required to implement these often unpopular market changes. The image of the powerful autocrat is, to this effect, transformed into a potentially positive figure, a forward-thinking political leader who can guide their country on the correct market path in the face of “irrational” opposition. Charity becomes a conduit for CEOs to fund these “good” authoritarians. The recent development of philanthrocapitalism also marks the increasing encroachment of business into the provision of public goods and services. This encroachment is not limited to the activities of individual billionaires; it is also becoming a part of the activities of large corporations under the rubric of CSR. This is especially the case for large multinational corporations whose global reach, wealth and power give them significant political clout. This relationship has been referred to as “political CSR”. Business ethics professors Andreas Scherer and Guido Palazzo note that, for large corporations, “CSR is increasingly displayed in corporate involvement in the political process of solving societal problems, often on a global scale”. Such political CSR initiatives see organisations cooperating and collaborating with governments, civic bodies and international institutions, so that historical separations between the purposes of the state and the corporations are increasingly eroded. Global corporations have long been involved in quasi-governmental activities such as the setting of standards and codes, and today are increasingly engaging in other activities that have traditionally been the domain of government, such as public health provision, education, the protection of human rights, addressing social problems such as Aids and malnutrition, protection of the natural environment and the promotion of peace and social stability. Today, large organisations can amass significant economic and political power, on a global scale. This means that their actions – and the way those actions are regulated – have far-reaching social consequences. The balanced tipped in 2000, when the Institute for Policy Studies in the US reported, after comparing corporate revenues with gross domestic product (GDP), that 51 of the largest economies in the world were corporations, and 49 were national economies. The biggest corporations were General Motors, Walmart and Ford, each of which was larger economically than Poland, Norway and South Africa. As the heads of these corporations, CEOs are now quasi-politicians. One only has to think of the increasing power of the World Economic Forum, whose annual meeting in Davos in Switzerland sees corporate CEOs and senior politicians getting together with the ostensible goal of “improving the world”, a now time-honoured ritual that symbolises the global power and agency of CEOs. * * * The development of CSR is not the result of self-directed corporate initiatives for doing good deeds, but a response to widespread CSR activism from NGOs, pressure groups and trade unions. Often this has been in response to the failure of governments to regulate large corporations. High-profile industrial accidents and scandals have also put pressure on organisations for heightened self-regulation. An explosion at a Union Carbide chemical plant in Bhopal, India in 1984 led to the deaths of an estimated 25,000 people. James Post, a professor of management at Boston University, explains that, after the disaster, “the global chemical industry recognised that it was nearly impossible to secure a licence to operate without public confidence in industry safety standards. The Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) adopted a code of conduct, including new standards of product stewardship, disclosure and community engagement.” The impetus for this was corporate self-interest, rather than generosity, as industries and corporations globally “began to recognise the increasing importance of reputation and image”. Similar moves were enacted after other major industrial accidents, such as the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilling hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil in Alaska in 1989, and BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploding in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Another important case was the involvement of the clothing companies Gap and Nike in a child labour scandal after the broadcast of a BBC Panorama documentary in October 2000. Factories in Cambodia making Gap and Nike clothing were shown to operate with terrible working conditions, involving children as young as 12 working seven days a week, being forced to do overtime, and enduring physical and emotional abuse from management. The public outcry that ensued demanded that Gap and Nike, and other organisations like them, take more responsibility for the negative human social impacts of their business practices. CSR was introduced in order to reduce the ill effects of corporate self-interest. But over time it has turned into a means for further enhancing that self-interest while ostensibly claiming to be addressing the interests of others. When facing the threat of corporate scandal, CSR is seen as the vehicle through which corporate reputation can be boosted, and the threat of government regulation can be mitigated. Again, here we see how corporations engage in seemingly responsible practices in order to increase their own political power, and to diminish the power of nation states over their own operations. The idea that organisations adopt CSR for the purposes of developing or defending a corporate reputation has put the ethics of CSR under scrutiny. The contention has arisen that, rather than using CSR as a means of “being good”, corporations adopt it merely as a means of “looking good”, while not in any way questioning their basic ethical or political stance. Even Enron, before its legendary fraud scandal and eventual demise in 2001, was well known for its advocacy of social responsibility. * * * CEO generosity is epic in proportions – or at least that is how it is portrayed. Indeed, on an individual level it is hard to find fault with those rich people who have given away vast swaths of their wealth to charitable causes, or those corporations that champion socially responsible programmes. But what CSR and philanthrocapitalism achieve more broadly is the social justification of extreme wealth inequality, rather than any kind of antidote to it. We need to note here that, despite the apparent proliferation of giving promised by philanthrocapitalism, the so-called golden age of philanthropy is also an age of expanding inequality. This is clearly spelled out a 2017 report by Oxfam called An Economy for the 99%. It highlights the injustice and unsustainability of a world suffering from widening levels of inequality: since the early 1990s, the top 1% of the world’s wealthy people have gained more income than the entire bottom 50%. Why so? Oxfam’s report places the blame firmly with corporations and the global market economies in which they operate. The statistics are alarming, with the world’s 10 biggest corporations having revenues that exceed the total combined revenues of the 180 least wealthy nations. Corporate social responsibility is not making any real difference. The report states: “When corporations increasingly work for the rich, the benefits of economic growth are denied to those who need them most. In pursuit of delivering high returns to those at the top, corporations are driven to squeeze their workers and producers ever harder – and to avoid paying taxes which would benefit everyone, and the poorest people in particular.” Neither the philanthropy of the super-rich nor socially directed corporate programmes have any real effect on combating this trend, in the same way that Zuckerberg’s handout of $3m will have a negligible effect on the San Francisco housing crisis. Instead, vast fortunes in the hands of the few, whether earned through inheritance, commerce or crime, continue to grow at the expense of the poor. In the end, it is capitalism that is at the heart of philanthrocapitalism, and the corporation that is at the heart of corporate social responsibility, with even well-meaning endeavours serving to justify a system that is rigged in favour of the rich. What is particular about this new approach is not that rich people are supporting charitable endeavours, but that it involves, as sociologist Linsey McGoey explains, “an openness that deliberately collapses the distinction between public and private interests, in order to justify increasingly concentrated levels of private gain”. In the CEO society, corporate logic such as this rules supreme, and ensures that any activities thought of as generous and socially responsible ultimately have a payoff in terms of self-interest. If there was ever a debate between the ethics of genuine hospitality, reciprocity and self-interest, it is not to be found here. It is in accordance with this CEO logic that the mechanisms for redressing the inequality created through wealth generation are placed in the hands of the wealthy, and in a way that ultimately benefits them. The worst excesses of neoliberal capitalism are morally justified by the actions of the very people who benefit from those excesses. Wealth redistribution is placed in the hands of the wealthy, and social responsibility in the hands of those who have exploited society for personal gain. Meanwhile, inequality is growing, and both corporations and the wealthy find ways to avoid the taxes that the rest of us pay. In the name of generosity, we find a new form of corporate rule, refashioning another dimension of human endeavour in its own interests. Such is a society where CEOs are no longer content to do business; they must control public goods as well. In the end, while the Giving Pledge’s website may feature more and more smiling faces of smug-looking CEOs, the real story is of a world characterised by gross inequality that is getting worse year by year.

2018-05-31T05:33:06Z,"Thursday briefing: My fake murder, by Russian journalist",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/thursday-briefing-my-fake-by-russian-journalist,"Top story: ‘Sorry for making you live through this’ Hello, it’s Warren Murray with the headlines of the day. The spectacular reappearance of journalist Arkady Babchenko after his “murder” in Ukraine has triggered relief but also censure and exasperation among colleagues and observers. Babchenko said Ukrainian security services staged his shooting as a sting to round up the conspirators in a Russian plot to assassinate him. He apologised to his wife, Olechka, for the “nightmare” but said there had been no alternative. “I’m sorry for making you live through this,” said the dissident reporter, who fled Russia after death threats. “I’ve buried my own friends and colleagues many times myself.” But the case is a gift to the Kremlin, which has had the killing of a number of Russian dissenters traced back to its door, and oversees a well-oiled fake news operation that propagates conspiracy theories. The state-run Russia Today (RT) network has wasted no time in presenting it as evidence of widespread media manipulation in Nato countries and the west. “The next time a Kremlin critic is shot to death, or poisoned, or falls curiously from their balcony to die on the concrete below,” writes Guardian correspondent Shaun Walker, “the first question is always going to be: are they really dead?” * * * Sexism of the boardroom – The retrograde views of FTSE bosses about female company directors have been illustrated by a government report that found a dismissive attitude to the need to increase diversity. Senior executives’ excuses included that they “have one woman already on the board – it’s someone else’s turn”, that other directors “wouldn’t want to appoint a woman”, and that “the issues covered are extremely complex” and there are no women qualified enough. The business minister, Andrew Griffiths, described the comments as “pitiful and patronising”. Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of the corporate social responsibility group Business in the Community, said: “As you read this list of excuses, you might think it’s 1918, not 2018 … Maybe those that give credence to these excuses are the ones that are not up to sitting on boards and should move over: we are in the 21st century after all.” * * * Greer: rape is lazy – Germaine Greer has called for rape penalties to be reduced, saying it should not be treated outright as a “spectacularly violent crime”. “Most rape is just lazy, just careless, insensitive,” Greer, who was raped at age 18, told a Hay festival audience. “Every time a man rolls over on his exhausted wife and insists on enjoying his conjugal rights he is raping her. It will never end up in a court of law.” In cases of obviously violent rape, she argued, the courts should concentrate on the violence, which should attract bigger sentences, rather than routinely conducting long trials that humiliate women. Greer is publishing her full argument on rape in a forthcoming book. * * * ‘Do we have a future here?’ – A senior figure in Britain’s Jewish community says a Jeremy Corbyn prime ministership could drive Jews from the country. “[Corbyn] has views which are antisemitic, and he has problematic views,” said Jonathan Arkush, the outgoing president of the Jewish Board of Deputies. “He was a chairman of Stop the War, which is responsible for some of the worst anti-Israel discourse.” Corbyn’s spokesman said the comments were “personal attacks without any evidence to support them … Jonathan Arkush’s attempt to conflate strong criticism of Israeli state policies with antisemitism is wrong and undermines the fight both against antisemitism and for justice for the Palestinians.” * * * Trust trumps tactics – Donald Trump’s approach to negotiating with North Korea courts “disaster” if he does not respect the need to gradually build trust. That’s the view of the Japanese former diplomat Hitoshi Tanaka, who helped orchestrate the release of five abducted Japanese citizens in 2002. He outlined how it took many meetings in the course of a year, involving a host of officials and intermediaries, to build confidence and momentum. In contrast, Trump appeared to be “trying to do many things on his own” including his off-again, on-again approach. Our foreign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall writes this morning that Trump’s aim of a swift, headline-grabbing deal could be stymied by some uninvited guests at the planned Singapore summit: regional interests including China, Russia, Japan and South Korea all want a piece of the action. * * * ‘Extraordinary cast of leaders’ – The Duchess of Sussex, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, the singer Dua Lipa and the Harry Potter novelist JK Rowling are among prominent inclusions in Vogue’s inaugural guide to Britain’s 25 most influential women. Also chosen are Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, along with reporters Amelia Gentleman, who exposed the Windrush scandal, and Carole Cadwalladr, who broke the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook story. Our report includes the full list. Lunchtime read: Recipes from scrap “Faced with a fridge full of turning veg, the wreckage of a Sunday roast or pans of leftover rice, there is no such thing as too much inspiration.” Well put Tony Naylor, who has pulled together ideas from leading chefs like Jamie Oliver and Skye Gyngell to stop you throwing out so much perfectly good food. Make your outer cabbage leaves into sauerkraut. Keep your stale bread for croutons. And as for vegetable skins: a puree, a salad and making vegetable salt are all ideas with a peel … Sport The 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams may have returned to Roland Garros in trademark unflappable fashion this week, but she has opened up about the challenging experiences of motherhood following the birth of her daughter, Alexis. Meanwhile the conversation around the playing surface in Paris continues after Rafael Nadal admitted the clay was “more slippery than usual”. And Novak Djokovic’s first two round performances mean that the injury-ravaged former world No 1 could be leading the pack in the hunt to steal the men’s crown from Spaniard Nadal, says Kevin Mitchell. Danny Welbeck leads the England World Cup squad for international goals, and heading into Russia 2018 he details his lengthy struggles with injury as well as the reading material that’s motivated him to return. Finally the lawyer for Colin Kaepernick has claimed at least one NFL owner has testified under oath that he changed his mind about signing the former quarterback after President Trump called for players who kneel during the anthem to be fired. Business The US will announce that the EU is being excluded from exemptions from steel and aluminium tariffs, according to reports. It will add to growing tension in Asia about the Trump administration’s trade policy, which is under attack from China and Japan. Still with the US and the Federal Reserve is proposing to relax the limits on risky trading that Wall Street banks are allowed to carry out. If it happens, it will reverse a major reform of the post-financial crisis years. And talking of crises, the euro maintained its recovery after Italy’s president signalled the country’s two biggest parties would be given more time to form a new government rather than risk fresh elections. The pound is buying $1.331 and €1.14. The FTSE is expected to rise by around 0.4% at the open. The papers “You only live twice”. The Sun and the Star have the same headline for the story of Arkady Babchenko’s reappearance, though the latter adds an exclamation mark. “Back from the dead” is how the i handles it. The Guardian explains in full: “I faked my own death to avoid Kremlin hitman, says journalist”. Some of the others have front-page pictures of Babchenko but he is not their splash. “Stop this Brexit border madness”, rails the Express – it’s more of that Rees-Mogg fury as the Tory MP complains that the Ireland issue is spoiling his Brexit. Still in the Brexit vein: “Brexit deal on security is blocked by France” – the Times reports that Britain could lose access to a Europe-wide crime-fighting database. “Sexist FTSE chiefs claim women aren’t fit for boardrooms” says the Telegraph as it covers a government report criticising the diversity failings of big companies. Get ready for “£100 a month energy bills” – the Mail warns that “Big Six” suppliers have all put their prices up. The Mirror says it’s got “THE PROOF” that British pilots were deliberately exposed to radiation in cold war nuclear experiments. Finally the FT: “US snubs Brussels call for relief from steel and aluminium tariffs”, a story we’ve got covered here.

2018-10-07T07:00:05Z,Has the Booker prize lost its mojo?,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/07/has-the-booker-prize-lost-its-mojo,"Documentaries about contemporary writers do not tend to liveliness – which is, perhaps, one reason why the BBC is increasingly reluctant to commission them. But Barneys, Books and Bust-ups: 50 Years of the Booker prize, to be screened on BBC Four on 15 October, the night before the announcement of this year’s winner, could not be boring even if it tried. There are no vengeful former muses; on this score, even Salman Rushdie gets off scot-free. But those who live in fear of lingering shots of honeyed bookshelves and the scratchy sound of a fountain pen moving across a sheet of paper can relax. Fifty years is a long time when it comes to gossip, feuds, giant egos, rank stupidity and mild lunacy, all of which the Booker prize used to deliver on a pretty regular basis. The film’s director, Jon Morrice, could have used no new material whatsoever, and he would still have had more footage than he knew what to do with. Every moment bulges with incident; every anecdote involves cattiness, hubris or the plangent lessons offered by posterity (occasionally, all three). Hard to say what I enjoyed most. Was it the sight of a sweaty Anthony Burgess, shortlisted for Earthly Powers in 1980, describing the Booker as “a rather small, parochial prize suitable for rather small, parochial writers”? (Burgess, sulking in a hotel while everyone else attended the ceremony, by this point knew very well that William Golding had bagged it for Rites of Passage.) Or was it when John Banville, the winner in 2005 for The Sea, smoothly announced on his big night that it was at least “nice to see a work of art winning the prize”? At the end of the hour, the viewer can only conclude that a kind of madness is apt to descend on those who get involved with the Booker, be they writers, publishers, judges or critics. Still, for all the madness and hype, the prize at least used to lead readers to books, sometimes in their millions. In Sheffield, in the 80s, my father would buy the shortlist every year as a matter of course, which is how he discovered such writers as William Boyd and Graham Swift. It is hard to imagine him doing so now. By general consent, its old shine is fast disappearing. “I think there has been a diminishment of the brand, one I would place at the feet of the last few winners,” says one former senior bookseller who, like almost everyone I approached about this piece, would talk only off the record. “The shortlist no longer has the power it had in terms of sales. It has stopped being a reliable indicator so far as readers go, and the fact that Colson Whitehead’s [Pulitzer prize-winning] The Underground Railroad wasn’t on the longlist last year, and that Sally Rooney’s Normal People hasn’t made it to the shortlist this year, are just other instances of that.” Is he saying that, for the public, it has lost its lustre? “Yes, and I’m not the only one who thinks so. The last book that connected with readers was Hilary Mantel’s Bring Up the Bodies [in 2012]. It’s less the Oscars now, and more the Cannes film festival.” So who does he predict will triumph this year? “If I were still a bookseller, the book I would want to win is Esi Edugyan’s Washington Black [an adventure story about a runaway slave]. It’s such an enjoyable read. But the book I think will win is The Overstory by Richard Powers.” In case you don’t know – I’ve yet to meet anyone who’s read it – The Overstory is an idiosyncratic and, in the words of one plucky critic, “valiant” 500-page epic that is supposed to do for trees what Moby-Dick did for whales. Perhaps this is why my contact is laughing. In certain quarters, of course, Powers would be an unpopular choice not only for commercial reasons. “American wins Booker prize for the third year running” isn’t, most insiders feel, a headline its director and trustees would want to see in the award’s 50th year. Publishers’ and authors’ nerves aside, in 2018, a more than usually large cloud of anxiety looms over the Booker and all who sail in her. The Man Group, the prize’s sponsor since 2002, is signed up only until 2020, and the word is that Luke Ellis, its CEO, is somewhat less keen on the company’s £1.6m annual commitment to both it and the International Man Booker prize than his predecessor. Given the well-publicised withdrawal of other sponsors from book prizes in recent years, no one is taking anything for granted. Meanwhile, publishers and booksellers alike agree that this year’s longlist was, for whatever reason, distinctly weird, with its inclusion of both a comic book (Sabrina by Nick Drnaso) and a crime novel (Snap by Belinda Bauer). “Next year, they’re going to get 30 crime novels,” says one confused publisher. “One of the criteria for entry is that you must publish two literary novels a year, and if a crime novel is now a literary novel, more imprints are going to believe they’ve eligible books on their lists.” This, in turn, could bring the prize’s organisers yet more woe. Anecdotally, it’s getting ever harder to find willing Booker judges, largely because the task is so onerous (this year, the judges read 171 novels). At least one high-profile writer who was approached to chair the judges in its birthday year said no. There are even niggling anxieties about the ceremony itself, a grand dinner that is held in the Guildhall, in the City of London, and attended by the Duchess of Cornwall. Last year, most of the invited journalists seemed to have been seated together, far away from any authors, publishers or random celebrities, a move that seemed to many a kind of insult given that publicity, good or bad, continues to be the Booker’s most vigorous engine. Above all, the majority of publishers and many writers and agents remain furious at the trustees’ decision, five years ago, to throw open the prize to any book written in English that is published in Britain – which was a roundabout way of saying that US writers would henceforth be allowed to enter (previously, only novels by Commonwealth and Irish writers were eligible). At an event marking the 50th birthday at the Southbank Centre last July, Peter Carey, who has won the Booker twice, called it an exercise in corporate branding that made no sense to literature; American prizes, he noted, are not open to writers from Australia or Britain. Julian Barnes, another former winner, described the decision as “daft”, pointing out that three of the six shortlisted writers in 2017 were American. Had one of these elbowed out, say, a fine Zimbabwean novel? With only one exception, everyone I speak to feels the same: that something has been lost. “A big, big mistake,” says Carmen Callil, co-founder of Virago books and former managing director of Chatto &amp; Windus. “Its USP has gone,” says a leading agent (this despite the fact that he represents some US authors). “This whole fucking thing about us having such a cultural cringe towards America,” says one publisher. In his view, it is now all but impossible for certain kinds of novel to succeed at the Booker (in four years of being eligible, two Americans have won it, while nine out of a possible 24 authors, have been shortlisted). “The judges seem to favour big, noble, American failures over smaller, quieter, non-American masterpieces.” Another publisher agrees: “It’s hard to imagine, say, an Alan Hollinghurst winning in this landscape.” The irony is that the Booker, according to some of these same people, is now losing ground in the US. “American publishers loved the fact that it brought them writers from other territories,” says one. “They don’t need to be told about Anne Tyler or Paul Auster. They know about them already.” Just to add to the angst, some American agents now reportedly make entry to the Booker prize a condition of the sale of the work of a US author to a British publisher. Given that publishers are allowed only two entries for each imprint (plus the novels of previously shortlisted authors), this would, if true, contribute to a further pushing out of British and Commonwealth writers.Last February, Mark Richards, the publisher at John Murray, and Alex Bowler, then at Granta and now at Faber &amp; Faber, drew up a letter asking the Booker trustees to reconsider their decision; it was signed by 30 publishers, and quietly supported by at least 10 more. The letter warned of a “homogenised literary future” permanently dominated by American writers. Some weeks later, the trustees and the prize’s literary director, Gaby Wood, invited its signatories to a meeting. “It was a bit fractious,” says one publisher who attended. Another admits: “It was, perhaps, a little over-emotional. People talked of authors having been betrayed.” Alexandra Pringle, who runs Bloomsbury, which published George Saunders, the American who won the 2017 prize, spoke passionately of how “a small, Cumbrian writer” would struggle for notice in this new realm. What was the attitude of Wood and the other trustees who attended to this? They were “defensive”. Why were the publishers talking of the prize’s “duty” to authors? It has no duty. Its role is only to reward the best book. If they didn’t like it, they were more than welcome to set up their own prize. Some time after this, a second meeting was held between a smaller number of publishers, Wood and Helena Kennedy, the chair of the trustees. This was more conciliatory, though nothing really changed. “I can’t think of a single publisher who thinks it’s a good idea,” says one trade journalist. “But they’re resigned to it now.” Others are more optimistic: “My hope is that 2020, when Man’s sponsorship comes up for renewal, will provide the obvious moment for a rule change. I get the feeling that some trustees, if not all, are persuadable.” On the committee that advises the board of trustees about such matters – it comprises publishers, agents and critics, as well as, currently, James Daunt, the managing director of Waterstones, and Jonty Claypole, head of arts at the BBC – opinions are mixed. “I don’t think the decision should be reversed,” says one member. “I think that ship has sailed. But I know there are others who disagree.” Where did the decision to include US writers originate? Publishers like to blame the Man Group, and what they regard as its greedy lust for global publicity. But according to one Booker insider, this is not the case. For two years, the trustees looked at the possibility of setting up a new, separate prize in the US; the consultants McKinsey were commissioned to explore this. When it became clear that it wouldn’t be feasible, Peter Mayer, the American former publisher of Penguin Books, and Ed Victor, the London-based American literary agent, suggested the change (both men have since died, as has Ion Trewin, then the literary director of the prize). Ask the Man Group, an investment management company, what it gets out of sponsoring the prize, and the talk is mostly of corporate social responsibility (the Booker prize foundation works in schools and libraries and supports a number of literacy programmes) and the “unique social networking opportunities” it provides for clients (among other things, it takes 200 seats at the award ceremony). However, a spokesperson also tells me that the company regards it as a “brand that we own because we have our name on it”. Is the name Man Booker better known – more written and talked about – in the US since American writers became eligible? It is difficult to say. However, it is worth noting that the percentage rise in sales of books in the US for winners from outside the country dwarfs that of American winners (while Paul Beatty, the American who won in 2016 for The Sellout, only doubled his US sales, Eleanor Catton, the New Zealander whose novel The Luminaries won in 2013, multiplied hers tenfold). To some, of course, all this is just a squall in an inkwell. As Professor John Carey puts it in the BBC’s film, Booker titles seem to many to conform ever more strongly to the bien-pensant tastes of a small, urban coterie, a world so far removed from most bookshelves as to be almost absurd (one thinks of Edward St Aubyn’s 2014 novel Lost for Words, a satire about a prize very like the Booker, in which there appears a judge who is obsessed only with relevance and “consensus-building” and a novelist who writes “like a man walking backwards along a path, erasing his footsteps with a broom”). But while there may be truth in this, if you are of a certain age, and love novels, and didn’t grow up in a family with, say, a subscription to the Times Literary Supplement, it’s impossible not to care about its future. I remember so clearly the first time I saw the winner announced on the BBC: it was Kingsley Amis in 1986, for The Old Devils, who said, eyes popping, that he would spend the prize money on “booze, of course, and curtains”, words I’ve never forgotten. As a teenager, the Booker introduced me to Penelope Lively and Timothy Mo. As a student, it brought me to AS Byatt and Banville. Later on, I read Ahdaf Soueif’s The Map of Love and Mick Jackson’s The Underground Man – beloved books, both – for no other reason at all than because they were on the shortlist. I would love it to seem glamorous and vital again: as widely and passionately talked about as it was in the 80s and 90s. But maybe we’ve simply come, down the years, to expect too much of it. “It’s just one literary prize,” a member of the advisory committee tells me. “Yet expectations of it are totally unrealistic.” People think that it has changed, he says, when really it’s only the world in which it operates that has: “No prize could have the same place as it once did in a culture that is so noisy. Maybe that’s the real reason quieter, more domestic books are losing out; they make less impact anyway.” Or perhaps it has just become too slick, too professional, too boringly 21st century. Last year, hunkered in a corner with my fellow hacks, I looked out across the Guildhall at the massed ranks of sober-seeming guests (no wonder there are fewer punch-ups these days), so many of whose heads were bowed prayerfully over their mobile phones, and thought of Selina Scott’s famous faux pas when she stuck her microphone in the face of Fay Weldon, the chair of the judges in 1983, and asked if she really had read all the books. (This after she had already failed to recognise another judge, Angela Carter.) If I had seen Morrice’s film, I might also have pictured the distinguished biographer Hermione Lee phoning Keri Hulme, the pipe-smoking New Zealander who won for The Bone People in 1985, live from her table at the award dinner to ask how she was feeling (technology being what it was then, we could hear, but not see, the startled author shout the words: “Bloody hell!”). These things, and so many others, would never happen now – and perhaps we’re all the poorer for it.

2018-04-11T05:00:00Z,Post-industrial Plymouth was broke. So it took business into its own hands | Aditya Chakrabortty,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/post-industrial-plymouth-business-social-enterprise,"Looming over one of the poorest parts of Plymouth, which is to say one of the poorest parts of Britain, is a giant graveyard. Its buried are not men and women, but the carcasses of 13 nuclear submarines. Some have been dead for decades, such as the HMS Conqueror, which sank the Belgrano 36 years ago. Nine still have nuclear fuel rods, and there have been repeated leaks of radioactive waste. The Ministry of Defence claims all are safe. Then again, it sometimes doesn’t even disclose breaches until months later, when MPs and journalists have had to winch out the truth. And so the neighbours worry. Some mention the children they send to the primary school next door. Yet the boats are unlikely to be dismantled or moved any time soon. Britain lavishes official attention on the well-off, whether in David Cameron’s old seat of Witney or in Theresa May’s Maidenhead. But down by the docks in the ward of Devonport, over 40% of children grow up in poverty – a depth of disadvantage that arouses from Whitehall little more than a shrug. All this runs true to local history. For nigh-on five decades, Devonport had its own Berlin Wall, with 50 acres of land walled up by the military. Complete with barbed wire running around the top, it was loathed by locals. It was only toppled in 2007. “The navy, the army, the air force: they come in, they do what they want, and take away the bits of the city they want for themselves,” says councillor Chris Penberthy, who grew up near the dockyard. “People do things to Plymouth,” he says. “Plymouth hasn’t often been allowed to do things for itself.” He is referring to the blitz, followed by the imposition of an Abercrombie city plan and the throwing up of shoddy housing. He also means the way in which well-meaning policy experts will today pitch up with some cash and pilot their brainwaves in Devonport and the impoverished west of the city. They come with a grand scheme to deal with household budgeting or child malnutrition and stay for a few months until the money runs out. Then they hurry off. A 60s baby, Penberthy grew up to the smell of Farley’s Rusks baking nearby. It joined Clarks’ shoes on a long rollcall of big local businesses. This is the Plymouth that residents liken to a northern mill town or a Welsh mining village. Just like them, the industry left decades ago. Just like them, it voted for Brexit. Representing the ward next door to Devonport, Penberthy sees ingrained deprivation in one of the richest countries in human history. Primary schools hold “brushing clubs” to help children look after their teeth, and “for some of those kids, aged eight or nine, it’ll be the first time they use a toothbrush”. Ahead of next month’s local elections, women on doorsteps say, “I vote how my husband tells me.” Families ripped off by the benefits office and bilked of desperately-needed cash for their disabled children sigh, “They must be right – they are the government.” What lends this even greater piquancy is Plymouth’s naval history, still celebrated in the breakfast rooms of a hundred lodging houses, with their paintings of Francis Drake on a bowling green. Before the dockyard became a radioactive burial ground, it employed tens of thousands of men. Today that figure is about 2,500. Post-industrial, post-imperial, post-Suez, Plymouth is no ordinary city; it is a place where the furs in which Britain wraps itself are revealed as so many rags. Which makes what it does instead important not just locally but nationally. What it is doing is one of the most intriguing experiments I have seen in any British city. However far from perfect, it shows what can happen when a council tries to shape how business behaves in its backyard. It is what a city doing things for itself looks like. And it starts neither in the council chamber nor the city centre, but in a knackered hall in Devonport. Dotted across Devonport are the grand Regency buildings that remind visitors of its vast previous wealth and pre-1914 status as an independent town. Most imposing of all is the Guildhall, with its massive Doric pillars. By the mid-2000s, it had lain empty for years, being far too large for the now-shrunken local economy. Then, to councillors’ relief, along came a regional group called the Real Ideas Organisation (Rio). “The conversation began, ‘Do you think it needs to be a community centre, a business centre or an arts centre?’” recalls Rio chief executive Lyndsey Hall. “By the end, it was, ‘We don’t care what you do – just take it away.’” With a £1.75m grant, Hall did just that. Today, it’s not just a centre for community or business or arts: it’s all three – and more. “No one’s going to get rich out of running a building like this,” says Hall’s colleague Ed Whitelaw. “Why would any private company want to take it on?” But Hall and Whitelaw don’t run a standard business. Theirs is a social enterprise, a company that uses its profits and assets for public good. Rio derives an income from the Guildhall, but it doesn’t sweat the building for every last penny. To wander around the Guildhall is to see that ethos in action: the main hall with its stained-glass windows has just been vacated by a team of cheerleaders, and is let out for free to community groups. Other social enterprises rent office space and use the basement jail cells as meeting rooms. In the corner is a cafe and bakery. When the council met Rio in the late 2000s, social enterprises were still a novelty. Hall had been inspired by a visit to Toronto and seeing everything from supermarket chains to the giant Harbourfront arts centre operating as community businesses. But in the UK, social enterprises, or community interest companies, were only legally recognised in 2005. A product of fag-end Blairism, they came bearing that ideology’s virtues and vices: a desire to tackle age-old social problems in new ways and a bewildered wonderment at the magic that could somehow be worked by entrepreneurs. That haze hangs over the 2005 act, which establishes a watchdog for the new businesses – but says its “power should be exercised only to the extent necessary to maintain confidence in community interest companies”. As for how exactly communities were to be served by these companies – well, that was usually left for the companies themselves to define. Whether returning £10m or 10p to society – that’s up to them. “Some social enterprises we go, ‘brilliant, fabulous’,” says Rio’s Hall. “Other things named as social enterprises we go, ‘ugh’.” Yet consider the possibilities that a new form of entrepreneurship offers Plymouth, which faces the same huge challenge as numberless towns and cities across Britain and the west: how to get capital and power to stay local. One answer adopted by Chris Penberthy and the other Labour politicians voted in to lead the council in 2012 was to grow a different kind of business. The next year, Plymouth raced Bristol to become the first social enterprise city in the UK. “How do we grow our economy and grow ourselves a future? By finding companies who will do more than corporate social responsibility,” says Penberthy, who was put in charge of growing social enterprise in the city, a post then unknown to local government. “There was a lot of banging desks and ‘Do it now!’” recalls Alistair Macpherson, who worked at the council for years. In another municipal rarity, Penberthy set up a public fund to kickstart new social enterprises. More than largesse or political vision, this was a way for a local authority with dwindling budgets to fill in the gaps that big business wouldn’t touch. Those gaps are not just the dead buildings brought back to life by Rio, which is now at work on a £7m project to turn Devonport’s abandoned market hall into a high-tech centre for virtual reality. They’re also the solar farm that Macpherson built as head of Plymouth Energy Community on contaminated land next door to a bomb dump. And they’re in the city centre’s abandoned shops, such as the one now occupied by Moments Cafe which, as well as selling mugs of tea and ham omelettes, helps dementia sufferers and their carers. Run by nurse Kate Smith, the cafe’s staff has been trained to look out for memory problems or distress among customers. What drew Luke into the cafe was a sign reading “Memory Matters”. It was like a personal message. Last July, surgeons had removed a brain tumour by cutting out part of a lobe, and now he could no longer remember basic things, whether afternoon plans or people’s names. At the till he didn’t ask for a coffee: “I just wanted a number. A number for me to ring to speak about my memory.” Instead, Kate took him upstairs for a quiet chat – then it all came out. How the tumour meant he’d lost his building business and split from the mother of his four-year-old girl. How his head still hurt so much, despite all the heavy-duty meds. The attempts to kill himself. How the council had stuck him in a house-share with two other men, both threatening to beat him up. How he’d run away, with nowhere else to go. “I just bawled my eyes out,” says Luke, and not because of how much trouble he was in. “It was the acceptance from Kate. She listened and understood.” Which made her rare. As Smith says, “The hospital hadn’t lined up any support. The [council] housing officers didn’t twig how badly his memory had been affected.” A sick man with no money and little support had been left to fend for himself. By the time he came into the cafe, he was bedding down on the streets. This was “just before the big snow” a few weeks ago that killed rough sleepers across the country. “You can’t leave him,” Smith remembers thinking to herself. “He’ll die.” So she lobbied council officers, drafted in support from Luke’s doctors, and got him a diary. Flip it open and the pages teem with Smith’s neatly written reminders to visit the hospital, phone the bank. It was a week’s work, reckons Smith. “And the rest,” laughs Luke. It paid off: he is now in a Travelodge while the council sorts out a permanent home. An amazing story, but it leaves you wondering why a just-opened cafe is picking up the pieces dropped by the NHS and the council – and whether tears over coffee and long hours ringing around a civic centre can ever form an actual business model. At the same time, it’s impossible to imagine such stories coming out of the mammoth Costa just a few doors down. Plymouth now has more than 150 social enterprises employing over 7,000 workers earning a combined income of over £500m. For a city of 250,000 people, which only adopted social enterprise five years ago, that’s remarkable growth. Even more surprising is the politics. Political control over Plymouth council changes only slightly less frequently than the tide, yet the Tory administration that took over in 2016 has also encouraged and funded social enterprise. If, as looks likely, Labour returns to power next month, it is committed to doubling the city’s co-operative economy by 2025. With neither side threatening to pull the plug, national charities such as Esmee Fairbairn and Power To Change have the security they need to plough millions into the city’s sector. To see what social enterprise could look like, walk 10 minutes west from Moments Cafe to yet another local graveyard. Once heaving with pubs and clubs, Union Street is now silent and shut. Yet inside The Clipper, once open all hours, Hannah Sloggett and Wendy Hart have plans to open a covered market and turn the two flats above into affordable homes for single fathers who lack the bedrooms for their visiting kids. That idea came from local residents, just as most of the pair’s politics is rooted in local activism. They live minutes away, and as Nudge Community Builders want nine out of every 10 jobs associated with their projects to go to local people and 70% of the money they spend to stay within a mile of the street. Like many others I meet in the city, they mention the Preston model – only the Plymouth equivalent is much more rooted in the private sector. Looking at Hart’s platform trainers and hearing Sloggett happily describe herself as “giggly” tells you a lot about the self-confidence of a sector that’s only been around for a few years, but that is starting to see itself as a direct challenge to the rest of business. I’m reminded of a remark from Rio’s Hall. “There was that moment on television when you’d have Alan Sugar doing The Apprentice and getting people to behave as badly as possible. Then an hour afterwards, it’d be The Secret Millionaire – with all these tycoons making people cry by giving them money out of the goodness of their hearts. “And that’s – that’s just wrong!” Her head crashes into her palms. “Why are we creating a culture where it’s OK to make money behaving as badly as possible in order for people to give it away? That’s the culture we’ve got to change. I don’t care whether it’s called social enterprise, or anything else.” Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the Guardian Additional reporting by Tom Wright",Social enterprises; Plymouth; Small business; Society; Brexit; UK news; Business; Economic policy,Opinion
2018-05-10T06:13:22Z,The spectacular power of Big Lens | The long read,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/10/the-invisible-power-of-big-glasses-eyewear-industry-essilor-luxottica,"If you have been wearing glasses for years, like me, it can be surprising to discover that you perceive the world thanks to a few giant companies that you have never heard of. Worrying about the fraying edge of motorway lights at night, or words that slide on the page, and occasionally spending a fortune at the opticians is, for many of us, enough to think about. And spectacles are unusual things. It is hard to think of another object in our society which is both a medical device that you don’t want and a fashion accessory which you do. Buying them, in my experience anyway, is a fraught, somewhat exciting exercise that starts in a darkened room, where you contemplate the blurred letters and the degeneration of your visual cortex, and ends in a bright, gallery-like space where you enjoy the spry feel of acetate in your fingers, listen to what you are told, pay more than you were expecting to, and look forward to inhabiting a new, slightly sharper version of your existing self. The $100bn (£74bn) eyewear industry is built on feelings such as this. In the trade, the choreography that takes you from the consulting room to the enticing, bare-brick display of £200 frames is known as “romancing the product”. The number of eye tests that turn into sales is the “capture rate”, which most opticians in Britain (or optometrists, as they are known in the rest of the world) set at around 60%. During the 20th century, the eyewear business worked hard to transform a physical deficiency into a statement of style. In the process, optical retailers learned the strange fact that for something that costs only a few pounds to make (even top-of-the-range frames and lenses cost, combined, no more than about £30 to produce), we are happy, happier in fact, when paying 10 or 20 times that amount. “The margins,” as one veteran of the sector told me carefully, “are outrageous.” The co-founder of Specsavers, Mary Perkins, is Britain’s first self-made female billionaire. Almost everyone wears glasses at some point in their lives. In developed countries, the rule of thumb is that around 70% of adults need corrective lenses to see well. In Britain, that translates to some 35 million people. But it’s hardly a topic of national conversation. To the casual observer, the optical market also presents a busy and confusing sight. In Britain, thousands of independent opticians rub alongside a few big retail chains such as Specsavers, Vision Express and Boots. The wall displays in even a small, local optician hold several hundred frames, metal, acetate and rimless, while posters advertise a range of lenses with sciencey-sounding properties – “freeform”, “photo-fusion”, “reflex vision” – and names so bland they are hard to remember even when you are looking straight at them. But what we see masks the underlying structure of the global eyewear business. Over the last generation, just two companies have risen above all the rest to dominate the industry. The lenses in my glasses – and yours too, most likely – are made by Essilor, a French multinational that controls almost half of the world’s prescription lens business and has acquired more than 250 other companies in the past 20 years. There is a good chance, meanwhile, that your frames are made by Luxottica, an Italian company with an unparalleled combination of factories, designer labels and retail outlets. Luxottica pioneered the use of luxury brands in the optical business, and one of the many powerful functions of names such as Ray-Ban (which is owned by Luxottica) or Vogue (which is owned by Luxottica) or Prada (whose glasses are made by Luxottica) or Oliver Peoples (which is owned by Luxottica) or high-street outlets such as LensCrafters, the largest optical retailer in the US (which is owned by Luxottica), or John Lewis Opticians in the UK (which is run by Luxottica), or Sunglass Hut (which is owned by Luxottica) is to make the marketplace feel more varied than it actually is. Between them, Essilor and Luxottica play a central, intimate role in the lives of a remarkable number of people. Around 1.4 billion of us rely on their products to drive to work, read on the beach, follow the whiteboard in biology lessons, type text messages to our grandchildren, land aircraft, watch old movies, write dissertations and glance across restaurants, hoping to look slightly more intelligent and interesting than we actually are. Last year, the two companies had a combined customer base that is somewhere between Apple’s and Facebook’s, but with none of the hassle and scrutiny of being as well known. Now they are becoming one. On 1 March, regulators in the EU and the US gave permission for the world’s largest optical companies to form a single corporation, which will be known as EssilorLuxottica. The new firm will not technically be a monopoly: Essilor currently has around 45% of the prescription lenses market, and Luxottica 25% of the frames. But in seven centuries of spectacles, there has never been anything like it. The new entity will be worth around $50bn (£37bn), sell close to a billion pairs of lenses and frames every year, and have a workforce of more than 140,000 people. EssilorLuxottica intends to dominate what its executives call “the visual experience” for decades to come. The creation of EssilorLuxottica is a big deal. It will have knock-on consequences for opticians and eyewear manufacturers from Hong Kong to Peru. But it is also a response to an unprecedented moment in the story of human vision – namely, the accelerating degradation of our eyes. For several thousand years, human beings have lived in more or less advanced societies, reading, writing and doing business with one another, mostly without the aid of glasses. But that is coming to an end. No one is exactly sure what it is about early 21st-century urban living – the time we spend indoors, the screens, the colour spectrum in LED lighting, or the needs of ageing populations – but the net result is that across the world, we are becoming a species wearing lenses. The need varies depending where you go, because different populations have different genetic predispositions to poor eyesight, but it is there, and growing, and probably greater than you think. In Nigeria, around 90 million people, or half the population, are now thought to need corrective eyewear. There are actually two things going on. The first is a largely unreported global epidemic of myopia, or shortsightedness, which has doubled among young people within a single generation. For a long time, scientists thought myopia was primarily determined by our genes. But about 10 years ago, it became clear that the way children were growing up was harming their eyesight, too. The effect is starkest in east Asia, where myopia has always been more common, but the rate of increase has been uniform, more or less, across the world. In the 1950s, between 10% and 20% of Chinese people were shortsighted. Now, among teenagers and young adults, the proportion is more like 90%. In Seoul, 95% of 19-year-old men are myopic, many of them severely, and at risk of blindness later in life. At the same time, across the developing world, a slower and more complex process is underway, as populations age and urbanise and move indoors to work. The history of eyewear tells us that people do not, as a rule, start wearing glasses because they notice everything has gone a little out of focus. It is in order to take part in new forms of entertainment and labour. The mass market in spectacles did not emerge when they were invented, in 13th-century Italy, but 200 years later, alongside the printed word in Germany, because people wanted to read. In 2018, an estimated 2.5 billion people, mostly in India, Africa and China, are thought to need spectacles, but have no means to have their eyes tested or to buy them. “The visual divide”, as NGOs call it, is one of those vast global shortcomings that suddenly makes sense when you think about it. Across the developing world, straightforward myopia, and presbyopia, the loss of near vision caused by ageing, have been linked with everything from high road deaths to low educational achievement and poor productivity in factories. Eye-health campaigners call it the largest untreated disability in the world. It is also a staggering business opportunity. Essilor and Luxottica know this. It was Essilor that worked out and first publicised the 2.5 billion statistic, in 2012. “For 2,000 years people were living mainly outside,” said Hubert Sagnières, Essilor’s chairman and chief executive, when we met recently in Paris. “Suddenly, we live inside, and we use this.” He tapped his mobile phone on the table. The legal and technical details of the EssilorLuxottica merger will take a few years to iron out, but Sagnières was transparent about its mission: to equip the planet with eyewear over the coming decades. “I am driving a very profitable company,” Sagnières told me. “You know, between 2020 and 2050, governments will not solve all the problems of the world.” The looming power of EssilorLuxottica is the subject of morbid obsession within the eyewear world. Everyone knows the new company is poised to have a profound impact on the way that we are going to see. “Forgive me,” said one longtime entrepreneur in the sector. “But it is nothing short of control of the industry.” One investor described the new corporation as a “category killer”. In many conversations, people described its arrival, which would have been genuinely unthinkable a generation ago, as both extraordinary and somehow inevitable at the same time. That struck me as the kind of contradiction you come across more often in a person than in a business. And it is true of EssilorLuxottica and, to some extent, the business of vision itself, because it is – to an amazing degree – the legacy of a single man. * * * Leonardo Del Vecchio is the patron, legend and haunting spirit of the global eyewear business. He is its Citizen Kane and its Captain Ahab. His father died before he was born; his mother was poor; and he was raised in an orphanage in wartime Milan, where he went out to work as a metal engraver at the age of 14. In 1961, Del Vecchio opened a workshop in the town of Agordo, in the Dolomite mountains. He was 25, and starting out on his own. The valley around Agordo was emptying out because of the closure of a mine, and the town was giving away land to companies that were willing to move there. Del Vecchio asked for 3,000 sq metres on the riverbank to build a factory to make parts for spectacles. He had a young family, and in time, he built a house next door to the workshop so he could step from one to the other, starting his day at 3am. Over the next half century, Del Vecchio grew his company, which was called Luxottica, into the world’s greatest maker of glasses frames. In an industry that was traditionally fragmented and small-scale, the totality of Del Vecchio’s ambition took his rivals by surprise. He sought to control every element in the business, from the metal alloys of the hinges to the stores where eyewear is sold. “Never assume that you have arrived, or look at the world as your only point of reference,” he liked to say. In a series of audacious takeovers, Del Vecchio acquired brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley and Persol, and signed contracts with fashion houses such as Armani, Ralph Lauren and Chanel. He built factories in China, acquired vision insurance schemes in the US and retail chains on four continents. Since 1994, Del Vecchio has been Italy’s highest individual taxpayer and the country’s second-richest man. A few years ago, people thought his career had run its course. But in January 2017, at the age of 81, Del Vecchio announced the greatest deal of his life, in which he also secured the final missing part for his frames – the lenses – when Luxottica agreed to merge with Essilor. “He wants to do this merger,” a former colleague said, “thinking he will leave behind this great company that will last for 100 years.” When I arrived in Agordo one recent afternoon, it was thinking about starting to snow. The town rests among steep wooded hills and the bare grey sides of mountains. The blue buildings of the Luxottica factory, with Del Vecchio’s house still standing by the entrance, glowed across the river. Although the plant is now merely one of the company’s 12 frame manufacturing facilities, which stretch from São Paulo in Brazil to Dongguan in southern China, the founding in Agordo remains Luxottica’s organising myth. Every year, Del Vecchio hosts a Christmas dinner for the plant’s 4,500 workers (the town of Agordo has a population of 4,000), which is entertained by an Italian pop star of his choosing. “People are screaming and crying when he comes in,” said Giorgio Striano, Luxottica’s chief operating officer. In Agordo, Del Vecchio is referred to as simply, “Il Presidente”. For the company’s 30th anniversary, in 1991, Del Vecchio renovated some 15th-century stables in the middle of Agordo and opened a private glasses museum. The curator, Caterina Francavilla, who is the daughter of Del Vecchio’s longtime deputy, showed me round before she closed up for the day. The first glasses were almost certainly made in northern Italy in the last decades of the 13th century. (Lenses are called lenses because they looked like lentils.) But for centuries after their invention, spectacles and other magnifying lenses were mostly rejected by medical men, who warned of their unnaturalness and recommended potions to correct people’s eyesight instead. In The Perfect Oculist, of 1666, Robert Turner, a London doctor, recommended turtle’s blood and the powdered head of a bat for the treatment of squints. For weak eyesight, you might try wearing cow’s eyes around your neck. The cabinets in Del Vecchio’s museum traced the evolution from the leather frames and hinged bridges of the middle ages to the gold rims of the 19th century. There were opera glasses designed by Napoleon for his Polish mistress, Maria Walewska; a pair of Emperor Franz Joseph’s spectacles; and some pink “occhiali appartenenti a Elton John.” No one knows why it took 400 years to put the arms on glasses – which are known as temples, and were pioneered in London in the early 18th century – so they finally sat comfortably on people’s ears. To mark another historic milestone, one cabinet also held a copy of Luxottica’s slender debut catalogue, from 1971, when the company made its first complete frames. On a shelf near the door of the museum, I spotted A Man Who Sees Far, an official Luxottica biography of Del Vecchio, which was published in 1991. I expected the optical world to be genteel and polite, and was taken aback whenever conversations turned to the personal charisma, and menace, of Del Vecchio. “He’s the godfather,” said Dean Butler, who founded LensCrafters in 1983. (Del Vecchio bought it in 1995.) “The godfather, to me, is the guy. He runs it.” One former senior Luxottica executive told me: “Honestly, he kind of rules by fear.” Very few opticians would even mention Del Vecchio’s name – lending him a Voldemort-like aura – for fear of offending him, however unlikely that might be. One talked about “getting a horse’s head in the bed”. Another concluded our interview by saying: “You can quote me as long as it sounds like I am sucking Del Vecchio’s dick.” I took A Man Who Sees Far back to my hotel. Even in the company’s hagiography, Del Vecchio comes across as improbably driven and unfeeling. The biographer struggles to get a few words with Il Presidente as he crosses the tarmac to his private jet. (Del Vecchio rarely gives interviews; he declined to speak to me.) “There were no kisses, no cuddles,” his eldest daughter, Marisa, recalls in the book. “Frankly, we were scared of him.” * * * Del Vecchio built the empire of Luxottica on two ideas. The first was to do everything itself. After the company’s initial progression from parts to frames in the early 1970s, it set out, step by step, to control the entire process of making and selling glasses, from acquiring the raw materials to selling its own products in its own stores. No one had done this before Del Vecchio. “There is a simplicity to him,” one former colleague told me. “To him it is a very simple equation: I make the best stuff, why doesn’t everybody buy it?” For the first 25 years, Luxottica stayed on the wholesale side of the industry – “behind the curtain”, as it is known – selling its glasses through opticians to the public. In the 1990s, however, Del Vecchio decided he wanted a retail network too. First, he got Luxottica listed on the New York stock exchange, an almost-unheard of move for a mid-sized Italian business. “A lot of big experts said it was impossible,” said Roberto Chemello, the chief executive at the time. Luxottica later estimated the listing to have been worth around $100m in advertising in the US – and it laid the ground for Del Vecchio’s hostile takeover of US Shoe, a conglomerate that owned LensCrafters, the country’s largest optical chain, in 1995. On paper, the deal appeared outlandish. US Shoe was five times larger than Luxottica, and its board did not want to sell. Having its own shops would also put Luxottica in direct competition with the thousands of optometrists it had been supplying for decades. “You have to be not only courageous,” said Chemello, of the transaction, “but a little bit crazy.” Luxottica bought US Shoe for $1.4bn. Once the deal was done, Del Vecchio promptly broke up US Shoe, whose roots went back to 1879, until all that was left were the LensCrafters stores that he wanted in the first place, which he proceeded to fill with Luxottica frames. “That is exactly the formula they have used ever since,” said Jeff Cole, the former chief executive of Cole National Corporation, an even larger optical retailer that sold out to Luxottica in 2004. “When they buy a company, they spend a little time figuring it out and kick out all the other suppliers.” The formula means that when you or I walk into a LensCrafters, or a Sunglass Hut, or a David Clulow, or an Óticas Carol (which has 950 branches in Brazil) or a Xueliang Glasses in Shanghai, or a Ming Long store in Hong Kong, around 80% of the frames on display will be made by Luxottica. Having its own designers, engineers, factories, supply depots and retail outlets – Luxottica currently has almost 9,000 stores and contracts with a further 100,000 opticians around the world – means it can bring products to market faster and in greater quantities than any of its rivals. It also keeps a larger proportion of its profits as a result. In the factory in Agordo, I saw dual-armed robots pinning together the front and temples of Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and basket after basket of metal frames being dunked in a series of chemical baths to coat and colour them. Glasses may appear to be relatively simple objects, but they involve between 180 and 230 manufacturing stages to produce. With its own designers, lasers and massive, quietly humming machines, Luxottica can take a pencil sketch to global production in about three weeks. “We are in a closed loop,” said Striano, the operations chief. Taking into account all the different colours and face shapes (Japanese noses are not the same as Latino noses), Luxottica has around 27,000 models in production at any one time. Its plants turn out 400,000 pairs of frames per day. I asked Striano if any other company came close. “I think nobody,” he said. Del Vecchio’s second great insight is the one that changed the nature of the optical business – and that was to combine it with the fashion industry. Although designers such as Pierre Cardin and Christian Dior had been experimenting with frames since the 1960s, Del Vecchio saw a way to take their ideas, and more importantly, their labels, to a mass market. In 1988, he signed a licensing deal with Giorgio Armani, another self-made tycoon, who had started out as a window-dresser at a department store in Milan. The deal transformed the glasses game. Until then, consumers in Europe and America who wanted fancy spectacles had to rely on staid, industry names such as Zeiss, Rodenstock or Silhouette. After the Armani deal, they could buy Prada, Gucci and Chanel, and they were willing to pay for it. “It created something,” as one Luxottica manager artfully told me, “to make the needs where probably they are not.” By the early 1990s, Luxottica salesmen supplying opticians in the City of London were making so much money that they were using chauffeurs to get around. (Armani himself has sat on the board of Luxottica, and owns a 5% stake in it.) In early 2018, Luxottica has around 30 brands, including some that it owns outright, such as Ray-Ban and Persol, or that it produces under licence (Michael Kors, Paul Smith, DKNY, Burberry and so on). People in the industry observe that taste in frames follows a roughly 30-year cycle, from metal, to rimless, to acetate and back again, in which familiar spectacle shapes recur and then disappear. The trend right now is towards metal, and designs that last flowered in Ronald Reagan’s America. In the “Style Area” in Agordo, on the factory’s first floor, I met Mario Mollo, a senior product manager. “You see now the 80s is becoming very popular,” he said. “You see shallow, very wide.” Mollo was poring over a desk of large-scale drawings of a new acetate frame for Oliver Peoples, named “Leonardo”. Spectacle frames require a thousand barely noticeable design decisions, around the shape of the bridge, the thickness below the eyes, or the pantoscopic tilt (how the angle of the lens meets the front of your cornea). The Leonardo had an unusual temple, in which a curving piece of wire had to be sandwiched between two pieces of acetate. “Sometimes this one is not easy to find the right bending,” said Mollo, tracing his finger along the drawing. Like every other senior Luxottica figure I met in Agordo, Mollo was Italian, male, dressed in cashmere, and wearing a pair of the company’s frames. On a workbench a few feet away, there was a pair of €4,000 (£3,500) Dolce &amp; Gabbana sunglasses that were hand-painted in Sicily, made out of wood and looked like a carnival float. “With sun, you can go totally crazy,” said Mollo. Luxottica had made only 100 for the entire world. “Crazy,” said Mollo, “but sold out.” The transformation of glasses from a medical device to a means of self-expression, like clothes or sneakers, has been a source of joy for millions of people. But it has also obscured their original purpose, and complicated efforts to distribute them as easily as, say, mosquito nets or aspirin. When I mentioned this to Mollo, he recalled a recent trip he had taken with Luxottica’s corporate social responsibility programme, conducting eye tests and distributing glasses in rural China. “They were so happy having the possibility to see. They were hugging us. It was really not for fashion,” he said. “Then they started, you know, looking at themselves,” – Mollo paused for a second – “and the fashion moment arrived.” The fusion of the fashion industry and the optical business is now regarded as complete. Until recently, eye-health charities and campaigners used to distribute thousands of pairs of secondhand glasses from richer countries to poorer populations that lacked them. In 2011, the World Health Organization advised them to stop – in part because people were refusing to wear outdated styles. “Being poor doesn’t mean we want to look stupid, you know,” Prof Kovin Naidoo, who runs the Brien Holden Institute, one of the world’s leading eye-health NGOs, told me. My last stop in Agordo was Luxottica’s sample room, a broad, quiet, carpeted space looking out over the river. The room contains every current Luxottica design, arranged on various tables and ranked in order of sales. The system has been in place since the plant was built in 1972, and during that time, it has been the domain of Luigi Francavilla, Luxottica’s deputy chairman, who is now in his early 80s. “Glasses are beautiful,” he said, pausing among the hierarchies of Ralph Lauren, Valentino and Bulgari models. “Especially the ones that sell the most.” It was snowing outside and Francavilla was wearing a thick blue cardigan. One of the first things he did was to take my glasses off my face to identify the tortoiseshell acetate, which is known as Havana. His own glasses were a pair of rimless Ray-Bans with pink carbon-fibre temples. Luxottica bought Ray-Ban from Bausch &amp; Lomb, one of the 20th century’s great optical companies, in 1999. At the time, the label was washed up. You could buy a pair of Aviators at a petrol station for $19 (£14). “It was a train smash,” a former senior Luxottica executive told me. “They were selling Wayfarers at Walmart.” Del Vecchio paid $645m (£476m) for Ray-Ban. During the negotiations, he promised to protect thousands of jobs at four factories in the US and Ireland. Three months later, he closed the plants and shifted production to China and Italy. Over the next year and a half, Luxottica withdrew Ray-Ban from 13,000 retail outlets, hiked their prices and radically improved the quality: increasing the layers of lacquer on a pair of Wayfarers from two to 31. In 2004, to the disbelief of many of his subordinates, del Vecchio decided that Ray-Ban, which had been invented for American pilots in the 1930s, should branch out from sunglasses into optical lenses, too. “A lot of us were sceptical. Really? Ray. Ban. Banning rays from the sun?” the former manager said. “But he was right.” Ray-Ban is now the most valuable optical brand in the world. It generates more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in sales for Luxottica each year, and is thought to account for as much as 40% of its profits. Francavilla joined the company in 1968. I asked him how a man with a small spectacles workshop in the Dolomites had come to bestride the global eyewear industry. “L’appetito cresce con il mangiare,” said Francavilla. The appetite grows with eating. * * * How did just two companies – one in frames, and one in lenses – come to dominate something as generic, as obvious, as glasses? It’s almost as if the world had one manufacturer for pens, and another for ink. The conditions that have allowed for the rise of Essilor and Luxottica are rooted, deep down, in the way spectacles are sold. Until the end of the 19th century, you could buy a cheap pair of glasses – for reading or for distance – out of a rack in Woolworth’s, or from a jewellery shop, or a guy in the street. Eyewear was a craft of tinkerers and inventors. “I this evening did buy me a pair of green spectacles,” Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on Christmas Eve 1666, “to see whether they will help my eyes or no.” (They didn’t; Pepys’ failing eyesight forced him to give up his journal three years later.) It was the birth of the optometry profession, around 1900, that changed things. This was a new breed of sober, respectable spectacle-sellers – not unlike pharmacists – who wanted to standardise eye tests and to restrict the sale of glasses to licensed professionals. Their aim, for the most part, was to raise standards. Eyeglass pedlars in the 18th and 19th centuries were notorious for scams and faulty lenses. But there was also another compelling reason to take a cheap, widely available product and put it in the hands of a few authorised sellers – and that was to make money. The first opticians had a tough time of it. They were disdained by ophthalmologists – proper eye doctors, who had trained in hospitals and considered themselves above the tawdry trade in glasses. The first optometry course in the US was taught at Columbia University’s physics department because it was not allowed inside the medical school. (A remnant of this prejudice still holds: within the optical industry, optometrists are always being teased for their chippiness and self-importance. “One step above dermatology,” a former Luxottica executive sniped to me). But the new professionals persevered and, in a way, the story of optometry for much of the 20th century was of finding new ways to protect their patch. Across Europe and in the US, optometry laws and regulations were passed to control the prescription and selling of eyewear. Many of these had a “doctorly” aspect, but they also had the effect of creating a highly opaque marketplace. For a long time, opticians fought all forms of advertising, for example, which might force them to spell out their prices and allow customers to shop around. In some places, this reached ridiculous extremes: in Kentucky, for a time, optometrists’ signs could not be more than four inches high. Under Britain’s Opticians Act of 1958, the display of prices was banned altogether, which meant that opticians were more or less free to make them up on the spot. “The price would come from a little black book,” one veteran practitioner told me. “There was a lot of sharp practice around.” Limiting the number of glasses sellers gave the largest optical manufacturers opportunities to try and corner the market. As early as 1923, the US government was investigating a scam to fix prices of the nation’s best-selling Kryptok bifocal lenses. After the second world war, investigators at the US Department of Justice uncovered a vast kickback scheme – thought to amount to $35m a year, and to involve some 3,000 eye doctors – in which the American Optical Company and Bausch &amp; Lomb effectively bribed practitioners to prescribe their lenses. In 1966, after another scandal, the two companies, which at one time manufactured around 60% of the glasses sold in the US, were banned from opening new retail and wholesale outlets for 20 years. This was when Essilor came on the scene. In 1972, Essel and Silor, two French optical companies, merged and began sell aggressively into the US market. Essilor specialised in plastic lenses, which were replacing glass, and it also had a magical product: “Varilux”, the world’s first progressive lens, invented by an Essel engineer named Bernard Maitenaz in 1959. Progressive lenses allow people who are both long- and shortsighted – typically older customers – to combine their prescriptions into a single, graduated lens. The early Varilux models were experimental and not everyone could adapt to them, but they were probably the most important innovation in eyewear since the invention of bifocals around the time of the French revolution. The company set out to make sure that Varilux and the rest of its products (Essilor’s current sales manual runs to around 400 pages) were sold in every optometrist in the world. Lenses are the pixie dust of the optical business. Barely anyone knows what they are made of, how they are constructed and, especially at the high end, exactly how they work. For the last half century, persuading opticians to prescribe Essilor, as opposed to Hoya or Zeiss, the company’s main rivals, has been painstaking, face-to-face work. One British optician, who stocks Essilor, described it to me this way: “Is there a difference between an Audi, a BMW or a Mercedes? Probably not. But you prefer that badge to that badge, or the way they win hearts and minds.” For years, the company has brought opticians to Paris and its Essilor Academy, where they are wined and dined and taught about its latest products. “It’s not really bribes; it’s the way it works,” one industry veteran told me. And when all else fails, Essilor – like its rivals, and like all wholesalers – uses financial incentives to keep its customers satisfied. Opticians and industry analysts that I spoke to for this article described how Essilor uses so-called “spiff money” – offering stores large, multi-year discounts and cash bonuses for selling its products – in order to squeeze out the competition. “Essilor wants to dominate this industry worldwide,” one retailer told me. “They are actually a well run company. They are not a ruthless company. But they get away with all this crap which in any other industry would be anti-consumer.” The arrangement suits Essilor and its clients pretty well. The profit margins within the optical business are a closely guarded secret, but insiders explained to me that while opticians might sell frames for two, or two and a half times, their wholesale price, it is the lenses where they make the most money, charging markups of 700% or 800% to their customers. The largest margins of all are on complex progressive lenses and protective coatings – for scratch resistance, or to cut out blue light – features that cost Essilor a few cents to make, and which opticians sell for between £25 and £50 a pop. Even Luxottica executives are awed by this. “Ray-Ban did a good job of saying Ray-Ban would cost $150, £150, €150 and the equivalent across the world. A little bit like the Big Mac, right?” one former marketing manager told me. “But lenses? Nobody knows how much lenses cost. The consumers don’t know. Nobody knows.” Some opticians call Essilor “The Big E”. The company boasts of supplying between 300,000 and 400,000 stores around the world – three or four times as many as Luxottica. “The strategy has to be absolutely global,” Sagnières, the chief executive, told me. “Not just for the rich or poor.” The company has not restricted itself to lenses by any means. If Luxottica has spent the last quarter of a century buying up the most conspicuous elements of the optical business (the frames, the brands and the high-street chains) then Essilor has busied itself in the invisible parts, acquiring lens manufacturers, instrument makers, prescription labs (where glasses are put together) and the science of sight itself. The company holds more than 8,000 patents and funds university ophthalmology chairs around the world. In deals that rarely make the business pages, Essilor buys up Belgian optical laboratories, Chinese resin manufacturers, Israeli instrument makers and British e-commerce websites. You can find threads on optometrist message boards with headings like “Essilor Has Purchased and Now Owns (Insert Company Name Here)”, which attempt to record all the independent lens makers and laboratories that used to exist. Within the industry, the Big E is generally considered less rapacious than Del Vecchio’s Luxottica; people regard it instead as a kind of unstoppable, enveloping tide. * * * The first rumours, imaginings really, of the two companies joining forces began more than a decade ago. The idea has an intuitive appeal – the satisfying click of lenses with frames – but there were considerable obstacles. The first was cultural. Essilor might be huge, but it has retained the feel of a traditional, French industrial enterprise: 55% of its employees are shareholders of the company. Luxottica, on the other hand, functioned more or less like a monarchy, with none of the management structures of most multibillion-dollar companies. “The corporate governance and headquarters of Luxottica were Mr Del Vecchio’s dining-room table,” one former manager in the US business recalled of the early 2000s. “We would fly to Italy, go to his house, show him our annual plan … He was like, ‘Go do that again.’” The companies saw themselves differently too. “I think Essilor, while not a model company by any means, has a moral purpose,” the former manager said. “With Luxottica, it’s just lip service. It is all about domination.” The most infamous Luxottica deals carried an edge of brutality. In 2001, the company clashed with Oakley, the world’s hottest make of sunglasses at the time. Luxottica had just bought Sunglass Hut, which sold a third of the US’s sunglasses, and Del Vecchio demanded that all its suppliers drop their prices. Oakley refused. In the summer of 2001, the company’s founder Jim Jannard flew to Milan to meet Del Vecchio and strike a deal. Jannard had founded Oakley out of the back of his car in 1975. According to Forbes magazine, at the end of their conversation, he said he hoped the two men would one day be friends. “We will never be friends,” Del Vecchio reportedly replied. A few months later, Il Presidente swung into action. In November, Sunglass Hut stopped selling Oakleys. The chain made up around a quarter of Oakley’s business and its share price fell by 37%. Then Luxottica began to produce Ray-Bans with bright blue and green lenses that were eerily similar to Oakley’s trademark “Ice” and “Emerald” coloured shades. “We were doing stuff like creating fake Oakleys,” a former Luxottica executive who was involved in the strategy told me. “There was a kind of war going on.” After Oakley sued in 2001, Luxottica issued a statement “denying the allegations in Oakley’s complaint in all material respects” and the case was settled out of court. But Luxottica won the war, buying Jannard’s company for $2.1bn (£1.5bn) in 2007. By that time, Del Vecchio appeared ready to retire. In the summer of 2004, as he approached his 70th birthday, Luxottica’s founder handed over day-to-day control of the company to Andrea Guerra, a young chief executive he hired from Indesit, the Italian white goods company. Under Guerra, Luxottica rationalised its manufacturing, shifting more production to China. It also became more stable and predictable. The share price trebled. But according to several former executives who were close to Guerra, he was opposed to any deal with Essilor, seeing the company as a long-term rival. (Guerra declined to speak with me). “He did not want to merge with Essilor,” a colleague said. “He wanted to protect us in a different way.” In 2014, however, Del Vecchio came back to work. He was 79. “We were all pretty shocked,” a former senior Italian executive told me. But it became clear that Del Vecchio was worried about what would happen to Luxottica when he dies. “His most precious child is this company,” the US manager told me. Del Vecchio has six children from four marriages to three women (he remarried his second wife, Nicoletta Zampillo, in 2010) but he has always insisted they will never succeed him. According to several senior figures at Luxottica, Del Vecchio came to believe that folding Luxottica into Essilor was the best way for his work to endure, and informal talks between the two companies began. In many ways, the final chapter of Del Vecchio’s rule at Luxottica has been chaotic and disorienting. Guerra was soon forced out. After that, Del Vecchio went through four chief executives in three years. In his early 80s, he is no longer the force that he once was. Subordinates told me that Del Vecchio can no longer work a full week and sometimes loses his place in meetings, while demanding to sign off on decisions as small as the floor-plans of new Luxottica stores. Dozens of senior managers have left. “He really doesn’t trust anyone,” one told me. But throughout his shaky return, Del Vecchio kept his eyes on the prize, meeting in secret with Sagnières, the CEO and chairman of Essilor, until, by the summer of 2016, Sagnières said, “it was obvious” that the deal would go ahead. When the two men announced the formation of the combined company on 16 January last year in a call to investors, Del Vecchio’s voice came on the line. “I’m very pleased to be here with you today,” he said, “to present the achievement of a lifetime dream.” * * * Over the coming decades, EssilorLuxottica will have the power to decide how billions of people will see, and what they can expect to pay for it. Public health systems are always likely to have more urgent problems than poor eyesight: until 2008, the World Health Organization did not measure rates of myopia and presbyopia at all. The combined company can choose to interpret its mission more or less however it wants. It could share new technologies, screen populations for eye problems and flood the world with good-quality, affordable eyewear; or it could use its commercial dominance to choke supply, jack up prices and make billions. It could go either way. Right now it is EssilorLuxottica’s putative rivals in developed markets, such as the US and Europe, that are most anxious about the power of the new company. In January, Doug Perkins, the other co-founder of Specsavers, warned that EssilorLuxottica was “throwing hundreds of millions of pounds” at new technologies, such as automated optometry kiosks and online retailing, that threaten the future of Britain’s high-street opticians altogether. “That is 100% certain to happen,” said Perkins. The bigger picture takes a moment to discern. Late last year, I visited Britain’s most important optical collection, which is kept in the basement of the College of Optometrists, a townhouse around the corner from Charing Cross Station. For the last 19 years, Neil Handley, the college’s historian, has been cataloguing 27,000 items donated by opticians and eyewear manufacturers, discovering the story of the industry as he goes along. “It’s under the radar,” he said. “It’s not something that is talked about.” When I asked Handley about the creation of EssilorLuxottica, he pointed to an old display of British spectacle parts, made by a firm called Hadley in Surrey in the 1930s. Until the 1970s, and the rise of cheap manufacturing in China, Britain used to have hundreds of frame-makers up and down the country.Today it has four. “What you are seeing is a potential monopoly, and the risk that brings,” said Handley. While it’s easy to fixate on the brands and the profits of the giants of the optical sector, the industry as a whole must expand dramatically in order to serve the world’s growing, ageing populations and increasing myopia among the young. “The danger is if their proposed answer to these problems turns out not to be the answer,” said Handley. “They have stifled all opposition, and so nobody else has the chance to come up with the right answer.” The stakes are highest in parts of the world that currently do not have anything like enough access to eyewear – what the industry calls the “white spaces” of Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia. “It is always better if there is more diversity in the market, and less dominance,” said Prof Naidoo, of the Brien Holden Institute, about the impact of the merger. “I don’t think anyone can argue with that.” In 2013, Naidoo was one of the authors on a groundbreaking paper that forecast that half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050 – almost 5 billion people. In the course of a single generation, across the world, from Inuit communities in Alaska to secondary-school students in Northern Ireland, researchers have recorded a rough doubling in the number of people who become short-sighted as children. The main reason, as far as anyone can agree, is a reduction in the time that they spend outdoors. Sunlight helps to moderate levels of dopamine, which in turn influence the development of the eye. Too much dopamine means eyeballs grow too long, and become oblong in shape, focusing light in front of the retina, rather than on it. Vision campaigners forecast that the myopia epidemic will put enormous strain on health systems across the developing world, which are already unable to equip their populations with a medical device that has been around since the Middle Ages. “We are barely managing in healthcare systems to provide eyecare,” said Naidoo. He corrected himself. “Not barely. We are not managing. Can you imagine, when those numbers are doubling and tripling, what is going to happen?” Naidoo was reluctant to criticise EssilorLuxottica, however. In part that is because Essilor is the world’s leading commercial funder of research into eye health, and a prominent force in improving access to corrective lenses. (Naidoo sits on the board of the company’s Vision Impact Institute in Paris.) Essilor’s €200m R&amp;D budget is three times the size of the rest of the industry combined, and it has a division called 2.5 New Vision Generation, named for the 2.5 billion people who currently need glasses but don’t have them. The company is investing in schemes such as mobile optometry, putting eye-health workers on motorbikes in Indonesia; at network of around 4,000 village-level optical stores in India; door-to-door salespeople in the favelas in Brazil; and working with the Liberian health system to get its products to what it calls the “base of the pyramid”. Last month, Essilor pledged to provide 200m pairs of free ophthalmic lenses to the estimated 900 million people living in the Commonwealth without access to glasses. In some of the least-served markets in the world, Essilor is more or less the only game in town. In 2016, the company opened an office in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country of 78 million people and 200 optical stores. Last year, Essilor acquired a prescription laboratory in Ethiopia, which currently has roughly one ophthalmologist for every million people. (In European countries, the ratio is about a hundred times smaller.) In places like these, all that eye-health campaigners can do is watch, and hope. “If the merged organisation decreases that investment, that will be a tragedy,” said Naidoo. “And that risk is there, you know. We can just hope that the merged organisation will see there is an opportunity to grow more, rather than less.” No one at Luxottica was willing to speak in detail about its plans for the merged company. It was a different story when I visited Essilor’s global headquarters, which is on a quiet street of apartment blocks in Charenton-le-Pont, in south-east Paris. The company’s senior executives are, as a rule, noticeably more nerdy and less well-dressed than their Italian counterparts, but they are much more comfortable in their role as titans of the global optical industry. Sagnières, the company’s 62-year-old chief executive and chairman, had the guileless glee of a high-school geography teacher whose class had just aced their exams. “I won!” he said, describing the deal with Luxottica. “Anything can happen. I won already. You won. Your kids won! Seriously, this is how it is.” Sagnières told me that the company has calculated – on the basis that a simple pair of glasses costs €5 – that the world can be supplied with eyewear for around €500m a year for the next 30 years. Just as importantly, any investment that EssilorLuxottica ploughs into the bottom end of the market is likely to pay off in the end. “We know that in three or five or 10 years, one day their life will have changed that much that they will afford to pay $50 for a better lens or $50 for branded frames,” said Sagnières. “I am fine with that.” A few days later, I visited one of Essilor’s research facilities in a former lens factory in Créteil, on the southern edge of the city. In a room full of brightly coloured furniture and signs that said things like “How can boomers enjoy their vision in all light conditions?” I met Dr Norbert Gorny, the company’s head of R&amp;D. Gorny is a tall, direct, German veteran of the optical scene, who explained that Essilor has spent much of the last decade expanding what it calls “the acuity corridor” on its progressive lenses, to help people read digital devices as they move around, compared to the more static way we used to read books and newspapers. But the company is increasingly keen to reach what it calls its “Next Generation Consumers” – people in the developing world who don’t wear glasses yet. Gorny called them “The Uncorrected”. “We do things for the 2.5 billion uncorrected,” he said. “But we also do things for people’s needs that are not already expressed.” During the afternoon, he showed me rooms where researchers put on motion sensors, as if they are in a Hollywood studio, to measure the depth of vision required for everyday tasks. Gorny also talked teasingly about new lenses that the company is developing with unnamed tech companies to supersede Google’s failed “Google glass” project of a decade ago. This time around, the idea is to project information from the internet – maps, messages, and Twitter, I suppose – directly on to the back of people’s eyes. “You can read easily – always sharp – information about where to go, the email that you did not want to miss,” said Gorny. “I leave it to your fantasy.” In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson’s book about innovation, he describes the crude reading lenses of medieval Europe as the first piece of technology “since the invention of clothing in Neolithic times, that ordinary people would regularly wear on their bodies.” It was possible, listening to Gorny and thinking of the teenagers of Seoul, urbanising populations in Africa, and people walking through European cities with their eyes fixed to their phones, to imagine a point where more or less the whole of humanity is watching the world through intermediating screens on their eyes. I asked Gorny whether he thought the 21st century, with its demographic changes, myopia epidemic and urge for digital information, would bring about a second optical revolution, in the manner of Germany’s printing presses in the 15th century. Will EssilorLuxottica become the Facebook of seeing? “I don’t know whether we are starting a revolution, witnessing a major change like we witnessed 500 years ago,” Gorny said. “What I believe is we are in the right industry at the right time.” The question is whether there is anyone, beyond its shareholders, that will be able to hold EssilorLuxottica to account. I’m not sure there is. The next few years might be rocky, as the new company grapples with its size and attempts to find a new leader who can define the corporation and its ultimate goals under the fading shadow of Del Vecchio. But after that, the field is open and the fundamentals are clear. On my way back to London, Gorny gave me a lift to the station. “There is nothing close to that firepower once the combination is done,” he said. “You have the global footprint. You can play all the courts.” And I thought about how one of the telling aspects of wearing glasses is that they help you notice everything else – and for the most part, see the world as it actually is – but it is only occasionally, through a chance reflection, or when you really take a moment to stop and look, that you see what is sitting on the top of your nose.

2018-08-14T05:00:51Z,BDS: how a controversial non-violent movement has transformed the Israeli-Palestinian debate,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/14/bds-boycott-divestment-sanctions-movement-transformed-israeli-palestinian-debate,"The movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel – known as BDS – has been driving the world a little bit mad. Since its founding 13 years ago, it has acquired nearly as many enemies as the Israelis and Palestinians combined. It has hindered the efforts of Arab states to fully break their own decades-old boycott in pursuit of increasingly overt cooperation with Israel. It has shamed the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah by denouncing its security and economic collaboration with Israel’s army and military administration. It has annoyed the Palestine Liberation Organization by encroaching on its position as the internationally recognised advocate and representative of Palestinians worldwide. It has infuriated the Israeli government by trying to turn it into a leper among liberals and progressives. It has exasperated what is left of the Israeli peace camp by nudging the Palestinians away from an anti-occupation struggle and towards an anti-apartheid one. It has induced such an anti-democratic counter-campaign by the Israeli government that it has made Israeli liberals fear for the future of their country. And it has caused major headaches for the Palestinians’ donor governments in Europe, which are pressured by Israel not to work with BDS-supporting organisations in the Palestinian territories, an impossible request given that nearly all major civil society groups in Gaza and the West Bank support the movement. In an era of corporate social responsibility, BDS has given bad publicity to major businesses tied up in Israel’s occupation (Airbnb, Re/Max, HP) and helped push other large firms out of the West Bank. It has disrupted film festivals, concerts and exhibitions around the world. It has riled academic and sports organisations by politicising them, demanding that they take a stand on the highly divisive conflict. It has angered Palestinian performers and artists who work with Israeli institutions, accusing them of giving Palestinian cover for Israel’s human rights violations. In the UK, BDS has brought turmoil to courts and local councils, embroiling them in disputes over the legality of local boycotts of settlement goods. In the US, BDS has caused two dozen states to pass bills or issue orders inhibiting or penalising those boycotting Israel or its settlements, pitting Israel’s allies against free speech advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union. It has ignited debates in Protestant churches in the US, some of the largest of which have divested from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation. It has become the bane of college administrators, forced to adjudicate complaints from BDS-supporting professors and students that their free speech has been stifled, and claims by Zionist faculty, donors and undergraduates that their campuses have become “unsafe” spaces. It has pulled liberals toward greater support for the Palestinians, making Israel an increasingly partisan issue in the US, associated less with Democrats and progressives than with Trump, evangelicals and the far right. In the Jewish diaspora, BDS has created new schisms on the centre-left, which has been forced into a vice by the rightwing and pro-settlement Israeli government on one hand, and the non-Zionist left on the other. It has prompted liberal Zionists to grapple with why they sometimes accept the boycott of products from settlements but not the boycott of the state that creates and sustains them. It has compelled Israel’s more critical supporters to justify their opposition to non-violent forms of pressure on Israel, when the absence of real pressure has done nothing to bring occupation or settlement expansion to an end. It has put the onus on liberal Zionists to defend their support not for the abstract ideal of what they hope Israel might one day become, but for the actual, longstanding practices of the state, including expropriations of Palestinian land for Jewish settlement; detention of hundreds of Palestinians without trial or charge; collective punishment of two million Gazans living under a more than decade-long blockade; and institutionalised inequality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. BDS has deprived Israel’s liberal supporters of the excuse that an aberrant occupation or rightwing governments are mainly to blame for the state’s undemocratic practices. Perhaps most significantly, BDS has challenged the two-state consensus of the international community. In so doing it has upset the entire industry of Middle East peace process nonprofit organisations, diplomatic missions and think tanks by undermining their central premise: that the conflict can be resolved simply by ending Israel’s occupation of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, leaving the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel and refugees unaddressed. For many diaspora Jews, BDS has become a symbol of evil and repository of dread, a nefarious force transforming the Israel-Palestine debate from a negotiation over the end of the occupation and the division of territory into an argument about the conflict’s older and deeper roots: the original displacement of most of the Palestinians, and, on the ruins of their conquered villages, the establishment of a Jewish state. The emergence of the BDS movement has revived old questions about the legitimacy of Zionism, how to justify the privileging of Jewish over non-Jewish rights, and why refugees can return to their homes in other conflicts but not in this one. Above all, it has underscored an awkward issue that cannot be indefinitely neglected: whether Israel, even if it were to cease its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, can be both a democracy and a Jewish state. * * * In the Old City of Bethlehem, down an arched pathway near the souk and Manger Square, there stands a centuries-old limestone building that now serves as the headquarters of Holy Land Trust, a Palestinian organisation devoted to nonviolent resistance to Israeli rule. Sami Awad, the non-profit’s founder, has an office on the top floor; lining his shelves are books by leading theorists and practitioners of protest and civil disobedience: Gene Sharp, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr, all of whom figure prominently in his teaching, writing and even casual speech. Awad meets often with delegations of Israeli and American Jews; unlike many Palestinian activists, he does not shy from discussing the Jewish connection to this land: “I can deny it till kingdom come. But it’s very deep and very emotional.” At the same time, he speaks candidly of occupation and racism, and he insists that Israel will not give Palestinians freedom unless forced to. “No oppressor group ever decides on their own just to be morally correct and change their behaviour,” he told me. “Something needs to happen: activism, resistance, boycott.” Jews and Arabs have been boycotting one another since the early days of Zionism. In the decades before Israel’s founding, the mainstream Zionist movement waged campaigns to boycott Arab workers, reject Arab produce, exclude Arabs from Jewish-only residential communities and forbid Arab purchase of Jewish-owned land. The fifth Palestine Arab Congress called for a boycott of Jewish goods in 1922. After Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Palestinian lawyers boycotted Israeli courts, and teachers went on strike under the slogan, “no education under occupation”. Israel responded to these and other acts of civil disobedience with arrests, fines, travel restrictions, shop closures, curfews and deportations of teachers, lawyers, mayors and university presidents. Sami’s uncle, Mubarak Awad, was a pioneer of Palestinian nonviolent resistance in the 1980s: Mubarak encouraged Palestinians to send back bills written solely in Hebrew, to refuse court summonses and to fly the Palestinian flag, which was cause for arrest. Inspired by Gandhi’s boycott of British cloth, he urged the replacement of Israeli products with Palestinian ones. But it wasn’t until the first intifada, the popular uprising against occupation that began in 1987, that the programme Mubarak and others advocated found its chance for full expression. Tactics he had championed in small classrooms and academic journals were now put into widespread use by a popular movement backed by major political parties: consumers boycotted Israeli goods and services, labourers in Israeli industries refused to work, shops closed down in unison, customers withdrew funds from Israeli banks, residents refused to pay taxes and most of the Palestinian tax collectors and police resigned. The Bank of Israel reported that the Palestinian boycott had cost Israel $650m ($1.4bn today) during the first year of the uprising alone. Mubarak was charged with “fomenting a rebellion against the state”; like dozens of others, he was deported by Israel during the first year of the intifada. Sami Awad was sent by his parents to Kansas in order to continue his studies. When he returned to Bethlehem in 1996, it had been transformed by the Oslo peace process. Tens of thousands of PLO officials and fighters had moved from exile in the Arab world to the West Bank and Gaza, and were now functionaries in the newly established Palestinian administration. A culture of resistance had been replaced by one of coexistence. A peace industry now flourished, as foreign funds flowed in to finance dialogue groups, NGOs and people-to-people initiatives. Awad, like most Palestinians, was optimistic that peace was on the horizon. Within two years, his optimism faded. The nascent Palestinian administration established following the 1993 Oslo accord seemed less a burgeoning democracy that would lead to an independent country in the West Bank and Gaza than a growing police state. He heard no end of talk of peace and coexistence, but what he saw on the ground was increased segregation and limitations on his freedom. The Palestinian autonomous areas in the West Bank were small, disconnected islands, 165 of them, each surrounded by a sea of territory under Israeli control. Within that sea – the 60% of the West Bank that is off limits to the Palestinian government – Israel confiscated land for settlement, demolished Palestinian buildings and provided financial incentives for the settler population to grow. If Oslo was the road to a two-state solution, Awad was beginning to wonder if the destination was one he wanted to reach. When the second intifada erupted, in September 2000, with Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli invasions and missile attacks, the dialogue and peacemaking activities of groups such as Holy Land Trust came to a halt. For Awad, the focus was now on nonviolent resistance, which was then neither popular nor simple. It was the bloodiest period of Israeli-Palestinian fighting since the 1948 war. More than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were killed. The militarisation of the intifada had made it dangerous to confront Israel in any manner, including peacefully. Yet Awad and other activists still managed to carve out a small space for nonviolent resistance. He demonstrated against land confiscation in the West Bank and, after 2002, the building of what Israelis refer to as a security fence and Palestinians came to call the apartheid wall. The barrier – a mix of eight-metre-high concrete slabs, fences and barbed wire – cut through the West Bank and Jerusalem, dividing Palestinians from one another and villagers from their land. The barrier effectively annexed nearly 10% of the West Bank to Israel. In occupied East Jerusalem, up to a third of the Palestinian residents were walled off from their schools, health clinics and workplaces. Dense crowds of Jerusalemites and West Bankers could be seen at 4 and 5am, packed like cattle as they inched through caged checkpoints to get to the other side of the wall. As the violence of the second intifada escalated, a campaign of international solidarity with Palestinians grew. In the first months of the uprising, students at the University of California in Berkeley erected mock checkpoints and brandished banners calling to “Divest from Israeli Apartheid”. Harvard faculty signed a divestment petition in 2002. In Durban, South Africa, alongside a contentious UN-sponsored World Conference Against Racism, representatives of some 3,000 NGOs called on “the international community to impose a policy of complete and total isolation of Israel as an apartheid state”. Boycott and divestment campaigns spread across US, UK and European campuses, gaining the support of several Israeli academics and large numbers of Palestinians. In the West Bank and Gaza, international and Israeli activists streamed in to offer their support. Their presence tended to make the Israeli army act more cautiously, which provided a measure of protection to Palestinian demonstrators. Awad still worked with Israelis, but now insisted that any cooperation be premised not on coexistence but co-resistance, with Palestinians in the lead. He was tear-gassed, beaten and detained alongside members of direct action groups such as the International Solidarity Movement, Christian Peacemaker Teams and the Israeli-led Anarchists Against the Wall. After a week or more among Palestinian villagers, the foreign activists would return to their campuses, church groups and labour unions, explaining that there was a little-noticed Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement – and that it could be supported through divestment and boycott. The first divestment by a US institution of higher education, Hampshire College – also the first US school to have divested from South Africa – was spearheaded by an Israeli undergraduate named Matan Cohen, who at 17 had been shot in the eye by Israeli forces during a demonstration against the separation barrier. The nonviolent activism of the second intifada was a prelude to what would become a worldwide boycott campaign. * * * The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement was founded with a statement of principles, known as the BDS call, on 9 July 2005. It represented something of a last resort. The Palestinians had been crushed by the military defeat of the second intifada. The living embodiment of the Palestinian national movement, Yasser Arafat, was dead. His newly installed replacement, Mahmoud Abbas, was identified more than any other Palestinian with the Oslo peace process. Though Abbas’s leadership seemed to offer a respite from the violence, it also promised a return to a strategy of diplomacy and cooperation that had done little to bring occupation to an end. If there was going to be pressure on Israel to give Palestinians freedom, it was going to have to come from the grassroots and the outside. The BDS call was made on the one-year anniversary of a historic advisory opinion by the international court of justice. The court ruled that Israel’s separation barrier was illegal, that Israel had to dismantle it “forthwith” and offer reparations to those it had harmed, and that every signatory to the fourth Geneva convention – meaning nearly every state in the world – was under an obligation to ensure Israel complied with international humanitarian law. But Israel ignored the ruling, and neither the PLO nor the international community made a real attempt to enforce the court’s findings. “If there had been action on the part of the international community to implement the ICJ ruling,” Ingrid Jaradat, a founding member of the BDS campaign, told me, “there wouldn’t have been a BDS call.” More than 170 Palestinian organisations from the occupied territories, Israel and the diaspora endorsed the BDS call. They spanned the political spectrum – leftists and Islamists, supporters of two states and of one. They included the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces – the coordinating body for every significant political party – as well as major trade unions, refugee camp committees, prisoners’ societies, artistic and cultural centres and nonviolent resistance groups, among them Sami Awad’s Holy Land Trust. Twenty-nine of these entities now form the BDS National Committee, or BNC, a leadership council. The chief innovation of the BDS call was not in the tactics that it advocated: boycott and divestment campaigns were already pervasive in 2005, and even sanctions and arms embargoes had been proposed previously, including by the UN general assembly. What was new about BDS was that it took disparate campaigns to pressure Israel and united them around three clear demands, with one for each major component of the Palestinian people. First, freedom for the residents of the occupied territories; second, equality for the Palestinian citizens of Israel; and third, justice for Palestinian refugees in the diaspora – the largest group – including the right to return to their homes. The BDS call was a challenge not simply to Israel but to the Palestinian leadership. It represented a conceptual reframing of the national struggle, more in line with the original positions of the PLO – before it had been forced by military defeat, international pressure and political pragmatism to abandon the goal of a single democratic state, acquiescing to a two-state compromise instead. The world powers had presented a two-state solution as a gift to Palestinians. But for Palestinians, the gift was clearly to Israel, for they saw it as the indigenous people relinquishing 78% of their land. Arabs had made up more than 90% of the population at the dawn of Zionism, in the late 19th century, and over two-thirds of it in 1948, prior to Israel’s war of independence. That year, the territory of what would become Israel was emptied of 80% of its Palestinian inhabitants, who were then prevented from returning to their homes. The PLO was founded some 16 years later, in 1964, before there was any Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. It was the liberation of the entire homeland and the return of its original inhabitants that had been the core objective of the Palestinian cause. By the first intifada and the 1993 Oslo accord that brought it to an end, however, many Palestinians were ready to accept the two-state formula, not because it was seen as fair, but because it was the most they could then hope to get. As the details of various peace proposals emerged, though, the deal sounded more and more rotten. The Palestinians would have to relinquish not just 78% of their homeland, but also the land taken up by major Israeli settlements within the occupied territories. They would have to give up sovereignty in large parts of occupied East Jerusalem, their future capital, and of the Old City that falls entirely within it. They would have to agree that any peace treaty would not allow the return of most refugees to their homes, unlike almost any other peace accord signed since Israelis and Palestinians first negotiated a draft final agreement in 1995. They would have to renounce all claims on Israel – including any demand for equal rights for its Palestinian citizens, who were more than one-fifth of the population. And in exchange they would get a West Bank-Gaza state that Israeli prime ministers, from Yitzhak Rabin to Benjamin Netanyahu, described as a “state-minus” or “an entity which is less than a state”. During negotiations with Israel, the PLO had agreed to each of these concessions, though few if any of them were supported by international law. When even these accommodations eventually proved insufficient to obtain an end to the occupation, growing numbers of Palestinians started to sour on the idea of two states. It wasn’t simply that the original two-state compromise had been eroded to the point of unrecognisability. It was that even the whittled-down version now seemed like a mirage. At the time of the BDS call, Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza was nearly four decades old, and showed no signs of disappearing. The number of settlers had nearly doubled since Oslo, reaching almost half a million in 2005. Many of them resided not in hilltop caravans, but in cities with shopping malls, parks, public pools and multi-lane highways connecting them seamlessly to Israel. The idea of removing even a third of this steadily growing population had come to sound implausible. The US and other powers did little more than wag their fingers. They promised the Palestinians that the situation would soon end with the founding of an independent state. Over time, the two-state solution became a slogan emptied of meaning. The less plausible it seemed, the louder it was proclaimed. But so long as it could still be imagined, the major world powers refused to demand that Israel grant the Palestinians citizenship and equal rights. The two-state concept was thus transformed from a possible solution to Israeli occupation to the primary pretext for depriving Palestinians of equality. It was also the main excuse for keeping the majority of Palestinians in exile: in order to preserve Israel’s Jewish majority, the refugees would have to languish in camps outside Israel’s borders until there was a Palestinian state that could absorb them. The BDS movement offered an alternative. It rejected talk of fictive solutions, whether of two states or one. The most fundamental problem, in its view, was not in deciding what sort of arrangement should replace the current system; the problem was forcing Israel to change it at all. Debating two states versus one amounted to counting angels on the point of a pin, so long as Israel was comfortable enough in perpetual occupation to prefer it to either one. * * * Israel’s response to BDS was slow in coming, but forceful once it arrived. Yossi Kuperwasser, who goes by the nickname Kuper, led the Israeli government’s efforts against the BDS movement until 2014. He now works for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a conservative thinktank run by Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and a longtime confidante of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Kuperwasser, who has a grown-out buzz cut, a gruff voice and the Israeli habit of filling pauses with a grumbling “ehh”, is an engaging and emphatic interlocutor. He has good Arabic, as does his wife, Tsionit (“Zionist” in Hebrew), who was born in Israel to Iraqi Jewish parents. Kuper headed the prestigious research division of military intelligence during the second intifada, and was appointed director general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs in 2009. It was Kuperwasser who turned the ministry into Israel’s command centre for what he calls the battle against BDS. He began the job just after the 2008-2009 Gaza war, which had killed 13 Israelis and around 1,400 Palestinians, lifting BDS activity to new heights. In September 2009, Israel’s international standing was dealt a heavy blow by the UN’s report on the war, written by a fact-finding mission headed by the eminent South African jurist Richard Goldstone. It found that Israel and Palestinian armed groups had committed war crimes, and that Israel had conducted “deliberate attacks on civilians” with “the intention of spreading terror”. It also determined that the ongoing blockade of Gaza – “the series of acts that deprive Palestinians … of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country” – constituted a possible crime against humanity. Kuperwasser said it was the Goldstone report that first alerted Israel to the grave nature of the threat posed by what it calls “delegitimisation”. In late 2009, Netanyahu identified delegitimisation as one of three critical threats to Israel, alongside Iran’s nuclear programme and the proliferation of rockets and missiles in Gaza and Lebanon. Since then, it has become common to hear senior Israeli politicians describe BDS and delegitimisation as an “existential” or “strategic” threat. Some of Israel’s centre-left commentators, all of whom oppose BDS, have nevertheless taken a rather cynical view of the government’s international campaign against BDS. They believe it is driven primarily by domestic politics. They point out that since the founding of BDS 13 years ago, Israel’s trade with the outside world has actually increased, and its diplomatic ties with India, China, African states and even the Arab world have grown. Many mainstream Israeli commentators see the BDS movement and Israeli politicians of the left and right working in symbiosis: the Israeli left threatens that BDS and delegitimisation will create an international “diplomatic tsunami” against Israel; the Israeli right does its usual scaremongering about external threats in order to drum up support at home and abroad. The BDS movement, meanwhile, eagerly points to every hyperbolic Israeli statement as evidence of its own success. Kuperwasser, however, says the threat BDS poses is very real, and that ignoring it or treating it as a nuisance will fail: “Until 2010, we tried this policy, and the results were not good.” More important, he said, measuring the impact of BDS in terms of Israel’s trade was fundamentally mistaken. “The core issue is not whether they are going to boycott us or not boycott us,” Kuperwasser said. “The core issue is whether they are going to be successful in implanting in the international discourse that Israel is illegitimate as a Jewish state.” * * * More than 20% of Israel’s 8.8 million citizens are Palestinian. They are the remaining survivors and descendants of the minority who stayed within Israel’s borders during the 1948 war. Haneen Zoabi, a 49-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel, from Nazareth, has been a member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, since 2009, and is a vocal supporter of BDS. She is Israel’s fiercest critic in the Knesset, where she regularly denounces Israeli policies toward the Palestinians and accuses Israel of being an apartheid state. YouTube is filled with videos of her standing calmly at the dais, attempting to speak as she is interrupted and heckled by enraged Israeli parliamentarians, some of whom have screamed out epithets such as “traitor!” or “Go to Gaza!” A leading Likud MK, Miri Regev, called for her to be deported. Zoabi has been subjected to a criminal investigation for incitement and suspended from the Knesset several times, most recently in March, for referring to the killing of Palestinians by the Israeli army as murder. While Israel allows Palestinian citizens like Zoabi to vote and hold office, the state has always treated land ownership by its Palestinian citizens as a threat, and has implemented official government plans to “Judaize” Arab areas and dilute the Palestinian presence. After the 1948 war, only 20% of the Palestinians in the territory that would become Israel remained, and a quarter of those were internally displaced. Israel put its Palestinian citizens under the curfews and restrictions of military government until 1966, confiscated roughly half their land, and passed laws that have prevented them from reclaiming it to this day. Tens of thousands of Palestinians reside in villages that predate the existence of Israel but are considered “unrecognised” by the state, facing demolitions and forcible evictions while receiving few to no basic services, including water and electricity. With the state limiting the development and expansion of Arab towns, Palestinian citizens have been forced to bid on properties in Jewish communities. But they have been repeatedly blocked. Hundreds of Jewish-only communities in Israel have admissions committees that are legally permitted to reject applicants on the basis of “social suitability”, providing cover for excluding non-Jews. “What we Palestinians in Israel face is apartheid, not discrimination,” Zoabi said. “Israel tries to say, ‘We are good Israel that has to do bad things in the West Bank and Gaza.’ No, look at how Israel treats its own citizens who don’t throw a stone!” Israel’s longstanding policies of inequality were given additional backing in the form of a July 2018 “basic law” – Israel’s version of constitutional laws – that downgrades the status of the Arabic language, states that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, and declares: “The state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.” Zoabi said the PLO had forsaken its responsibilities to the Palestinian people. After formally committing to two separate states in 1988, she said, “the PLO effectively conceded Israel as a Jewish state”, with inequality between Jews and non-Jews enshrined in its laws. It was now mainly the Palestinian citizens of Israel who really challenged Zionism itself, she said, by insisting that the state could not truly be both democratic and Jewish. As a result, Palestinian citizens of Israel had become a “much bigger threat to Israel than the PLO”. She continued: “The PLO defined our struggle” – the struggle of Palestinian citizens for equality – “as an internal Israeli issue. They abandoned us!” Zoabi harshly criticized the Palestinian leadership for its role in prolonging the occupation. She blamed Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO chairman and PA president also known as Abu Mazen, for the fact that the US president Donald Trump had decided to break with decades of US policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December. “Trump made a calculation,” she told me. “What will be the reaction to my move? All of Israel and the US said to him, correctly, that Abu Mazen will not change the rules of the game, will not end security cooperation with Israel, and will not stop Oslo. So what price will Israel or the US pay?” Zoabi said that when she travelled abroad, to countries such as Ireland, Germany and the US, “officials there told me: ‘The PLO ambassador is against your position on BDS. So who am I supposed to believe?’” Like the PLO, Zoabi is highly critical of Israel’s occupation, but she believes the real roots of the conflict are in Israel’s historic treatment of Palestinians. “The problem is not the occupation, the problem is the Zionist project,” she said. “Israel fears that if people had open minds and saw what Israel was doing to the Palestinians, it would be the end. The minute you say that Israel is not a normal state – that it is not a democratic state that makes some mistakes, but an abnormal state, acting against human rights – then you are breaking its image as liberal, humane, [with] the most moral army in the world. BDS is eroding Israel’s standing.” * * * Despite their totally opposing goals, the Israeli right and the leaders of the BDS movement agree on quite a lot. Both assert that at its heart the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is over Zionism and the forced exile of the majority of Palestinians in 1948, not Israel’s 1967 conquest of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank. Both contend that the settlements should not be treated differently from the government that created them. Both believe that the demands of Palestinian citizens of Israel for equality and of refugees for return are central issues of dispute, which were given insufficient attention by past peacemakers. Both say that Israel’s battle against BDS is not primarily an economic struggle. Both view the BDS movement as representative of mainstream Palestinian demands, despite acknowledging that the movement cannot mobilise large crowds and its main activists are not important figures in Palestinian politics. And both believe that the BDS movement will expose the true nature of the conflict to the world. But whereas the BDS movement is betting that this exposure will lead people to conclude that Zionism is fundamentally racist and should be rejected, Kuperwasser, for one, is convinced it is the Palestinians who will be unmasked. “The Palestinians are taking a very big risk,” he said. “Because, in my mind, there is a good chance that the world will deny their conceptual framework. People will say: ‘This is what the Palestinians want?! We are totally against it … They are crazy; they want Israel to disappear.’” If that happens, he added, the Palestinians won’t even get a West Bank-Gaza state, which he believes the PLO still sees as merely the first stage toward liberating all of Palestine. In Kuperwasser’s view, the BDS movement and the Palestinian leadership share the same goals; the differences between them are merely a matter of tactics. “Abu Mazen understands more than the BDS movement that you have to be subtle,” he said. The PLO’s acceptance of a two-state solution, its vows to take into account Israel’s demographic concerns, its silence on the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel – all of these, Kuperwasser added, were merely a subterfuge designed to obtain a West Bank-Gaza state, which would then serve as a launching pad for continued struggle. “The Palestinian idea of struggle is so deeply embedded in their mind that they cannot actually think about the possibility of giving up the struggle in order to make peace. I cannot tell you how many Palestinians I told, ‘Listen, with this struggle, you are paying the price much more than we do. We are flourishing. Even if we pay a price, we are flourishing.’” The key for Israel, he said, was winning the hearts and minds of centrist liberals and progressives abroad, not people who are already in the Zionist or anti-Zionist camps. What had made it more difficult, he said, was that some Israelis and Jews were guilty of “negligence and intentional giving up of the battlefield” – not the radical left, but centrists who had naively adopted the language of the enemy. Kuperwasser singled out the former Labor party prime minister Ehud Barak, who had repeatedly warned that Israel is “on a slippery slope toward apartheid” – a warning that has also been made by the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and the former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Yitzhak Rabin. For Kuperwasser, these statements, intended to convince Israelis to make territorial concessions for peace, were above all a gift to its enemies. * * * For the BDS movement, the charge of apartheid, which became prominent after the start of the second intifada in 2000, was not merely a provocative analogy to South Africa but a legal claim, based on the crime of apartheid as defined in international conventions and the founding statute of the international criminal court: “an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”. The concept of apartheid became central to the BDS movement’s framing of the conflict. Whereas the Palestinian Authority sought to accentuate its autonomy and state-like characteristics, the BDS movement underlined the PA’s subservience to Israel. For proponents of the two-state model, the PA was a nationalist project working toward eventual independence, while in the apartheid framework it was merely an Israeli satrap. BDS leaders emphasised the de facto “one-state reality” of Israel-Palestine – which had become a common trope even among Israel’s supporters, many of whom were dismayed at the possibility that the country could eventually be forced to enfranchise the Palestinians living under occupation and thereby cease to be a Jewish state. Increasingly among both Israel’s centre-left friends and its enemies, the idea of a single state was not a plan for the future – to be sought or averted – but an accurate description of the reality on the ground, which was becoming more and more difficult to disentangle. Jews were already a minority in the territory under the control of Israel, which regulated the Palestinians’ borders, exports and imports, customs revenues and permits for travel and work. Legally, commercially and administratively, the Jewish and Palestinian populations were interlaced. The more deeply entrenched this one-state reality became, the more resonant the charge of apartheid, and the more difficult to imagine undoing it through partition into two states. A battle against occupation could be concluded with a simple military withdrawal, but a struggle against apartheid could be won only with the end of state policies that discriminated against non-Jews. In the case of Israel, these could be found not just in the occupied territories, but everywhere Palestinians came into contact with the state. In the West Bank, Palestinians were denied the right to vote for the government controlling their lives, deprived of free assembly and movement, forbidden from equal access to roads, resources and territory, and imprisoned indefinitely without charge. In Gaza, they could not exit, enter, import, export or even approach their borders without the permission of Israel or its ally, Egypt. In Jerusalem, they were segregated from one another and encircled by checkpoints and walls. In Israel, they were evicted from their lands, prevented from reclaiming their expropriated homes, and blocked from residing in communities inhabited exclusively by Jews. In the diaspora, they were prevented from reunifying with their families in Israel-Palestine or returning to their homes, solely because they were not Jews. Though in public, world leaders spoke endlessly of a two-state solution, privately many doubted it was still possible. They regularly condemned settlements (since these, unlike occupation, were illegal), but they did nothing to reverse settlement growth. They called for Palestinians to have freedom, but not through equal rights and citizenship in one state – because, among other reasons, international law forbids Israel from annexing territory acquired by force. They saw Israel was subverting a two-state solution and taking measures to deprive Palestinians of rights. But they wouldn’t exert any real pressure on Israel so long as it mouthed an intention to one day grant Palestinians some limited form of independence. Israel was thereby allowed to hold all the land while excluding the majority of its indigenous people, just as South Africa had aspired to do. In redefining the conflict as a case of apartheid, BDS activists saw a way out of this trap. The apartheid rubric could also undo the Palestinians’ greatest weakness – fragmentation – by uniting them in a common struggle against a single, discriminatory regime. In Gaza this January, I met Haidar Eid, a professor of literature at Al-Azhar University and a co-founder of the BDS movement in Gaza. He is in his mid-50s, compact, with a scruffy grey beard and short curly hair, and a fondness for knitted turtlenecks. Eid said that he had never seen such strain on the people of Gaza. It was weeks before Gazans would launch the Great March of Return, the weekly protests along the Gaza border fence in which Israeli snipers killed more than 100 unarmed demonstrators and wounded several thousand more. Along with tens of thousands of other public employees, Eid’s salary at the university had been cut by more than half, and he was looking for a second job. Over 40% of Gazans, including most young people, were unemployed. Eid scheduled much of his life around when the elevator for his 10th-floor apartment would be working, since Gaza had only six to eight hours of electricity per day. Scarce power prevented the full treatment of sewage, tens of millions of litres of which were dumped each day, raw, into fetid ponds and the sea. Like more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population, Eid and his family are refugees from a village in present-day Israel. He opposed the Oslo agreement because it ignored Palestinian refugees. “Oslo,” he said, “reduced the Palestinian people to residents of the West Bank and Gaza.” But it was refugees who founded the Palestinian national movement, and who accounted for the majority of Palestinians worldwide. He said, “The Palestinian issue is one thing: the right of return.” Eid’s village, Zarnuqa, was purged of its Palestinian inhabitants and no longer stands. Throughout Israel the land of refugees remains largely empty or sparsely populated, such that prominent researchers, such as the Palestinian historian Salman Abu Sitta, estimate that most could return without displacing Israelis. Eid noted that a two-state solution meant precluding most refugees from returning, since Israel refuses any possible threat to its Jewish demographic majority. (There is a myth propagated by some of Israel’s supporters that Palestinians are the only people who pass on refugee status to their children. On this basis, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have sought to cut UN assistance to millions of Palestinian refugees born after the 1948 war. In fact, granting refugee status to stateless descendants is standard practice throughout the world. The majority of registered Afghan refugees, for example, are second- and third-generation, born outside the country, as are most who have returned to Afghanistan in recent years.) Eid spent six years in Johannesburg, where he obtained his doctorate, and his English has traces of a South African accent. He compared Gaza and the Palestinian refugee camps outside Israel’s borders to the Bantustans in which black South Africans were confined under apartheid; it was his view that a two-state solution would not end apartheid but rather consolidate it, creating an enfeebled, discontiguous West Bank-Gaza state that would have a dubious claim to independence. To Eid, the two-state solution was an essentially racist proposal, because it was designed to preserve a Jewish ethnic majority, with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews. He preferred a single, democratic, non-racial, non-religious state, which he said was a “huge compromise for Palestinians”, because it would give “citizenship and forgiveness to settlers and occupiers”. Eid objected to the PLO’s insincere threats to seek such an outcome, which he wrote off as a misguided attempt to scare the Israelis into accepting ethnic partition: “I mean, equality is not scary! If you are against equality and justice, you are against human rights.” Relying on states to behave morally was a lost cause, he argued; they needed to be pressured by their own people from below, through BDS activism by civil society. He recalled that it had taken more than 30 years for the international community to heed the calls for boycott, divestment and sanctions against apartheid South Africa, whose violent overreaction to indigenous resistance had been a prime driver of international solidarity. Just as the boycotts against South Africa had been stoked by the apartheid regime’s killings of protesters, Eid said, “the growth of BDS has been paved in Gaza’s blood. Every massacre we have in Gaza convinces me more that the only hope we have is popular resistance and BDS.” * * * Though BDS has not had a major economic impact on Israel so far, compared to the decades-long campaign in South Africa, its ascent has been rather steep. Institutional investors such as the Dutch pension fund PGGM and the United Methodist Church have withdrawn from Israeli banks. The Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Christ, and Norway’s largest private pension fund have divested from companies profiting from Israel’s occupation. And major firms such as Veolia, Orange, G4S and CRH have fully or mostly pulled out of Israel following boycott campaigns. Dozens of student governments and numerous academic associations have endorsed boycott and divestment initiatives. And many musicians and artists have cancelled shows or pledged to boycott the country. No less important, the BDS movement has effectively won the argument inside Palestine: whereas Abu Mazen had stated, in 2013, that while the PLO supports settlement boycotts, “we do not support the boycott of Israel” because “we have relations with Israel, we have mutual recognition of Israel”, by 2018 the PLO had at least rhetorically adopted BDS. International organisations, too, have been influenced by the BDS movement to move slowly from ineffectual condemnations to calls for practical measures that have some teeth. Last summer, Amnesty International called for a worldwide ban on settlement products and an arms embargo on Israel and Palestinian armed groups. Human Rights Watch called on institutional investors in Israeli banks to ensure that they are not contributing to or benefiting from settlements and other violations of international law. And the UN human rights office has compiled a list of over 200 companies – the majority based in Israel or the occupied territories, 22 based in the US – that are linked to the establishment, expansion or maintenance of Israeli settlements. In what is expected to be the most significant development in the 13-year-old BDS campaign, the UN human rights office plans to publish the names of these companies later this year. Nearly all of the corporate and student-led divestments have been selective: they have not targeted Israel as a whole, but only settlements and occupation. A number of them had little to do with the BDS movement itself. But both the Israeli government and the BDS movement have tended to obscure this fact. Doing so has helped the BDS movement appear to rack up victories, and it has helped the Israeli government to discredit cautious bureaucratic initiatives to adhere to international law, casting them instead as unhinged, demonising efforts by BDS radicals. Conflating boycotts of the settlements with opposition to Israel’s existence has been a central element of the government’s policy, reflecting a desire not just to protect settlements but to stem the tide of selective boycotts that could spread to Israel as a whole. “We are saying there is no difference between a settlement boycott and a boycott of Israel,” Yossi Kuperwasser said. “If you want to promote the boycotting of Israel, any part of Israel, you are not a friend of Israel. You are actually an enemy of Israel. So we have to deal with you.” The government has passed a law that bars entry to foreigners who have publicly supported a boycott of Israel “or an area under its control”. Its minister of strategic affairs has called for imposing financial penalties on Israeli organisations, companies and in some cases individuals who advocate boycotts of either Israel or the settlements. After Hagai El-Ad, the head of the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, addressed the UN security council and called on it to take action against Israel’s occupation, the chairman of the governing coalition called to revoke his citizenship and to create a bill that would do the same to any Israeli who calls on international bodies to take action against Israel. Israel and its allies have pursued the same strategy abroad. In 2014, Netanyahu convened a meeting of top Israeli ministers to discuss possible counter-BDS measures, including, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz, “legal suits in European and North American courts against [BDS] organisations”, “legal action against financial institutions that boycott settlements”, and “whether to activate the pro-Israel lobby in the US, specifically Aipac, in order to promote legislation in Congress”. Since then, major banks around the world have shut down the accounts of pro-BDS groups. In 24 US states, bills and orders that stifle free speech by discouraging, penalising or restricting support for boycotts of Israel or of settlements have been passed, and have been challenged in two states so far by the ACLU. Following Hurricane Harvey, last summer, the city of Dickinson, Texas required residents who wanted relief to certify that they do not and will not boycott Israel, a demand the ACLU’s Texas legal director called “an egregious violation of the first amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths”. A federal anti-boycott bill supported by Aipac has also met with opposition by the ACLU, which argues that “political boycotts are fully protected by the first amendment”, regardless of whether the boycott is of Israel or the settlements. This deliberate elision of Israel and the settlements has caused no small amount of consternation among the state’s more liberal supporters in the American Jewish community. For years they have sought to protect Israel itself from sanction, by arguing that only boycotts of settlements are legitimate. Now they feel themselves under attack not just from BDS, on the left, but the Israeli government, on the right, both of which disdain the centre-left notion of being “pro-Israel and anti-occupation”, and both of which reject the position that wine produced in West Bank settlements should be boycotted while the government that created, financed and maintained the settlements should not. Israel’s strategy has been to force a choice on companies subjected to pressure to withdraw or divest: stay in Israeli-controlled territory and ignore the boycott campaign, or accede to its demands and face potential lawsuits and losses in much bigger markets in Europe and the US. Given that choice, Kuperwasser said, most companies would be very reluctant to withdraw from Israel or the settlements: “But if it’s going to happen, there are going to be more laws around the world that are going to make these companies suffer. We can retaliate and come up with a response.” The Ministry of Strategic Affairs has outsourced much of its anti-BDS activity in foreign countries, helping to establish and finance front groups and partner organisations, in an attempt to minimise the appearance of Israeli interference in the domestic politics of its allies in Europe and the US. Kuper said that anti-BDS groups were now “sprouting like mushrooms after the rain”. He and a number of other former intelligence and security officials are members of one of them, Kella Shlomo, described as a “PR commando unit” that will work with and receive tens of millions of dollars from the Ministry of Strategic Affairs. In 2016, Israel’s embassy in London sent a cable to Jerusalem complaining that the strategic affairs ministry was endangering British Jewish organisations, most of which are registered as charities and forbidden from political activity: “‘operating’ Jewish organisations directly from Jerusalem … is liable to be dangerous” and “could encounter opposition from the organisations themselves, given their legal status; Britain isn’t the US!” Last year, al-Jazeera aired undercover recordings of an Israeli official working out of the London embassy, who described being asked by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs to help establish a “private company” in the UK that would work for the Israeli government and in liaison with pro-Israel groups like Aipac. To Israeli liberals, the gravest threat from BDS is that it has induced in their government a reaction so reckless and overreaching that it resembles a sort of auto-immune disease, in which the battle against BDS also damages the rights of ordinary citizens and the organs of democracy. Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs has utilised the intelligence services to surveil and attack delegitimisers of Israel. It called to establish a blacklist of Israeli organisations and citizens who support the nonviolent boycott campaign, created a “tarnishing unit” to besmirch the reputations of boycott supporters, and placed paid articles in the Israeli press. Leftwing Israeli Jews have been summoned for interrogation or stopped at the border by agents of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, who described themselves as officers working against delegitimisation. Israel has banned 20 organisations from entry for their political opinions, including the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that won a Nobel peace prize for helping Holocaust refugees and that now supports self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians while also endorsing BDS. Last year, the Israeli intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, called publicly for “targeted civil assassinations” of activists such as the BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti, a permanent resident of Israel. Barghouti was also threatened by Israel’s minister of public security and strategic affairs: “Soon any activist who uses their influence to delegitimise the only Jewish state in the world will know they will pay a price for it … We will soon be hearing more of our friend Barghouti.” Not long after, Barghouti was prevented from exiting the country, and last year Israeli authorities searched his home and arrested him for tax evasion. * * * Perhaps Israel’s most powerful tool in the campaign against delegitimisation has been to accuse the country’s critics of antisemitism. Doing so required changing official definitions of the term. This effort began during the final years of the second intifada, in 2003 and 2004, as pre-BDS calls to boycott and divest from Israel were gaining steam. At that time, a group of institutes and experts, including Dina Porat – a Tel Aviv University scholar who had a been a member of the Israeli foreign ministry’s delegation to the 2001 UN world conference against racism in Durban, South Africa – proposed creating a new definition of antisemitism that would equate criticisms of Israel with hatred of Jews. These experts and institutions, working with the American Jewish Committee and other Israel advocacy groups, formulated a new “working definition” of antisemitism, including a list of examples, that was published in 2005 (and later discarded) by an EU body for combating racism. This working definition was adapted in 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), and has been used, endorsed or recommended, with some small modifications, by a number of other organisations – including the US Department of State, which, since 2008, has defined antisemitism to include any of three categories of criticism of Israel, known as the “three Ds”: delegitimisation of Israel, demonisation of Israel and double standards for Israel. (More recently, the IHRA working definition has been at the centre of the antisemitism controversy in the Labour party, which adopted a modified version of the examples accompanying the definition.) By the state department’s definition, delegitimisation includes “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist”. Thus anti-Zionism – including the view that Israel should be a state of all its citizens, with equal rights for Jews and non-Jews – is a form of delegitimisation and therefore antisemitic. According to this definition, virtually all Palestinians (and a large proportion of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel, who oppose Zionism for religious reasons) are guilty of antisemitism because they want Jews and Palestinians to continue living in Palestine but not within a Jewish state. Kuperwasser, for one, stands by the charge: “Anti-Zionism and antisemitism are the same lady in a different cloak.” The second D, demonisation, includes “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” – as the Israeli army’s deputy chief of staff did during a Holocaust remembrance day speech in 2016, likening the “revolting trends” in Europe and Germany in the 1930s and 40s to tendencies visible in Israel today. The last of the three Ds, applying double standards, holds that singling Israel out for criticism is “the new antisemitism”. Yet practically every earlier divestment and boycott initiative around the world could be accused of double standards, including the campaign against apartheid South Africa, most of whose proponents ignored graver transgressions elsewhere, such as the concurrent genocides in Cambodia, Iraqi Kurdistan and East Timor. The new definition of antisemitism has been frequently deployed against Israel’s critics in the US, especially on university campuses. Israel advocacy groups have urged several universities to adopt the state department definition. At Northeastern University in Boston and the University of Toledo in Ohio, pro-Israel students and advocacy groups attempted to thwart even discussing boycott and divestment, arguing that it would create an antisemitic climate on campus. The California legislature passed a resolution in 2012 to regulate speech on California campuses; it cited examples of antisemitism that included not just delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel but also “student- and faculty-sponsored boycott, divestment and sanctions campaigns against Israel”. In 2015, an anonymous website, Canary Mission, began publishing lists of pro-Palestinian students who support divestment, often accusing them of antisemitism; the Israeli government has used Canary Mission profiles to interrogate and deny entry to pro-BDS US citizens. On several campuses, pro-Israel groups have intimidated pro-Palestinian students and faculty by placing names from the Canary Mission website on posters that state: “The following students and faculty … have allied themselves with Palestinian terrorists to perpetrate BDS and Jew Hatred on this campus.” Kuperwasser was unapologetic about the perceived excesses of Israel’s anti-BDS campaign at home and abroad. He was confident that Israel was taking the right approach and would succeed, as it had against past assaults: “We won the war on the conventional battlefield. To start with, our chances were very slim. We won the war on terror. Again, it wasn’t easy. I remember when we went to the big battle – the second intifada – and many generals around the world were telling me, ‘Listen, Kuper, you’re wasting your time: nobody ever won a war against terrorism,’ citing Vietnam and other cases. And I said: ‘No, we shall win this war as well. We are innovative and determined enough. And unlike many other battles, we don’t have a second option, an alternative. We have to win.’ The same goes here. We shall win.” * * * For Jewish Zionists in the diaspora, whether their support for Israel is critical or unwavering, the demands of the BDS movement are a non-starter. Most would say that it is tragic that 80% of the Palestinian residents within what would become the boundaries of Israel were forced into exile during the 1948 war, but the lesson of the Holocaust is that Jews must have their own state, full stop. They support the right of Palestinian refugees to return to the state of Palestine, not to Israel. This is among the primary reasons that they are so troubled by the prospect that there will never be a West Bank-Gaza state: few dispute that refugees have a right to return to their homeland – this is, after all, the founding idea of Zionism – but with no Palestinian state there is no good liberal answer to where Palestinians should return to. Because the BDS movement opposes a state with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews and therefore rejects the idea of a Jewish state, many diaspora Jews view the threat it poses as existential. Thanks in no small part to the BDS movement, the Israel-Palestine debate is transforming from a question of how to end Israel’s occupation, which most liberal Jews do not support, to a referendum on the legitimacy of Israel, which they consider a settled fact that they shouldn’t have to defend. Beneath this principled opposition, there are also more visceral misgivings. One of the primary apprehensions of liberal Zionists about the BDS movement is what they consider to be its strident tone and uncompromising positions. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the head of T’ruah, a rabbinic human rights organisation that works in both Israel and the US, said that she “straddles the line between progressive groups where Zionist is a bad word and pro-Israel groups where occupation is a bad word”. She said she felt alienated by the hostility of the BDS movement, which at times seemed to her downright gleeful as it publicised Israel’s misdeeds. “BDS is triggering 2,000 years of Jewish trauma and 70 years of post-Holocaust trauma,” she said. David Shulman, a renowned Indologist, Hebrew University professor, and activist with Ta’ayush (“co-existence”), a leftwing Israeli-Palestinian group that protects Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks, said that his biggest problem with BDS was “the virulent tonality” of it: “I understand it is a heterogeneous movement. But so much of it is based on hatred, which is a terrible basis for political action.” Many liberal Zionists recoil not just at the vehemence of some BDS activists, but also at their occasional conflation of Israel and the Jewish people, which they feel smacks of antisemitism. Simone Zimmerman, a co-founder of the American Jewish anti-occupation group IfNotNow, said she found the Israeli government no less guilty of the charge: “Bibi Netanyahu goes around the world saying, ‘I am here to represent the Jewish people, and the IDF is doing what it’s doing on behalf of all the Jewish people in the world.’ And the American Jewish Committee and Aipac say we’re doing what we’re doing to keep the Jews safe. I find it hard to make the case that our critics should be more nuanced than we are ourselves.” In the US and Europe, liberal Jews feel as alienated by the anti-Zionist BDS movement as by the illiberal supporters of Israeli policies they deplore. Last fall, the rightwing Zionist Organization of America feted Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser whose ex-wife, in a sworn court declaration, recalled his complaint that their daughters’ school had too many Jews. Bannon had proclaimed himself a “Christian Zionist”. The “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer, an organiser of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which white supremacists had chanted “Jews will not replace us”, had also declared himself a sort of Zionist, inspired by Israel’s example as an exclusionary ethnic state. Last year he said to an Israeli television interviewer: “You could say I’m a white Zionist in the sense that I care about my people. I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves, just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.” The alliance between Israel’s allies and ultra-nationalists in Europe and the US has become a central theme of the BDS campaign’s messages. In this respect, the Trump era has been good for the movement. So has the Netanyahu government, whose attacks on BDS have been among the greatest drivers of publicity and recruitment for the campaign. Jacobs said that it had become harder and harder to be pro-Israel and anti-occupation in progressive spaces. “On the left, support for BDS is a litmus test: either you support it or you have no place.” To progressives, centre-left pro-Israel groups are increasingly viewed as Aipac-lite, supporting two states in name while in practice protecting Israel from any sort of pressure that might induce it to end a very comfortable occupation. Sharon Brous, a leading progressive rabbi in the US, told me, “I am not supportive of BDS, but I think we haven’t treated it correctly. Boycott is a tool that we in the Jewish community use often. It is nonviolent.” American progressives have advocated a number of domestic boycotts in recent years – including one against the state of North Carolina, over a controversial anti-LGBT law. Mouin Rabbani, a senior fellow with the Institute for Palestine Studies who is not active in the BDS movement, told me, “All these years we heard Israel and its supporters ask, ‘Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?’ And then when faced with a totally nonviolent Palestinian boycott campaign, they say they can’t support it.” Simone Zimmerman, the IfNotNow co-founder, said: “If you ask a random American Jew on the street, ‘Do you believe that people in their society shouldn’t discriminate based on ethnic heritage, and all people should have access to all the basic rights that you care about in America?’, they’d probably say yes. And then it comes to Israel, and they say: ‘Equality for all people? You’re trying to wipe Israel off the face of the map!’” * * * In Jaffa one Saturday afternoon, I met Kobi Snitz, a mathematician who works at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and is a member of Boycott from Within, a group of pro-BDS Israelis, most of whom are Jews. Snitz is a veteran activist who has been participating in West Bank demonstrations with Palestinians since the second intifada. He has been arrested numerous times and spent many years protesting alongside the family of Ahed Tamimi, who has become a symbol of Palestinian unarmed resistance, following her arrest last December, at age 16, for slapping Israeli soldiers who entered her property shortly after the army shot her 15-year-old cousin in the head at close range. Kobi said that the protests he had joined in Tamimi’s village, Nabi Saleh, had dwindled over the years, as had non-violent resistance in the West Bank more generally. “It’s amazing that it lasted as long as it did,” he said. “Four died in Nabi Saleh, hundreds were injured, and roughly a third of the village was detained or jailed. For a village of 500 people to put up that kind of resistance on its own for that long is extraordinary. But, yes, eventually it dies down and dwindles. Oppression works. Terror works.” Snitz drove me, in a beat-up old sedan, to a lunch of Sudanese lentils in Neve Sha’anan, the poor south Tel Aviv neighbourhood that is home to many African asylum seekers. We were the only non-Africans in the restaurant or on the street. At bottom, he explained, boycott was a peaceful tactic of resisting immoral repression; the refusal to cooperate with gross injustice, he argued, was the minimum required of a person of conscience. As we drove back to Jaffa, passing a prison in which Snitz had been detained, he paraphrased words he had heard from the BDS co-founder, Omar Barghouti. “Omar said: ‘Look, I don’t want the west to come and save us. I’m not asking for the west to come invade Israel. I’m just asking it to stop supporting our oppression.’” Snitz added: “It’s true that this conflict is not special in how bad the violations are. What is special is how much the liberal west actively supports them.” • Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",Israel; Palestinian territories; Middle East and north Africa; World news; Protest,News
