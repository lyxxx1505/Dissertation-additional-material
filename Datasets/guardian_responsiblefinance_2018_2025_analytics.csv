2022-09-19T16:00:02Z,"Debt concerns as UK public sector workers turn to buy now, pay later",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/19/debt-public-sector-workers-buy-now-pay-later-loans,"Experts have raised concerns over cash-strapped public sector workers turning to controversial buy now, pay later loans after being turned down by mainstream lenders. Analysis by the University of Edinburgh found that one in 10 public sector and NHS staff, who were initially rejected for a more conventional loan on the basis that they could not afford to repay it, went on to secure credit from buy now, pay later (BNPL) firms last year. Researchers also found that the overall use of BNPL products among public sector employees had “increased significantly” relative to other credit and loans, and that it was starting to displace other non-traditional lenders such as those offering high-interest payday loans. Prof Tina Harrison, of the University of Edinburgh’s business school, warned that the rising use of BNPL – which is still unregulated in the UK – increased the risk of public sector workers falling behind on their payments. “The increase in the use of BNPL, especially among individuals with very low financial resilience, is extremely worrying,” she said. “Left unchecked, BNPL has the potential to very quickly lead to an unmanageable debt burden.” BNPL firms such as Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy enjoyed rapid growth during the pandemic as online shopping boomed. While shoppers are not usually charged interest on their purchases, they are still at risk of overextending themselves with debt, and are not entitled to forbearance or compensation if things go wrong since such firms are not yet regulated in the UK. Research released by Barclays Bank and the debt charity Stepchange in June found that almost a third of BNPL borrowers said their loans had become unmanageable and had pushed them into problem debt. Shoppers who used such services were paying off an average of 4.8 purchases – almost double the 2.6 purchases in February. The Edinburgh research analysed the transactions of 104,661 NHS and public sector workers who applied for a loan from the non-profit lender Salad Money, but were rejected on the basis that they were unable to afford repayments. Salad Money, which commissioned the survey, issues loans exclusively to public sector workers. Analysis of 174m anonymised bank transactions by the public sector workers found evidence that 54% had experienced direct debits being returned – a key indicator of financial difficulties. The head of Responsible Finance – an industry body that oversees the UK’s non-profit lenders, known as community development finance institutions (CDFIs) – said it was “shocking” to see the rate of BNPL approvals among previous rejected loan applicants. “How can it make sense that if a responsible lender says ‘no, this loan is not affordable,’ an under-regulated, well-funded tech darling can say yes?” Theodora Hadjimichael said. The findings were released as part of a report showing that many key workers would struggle to afford an unexpected bill of £100 in the middle of the month because the staff whose transactions were analysed had, on average, just £79 in their account by that midpoint. It also found that BNPL users spent more relative to their incomes, and tended to have higher overdrafts, while a significant minority were heavily indebted. While it said it was not possible to blame BNPL for those trends, the analysis found its use tended to increase over time.","Buy now, pay later; Financial sector; UK cost of living crisis; Business; Borrowing & debt; Consumer affairs; Money; UK news",Business
2021-02-28T09:15:09Z,CDFI: the community spirit that's saving borrowers from payday loans,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/feb/28/cdfi-the-community-spirit-thats-saving-borrowers-from-payday-loans,"Kathryn Smart was struggling to make ends meet at the start of England’s latest lockdown. The 45-year-old usually earns £1,100 a month working at a debt collection agency in Sunderland, but reduced her hours to help home-school her six-year-old son. Smart needed money to tide her family over, but knew she would not qualify for a mainstream loan. A bad experience with payday lenders several years ago left her with £3,000 worth of debt and a poor credit score. With a contentious county court judgment (CCJ) also on her file, she Googled “loans offered to borrowers with CCJs” and found Fair Finance, one of the UK’s 50 community development finance institutions (CDFIs). While the not-for-profit cooperatives have existed in the UK for 20 years, they are little-known outside their customer base. “I first thought they were a payday lender,” says Smart. “I didn’t know they were a responsible finance company until I had done a bit more research.” As Smart discovered, CDFIs are social enterprises lending to businesses and individuals on low incomes who are struggling to access mainstream credit. Most offer some financial education, as well as budget and debt advice. While interest rates on personal loans are usually between 100-200%, that is a fraction of payday lenders’ rates. Smart secured a £200 loan at an annual rate of 191% – compared with the 1,604% she paid on a payday loan. She was able to borrow a further £300 to buy clothes for her son, but only after the initial debt was repaid, helping avoid the repeat lending that had got her into financial trouble previously. Of the CDFIs in the UK, 10 offer loans to individuals, while the rest focus on small businesses. Five serve individual customers throughout the UK – FindingFinance.org.uk can help you find one. The organisations lend around £25m a year, and serve around 35,000 customers who, on average, borrow £500 over five months. Unlike credit unions that lend from deposits held in customer accounts, they rely on government grants, private investors and philanthropists. In the UK they struggle to attract the investment needed to grow and service a larger pool of borrowers. The business model has its roots in the US, where it grew out of the civil rights movement of the 1970s. Banks had been excluding African American communities as high-risk, but protests led to the Community Reinvestment Act, requiring them to lend to the people they took deposits from. One way to do that was to invest in organisations like CDFIs, which were embedded in those communities and had gained their trust. In the early 2000s, the UK government-backed Social Investment Taskforce was asked to identify new ways to tackle social and financial exclusion and CDFIs were proposed. Most were launched in deprived areas – including Dalston, in east London, Glasgow, and Middlesbrough – in partnership with chambers of commerce or local authorities, and overseen by the industry body, Responsible Finance. At their peak, there were 80 in the UK. But local budget cuts pushed them down the list of priorities of their early backers. Some closed, while others merged. Responsible Finance’s chief executive, Theodora Hadjimichael, believes that with more funding CDFIs could play a key role in helping consumers and businesses through Covid. She says members have “seen a couple of recessions, and been able to support businesses and people, so we have a demonstrated track record in navigating those challenging times”. The real difference between CDFIs and other short-term lenders, she adds, is how they treat customers, because a CDFI’s priority is to help, rather than to accrue profits. “They work with a customer to offer flexible repayment days, understand the financial difficulty they might be in so they get the right type of support. And that’s when a lot of the other types of services can be helpful, like budgeting and advice,” she explains. Earlier this month, the FCA revealed that the number of people who are financially vulnerable had jumped to 14.2 million as a result of the pandemic. Hadjimichael says the demographics of CDFI borrowers have also shifted. The most common customer has typically been women under 30 who live in social housing and rely on part-time work and benefits to make it through the month. But now that has expanded to the self-employed and two-parent households receiving lower wages due to furlough or working fewer hours. Many are home-schooling, adding higher heating and food bills. Increased demand for small loans has put further pressure on CDFI funding pots. The group is now urging the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to commit to a £25m top-up in Wednesday’s budget to replace cash that would have otherwise come from the EU. It also wants high street banks to be required to match that funding. The former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, and Kevin Hollinrake MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary committee on fair business banking, are backing calls for extra financing. However, these arguments have focused on the financial support that CDFIs can offer small businesses, rather than individuals. Peter Tutton, the head of policy at debt charity StepChange, says they can certainly play a role in helping low-income consumers increase their financial resilience, but cannot solve inequalities and persistent debt problems on their own. “What CDFIs can’t necessarily do is address the needs of those in the most financially vulnerable positions”, he says. “That’s why we need to see these alternatives to high-cost credit allied with meaningful policy interventions. With 7 million people behind on essentials, or borrowing to make ends meet, the need is more pressing than ever.” But Hadjimichael is hopeful that the Treasury will see a role for CDFIs in helping consumers and open its wallet. “It’s obviously something that’s higher on the government’s agenda now, and probably will stay so, given the level of financial distress and hardship that a lot of people are getting into during Covid,” she says. Smart is grateful her search for a loan took her to Fair Finance. “It is a positive company and I would recommend it rather than a payday lender – I wouldn’t do that ever again.” • This article was amended on 2 March 2021 because an earlier version referred to “banks” lending money from customer deposits; it intended to say that credit unions lend in this way.",Money; Consumer affairs; Consumer rights; Payday loans; Borrowing & debt; Ethical business; Business; UK news,Money
2020-07-02T07:00:46Z,Revealed: development banks funding industrial livestock farms around the world,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/02/revealed-development-banks-funding-industrial-livestock-farms-around-the-world,"Two of the world’s leading development banks have pumped billions of dollars into the global livestock sector, despite warnings that reducing meat and dairy consumption is essential for tackling the climate crisis. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the commercial lending arm of the World Bank – and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have provided $2.6bn (£2.1bn) for pig, poultry and beef farming, as well as dairy and meat processing, in the past 10 years. The UK government is a major funder of both banks and its own development bank, CDC, has also invested tens of millions of pounds in the global livestock sector over the past decade, including finance for an industrial-scale beef feedlot in Ethiopia and poultry companies in Niger and Uganda. Development banks provide medium and long-term capital for the purpose of economic growth in poorer countries. The IFC and EBRD have both publicly committed to tackling man-made climate change and making investment decisions with the climate in mind. But an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian has revealed that IFC and EBRD finance – which involved direct investments, loans and other financial support – was used for industrial-scale mega-farms, abattoirs and the expansion of multinational meat and dairy corporations. In one recent case, a beef cattle feedlot in Madagascar, owned by a conglomerate of more than 20 companies, was granted funding worth $3.5m to produce beef for export to the Middle East and the domestic market. In another, Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork company, received a substantial cash injection from the IFC for its activities in Romania. Scientists have repeatedly raised the alarm over the sizeable climate footprint of animal farming – it produces nearly 15% of human-made greenhouse gas emissions – and said that unless global consumption is reduced, efforts to tackle climate change will fail. “Expanding production and consumption of meat and dairy is incompatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement,” said Prof Pete Smith, chair in plant and soil science at the University of Aberdeen and a lead author of a landmark UN report about the impact of land use and agriculture on climate change. He cited research showing that a shift to vegetarian or vegan diets, among other food sector and land-use changes, by half of the global population by 2050 is required to meet the Paris goals. “While some investments by development agencies and banks in animal agriculture to improve food security in the world’s poorest nations may be justifiable, massive investments in livestock production systems in countries that already have high levels of consumption, and in multinational meat and dairy companies, clearly is not,” he added. Animal products tend to have far higher environmental footprints – in some cases 10 to 100 times higher – than plant-based foods because of the amount of land, water, greenhouse gas-emitting fertilisers and energy needed to produce a portion of protein. The livestock sector uses more than 80% of the world’s farmland, either as pasture or as land producing animal feed, yet provides only 18% of global calories. Last week in a landmark climate report the World Bank committed to working with clients to incentivise sustainable diets and “address drivers of increased meat consumption”, and said it was considering advocating for a carbon tax on the livestock sector. The report extolled the climate benefits of plant-based meat substitutes. Jeremy Coller, head of investment firm Coller Capital and founder of responsible finance network Fairr, said that while the financial world was beginning to play its role in lowering greenhouse gases, it was “crazily disjointed and inconsistent for the IFC and EBRD to invest public funds in intensive animal agriculture, one of the world’s highest-emitting industries”. Our analysis of public records and industry data highlights how the banks have financed companies operating across eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Some investments were in countries where meat supply is currently low, such as Ethiopia, but others were made in places where meat consumption per capita is already high or average, such as Ukraine, China and Romania. The dairy sector was the biggest recipient of IFC and EBRD funding, with processing companies and farms receiving more than $1bn. The pig and poultry sectors each received about $500m. The IFC told the Bureau that it is intentionally catering for growing global demand for meat and dairy and that the livestock sector is a key pillar of food security and poverty reduction in many countries. It acknowledged, however, that the sector had a “large environmental and climate footprint”. The European Bank said the meat and dairy sectors represent an important staple in the diets of many people but that livestock projects represent about 1% of its total business investment. Both banks said they are working to reduce the emissions of the projects they fund. The impact of each project should be considered against global and national emission budgets, according to Prof Tim Benton, director of the Energy, Environment and Resources programme at Chatham House. But he warned that trying to reduce the carbon footprint of a pint of milk or a single chicken is pointless when demand for those products keeps increasing. “Just because the greenhouse gas efficiency of a unit of meat or dairy has improved, if everybody’s eating more of it, the total emissions that come from meat or dairy might increase.” Both development banks told the Bureau that they assess individual projects for their carbon emissions. The EBRD added that it had introduced practices to assess climate risks across its entire portfolio. Some of the companies funded by the development banks are multinational agribusinesses or their subsidiaries or affiliates. In 2010, the EBRD took a stake in the eastern European and central Asian subsidiaries of the French group Danone, one of the world’s biggest dairy companies, which generated sales of €25.3bn (£22.5bn) in 2019. The EBRD said that its investment – now ended – had been intended to expand the dairy markets and Danone’s operations in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Among projects recently approved by the IFC is a loan of $54m to the India-based poultry giant Suguna, the country’s leading chicken supplier and one of the world’s top 10 biggest poultry producers. The company serves export markets as well as Indian consumers. The IFC loan is partly designed to aid the company’s expansion into Kenya and Bangladesh, with finance earmarked for construction of feed mills and hatcheries. The fully integrated agribusiness, which claims to work with 39,000 farms across 18 Indian states, was previously caught up in controversy, after it was alleged that an antibiotic, whose use the WHO had said should be curtailed, was found being used on one of its contract farms. The company denied this. Suguna told the Guardian that as “the key player in broiler production in India [Suguna] has been immensely pushing to reduce or remove antibiotics from the production system using different ingredients promoted by research. Suguna uses only registered antibiotics for the treatment and not for growth promotion.” Suguna is not the only India-based poultry company to have been supported by the IFC, with rival Srinivasa receiving an injection of more than $20m in 2018. Smithfield Foods – now part of the Chinese conglomerate WH Group – also benefited from IFC finance, with loans of $60m for its operations in Romania. Smithfield is the world’s largest pig producer and pork processor, and it recently hit global headlines after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close its flagship meatpacking plant in South Dakota, which reportedly supplies 18 million meals a day to US consumers. Research by the Coller FAIRR Index recently indicated that 77% of leading meat, fish and dairy producers, including most of the largest listed meat companies in the Ukraine and China, fell into a “high risk” category on addressing climate change, meaning that they do not adequately measure all greenhouse gas emissions and do not have meaningful targets to reduce them. The UK government has pledged to use its presidency of COP26, the annual UN climate talks, to “green local and international supply chains for foodstuffs and key commodities” and “increase the alignment of financial flows with net-zero”. The CDC told the Bureau it was about to publish a new climate change strategy to make sure agricultural companies it invested in implement “climate smart agricultural practices in order to decrease emissions and increase resilience to a warming climate... It is also important to remember that one in five people living in Africa experience hunger. Alleviating levels of chronic malnourishment and improving food security remain vital development goals.” The IFC accepted that animal protein has “a large environmental and climate footprint, yet it is important to note that its growth is demand driven and linked to people’s dairy and meat consumption preferences”. It justified the investments in the livestock industry by saying that “in most developing countries there is a significant portion of the population that struggles to meet their daily minimum requirements for nutrition, including protein”. An EBRD spokesperson said the bank is “primarily investing in increased efficiency, improvements in energy use along supply chains, improved animal welfare, waste management and utilisation (including manure management), and production of green energy”. The bank also said it actively pursued the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, “including by improving resource efficiency along the meat supply chains from farming to distribution”.
