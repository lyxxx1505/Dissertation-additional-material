2022-11-20T08:00:22Z,The savior CEO and the empty promise of ‘stakeholder capitalism’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/20/stakeholder-capitalism-jp-morgan-walmart,"American CEOs are a self-assured bunch but it takes a certain level of hubris to conclude that your skills making money and climbing the corporate ladder also equip you to solve social and environmental challenges. While promising to save the world is increasingly part of the chief executive’s job description, two timely new books make clear that this grandiose notion remains little more than a self-serving fantasy. No matter how earnestly they proclaim their support for “stakeholder capitalism” – the popular promise that companies now take care of employees, communities, the planet and other “stakeholders”, not just themselves – profits still come first. Few chief executives have embraced the CEO-as-world-saver conceit as enthusiastically as Jamie Dimon, the head of the $2.6tn investment bank JP Morgan Chase. There’s Dimon lamenting in Time magazine that “policymakers, governments and business leaders have done a poor job of helping those who have been left behind.” There’s Dimon concluding a shareholder letter with a rousing call to “acknowledge our problems and work together” to “lift up those who need help and society as a whole”. And there’s Dimon taking a knee at a Chase bank branch, ostensibly in solidarity with the global Black Lives Matter uprising. New York Times reporter Emily Flitter captures the insurmountable contradictions of stakeholder capitalism in her important and infuriating new book, The White Wall: How Big Finance Bankrupts Black America. In 2014, Flitter recounts, JP Morgan started making philanthropic contributions and “for-profit capital allocations” to the city of Detroit, Michigan, to “address some of Detroit’s biggest economic hurdles”, as Dimon would later phrase it. Accompanying each investment was, Flitter writes, “a media blitz that made it seem like JP Morgan bankers had galloped into a completely deserted hellscape and brought it back to life”. Over the next five years, the bank directed some $155m to Detroit. That’s not an insignificant amount of money – unless you compare it to JP Morgan’s own earnings or its CEO’s compensation. As Flitter points out, that $155m represented “0.03% of its profits over the same period”. A Guardian review of JP Morgan’s annual proxy statements calculates that between 2015 and 2019, roughly the same window as JP Morgan’s work in Detroit, the bank’s board (which Dimon chairs) awarded Dimon more than $135m in compensation. Part of the justification the company gave for Dimon’s 2019 pay was his support for “a diversity and inclusion strategy that attracts, motivates and retains top talent”. In a memo to JP Morgan employees a few weeks after the murder of George Floyd, Dimon wrote: “Let us be clear – we are watching, listening and want every single one of you to know we are committed to fighting against racism and discrimination wherever and however it exists.” Yet as Flitter reveals with devastating clarity, from sidelining Black employees to offering Black customers inferior lending terms and investment products to promoting predatory practices in predominantly Black communities, such commitments are often little more than empty rhetoric. Empty rhetoric does nothing to address the racism that remains deeply entrenched in finance, but that doesn’t mean rhetoric is pointless – at least for executives. “The anodyne talk of diversity can be used as a shield against discussions of specific and unflattering problems,” Flitter writes, which “also helps keep the topics of racism and representation on the margins of corporate life”. The ultimate outcome of performative anti-racism is the preservation of the status quo – which is, of course, the point. High-profile pledges are also fantastic PR. Flitter notes, for instance, that “from start to finish” a JP Morgan investigation into its predecessor banks’ historical ties to slavery “was handled by one of the bank’s public relations specialists”. Of the $30bn that formed JP Morgan’s landmark “racial equity commitment”, announced to great fanfare in October 2020, Flitter finds that some $28bn “was made up of activities that were part of the bank’s normal business and were now being counted as specifically good for closing the racial wealth gap”. (Earlier this year, JP Morgan agreed to a third-party audit of the $30bn pledge.) In the fall of 2019, rhetoric also helped land Dimon and two other CEOs on the cover of Fortune magazine. At the time, Dimon was leading the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group for CEOs of American companies. During Dimon’s tenure, the organization earned glowing headlines and effusive praise from business and media elites by issuing a statement that claimed to “redefine … the purpose of the corporation to promote ‘an economy that serves all Americans’”, including by “foster[ing] diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect”. (The statement came less than a year after JP Morgan paid some $24m to settle a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by employees.) According to Fortune, Dimon and the Business Roundtable had begun a “reexamination” of the group’s stated commitment to prioritizing stock prices at a “testy dinner” the previous year. One person who attended that dinner with Dimon was Rick Wartzman, the author of the new book, Still Broke: Walmart’s Remarkable Transformation and the Limits of Socially Conscious Capitalism. Soon after the Business Roundtable released its statement, Dimon was succeeded as head of the group by a fellow stakeholder capitalism enthusiast and a key player in Wartzman’s narrative: Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chairman and CEO. McMillon speaks incessantly about how Walmart is committed to all of its stakeholders, particularly its 2.3 million employees. The company, Wartzman writes, “very much sees itself as part of this new wave of capitalism”. Still Broke traces Walmart’s history through the lens of the company’s employees. This unexpectedly engaging book portrays a company making progress, but of a very narrow sort: the type of progress that happens on executives’ terms, not workers’; the type of progress that is considered progress only because the starting point was so bad. It’s the type of progress, in other words, that aptly reflects most corporations’ social and environmental responsibility efforts. Walmart’s approach to worker organizing serves as a case in point. “If there is one thing that runs as deep in Walmart’s DNA as its devotion to keeping costs down and prices low, it would have to be its antipathy toward organized labor,” Wartzman writes. In the 1990s the company “tracked employee attitudes” to generate a “Union Probably Index” that would allow it to better target stores that might be inclined to organize. Years later, Walmart hired the elite PR firm (and vocal stakeholder capitalism proponent) Edelman to fight labor efforts; one outcome was “Working Families for Walmart”, an astroturf organization paid for by Walmart and “housed in Edelman’s Washington offices”. Wartzman also highlights a 2012 Bloomberg investigation that discovered that Walmart was so afraid of the employee organizing initiative Our Walmart that the company “hired an intelligence-gathering service from Lockheed Martin, contacted the FBI, staffed up its labor hotline, ranked stores by labor activity and kept eyes on employees (and activists) prominent in the group”. Throughout Still Broke, Wartzman wrestles openly with two tensions. One is the contrast between Walmart’s genuine progress on certain issues – such as its sustainability efforts or its philanthropic undertakings, including its admirably generous response to Hurricane Katrina – and its stubborn unwillingness to raise hourly wages or allow employees to organize. (As the book reveals, Walmart’s anti-labor efforts have continued under McMillon.) The more foundational tension is whether it’s even possible for companies to solve the societal challenges they claim to be determined to fix. In 2015, Walmart finally announced that it would raise its minimum hourly wage to $9, with a further increase to $10 the following year. Like JP Morgan’s investments in the city of Detroit, Walmart’s pay bump was a PR bonanza for the company: President Obama called to congratulate McMillon, and the company was named to Fortune’s “Change the World” list. Walmart has made that list every year since, and the company continues to be celebrated as a paragon of corporate progress. Yet as Wartzman’s account makes abundantly clear, the “mantle of social responsibility” that corporate and media elites have bestowed on Walmart does little for the people who depend on it the most: employees. “After all of that – after all the protests and HR focus groups, the headlines and hearings, the self-congratulatory speeches and board meetings – here’s where Walmart landed: as of summer 2022, at least half of its US hourly workers still make less than $29,000 a year, many of them a fair bit less,” Wartzman concludes. As the civil rights activist JoAnne Bland tells Wartzman after she meets with McMillon, “They know people can’t live off those wages. How much profit do you need?” “At the heart of the struggle for Black Americans to gain equal footing in this country,” Flitter observes in The White Wall, “is the question of who has control and who has money.” Whatever promises corporations make about fighting racism or protecting employees, these two books make clear that companies may be willing to make changes at the margins, but they still draw the line at sacrificing control or money.",JP Morgan; Walmart; Business; Jamie Dimon; Banking; Retail industry; US news; Books,Business
2024-02-29T11:00:16Z,"Trump gave top US firms staggering tax cuts, with some paying $0 or less – report",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/29/trump-tax-cuts-us-companies,"Some of the US’s most profitable corporations, including General Motors, Citigroup and Netflix, have slashed their tax bills in the years since the passage of the Trump tax cuts, with nearly a quarter paying rates in the single digits and 23 paying nothing, a report has found. The 2017 law cut the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. But the new assessment of corporate tax avoidance, published on Thursday by the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep), found that during the first five years the law was in effect, many profitable public companies in the US paid a far lower rate in practice. Together, the 342 corporations studied by Itep paid an average effective tax rate of just 14.1%. Eighty-seven companies paid an average of less than 10%; 55 of those firms paid less than 5%; and 23 corporations, including T-Mobile US and Xcel Energy, paid zero (or less) federal income tax over the five-year period – even though they made a profit each year. Among the lowest taxpayers were companies including Netflix and Nike, as well as several corporations whose CEOs have become high-profile advocates for corporate social responsibility and “stakeholder capitalism”, such as Salesforce and Bank of America. In the five years since the Trump tax law took effect, “the biggest and most profitable companies don’t appear to be paying anywhere close to that 21% rate”, said Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at Itep and the lead author of the report. “What Trump described as a big tax cut turned out to be just that.” Between 2018 and 2022, Bank of America brought home more than $138bn in profits, yet the company paid only $5.3bn in federal income tax – an effective rate of 3.8%, Itep found. Bank of America was recently named the second most “just” company in the United States by Just Capital, a non-profit that ranks US corporations by how well they “perform[] on the issues that matter”, like serving their communities. Fortune magazine has called the Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, “the king of stakeholder capitalism”, a term that describes the notion that corporations today are taking care of not just their executives and shareholders but all of society. In 2020, Marc Benioff, the co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, declared to the New York Times that “it’s time for a new kind of capitalism: stakeholder capitalism, which recognizes that our companies have a responsibility to all our stakeholders”. During the first five years of the Trump law, however, Salesforce paid only $175m in taxes on some $6bn in profits, according to the Itep report. “There appears to be a substantial overlap between the companies that are routinely avoiding corporate income taxes and the companies whose leaders seem to have laudable charitable aims,” Gardner said. “No one would doubt that Marc Benioff wants to do good things in the world. He just doesn’t seem to prioritize doing it in the way that the law says he should. He wants to do it his way.” The Itep report makes clear that the companies listed in the report aren’t breaking the law. “Tax avoidance occurs because Congress chooses to allow it,” the report notes, “either by enacting special exceptions and breaks from the regular tax rules, or by leaving in place loopholes that are clearly being exploited.” Congress is currently considering additional exceptions that could help corporations lower their 2022 tax bills even further, the report warns. A bipartisan tax package that recently passed the House of Representatives, for which corporate interests have been lobbying aggressively for months, includes a tax break that would allow businesses to immediately deduct the costs of “research and development” conducted in the United States. The Trump tax law requires firms to spread out the deductions over time, rather than claiming them all at once, starting in 2022. But the tax deal currently moving through Congress would roll back that limitation for domestic investments – and do so retroactively. That means companies could update their 2022 (and 2023) tax filings to claim billions of dollars in new deductions, ostensibly to reward them for investing in research and development – even though the only thing that would have changed is the text of the tax code. “By definition, extending them backwards in time … can’t encourage a dime of additional research,” Gardner said. While limited corporate disclosures make it difficult to say precisely how much money companies could claw back, the available data suggests that this single, retroactive policy tweak could potentially save some firms billions of dollars – and that the benefits “would be hugely concentrated in the hands of a very small number of corporations”, Gardner said. Meta, for instance, might be able to shave its tax bill by nearly $6.5bn, the report found, which would bring its average effective tax rate below 0% over the five-year period of the study. Microsoft could potentially save a similar sum. “I always go back to that social contract of our company with the world around us,” Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, told Just Capital in 2020. “You can’t exist if all you’re doing is benefiting yourself … Profit [comes] because of the larger surplus you’re creating around you.” “The whole point of having a tax system is to pay for all the important services that we need,” Gardner said. “Healthcare isn’t sexy, right? Education isn’t sexy. Making sure that we have the money we need to defend ourselves as a nation isn’t sexy. But these basic bread-and-butter needs are why we have a tax system.”",Tax avoidance; Business; Trump administration; US politics; General Motors; Citigroup; Netflix; Nike; Bank of America; Meta; Microsoft; House of Representatives; US Congress; US news,Business
2024-10-06T08:00:47Z,"After 100 days of mistakes, we need to hear Labour’s underlying philosophy | Will Hutton",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/06/after-100-days-of-mistakes-we-need-to-hear-labours-underlying-philosophy,"Writing a book with a provocative title has its risks. In This Time No Mistakes: How to Remake Britain I argue that the government must escape the serial mistakes of the past 45 years of trying to shrink the state and promote a self-organising market. The aim is unworkable in theory and practice, engendering a series of disasters ranging from monetarism to the Truss budget. Instead, Britain must strike out anew. The project must be a high-investment, high-productivity economy. The state does not crowd out business investment: public investment crowds it in. Inequality and social division are not prices worth paying for growth; they actively impair it. The mission should be to build a “we society”, incorporating not just an income safety net but decent housing, nutrition, transport and provision of health and social care, ladders of opportunity and the creation of a purpose-driven, innovative stakeholder capitalism. An agile state would lead the charge. The hope was that a newly elected Labour government might take heed, especially if it won a landslide. But after making more mistakes in its first 100 days – a milestone it reaches this week – than any postwar government, the title sounds like a cry into the void. Audiences around the country don’t spare me their sense of intense disappointment at the never-ending stories from “freebie-gate”, made more intense by the outcry over removing pensioners’ winter fuel allowance, scrapping the cap on social care bills and voting to retain the two-child limit on benefit payments. Double standards can be expected of the Tory party – but not Labour. Why does a rich country, notwithstanding 14 years of misgovernance, face such self-imposed “tough” choices? What is Labour’s vision for the country? Part of the problem is that the party’s leadership relegates the importance of ideas and political philosophy because, allegedly, they do not constitute good “retail politics”, don’t play well in focus groups and open up the threat of attack for being of the left. It is safer to duck argument over ideas and be a managerial party focusing on delivery. It is a first order mistake Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson or Tony Blair did not make – and certainly not Margaret Thatcher. Ideas are the lifeblood of politics. Without a philosophy, the politician blows in the wind and has no definition. Blair might have been the quintessential centrist, but he knew that as a Labour leader he had to house it in a distinctive philosophy that had leftwing roots. He declared that it was not socialism that endured, but its ethic – of acting together to promote better outcomes for every individual. We must have one another’s backs. But that ethic of socialism had to be combined with a demand that individuals (and firms) accepted reciprocal social responsibilities, so “the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe” – as his rewritten clause IV, which used to commit Labour to common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, now states. It was a “third way” for which he was prepared consistently to argue despite the brickbats from right and left. It might not have lived up to its potential promise – although he left British public services in much better shape than he found them – but he handed on to his successors a viable political framework on which to build. Combining an ethic of socialism with a hard-headed social liberalism is progressive gold. The former is what drives the creation of strong societal foundations; the latter informs the building of ladders of opportunity. To complete the “we society” there needs to be a state committed to the high public and private investment without which there is neither the wherewithal nor growth to fulfil the ambition. It is hard to properly gauge the intent of a philosophy-light government. It was quick to freeze infrastructure projects around the country for all their evident need, but 100 days in it has yet to grip multiple social crises. Thus one of the totemic policies of the failed “me society” decades was the sale of council houses at aggressive discounts to incumbents without an explicit requirement that any sale must be matched by a newly built replacement. To reward the current generation of tenants while neglecting the next by shrinking the council house stock by 4.4m over 45 years has been social vandalism. It should be stopped. But there are signs of a progressive philosophy emerging. Keir Starmer’s speech at the Labour conference, restating his commitment to economic growth and investment, as well as cultural pleasures, echoed Anthony Crosland, the archetypal liberal social democrat. His The Future of Socialism, now nearly 70 years old, was as radical a critique of Labour’s clause IV as Tony Blair’s. His vision was of public investment-led growth that would deliver not only wellbeing for all but more “gaiety and liberty in private life”. A few days later, Starmer said that he believes in borrowing for public investment. It is a refrain being taken up by Rachel Reeves, although the jury is out until the 30 October budget. “Invest, invest, invest” is her commitment, she told the Financial Times. In Liverpool to promote a 25-year £22bn commitment to invest in carbon capture and storage technologies, she attacked Tory spending plans that leave public investment falling to a derisory 1.6% of GDP by the end of the parliament. The open question is how much any rewrite of the famed fiscal rules in the forthcoming budget will allow public investment to be lifted to a benchmark 3% of GDP, making a real impact on growth. A review of the pension system to promote more British investment is in full swing. Taxation will rise to relieve the worst pressure on public service delivery. This Thursday’s employment rights bill, marking Labour’s first 100 days, with commitments to offer better sick and maternity pay, and more protection against unfair dismissal, is a decisive improvement in Britain’s workplace settlement. There have been too many avoidable mistakes since Labour came to power. Now it is beginning to roll out progressive policies – but they would have more purpose if part of an overarching philosophy. The party does aim to build a strong social floor, ladders of opportunity and a high-investment economy, combining socialism and social liberalism. It is a compelling vision, and to argue for it would reveal the government’s direction of travel. It could even mean fewer mistakes. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist.

2024-04-10T17:38:01Z,The Guardian view on Labour and the tax gap: a £5bn question for a coterie of insiders | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/10/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-the-tax-gap-a-5-billion-question-let-to-a-panel-of-insiders,"In February 2016, the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge went on the warpath. She tweeted: “I hear Edward Troup to head HMRC … Good news for big biz. Bad news for ordinary taxpayers.” Repeating her criticism to this paper, she described Sir Edward Troup as “a rather anonymous-looking person, but incredibly powerful”. This week, the Labour party created a new panel of experts to help it crack down on tax avoidance. Of its four members, two will be Sir Edward … and Dame Margaret. To use a 2016-era term: awks. This is no mere clash of personalities. It cuts to the core of where Labour stands on tax. In a distinguished career, Sir Edward has been a corporate lawyer in the City, an adviser to the Treasury and a commentator on tax affairs. In that last role, he wrote in the Financial Times in 1999 that “taxation is legalised extortion”. In 2004, he told MPs on the Treasury select committee: “I would not like to support anything which is perceived as tax avoidance, but you have got to remember that this is money left in the economy and this is not necessarily a bad thing for the economy.” As chair of the public accounts committee after the banking crash, Dame Margaret battled tax avoidance. She took Sir Edward to task over his positions and clashed with another member of Labour’s tax panel, Bill Dodwell, declaring that his then-employer, Deloitte, benefited unfairly from its links to the Treasury. Now all three will work together, drawing up policies to claw back as much as £5bn in missing tax revenues. A welcome burst of pluralism? Hardly. That would have meant drafting in experts on small businesses (which account for most tax avoidance), and others from outside the tax industry. There are plenty of academics, trade unionists and independent investigators who would have merited inclusion. In December, Labour established a review of financial services to “boost economic growth and make working people better off”, yet among its 10 appointees, there was not one from a consumer rights group or from an organisation representing working people. There were, however, senior figures from Barclays, Prudential and Legal &amp; General. Sir Keir Starmer makes no secret of his admiration for Tony Blair, yet New Labour’s early enthusiasm for stakeholder capitalism led it to pull together a wider range of perspectives. For now, this need not bother Sir Keir’s advisers. Just weeks after Jeremy Hunt stole their proposals on taxing non-doms and splurged the cash for more tax cuts, they now have an answer to any troublesome Tory who asks how Labour will pay for those breakfast clubs and extra NHS appointments. But it is not much of a figleaf, nor in this harsh economic climate will it stay in place for long. By setting its face against taxes on wealth or extra borrowing, the Labour leadership has boxed itself into an exceedingly and unnecessarily tight corner. Taxes on share dividends and capital gains are far lower than the rates paid on income from work or pensions: they should be equalised. As tax experts argued in a 2016 paper for Labour, large corporations should be compelled to publish their tax returns and HMRC needs substantially more money. Until basic things like these are done, the tax system will remain, in the words of one of its longest-serving MPs, “Good news for big biz. Bad news for ordinary taxpayers.”",Labour; Tax avoidance; Politics; UK news; Business; Margaret Hodge; Keir Starmer; HMRC; Tax and spending,Opinion
2024-03-26T14:43:00Z,"Little planning for looming retirement crisis, BlackRock chief warns",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/mar/26/little-planning-for-looming-retirement-crisis-blackrock-chief-warns,"The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager is warning of a future “retirement crisis”, as pension savings fail to keep up with life-extending medical breakthroughs. In his annual letter to investors, the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, said that establishing “a secure, well-earned retirement” would be one of the greatest economic challenges to face the US in the mid-21st century. The boss of BlackRock, which manages about $10tn (£7.4tn) in assets, including retirement funds, praised medical advances, including obesity drugs such as Wegovy and Ozempic, that he said could be life-extending for some people. However, he said the same efforts had not extended to financial planning for longer lives, with one in six people worldwide expected to be over 65 by 2050. That compares with one in 11 in 2019. He noted that Brazil would have more people leaving its workforce than entering it by 2035, while Mexico would reach peak workforce by 2040. India would do the same in about 2050. Fink’s annual letters are closely followed, touching on big topics including sustainability and stakeholder capitalism. He predicted that America’s ageing population would put the US retirement system under “immense strain”, with the social security administration saying that it would not be able to pay people full benefits by 2034. “These drugs are breakthroughs. But they underscore a frustrating irony: as a society, we focus a tremendous amount of energy on helping people live longer lives. But not even a fraction of that effort is spent helping people afford those extra years,” Fink said. “As populations age, building retirement savings has never been more urgent,” he added. “This is a much harder proposition than it was 30 years ago. And it’ll be a much harder proposition 30 years from now.” The chief executive said that investments through financial markets would be a key part of the solution which, in turn, would require state backing. “People are living longer lives. They’ll need more money. The capital markets can provide it – so long as governments and companies help people invest. “To support them [retirees], governments are going to have to prioritise building out robust capital markets like the US has.” He also suggested raising the retirement age beyond 65 – an idea he said “originates from the time of the Ottoman empire” – and introducing schemes similar to the Australian superannuation guarantee, under which employers contribute a portion of income for every worker into a retirement account. He said that 32 years after Australia introduced the retirement savings programme in 1992, its citizens “likely have more retirement savings per capita than any other country. The nation has the world’s 54thlargest population, but the fourth largest retirement system”. The UK began phasing in its own auto-enrolment pension scheme, designed to ensure all workers have a private pension to add to their state pension, in 2012. Fink touted BlackRock’s products, which he said could help guarantee savers stable payments from their retirement pot every month. Ultimately, young Americans would struggle to hold out hope for their future without more certainty over their finances, Fink said. “If future generations don’t feel hopeful about this country and their future in it, then the US doesn’t only lose the force that makes people want to invest. America will lose what makes it America.” He added: “Without hope, we risk becoming just another place where people look at the incentive structure before them and decide that the safe choice is the only choice. We risk becoming a country where people keep their money under the mattress and their dreams bottled up in their bedroom.”",Retirement planning; Family finances; Money; US retirement; US personal finance; Older people; Society; Pensions; Pensions industry; Business; Investing; Health,Money
2023-06-30T15:56:27Z,Severn Trent chief proposes ‘social purpose’ water firms amid utilities crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/30/severn-trent-chief-social-purpose-water-firms-utilities-crisis-liv-garfield-thames-water-labour-renationalisation,"The chief executive of the water company Severn Trent is seeking backing from industry and the Labour party for British utility firms to be reformed as “social purpose” companies that would stay in private hands but give greater weight to the needs of customers, staff and the environment. Liv Garfield, who has run the FTSE 100 company since 2014, has this week written to the chief executives of utility companies in the water, energy and telecoms sectors inviting them to an “off-the-record roundtable” chaired by Will Hutton, a columnist for the Observer and the co-chair of the Purposeful Company. Amid a financial crisis in the water industry, during which government officials have been discussing a temporary renationalisation of Thames Water, Garfield is trying to shape the debate over the future of England’s 11 privately owned regional water monopolies and other utilities. Her proposals include provision of social tariffs for vulnerable customers, a strong voice for employees in strategic decision making, and making a positive contribution to the environment. In a confidential email, obtained and published by the Evening Standard, Garfield wrote: “While it is clear Labour will not include nationalisation in its next manifesto, they are also not keen on entering into the election race championing the status quo. The leadership thinks there is room for improvement and, politically, there is significant pressure to ‘do something’ about utilities. “One idea we believe might be attractive to the Labour leadership is repurposing utilities and utility networks into a new breed of declared social purpose companies – companies that remain privately owned, who absolutely can (and should) make a profit, but ones that also have a special duty to take a long-term view.” The nationalisation of water companies – which was proposed by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the run-up to the 2019 general election – has risen back up the public agenda after concerns over the financial health of Thames Water emerged hours after the sudden resignation of its chief executive on Tuesday. Garfield told the chief executives that the Labour party was “aware we are soft testing various ideas”. Her email included an “imagined press statement about what the end product could look like” entitled “Labour to reset how utility companies operate to ensure world class public services in the UK”. Hutton said he supported Garfield’s initiative. He said he had been “arguing for stakeholder capitalism” since he wrote his book, The State We’re In, in 1996. “Stakeholders can best be united and energised in companies who put their purpose – their reason for being – first and foremost. Well-earned profits will follow,” he said. Hutton said he believed regulated utility firms should be incorporated as “public benefit companies”. “Undoubtedly there are cases where publicly owned corporations are right, but the huge expense alone rules nationalisation out as the default position for every utility,” he said. “I therefore congratulate and welcome Severn Trent CEO Liv Garfield’s initiative and, given my longstanding advocacy going back more than 25 years, happy to help if I can.” . It is not clear whether any roundtable will eventually take place. The email emerged as Severn Trent, which serves Birmingham and the wider Midlands region, prepared for its annual investor meeting in Coventry next week. Pirc, which advises shareholders on how to vote at annual meetings, has recommended that investors vote against the company’s pay report. It is due to pay Garfield a £3.2m pay package. It says Garfield is paid 28 times the average employee, which is “considered excessive”. Pirc also recommends investors vote against the reappointment of Deloitte as the company’s auditor, and the re-election of its audit committee chair, John Coghlan, owing to their lengthy tenures. With concerns about the level of debt at a number of water companies, investors have been injecting more cash to help stabilise the situation. Southern Water is reportedly poised to secure a £500m cash injection from the Australian investment bank Macquarie as it faces issues with rising interest rates and costs, which have hindered Thames Water. This follows a £500m investment by Yorkshire Water’s shareholders on Monday. Meanwhile, the GMB union will soon announce strike dates for more than 1,000 employees at United Utilities. A majority of 68% voted in favour of strike action over pay and “in protest at years of under-investment” at the company, which supplies water in the north-west. A United Utilities spokesperson said: “That vote took place two weeks ago. Since then we have made an improved pay offer which ranges between 7.5% to 8.6% for our employees, along with an additional payment of £1,000. All four recognised unions, including GMB, are currently balloting their members on the new offer. “GMB has not notified us of strike action and all of our employees continue to work as normal, maintaining services for customers.” Severn Trent declined to comment on Garfield’s email.",Severn Trent; Utilities; Privatisation; Politics; Economic policy; Business; UK news; Labour; Water; Pollution; Environment,Business

Its subsidiaries run luxury resorts, develop land, and manufacture cement. But tell them it supplies water to south-west England and that may surprise some in the south-east Asian nation. In 2002, the bust US energy trader Enron sold 100% of Wessex Water to YTL Power International, a YTL Corp subsidiary, for about £545m plus £695m of Wessex debt. The Malaysian company saw its investment as the start of an expansion into Europe, although for its chair, Francis Yeoh, it was something more. When the then Prince Charles awarded Yeoh a knighthood in 2019, the businessman credited his time studying civil engineering at Kingston University in the late 1970s for the growth of YTL. “In Britain, there is a real premium transparent, coherent regulatory framework, where the rule of law is the order of the day,” Yeoh was quoted as saying in the 2018 book Power Talk: Insights from Asia’s Leading Entrepreneurs. At a Malaysian government forum in 2014, Yeoh explained his preference for operating in countries such as Britain, Singapore and Australia. “The good thing about these three territories, I do not have to kowtow to the prime minister before I do a deal, I do not have to see them even, even after I have won the deal,” he said. However, when the Guardian tried to reach Yeoh, 68, to ask about the pollution of English waters, his daughter Rebekah Yeoh Pei Wenn, a YTL director of corporate finance, said he was unavailable to discuss this topic “as we draw closer to our quarterly board meetings”. After making an approach by phone, the Guardian went to the YTL Power offices in Kuala Lumpur – a stone’s throw from one of YTL’s numerous hotels, the Ritz-Carlton, to ask if it would be possible to speak to anyone there about the water company. A receptionist confirmed that “YTL is the owner of Wessex Water, but the staff are based in the UK, you will have to talk to them”.When the Guardian followed up via email, it was politely but firmly told that the chairman was unavailable, adding: “We wish you all the best for the article.” Yeoh took over the running of YTL in the 1980s from his father, the late billionaire Yeoh Tiong Lay, whose initials form the company name. Forbes ranked him 17th on the list of Malaysia’s 50 richest people in 2022, with a net worth of $1.25bn (£1.04bn), which he shares with his six siblings. An evangelical Christian, his apparent Twitter account posts biblical scripture, family videos and nods to the late Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who enjoyed the Malaysian coast. In February 2021, he tweeted: “YTL listed in the KLSE [Malaysia’s stock exchange] in 1986, we had total assets of USD20m. Today we are blessed with global assets of USD20b. This is miraculous!” BlackRock: ‘We engage … but it is not the role of minority investors to direct these companies’ Every January, Larry Fink sends a letter to the world’s chief executives. Few of them can afford to ignore it. The billionaire investor is the chair and chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a company that oversees a portfolio of investments that was worth more than $10tn at the start of the year – twice the annual economic output of Japan. In recent years, Fink, 70, has been much concerned with the environment and has become, arguably, the most important proponent of “stakeholder capitalism” – the idea that a successful business must take into account all its “stakeholders” – employees, customers, partners, society and the environment, and not only this quarter’s profits. It is not that Fink sees stakeholder capitalism as antithetical to making profits – far from it. “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke.’ It is capitalism driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism,” Fink wrote in his 2022 letter. Most of BlackRock’s equity holdings are held through funds that track stock market indexes by buying shares in the companies that make up those indices, which is how it came to be a major shareholder in the English and Welsh water utilities market. BlackRock holds significant investments in Severn Trent, which was fined £1.5m for sewage discharges last year, South West Water, which is being investigated for raw sewage dumping, and United Utilities. BlackRock does engage with the companies it invests in and publishes a report of those engagements. The report shows the investor has engaged with Severn Trent, United Utilities and Pennon, of which Bristol Water and South West Water are subsidiaries. It does not detail the specifics of those conversations but, according to its guidelines, the conversations are about “pursuing durable long-term value”. “We believe that companies that take into consideration environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities are better positioned to deliver long-term value,” the guidelines state. Asked about the worrying reports and allegations of environmental damage by its investments, a BlackRock spokesperson said: “As a minority investor on behalf of our clients, we engage with publicly listed UK water companies on governance and material sustainability risks. It is not, however, the role of minority investors to direct these companies – this role is the responsibility of their management teams with appropriate board oversight, and as determined by their regulator.” CK: No response Apart from being the richest person in Hong Kong, CK Hutchison Holdings’ former chair Li Ka-shing, 94, also enjoys a near-mythical status in the city. He is known for working his way up from a watchmaking apprenticeship to eventually owning a factory specialising in manufacturing plastic flowers and other plastic goods in the 1950s. After that, Li moved into real estate, port operations, retail and telecommunications, consolidating his position as the most influential businessman in Hong Kong over the span of decades. Li’s self-made reputation is woven into Hong Kong’s own “Lion Rock spirit” mythology, which attributes its economic growth from a coastal village to an international finance hub to perseverance. Today, Li’s businesses in Hong Kong have near-total reach in its residents’ daily lives: from the supermarket they shop in, to their cellular provider and more than 100 housing projects where they live. The tycoon’s influence is reflected in a widespread joke that says Li has the power to divert typhoons, so as to not disrupt work and production in Hong Kong. Among Hong Kong citizens, he is nicknamed “Superman”. CK Hutchison Holdings is active in about 50 countries, employing more than 300,000 people worldwide. The corporation operates in 52 ports in 26 countries, has telecom networks in Europe and interests in Australian gas and Dutch energy. Among its many interests is Northumbrian Water in England, which was fined more than £500,000 last year for sewage pollution and is being investigated by Ofwat as part of a larger look into ongoing issues in the sector. This summer, CK Infastructure sold off a 25% stake in the company, which provides water for 2.7 million people in the north-east of England, to the New York-listed private equity firm KKR for £867m. The Guardian contacted CK Infrastructure to ask why it had bought an English water company; whether it still regarded English water as a good investment, and what responsibility Li Ka-shing and CK Infrastructure felt they had for the water system in England and towards the English public? However, despite a number of approaches, there was no reply.",Water; Pollution; Utilities; Business; Environment,Environment
2022-12-07T16:45:07Z,BlackRock CEO faces call to step down amid claims of hypocrisy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/07/blackrock-ceo-faces-call-to-step-down-amid-claims-of-hypocrisy,"Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and one of the most vocal supporters of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investment principles, is facing pressure from an activist hedge fund to step down amid claims of hypocrisy. London-based Bluebell Capital Partners, a $250m hedge fund, took aim at Fink and BlackRock on Tuesday, claiming the firm’s ESG strategy was inconsistent and had “alienated clients and attracted an undesired level of negative publicity”. “The contradictions and apparent hypocrisy of BlackRock’s actions have … politicised the ESG debate,” Bluebell wrote in a letter. “The reputational damage of being dragged into this politically charged debate, in our view, is very significant because it calls into question the independence of BlackRock as an asset manager.” According to Bluebell, which holds a 0.01% stake in BlackRock, the asset giant has not gone far enough to detach itself from fossil fuel investments in pursuit of its ESG goals, and Fink has become a target of environmental and human rights campaign groups. “Fink clearly has political ambitions because it is not his job as chief executive of BlackRock to dictate energy policy,” Bluebell chief investment officer, Giuseppe Bivona, told Reuters. Bluebell’s criticism of BlackRock focuses on commitments to invest in companies – including Glencore – that mine coal for energy production, and BlackRock’s refusal to support their campaign to prevent a Belgian chemical company called Solvay from dumping soda ash into the Mediterranean. A BlackRock spokesperson said that the company did not “support” Bluebell’s campaigns because it does “not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients”. Bluebell has been involved in previous skirmishes. Last year, it followed powerhouse investor Elliott Management in demanding that GlaxoSmithKline’s chief officer, Emma Walmsley, reapply for her job and launch a search for new leadership after taking a stake in the company. Fink has been an outspoken supporter of ESG investing, a stance that has put him and BlackRock in political cross-hairs. Over the summer, 19 conservative US state attorney generals accused Fink and BlackRock of violating their fiduciary duties and of sacrificing returns to advance the company’s net zero carbon emissions agenda. Last week, Florida said it would pull $2bn in state pension funds from the asset giant. “I think stakeholder capitalism is not political or woke – I just think it’s capitalism,” Fink told a New York Times conference last week.",Business; Hedge funds; Environment,Business
2022-01-30T08:05:15Z,‘Woke’ capitalism is the new villain of the right. It’s also the only way forward | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/woke-capitalism-new-villain-of-the-right-only-way-forward,"British capitalism is in trouble. The UK stock market, populated by too many legacy companies with scarcely a major hi-tech company in sight, has been the worst performing among advanced countries since 2000. Brexit has deepened the crisis. Our companies, vulnerably cheap by international standards, have become easy prey for takeover merchants from all over the globe who are rarely benign stewards. Too few great new companies are coming through to take their place. Yet, by the criteria of the political right, the UK should be a capitalist beacon. Regulation in Britain – from the world of work to product standards – is light, applied weakly and is too often close to non-existent. Companies and capital are taxed modestly by international standards. But, stubbornly, the growth rate shrinks as investment and productivity stagnate. Could it be, pray, that the dominant rightwing intellectual paradigm is wrong? Endlessly inventive, the right has found a convenient new villain to blame – “woke” or “stakeholder” capitalism. It may be that the woeful economic trends are longstanding and deep-seated, but don’t let that get in the way of a good new culture war. Last week, the Adam Smith Institute crystallised the complaint in a paper, Capitalism After Covid, which added stakeholder capitalism to the state as culprits in chief. Governments, intoned author Matthew Lesh, have failed in their pandemic response while the private sector has done brilliantly. This “state failure” removes the case for more government involvement in the economy, post-Covid. Instead, capitalism must be given its head, but not a woke capitalism that “stabs itself in the face” by wanting to address “racial justice or environmental protection”. Capitalism must ruthlessly put profit and shareholders first, which is its sacred duty, not sacrifice profit to appease stakeholders in the trivial search for good headlines – the road to perdition. Too many companies are following woke Unilever and sacrificing profit and performance for lofty talk of pursuing sustainability and social purpose, personified, said a leading critical investor, Terry Smith, by trying to argue that the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise was to further healthy eating. Lesh won kind headlines in the Mail. But his thinking is fossilised in the 1980s and singularly fails to address today’s facts and arguments. Has state failure been so complete? Opinion in 27 countries has become more trusting of state competence in handling the pandemic, according to Cambridge’s Centre for the Future of Democracy. In pandemics, you need collective action and state leadership. Yes, there have been weaknesses – but offset by astonishing successes. In Britain, for example, the speed at developing and rolling out vaccines was because of smart collaboration between clever public procurement, universities, notably Oxford, the NHS and purpose-driven companies such as AstraZeneca. Equally, economics is wrestling with the gaping shortcomings of the simple free market views that Lesh champions. Not least, as the 2021 winter edition of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy asks: “Capitalism – what has gone wrong, what needs to change and how can it be fixed?” Radical uncertainty besets economic decision-making; we need better designed institutions to win the gains from cooperation and individuals are much more complicated than economic automata responding to price signals. Economic models that ignore all this (such as Lesh’s) argue successive contributors, lead to a degraded capitalism, stagnating living standards and rising populism in response. Witness Britain in 2022. Companies shape and are shaped by the society of which they are part and this includes the evolving preferences of shareholders. The Investment Association annual 2021 review reports that 49% of the £9.4tn of investment funds under UK management are pledged to promote the environment, social cohesion and good governance (ESG in the jargon), reflecting the wishes of their millions of savers. Founded in the 1880s, Unilever’s purpose was “to make cleanliness commonplace and lessen the load for women”. Today’s investors want it to continue with an updated purpose – making “sustainable living commonplace”, the principle reason it is a great company. Unilever, and the growing number of companies like it, are only responding to their shareholders’ priorities. McKinsey Global Institute declares that stakeholder capitalism, in which companies carefully manage the trade-offs between their varying stakeholders, is the key to long-term value creation. It is the future of business. This is not a sacrifice of profit in woke appeasement of useless consumers, employees and wider societal pressures, as Lesh characterises it. Stakeholder capitalism is a recognition that any company is a social organisation that needs engaged workforces, loyal customers, supportive shareholders and strong brands, all of whose claims have to be managed, alongside financial priorities. Mock the idea that Hellmann’s mayonnaise has a purpose, but consumers care about the health of what they eat and will do more in future. Purposed brands, as Unilever’s own data shows, outperform their non-purposed rivals. And that means profit. Are companies good enough at explaining these realities and trade-offs, at explaining why they consider what they are doing is so material to their long-term profitability and why they feel compelled not to ignore climate change or Black Lives Matter? Lesh attacks the entire framework without recognising the huge current debates about how stakeholder companies and their investors can do better. Companies are asking how they can better explain to their shareholders their best guess of future trends and explain why engaging workforces and customers is so worthwhile. Investors are becoming better at calling out greenwashing and soft corporate baloney. It’s called “materiality”, to borrow the buzzword of the hour – think relevance, significance. Ignore these material pressures beyond immediate financial demands and companies get into profound trouble. British capitalism suffers from a long history of making easy money through being the first to industrialise and possessing a global empire. As a result, the culture of innovative risk-taking and the institutions to support it, along with a sophisticated conception of the company, are cruelly under-developed, as Adam Smith would have been the first to recognise. The value of the institute that proselytises in his name is that it is a useful fool, setting out so revealingly why its 1980s thinking is so wrong. And why so many in business, investment and academia are right to figure out new ways to reset capitalism and better capture its undoubted dynamism to serve the common good. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Business; UK news; Unilever; Investing,Opinion
2022-01-18T13:14:35Z,"BlackRock’s Larry Fink: climate policies are about profits, not being ‘woke’",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/blackrock-larry-fink-climate-policies-profits-woke,"Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment fund manager, said pushing climate policies was about profits, not being “woke”. In his annual letter to CEOs , Fink said businesses, cities and countries that do not plan for a carbon-free future risked being left behind. He argued that the pursuit of long-term returns was the main driver behind climate policies, after being criticised for seeking to influence companies. “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’,” he wrote. “We focus on sustainability not because we’re environmentalists, but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients.” West Virginia’s treasurer said this week that the state’s Treasury investment board would no longer use a BlackRock fund, after the fund manager urged companies to cut their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. The official said this would damage West Virginia’s economy. In his Dear CEO letter, Fink wrote: “It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long term. Make no mistake, the fair pursuit of profit is still what animates markets; and long-term profitability is the measure by which markets will ultimately determine your company’s success.” After Fink wrote two years ago that climate risk was an investment risk and that the firm would put sustainability at the heart of its investment decisions, many companies set out plans to become carbon-neutral. BlackRock had previously been criticised for not pushing hard enough on the issue. Last spring, BlackRock – which manages about $10tn (£7.4tn) in assets – reportedly threw its weight behind a shareholder campaign to oust several directors on the board of the US oil giant ExxonMobil. The coup launched by dissident hedge fund activists at Engine No 1 replaced two Exxon board members with its own candidates to help push the oil company towards a greener strategy. Fink predicted in this year’s letter that “the next 1,000 unicorns won’t be search engines or social media companies, they’ll be sustainable, scalable innovators – startups that help the world decarbonise and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers”, adding that established companies should strive to do the same. He said a “tectonic shift” had happened in recent years, with sustainable investments globally reaching $4tn. Fink also said that companies had a moral responsibility to adapt to “a new world of work” that had been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic. He said “that world is gone” – where companies expected workers to come to the office five days a week, mental health was rarely discussed in the workplace, and wages for those on low and middle incomes barely grew.",Climate crisis; Environment; Financial sector; Business; UK news; US news; Investing; Fossil fuel divestment,Environment
2022-01-18T19:28:02Z,Little ingenuity needed to spot the weakness of THG | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/18/thg-ingenuity-e-commerce,"For all the excitable claims by Matt Moulding, founder, chairman and chief executive of THG, that the e-commerce retailer was a victim last year of a vicious “short attack” from hedge funds, there was a boring explanation for the big tumble in the share price. The stock market, in its collective wisdom, was already in the process last autumn of deciding that the e-commerce and new-tech brigade – think Asos, Boohoo, Darktrace and others – might be a tad overvalued. The reappraisal wasn’t confined to the UK; it was happening in the US too. And THG, or The Hut Group as it was, gave investors extra reasons to be cautious because its communication around its Ingenuity division, the unit that provides “end-to-end technology solutions” for other people’s brands, was cack-handed. Put simply, investors struggled to see what was revolutionary about a marketing, logistics and distribution set-up. Given that Ingenuity, according to the market’s previous bullish thesis, accounted for about half of THG’s value despite being the divisional tiddler, it was hardly surprising that outsiders had a rethink. You don’t need a conspiracy theory to explain the shares’ descent from 600p from 200p-ish. They now stand at 168p, down 10% on the day, after a trading update that said operating profit margins in 2021 would be slightly below City forecasts. Conventional factors, including foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, were to blame, but it all adds to the impression that THG inhabits the same universe as the rest of the corporate world and should probably be valued as such. THG’s Beauty businesses, centred on the Lookfantastic brand and with revenues of £1.1bn in 2021, are clearly a substantial operation. So, too, the shake and protein division called Nutrition (£659m of revenues). But Ingenuity, with revenues of £194m remains a mystery. Yes, it’s growing rapidly, but until THG provides a breakdown of divisional profits, any valuation is vague. Moulding, wisely, didn’t treat us to another airing of his views on short-selling. Best to keep things that way: if there is hidden value within THG, the stock market is perfectly capable of finding it. Debt threat to Unilever’s ambitions On day two of the great GSK adventure, Unilever’s shares fell another 4%. One worry is that the company, led by chief executive Alan Jope, will end up overpaying for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division. Another is that it will walk away and overpay for something else. Jope, after all, was clear on Monday that, whatever happens, Unilever’s strategy is to expand “materially” in the territory of “health, beauty and hygiene”. Investors’ nerves won’t be helped by credit rating agency Fitch’s contribution. A purchase of the GSK business, “or possibly any other large target”, would raise debt levels to the point where the current A rating on Unilever’s debt is threatened, it said. Unilever has a view on the debt point, of course: it would sell some or all of its food business, which is stuffed with excellent brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Hellmann’s. It has no intention of running with sky-high borrowings for long. But there is an issue of time and sequencing here. If the food business is worth roughly £50bn – the same as the rejected offer for the GSK unit – how quickly could that sum be turned into cash? A single buyer looks unlikely, which would imply a series of sales. As it happens, Unilever sold at decent prices in the recent past when disposing of its spreads business and then the PG Tips tea operation, but neither sale happened quickly. Targeting the GSK unit is entirely reasonable, as argued here on Monday: the fit is good. But the journey to a reinvented Unilever is starting to look extremely complicated. Only radical in the US “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke’. It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships,” writes Larry Fink, big boss of the $10tn asset manager BlackRock, in his annual “Dear CEO” letter. There’s nothing particularly new or groundbreaking in his view. Fink was late – disgracefully so, many would say – to embrace the idea that long-term returns require a long-term perspective, and that profit-seeking companies should operate with a sense of duty to wider society and the planet. But he’s been arguing along those lines for a few years now. So why does he feel the need to reject the charge of being woke? Only because he’s getting heat from US conservatives. In the UK – and, indeed, in the mainstream fund management in the rest of Europe – Fink’s version of stakeholder capitalism would be seen as unthreatening and middle-of-the-road. Over here, almost nobody is calling him radical or woke.",THG; Business; E-commerce; Retail industry; UK news; Unilever,Business
2022-04-24T05:00:13Z,"Elon Musk wants to own Twitter to protect his ‘freedom’, not everyone else’s | Robert Reich",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/24/elon-musk-twitter-billionaire-robert-reich,"Elon Musk has now put together a $46.5bn financing package to buy Twitter – two thirds of it from his own assets, and a third from bank loans secured against Twitter’s assets. It’s the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person. Twitter’s founder and top managers don’t want Musk to take over the company. They offered him a seat on the board but he didn’t want it because he’d have to be responsible to all other shareholders. Now they’re adopting a “poison pill” to stop him. But Musk plans to buy shares directly with a tender offer that shareholders can’t refuse. After all, it’s a free market. Musk says no one should object to what he wants to do with Twitter because he’s a “free speech absolutist” – and who can be against free speech? Besides, he and his apologists say, if consumers don’t like what he does with Twitter they can go elsewhere. Freedom to choose. Free market? Free speech? Free choice? When billionaires like Musk justify their motives by using the word “freedom”, beware. What they actually seek is freedom from accountability. They want to use their vast fortunes to do whatever they please – unconstrained by laws or regulations, shareholders, or even consumers. The “free market” increasingly reflects the demands of big money. Unfriendly takeovers, such as Musk is mounting at Twitter, weren’t part of the “free market” until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before then, laws and regulations constrained them. Then came corporate raiders like Carl Icahn and Michael Milken. Their MO was to find corporations whose assets were worth more than their stock value, borrow against them, acquire enough shares to force them to cut costs (such as laying off workers, abandoning their communities, busting unions, and taking on crushing debt), and cash in. But the raiders’ antics often imposed huge social costs. They pushed America from stakeholder capitalism (where workers and communities had a say in what corporations did) to shareholder capitalism (where the sole corporate goal is to maximize shareholder value). Inequality skyrocketed, insecurity soared, vast swaths of America were abandoned, and millions of good jobs vanished. The raiders altered the “free market” to allow them to do this. That’s what the super-rich do. There’s no “free market” in nature. The “free market” depends on laws and rules. If you have enough money, you can buy changes in those laws and rules that make you even more money. (You can also get the government to subsidize you – Musk has received a reported $4.9bn so far.) “Free speech” is another freedom that turns on wealth. As a practical matter, your ability to be heard turns on the size of the megaphone you can buy. If you’re extremely rich you can buy the Washington Post or own Fox News. If you’re the wealthiest person in the world you can buy one of the biggest megaphones in the world, called Twitter – and then decide who can use it, what its algorithms are going to be, and how it either invites or filters out big lies. Musk said last week that he doesn’t care about the economics of the deal and is pursuing it because it is “extremely important to the future of civilization.” Fine, but who anointed Musk to decide the future of civilization? Which brings us to free choice. If consumers don’t like what Musk does with Twitter, they cannot simply switch to another Twitter-like platform. There aren’t any. The largest social media platforms have grown gigantic because anyone who wants to participate in them and influence debate has to join them. After they reach a certain size, they’re the only megaphone in town. Where else would consumers go to post short messages that can reach tens of millions of people other than Twitter? With social media, the ordinary rules of competition don’t apply. Once a platform is dominant it becomes even more dominant. As Donald Trump discovered with his Truth Social fiasco, upstarts don’t stand much chance. Musk’s real goal has nothing to do with the freedom of others. His goal is his own unconstrained freedom – the freedom to wield enormous power without having to be accountable to laws and regulations, to shareholders, or to market competition – which is why he’s dead set on owning Twitter. Unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight, this one is dangerous. It might well upend democracy.

2021-07-14T06:33:05Z,A financial fairytale: how one man fooled the global elite,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/14/the-key-man-simon-clark-will-louch-private-equity,"The place was Dubai. The star was Tina Turner. “As the American pop legend belted out Simply the Best,” write authors Simon Clark and Will Louch, “guests sipped vintage champagne served from an ice bar that was melting slowly into the Arabian sand on the beach, fire dancers performed and cigar rollers flown in from Cuba handed out their aromatic wares.” The host of the party was Arif Naqvi, founder of Abraaj, a private equity fund that managed nearly $14bn and had stakes in a hundred companies. Its investors were treated to oratory from Bill Clinton, the former US president, and dinner with Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon. Arif’s promise to give capitalism a conscience seduced western governments and billionaire Bill Gates. But it was all a lie, a fairy tale. In their gripping new book, The Key Man, British journalists Clark and Louch tell how Arif helped himself to the private equity group’s money, pocketing $780m, half of which is still missing. The account raises questions over whether “impact investing” and “stakeholder capitalism” are less about poverty alleviation for the world than guilt alleviation for the Davos elite. “Arif was very early on in presenting himself as an impact investor,” says Clark, 45, via Zoom from Britain. “Impact investments emerged after the global financial crisis as a movement. You’ve got capitalists who are saying that they can invest profitably and at the same time they can address social issues like ending poverty or fixing climate, and that was what makes the Abraaj story really stand out from other financial crime stories. “Bernie Madoff was saying to investors, give me your money, I’ll give it back to you and more because I’m going to invest profitably, and the ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ was doing the same thing. Abraaj went a step beyond that, saying to investors, give me your money, I will make you profits and, at the same time, we will end poverty in the developing world. In order to do that, he wasn’t just making an investment pitch. He was making a pitch in terms of how he could provide public goods: he could do something for the common good of the world.” The Key Man’s opening chapter, The Boy from Karachi, begins with the young Arif at home in Pakistan, spellbound by watching the 1969 moon landing and deciding that the whole world is his stage. He was relatively well off, attending Karachi Grammar School, but did not belong to the wealthiest echelon. He excelled and went on to study at the London School of Economics, then worked for companies such as Arthur Andersen and American Express. Eventually he moved to the financial trading hub of Dubai and founded Abraaj in 2002. With hustle, showmanship and ostentatious philanthropy, along with a willingness to work in countries seen as risky due to corruption, this “silver-haired man of soft bearish charm” became a poster boy for stakeholder capitalism. His associates included Gates, Prince Charles and then secretary of state John Kerry. He sat on boards at the United Nations and Interpol. He was the subject of glowing profiles in the New York Times and Forbes magazine. And he pitched himself to western governments which, stung by the financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement, were hungry for ways to show they cared. Louch, 30, recalls: “Barack Obama travelled to Cairo and made an amazing speech about healing the US’s relationship with the Muslim world. A key part of his pitch was to use entrepreneurship and American style capitalism to help end or tackle the issues with unemployment that maybe were linked to terrorism there. “Arif heard this speech and went to Washington. He took on board what the US government was looking for and then basically presented himself as being someone that could help administer the Obama administration’s vision for resolving a lot of the social issues there by investing in businesses, by creating jobs, by growing the economy. “I think in total the US government pledged over $500m to Arif’s firm for which he – and this is something that’s not necessarily always mentioned in the grand speeches that Arif was giving – would earn significant management fees for investing government money in the region.” Arif built numerous contacts in Washington amid discussions about a Marshall Plan for the Middle East for which he would manage the funds. Clark adds: “So there was this convergence of public and private policy. It was part of a global trend, globalisation, and Arif was bang in the middle of that. “By going to Davos every year and networking there in Washington and London and elsewhere, he built this incredible network and, because of where he comes from and his ability, he was seen as a person who could be the key man in terms of delivering profits and policy outcomes for western investors and governments.” The authors chronicle how Arif flew on a Gulfstream jet with a personalised tail number, M-ABRJ, sailed on yachts and compared himself to the mythical adventurer Sinbad. He owned a sprawling estate in Oxfordshire, fixed up the local cricket pavilion at great expense and lavished more than $348,000 on a dinner at Davos attended by then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif. But something did not add up. Abraaj was spending more than it earned and secretly moving money around to plug holes in its balance sheet. Clark explains: “If you raise a one billion dollar health care fund for building clinics and hospitals in Africa and South Asia, as Abraaj did, then you have to just use that one billion dollars for building and buying hospitals. “But Abraaj would call money from investors – including Bill Gates who put $100m into this fund and gave confidence to others to put money in as well – and say we’re going to buy or build a hospital in Nairobi or Karachi or Lahore and the money would be sent by the investors. Then Abraaj would siphon it out of the fund and put it into a central pot where they were mixing all of their monies together and spend it on whatever their priority was like salaries, or loans coming due, or the previous investment because they used their money for something else so to keep them quiet let’s use this money instead, which is a Ponzi-like situation. “That’s where they really came undone and because their finances were not disclosed to the public and were not being properly disclosed to investors, they were able to hide this financially dire situation for years, until it came unstuck at the end of 2017.” Finally, in late 2017, Andrew Farnum, an executive with the Gates Foundation, raised the alarm and demanded to see bank records, wondering why the money was not being invested in hospitals as promised. After a tipoff from a whistleblower, Clark and Louch, reporters for the Wall Street Journal based in London, broke the story that investors were investigating Abraaj for mismanaging their money in early 2018. The firm collapsed with $385m unaccounted for. Arif was arrested at Heathrow airport, charged by the US government with fraud and money laundering. He is currently out on $19m bail, living in South Kensington, wearing an ankle tag and awaiting extradition. He denies wrongdoing. But his downfall raises broader questions about stakeholder capitalism and whether it can truly be a tool to combat poverty or the climate crisis – or is merely another smokescreen for the super-rich to pursue even more wealth. Louch insists: “I think the message absolutely isn’t that stakeholder capitalism is a myth. The book shows, and other examples in the financial system today show, that it can be a good thing tackling some of the biggest issues that we have today. “One of the takeaways from this book is that a lot of very wealthy men – largely men – meeting in Davos once a year are probably not alone going to be the people that have the answers to this problem. A more inclusive conversation involving other members of society, not just people that have lots of money and power and influence, is probably the way that stakeholder capitalism would actually maybe ever work.” Clark concludes: “It’s great that capitalists say they want to help make the world a better place, but citizens and investors need to be able to see exactly how they’re going about that so that everyone can verify whether or not they are doing what they say. There is an absolute need for a more inclusive conversation about the global economy in general and about poverty alleviation in particular. “It should become as unacceptable for a group of wealthy people to talk about poverty alleviation as it is for a group of men to talk about gender equality. In order to get a reality check and ground this conversation about impact, there is a need for the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of impact investing to be included in the discussion about how, where and when to deploy capital to produce these outcomes. Otherwise, it’s likely to end up at best as a PR stunt and at worst as a fraud.” The Key Man is out now",Books; US news; Culture; Business,Books
2021-11-04T14:15:36Z,Banks are still financing fossil fuels - while signing up to net zero pledges | Mariana Mazzucato,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/banks-are-still-financing-fossil-fuels-while-signing-up-to-net-zero-pledges,"Despite the stark warnings of climate breakdown from the IPCC and the UN, it’s business as usual for fossil fuel capitalism. An astonishing 56% of the G20 nations’ Covid-19 recovery funds for energy have gone to fossil fuel companies. In April, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) chaired by Mark Carney was launched to bring together leading financial corporations to redirect finance towards achieving net zero by 2050. Yet many of its signatories remain among the world’s top backers of fossil fuels. Some have even issued new financing to companies expanding fossil fuel infrastructure since signing up with the GFANZ. Oil extraction in the Amazon is being financed by GFANZ members HSBC and Citi, for instance, while Deutsche Bank, MUFG, and Credit Agricole are issuing bonds for a company that constructs pipelines in Indigenous territories. These are just some of the more prominent players in a financial system that remains too tightly entwined with fossil capitalism through unaccountable and complex global flows between fossil fuel corporations and private equity firms, asset managers, pension funds and other financial institutions. At Cop26, Rishi Sunak announced that the UK will become the world’s first “net zero-aligned finance centre” – seemingly a response to accusations that banks are not doing enough. His move was instantly criticised by climate campaigners as little more than a “marketing slogan”. If the Glasgow summit is to live up to its status as the “finance COP”, we need to radically transform the global financial system so that it serves public purpose over private profit. The GFANZ is a start, but it doesn’t go far enough. International agencies and national governments need to impose stringent conditions on how financial corporations operate, switching investments out of fossil fuels and into zero-carbon activities. Through carbon tariffs, renewable energy subsidies and state investments, fossil capitalism can – and should – be rendered unprofitable. A massive expansion of state-owned green investment banks will be critical for transforming finance. These provide patient loans and grants, used to fund research and development and startups in zero-carbon technologies. A promising example is the Scottish National Investment Bank, which invests millions across Scotland to deliver climate goals. Across the world, public banks are already the pioneers of green lending: they invest nearly as much as all private banks combined in the green economy, despite accounting for only 20% of total global banking assets. Importantly, public banks and public wealth funds retain a substantial stake in the capital created by the green transition – through, for instance, equity shares and revenue participation agreements. If we want to ensure a socially just – and thus effective – transition, green investment banks must be governed democratically, and their financial assets should be shared collectively among workers and citizens. This could take the form of a citizens’ dividend that would provide everyone with a guaranteed minimum income, for example. Such institutions can transform shareholder capitalism, which feeds profits back to company shareholders, into stakeholder capitalism, in which citizens and workers have a democratic ownership stake. “Business as usual” only leads us down the road of no return. We urgently need to change direction towards a radical industrial strategy that puts climate action at the forefront of financial investments. This will mean restructuring capitalism around a renewed sense of public purpose, channelled through ambitious missions to renew the capacities of the state and meet the challenges of the climate crisis. In practice, this means setting measurable goals such as creating good green jobs for unemployed coal workers, as exemplified by Spain’s national Just Transition Strategy, bringing stakeholders together to achieve them, and redirecting resources. New institutions will be needed to push forward this economic transformation. Europe already has its Organisation for Nuclear Research, known as Cern, which pools technology and resources for particle physics. We need an equivalent body for climate technology that would pool investments in climate action across countries and sectors (the G7 Panel on Economic Resilience, which I was part of, has already recommended precisely this). We also need a new social contract between the state, capital and labour. This will mean transforming the government’s reliance on parasitic public-private partnerships that socialise the risks and privatise the rewards of important public projects (such as the UK’s test-and-trace programme). To prevent this from hampering climate action, governments should enforce new conditions that ensure private contractors promote decarbonisation. They could follow Sweden’s example, which recently insisted that contractors only use green steel, made without coal. Governments could also take inspiration from Germany’s state-owned development bank, KfW, which offers loans to the steel industry that include conditions to reduce carbon and emissions. Or the French and Dutch Covid bailouts for national airline carriers Air France and KLM, which enforced conditions including cutting domestic flights that compete with rail travel and reducing absolute carbon emissions. Conditions like these need to be extended across the board to make it impossible for carbon-emitting companies to operate. At Cop26 it should be clear to delegates what lies at the root of climate catastrophe. The type of capitalism we have created is driving environmental breakdown and needs to be fundamentally redesigned. There is no time for tinkering; we need radical transformation now.

2021-10-17T08:00:23Z,I rejoiced in Blair’s triumph in ’97. Will I ever get the chance to cheer again? | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/17/new-labour-1997-election-tony-blair-gordon-brown-change-conservatives-bbc,"That first Saturday of May 1997 after New Labour’s stunning election victory and after we’d seen the second edition of the Observer off-stone – “Goodbye xenophobia” ran the huge, now sadly doleful headline – we took to the courtyard of a local pub for a celebratory drink. We shared the same ache for change as our readers, and Tony Blair’s top pollster Philip Gould, along with an eclectic bunch of new cabinet ministers, showed up to celebrate with us. It was a joyous moment. But the open question, prompted by watching the riveting if flawed BBC Two documentary series Blair &amp; Brown: The New Labour Revolution, is whether any of us will ever experience it again. Do we live in a de facto, one-party state under “King” Johnson? The series makers did not intend it – nor did the cast of New Labour politicians who speak so candidly – but one of the unintended consequences of the series is that it crystallises a widespread doubt about New Labour. Yes, it did good and was serious about winning. But Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s suspicions about each other, and thus the solidity of the foundations of the “project”, are foregrounded. Brown was, at heart, the tax-and-spend Labourite whom Blair thought he was, while Blair, as he himself suggests, was the true, if messianic, custodian of New Labour. Yet Brown’s problem was that, despite their command of British politics, both shrank from a reform programme for British capitalism that had a serious chance of delivering a high-wage, high-productivity economy. Reform of the City of London, for example, and laying the building blocks of a stakeholder capitalism – creating value for others beyond shareholders – might have been considered “anti-business”. Instead, they tinkered at the edges while launching a massive programme of redistribution based on tax credits and public sector investment, one that they did not dare to own politically and which was quickly reversed by their successors. The British capitalist status quo was not to be disturbed, which was at the core of Brown’s refusal to join the euro, a lost turning point, given only cursory treatment in the programme. It would have forced Britain to make structural reforms for which Blair, despite his pro-Europeanism, had little sense and not much appetite – but neither did Brown. He glowered menacingly, absorbing too much governmental energy in assuaging his anger, without really a defining political dividing line. He became a convert to reform too late, after the financial crisis in which New Labour, abjuring reform of the City, had been complicit. For all its success this side-stepping of fundamental reform was a central problem. The salient political truth about the run-up to the 1997 election was the growing collective hunger for change. I have never doubted that John Smith, had he lived, would have won big in 1997 too, and, judging from my conversations with him, he would have led a reforming government that might have tackled the issues from which New Labour shrank. The New Labour revolution was unnecessary: a majestic political stunt, originating from an Alastair Campbell doodle, arising less from conviction than insecurity. In the week when a poll revealed a formidable 10-point Tory lead, it can seem as if there are endless obstacles to change for Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson’s charisma, Labour’s evisceration in Scotland, the challenges in the red wall, the ongoing aftermath of the Corbyn debacle, the chronically weak starting point, with only 199 MPs. But still, that ache for something better is present again. William Hague believed there were four stages through which New Labour would move in the public’s mind – fascination, admiration, disillusion and contempt. The same holds for Johnson. Admiration is now fading and disillusion beginning in earnest, with three triggers – the abysmal handling of Covid, compromised by too many concessions to the libertarian right; the chaos of Brexit; and the accompanying emergence of a stagflationary, low-wage, low-investment economy. A government that allows too many deaths of its own citizens and pursues policies that make them poorer will soon be held in contempt. There is wisdom in the old Westminster adage that it is governments that lose elections rather than oppositions winning them and the signals are that the Conservatives, for all their opinion poll lead, are beginning to fall seriously behind on key indicators such as prime ministerial approval, the handling of Covid and the energy crises. Starmer may have neither the flair nor easy fluency of Blair or Johnson, but he is palpably serious, an alternative to whom the country can realistically turn. He needs to build on that asset. Last week, a City seminar of 50 business leaders deplored not only Johnson’s policies and scapegoating of business but, more tellingly, the lack of any intellectual rationale. A leading diplomat who knows Britain inside out returned from Labour’s party conference impressed: it was beginning to be a proper party, again in contention. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, he told me, in particular won his admiration, as she is doing from a growing section of British business. One of the key lessons of the BBC series is that Starmer and Reeves need to fashion themselves as a political partnership, an epitome of thoughtful seriousness and competence, right for the times, in contrast to Johnson. They need to describe a route to a high-wage, high-investment economy and genuine levelling up. They should contrast Europe’s low Covid death rate, won with Covid passports, vaccination of children and extensive social distancing, with Britain’s libertarian disaster and, in the process, start to rehabilitate the EU. Brexit’s many failures should be mercilessly attacked and improvements advocated. The next election may not see a Labour landslide like 1997 – the necessary swing is at the outer limits of possibility – but, rather, an implosion of a riven Conservative party that will leave Starmer, like Olaf Scholz in Germany, in pole position to form a coalition or minority government. It may not feel like 1997, but it will be the change we need. If so, I hope the Observer editor comes up with a headline that better stands the test of time than mine.

2021-10-09T06:00:25Z,"When others stay silent about the ills of British capitalism, liars like Johnson rush in | William Davies",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/09/ills-british-capitalism-liar-boris-johnson,"Boris Johnson’s latest wheeze is classical political economy. Faced with the chaos of petrol shortages, empty supermarket shelves and surging gas prices, Johnson offered an audacious response this week: this was all part of the plan. Britain, he explained, was merely transitioning out of a broken economic “model”, based around low pay and high immigration, and into a new one, based around high productivity and high-wage job creation. His conference speech was immediately criticised by the right, on the basis that by celebrating tighter labour markets it appeared to be actively inviting inflation. But on the basic gut level, to which Johnson only ever speaks, he appears to have got away with it. Britain’s most exasperating economic policy riddle of recent decades – its sluggish productivity growth – was simply going to be magicked away, he announced. Regardless of whether we agree with the Adam Smith Institute that his speech was “economically illiterate”, Johnson’s newfound interest in economic “models” tells us something about how this weird new Conservative party is operating. It is equally significant that Keir Starmer – in contrast to his two predecessors – shied well away from discussing the state of British capitalism. The terms of political debate appear to have flipped. To some extent, Johnson was ploughing a familiar conservative furrow. The insistence that apparent economic failure is, on the contrary, merely a symptom of the medicine beginning to work has strong echoes of Margaret Thatcher’s turbulent first few years in office. In 1981, Thatcher was famously criticised by 364 far more distinguished economists than those of the Adam Smith Institute in a letter to the Times condemning her attempts to tackle inflation through punitively high interest rates. Thatcher posed as the strict nurse, painfully weaning the patient off its addiction to inflation. Johnson, by contrast, is suggesting Britain now needs to kick its dependence on foreign labour. No matter what apparent damage the Conservative party does to business or GDP, there is something about its status in British public life that grants its leaders the right to speak about the essence and direction of capitalism, in defiance of all economic logic and indicators. Thatcher, of course, was deadly serious and a living embodiment of the work ethic that she was advocating. Johnson is neither of those things. Thatcher nearly paid a hefty political price for her intransigence, whereas it’s hard to imagine Johnson risking his position for a mere ideology. For Johnson, it’s safe to say, this is more bluster that “works” to the extent that it allows him to spin a good yarn. Theories of capitalism now join ancient Greek myth and rugby metaphors – all simply ways that Johnson chooses to navigate an interview. Starmer evidently views Johnson’s recklessness as an opportunity to position Labour as the party of business. “Good business and good government are partners,” he told Labour conference a week earlier. While his speech was understandably hostile to Conservative economic policies, which he blamed for low wages, it contained nothing as drastic as changing the entire model of the British economy. In the tradition of New Labour, it largely fixated on extolling the benefits of what (good) business can do. It is a strange juncture to have reached, when the character of British capitalism is now being questioned for wholly opportunistic purposes by a showman such as Johnson. But this is what happens when more honest politicians duck difficult questions about the workings of capitalism, or get punished for asking them by the media – which is precisely what has transpired over the past 30 years. Among political economy scholars, interest in “varieties of capitalism” blossomed during the 1990s, at the same time that liberal democracies were abandoning the question of “capitalism or socialism?” in favour of a question about which kind of capitalism. Before winning power, New Labour was tempted by Germanic visions of “stakeholder capitalism” proposed by Will Hutton, but Gordon Brown came to the conclusion that Britain’s flexible labour market was too valuable an asset, especially given stubbornly high unemployment on the continent at the time. The economist David Soskice, whose 2001 book Varieties of Capitalism (edited with Peter Hall) is still the handbook for this mode of analysis, supposedly convinced Brown that he was far better off streamlining Britain’s existing, flexible “model” than seeking to impose a set of constraints upon the labour market in search of a new one. Before long, the entire question of economic “models” fell by the wayside. Brown, meanwhile, rolled out a system of tax credits, that brushed the social consequences of a low-wage economy under the carpet. It wasn’t until 2011, with capitalism in crisis and the bookish Ed Miliband leading the Labour party, that such questions were resuscitated. In place of New Labour’s usual bland paeans to “business”, Miliband sought to draw a line between the economy’s “predators” and “producers” – a truthful recognition that British capitalism had become a playground for asset-strippers, speculators and monopolists. It was shot down in the press as evidence of “Red Ed’s” dangerous Marxism. From 2015-19, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell upped the ante, developing a left populism that accused the super-rich of “rigging” the economy. In their eagerness to side with the majority of workers, they went into the 2019 general election promising to target just 150 “billionaires”: not so much a failed economic “model” as a tiny parasitical clique. By retreating back to the New Labour tactic of praising “business” and promising “economic prosperity” in general, Starmer has abandoned any such critique. The manifold differences between, say, a private equity fund extracting profits from a care home by squeezing wages and a family-owned exporter of machine tools, become obscured all over again. In his bid to look economically serious, Starmer has had to avoid making serious economic distinctions. In a public culture that rewards mendacity, a liar such as Johnson ends up with more licence to raise such topics, so long as and he doesn’t do so with any serious intent and Labour remains silent about them. Economic reality cannot, of course, be wished away altogether with bluster and humour. But among the dysfunctions of Westminster is the fact that economic outcomes may eventually be determined by two policy areas that are no longer up for democratic debate: Brexit and monetary policy. Johnson can bluff about productivity and immigration all he likes, but neither he nor Starmer will stand up in public and highlight manifest connections between Britain’s chosen Brexit deal and logistical chaos. And he can troll the Confederation of British Industry all he likes by celebrating wage increases, but if inflation runs above 2% for long enough, the independent Bank of England is duty bound to respond by raising interest rates. The effect this may have on an already-inflated housing market may pose him far greater political problems than wage inflation, but that’s how Britain’s economic model works. If he really wants to change it by design, and not merely revel in the current chaos, he’s got his work cut out. William Davies is a sociologist and political economist.

2021-06-13T06:00:53Z,Seven Ways to Change the World by Gordon Brown; Go Big by Ed Miliband review – what’s the new idea?,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/13/seven-ways-to-change-the-world-by-gordon-brown-go-big-by-ed-miliband-review-whats-the-new-idea,"Among the things Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband have in common, apart from electoral defeat to David Cameron, is a fascination with the best of all possible worlds. That compulsion, which fuels both of these books, might be thought of as the globalist gene, the unbending faith that things can only get better if people would only listen harder to the wisdom of progressive thinktanks. Their twin “how to fix it all” volumes are published pointedly ahead of a quartet of global summits that neither will attend: the G7 meeting in Cornwall this weekend, August’s nuclear non-proliferation conference at the UN, the G20 summit in Italy in October and the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November. To Brown, these meetings represent, post-Trump and, tentatively, post-Covid, “the opportunity to unwind the protectionism of the last decade and reactivate international collaboration”. You can only trust that President Xi of China and comrade Putin, not to mention our own Brexity prime minister, have received advanced copies of his book. It is, perhaps, not surprising that Brown retains an optimistic view of such gatherings. He is one of a handful of politicians who can claim to have used them to effect lasting change – first in brokering the deal to Drop the Debt at the 2005 Gleneagles Summit, wiping out £30bn of legacy obligations in developing countries, and second in heroically coordinating the recapitalisation of the global economy after the banking crisis of 2008. His “seven ways to change the world” imagine similar “cometh the hour” interventions, full of technocratic chutzpah. As he likes to say, in a phrase that presupposes a different world to that in which we live, “global problems require global solutions”. Brown, at 70, directs his formidable attention to what he calls “ungoverned spaces”, by which he means not rogue states and lawless regions, but the crises that national governments acting alone cannot reach – the polluted oceans and expanding deserts, the tax-haven black holes and the vulnerable tech of thermonuclear defence – not to mention the threadbare blanket of global health provision, harshly spotlit by the pandemic. His prescriptions for these crises, current and potential, focus unsurprisingly on making the institutions formed in the post-colonial 20th century – the UN, the World Health Organization, the World Bank – fit and funded for the urgent challenges of the 21st century. His chapters dwell on the mechanics of future pandemic prevention, the architecture of a global Green New Deal, a plan to deliver education to every child, the abolition of tax havens and the elimination of nuclear weapons. Characteristically, his interest lies less in storytelling than in political analysis; there is sometimes a depth of detailed structural economic wisdom that might keep Treasury whiz kids on the edge of their ergonomic seats, but less so the general reader. Brown describes his solutions as “on the credible end of desirable”. Though he has a chapter entitled “Tackling populist nationalism head on”, the tone of his argument retains a sense that any deviation from the idea of the world as he describes it is a kind of irritant to be brushed aside in the manner of Gillian Duffy (“that bigoted woman”) on the 2010 campaign trail. It may be true that the solutions to all of the problems he describes are rooted “in a multi-global not just bi-polar world” and that the “block in all areas lies in a seductive and corrosive force – nationalism”, but he has little interest in pursuing a closer understanding of those most stubborn human traits, good and bad, that irrationally resist change and cling to tribe and tradition. Why can’t they just see sense? Ed Miliband was for a decade Brown’s special adviser – in the habit in those years, as he writes here, of unplugging all his phones on weekend mornings to avoid another lecture from his boss. His book, which originates from a podcast called Reasons to Be Cheerful that he co-launched with radio presenter Geoff Lloyd in autumn 2017, is chattier than that of his former mentor, more anecdotal in its approach to saving the world (in the advance publicity for the book you could be forgiven for believing it was a memoir about how Miliband came late to learning to ride a bike but now has the zeal of the converted). Still, the “Go Big” of the title argues that the scale of the crises we face must define the scale of the solution. The fragile, debt-swamped economy of the post-pandemic world requires radical reshaping rather than piecemeal tinkering. Miliband is a listener where Brown is a preacher, and he draws inspiration from wherever he can find it: Franklin Roosevelt, Icelandic female strikers, Paul Stephenson and the Bristol bus boycott. At the heart of his argument is a truism with which no reader of this paper would be likely to disagree: “We can’t remake the high-carbon unjust world as the zero-carbon unjust world.” What follows is the outline (none of it set in stone) of “a renewed social contract” that involves at least 20 clauses. It’s a familiar wishlist, but one set out with likable energy: a Green New Deal, universal basic income (or a one-off “freedom dividend”), stakeholder capitalism, a living wage for carers, better work-life balance, a calling to account of big tech and its billionaires, cycle lanes, citizens’ assemblies, fossil fuel divestment… When it comes to the question of how these ideals are to be brought about, Miliband seems to believe, despite a good deal of decent evidence to the contrary, that a collective sea change in the observable motivation of nations and individuals might well be imminent. “We need to recognise a different set of values if we are to tackle the challenges we face,” he writes. “We do care about each other, we do have a deep well of empathy…” That “we” becomes so insistent in the course of his book that you start to wonder who he means by it – all of his likely readers? All world leaders? All of humanity? If the politics of the past five years, or the past 50 years, has taught us anything, it might perhaps be that the wisdom of Dr Pangloss only gets you so far.

2021-03-21T07:00:49Z,Value(s) by Mark Carney review – call for a new kind of economics,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/21/values-by-mark-carney-review-call-for-a-new-kind-of-economics,"If 25 years ago anyone had suggested that one of the world’s most prominent ex-central bankers would launch an intellectual broadside at free market fundamentalism for shredding the values on which good societies and functioning markets are based, I would have been amazed. If, in addition, it was suggested he would go on to argue that stakeholder capitalism, socially motivated investing and business putting purpose before profit were the best ways to put matters right, I would have considered it a fairy story. Although writing in this vein in the mid-1990s made my book The State We’re In one of the past century’s political bestsellers, the newly elected Labour government was terrified of going near most of it for fear of being cast as anti-business and interventionist. Now Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England until this time last year, has turned his hand to driving ideas once considered eccentric into the mainstream. In a mix of rich analysis mixed with pages that read like a dry Bank of England minute, he blames the three great crises of our times – the financial crash, the pandemic and the climate emergency (he is the UN’s special envoy on climate action and finance) – on twisted economics, an accompanying amoral culture, and degraded institutions whose lack of accountability and integrity accelerate the system’s dysfunction. Thus banks lost control of reality in a fantasy world in which balance sheets could grow exponentially without risk – another market would handle that – indulged by governments and regulators who believed that markets were always right. Then came the Covid pandemic, for which western governments were singularly unready, relying on dubious cost-benefit analysis rather than valuing what we as humans tend to – our lives and looking out for one another. The same mistake is being made with climate change. The embrace of markets and their “subjective” valuations has led to a society that has been robbed of its capacity, declares Carney, to express what is important to us. His seven key values are: solidarity, fairness, responsibility, resilience, sustainability, dynamism and humility – all laced with compassion. That leads to three key components of any good society: fairness between the generations, in the distribution of income and of life chances. He opens Value(s) citing Pope Francis at a Bank of England lunch deploring how current trends are turning the wine of humanity into a toxic grappa of self-interest – and ends by hoping that his book can turn grappa back into wine. He has succeeded: Value(s) is something of a landmark achievement. Carney is at his most sure-footed and convincing on the rise of a market society and the accompanying decline of values. We are at the risk of being overwhelmed by “a utopia of wealth and a dystopia of personal relations”, as one economist he quotes puts it. The book provides an original condemnation of today’s economics as surrendering the quest for objective value grounded in the essence of our humanity. As markets best reflect our subjective preferences, there is nothing to be done except surrender to their will. And the same process is being extended deep into our social marrow – even to health and the value placed on lives. Of course, as he readily concedes, markets unleash energy and dynamism, but to believe that they are always right and cannot be altered is to sign up to a quasi-religious faith. He scorns persistent market fables – “this time will be different” (the most expensive words in English, as he says), “markets always clear” and “markets are moral”. The 10 pages in which he takes down these myths are worth the book alone. His ringside seat account of the financial crash, when his pre-emptive actions at the Bank of Canada helped insulate the country from the worst of the crisis, along with his damning diagnosis of early 21st-century banking, are gripping. His argument that companies that are driven by creating an intrinsic purpose from which they derive profit fare best over time both for themselves and society is among the best summations I have read. He is right that the growing number of purposeful companies that are committing to end their own – and even their clients’ and supply chains’ – carbon emissions by 2050 if not before is a source of optimism. But I’m not sure that, together with better reporting and more sophisticated risk management, this will do as much heavy lifting as he hopes. He knows you need an active state as well – but his recommendations on that score are less than full-blooded. The early chapters on economists’ struggles over the centuries (including an account of Magna Carta’s role in the story) to understand value will be difficult to negotiate for non-economists. It’s a pity: an early taste of Carney opening his shoulders and going for it, as he does later, would persuade the general reader to stick with important arguments. There are alarming omissions too. No mention, for example, of Karl Polanyi’s still unsurpassed account in The Great Transformation of how 19th-century society was so undermined by excessive marketisation that fascism and communism resulted. He is an uncertain guide through the pros and cons of utilitarianism and its current guise, cost benefit analysis; he simultaneously recognises the need for putting some numbers on the costs and wider welfare benefits of policies while recoiling from the cruelties it can throw up. I’m not sure where ultimately he stands. But the sweep and aim of Value(s) remains magnificent. It will help arm the best in business, finance and government and disarm the worst.

2021-02-07T08:14:25Z,"Yes, Britain’s vaccine rollout is a triumph. But let’s not kid ourselves it proves the Brexit case | Will Hutton",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/07/britains-vaccine-rollout-a-triumph-lets-not-kid-ourselves-it-proves-brexit-case,"Europeans are circling the wagons around the beleaguered EU president, Ursula von der Leyen, amid the wreckage of her European “health union” and unilateral, short-lived suspension of the Northern Ireland protocol. The desire for a pan-European approach to vaccine procurement and distribution was in essence right, say German and French leaders – Covid knows no borders and Europe must fight as a whole. Nor were the delivery failures of her making. On Northern Ireland, she could hardly have reversed her self-acknowledged bad decision more quickly. Rally to the EU president. The defenders of her and the commission are wrong. Both the dilatory procurement and risk-averse delivery strategy were self-made disasters, originating in a centralised federal mindset that does not work. Europe can only emerge stronger, beating back mounting criticism across the continent over vaccine shortages, if it looks the failures in the eye and radically reorients itself. At the same time, Boris Johnson’s government is winning plaudits. Under intense pressure, it rolled the dice, secured an exclusive vaccine contract with AstraZeneca by paying hundreds of millions upfront, before regulatory approval, to allow the building of UK vaccine production capacity. He has reaped the rewards. Similarly generous contracts were struck with other suppliers – the hope was that enough vaccine would work to justify the spending. So it proved. On top, a well-prepared NHS has rolled out the vaccinations with stunning efficiency. The “freedom” of Brexit is justified, chirrup delighted Brexiters. Again wrong. Brexit remains a self-inflicted disaster growing worse by the day – witness the mounting chaos in our ports and the suffocation of exporters and the service sector alike through their exclusion from the single market and customs union. Exports to the EU down an extraordinary 68% in January. As for “freedom”, Britain always had the right to opt out of the EU’s regulatory directives. The NHS, with its foundational socialist commitment to equal health for all, would have worked well in any circumstances. But the Tories are the English nationalist party – they can be no other. Johnson and Rishi Sunak may say they want the alchemy of a proactive, agile government working hand in hand with innovative companies – a classic European social market approach – across the board. But in reality they blunder on with reheated Thatcherism as their core reflex policy (only last week bids for 10 new free ports in England closed) and insist that the escalating Brexit-induced crises in business and the City are “teething problems”. Nationalist hyper-Thatcherites are never going to implement the aggressive social market capitalist policies needed to “build back better”, or strike the deals, involving compromises over “sovereignty”, vital for future prosperity. Mainland Europeans should also heed the lessons. AstraZeneca, as part of its deal with Oxford University, aims to produce 2 billion doses of its vaccine for Europe, the US and the world at $3 a jab – less than a cup of coffee – and far cheaper than its more venal rivals. It is a social market, stakeholder-capitalism success story, as has been the UK government’s public-private vaccination policy. However, vaccines are not produced like widgets and yields can disappoint – the reason for being unable to supply the EU with 100 million jabs by the end of March. But soon US regulators will give it the green light too. AstraZeneca did not deserve President Macron giving succour to the army of anti-vaxxers, particularly in France, by falsely saying the vaccine did not work for the over-65s – even as he colluded with Von der Leyen in trying to bully the British into surrendering their contracted supplies to the EU. Nor should Angela Merkel tamely rally behind her ex-colleague Von der Leyen; her finance minister, Olaf Scholz, was more on the money when he said that neither Germany nor Europe could afford “to let this shit repeat itself”. Amen to that. The commission should never have arrogated vaccine procurement and distribution to itself as if it were a Soviet planner. It had neither the expertise nor experience. It should have stuck firmly to a tried and tested social market approach, delegating the response to member states while ensuring there was no bidding war, along with a robust system for intra-EU vaccine sharing. It should have been devising an EU-wide approach to contest the anti-vaxxers and have abjured vaccine nationalism to the last, never blockading Northern Ireland. Nonetheless its proposition – that no European is safe until every European is safe – is right. It must stand by it. However, instead of luxuriating in a “freedom” that, when it works, is thoroughly European, Britain should be thinking of how to find its way back to the European mainstream and make those values live in Europe as much as Britain. Future economic and business success does not lie in joining the trans-Pacific partnership, which accounts for some 8% of our trade, or in free ports, havens for business malpractice and “deregulation”. They are no compensation for what we are losing as European supply chains collapse along with open access to European markets, hitting industries as varied as music and fishing. The City of London, tax cow for the nation, desperately needs a deep and binding financial services EU treaty if it is to prosper, not the minimalism of a scant and rickety temporary deal, which anyway the government seems reluctant to negotiate. If only Von der Leyen had trusted Europe to be its social market self, with a proper balance between speed and equity and with the commission as steward and referee, the EU would now be awash with vaccines. Equally, whatever success Britain has in future will be because it, too, is finding its way to be “European”. Brexit’s destiny is to be the trigger for that realisation in both Britain and the continent. A first step for Britain will be a return to the single market and customs union, and, because it cannot be a rule taker, it must and will eventually rejoin the EU, an EU that has also learned some lessons. It may take a decade, but it will happen, because it must. Warts and all, we stand together as Europeans. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Brexit; European Union; Ursula von der Leyen; Coronavirus; Vaccines and immunisation; Politics; Europe,Opinion
2020-01-25T11:22:52Z,The high priests of plutocracy all meet at Davos. What good can come from that? | Cas Mudde,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/25/davos-world-economic-forum-capitalism-plutocracy,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an odd event, but also the perfect insight into the problems of political activism in today’s world. Every year a select(ed) group of a few thousand people travel to the remote Swiss town of Davos, many in their own or their corporate private planes, to discuss the global economic, political and social issues of the day, including climate change. Economic leaders rub shoulders with political leaders, and prominent social activists provide a flavor of social responsibility. For years now the media have been writing that the WEF takes place as “capitalism is in crisis”, but while this might be true in general, the vast majority of the WEF participants continue to do well. They have learned to adapt to criticism, be it from the anti-globalization movement of the 1990s or from the far right today. Include the most malleable, shower them with praise, write a communique that you have understood their message, make some cosmetic changes and continue with what you have been doing from the beginning. The WEF 2020 meeting was yet another example of this routine. It touted its “young change-makers”, who entertained the old(er) change-frustraters with passionate speeches about issues like climate change, gun violence, pollution and racism. Obviously, “Greta” (who no longer needs a last name) was there, holding the grownups to account, playing on their parental guilt, and giving the international media the quotes they came for: “Our house is still on fire.” There are also some “old change-makers”, less touted but more respected, most notably impeached president Donald Trump. He had dominated the 2017 WEF in absence, surprised his audience as a “pragmatist” in 2018, and skipped Davos again in 2019. This year he returned to boast about “his” economic accomplishments, using it both as a distraction from the impeachment trials and as part of the permanent re-election campaign. While his speech was full of distortions and lies, as usual, it raised few concerns among the Davos crowd. Trump has long been domesticated and (the people who drive) the markets love him. In an op-ed in the Guardian last week, which was much debated and mocked on social media, self-proclaimed co-founder of Occupy Wall Street Micah White explained why he was “headed to Davos”. Allegedly, there is a “hidden Davos”, and White was going on a great discovery expedition to find it. “In the hidden Davos,” according to White, “opposing social forces, activists and elites, can put their egos and personas aside to speak freely and find common cause for joint action on the global crises that impact us all – from income inequality to climate change.” I don’t know whether he found it, but based on the first 50 years of the World Economic Forum, this “hidden Davos” has proven to be fairly irrelevant. Sure, Davos has helped elevate the public profile of important activists and voices for change, including “Greta” and my fellow Dutchman Rutger Bregman, last year. But neither has changed the agenda of the World Economic Forum, let alone the priorities of the economic and political elites. In essence, the World Economic Forum is the high priest of plutocracy, ie rule by the ultra-wealthy. It is a good example of the enduring ideological legacy of neoliberalism, an often-ignored aspect of neoliberal hegemony. While states have held on to significant control over national economies, national politicians have largely renounced their power over the economy and politics. Believing that “the market” is the best mechanism to solve every issue, from employment to healthcare, economists and entrepreneurs are now seen as the best problem solvers for our political problems. Whether through “stakeholder capitalism” – the official theme of WEF 2020, which sounds meaningful, but is so vague that it is meaningless – or through the philanthropy by billionaires like Bill Gates and George Soros, the plutocrats set the priorities of social change and activists like “Greta” and celebrities like “Bono” can at best tinker at the margins. As the US writer Anand Giridharadas does not tire of emphasizing, the “plutocrats’ phony religion” of philanthropy is no substitute for the state. And neither is “stakeholder capitalism” or whatever expensive rebranding the Davos crowd come up with to sell their old wine in new bottles. They are not fundamentally changing the exploitative nature of capitalism, of both nature and people, and will not stand up to authoritarian leaders – in fact, they often embrace them. So, rather than fawning over billionaires who donate tiny percentages of their massive wealth to issues of their choosing or providing entertainment and normative cover for exploitative big business, activists for social change should call for stricter regulation and fairer taxes by their individual states. Only then will they have a true opportunity to regain control over the political agenda and will they, rather than the plutocrats, be able to decide which issues to focus on and how to support them.

2020-01-19T06:00:50Z,Trump is on trial for abusing his power – the Davos elites should join him | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-abuse-power-davos,"As the Senate debates Donald Trump’s future, chief executives, financiers and politicians will descend on Davos in the Swiss Alps for their annual self-congratulatory defense of global capitalism. The events are not unrelated. Trump is charged with abusing his power. Capitalism’s global elite is under assault for abusing its power as well: fueling inequality, fostering corruption and doing squat about climate change. Chief executives of the largest global corporations are raking in more money and at a larger multiple of their workers’ pay than at any time in history. The world’s leading financiers are pocketing even more. The 26 richest people on Earth now own as much as the 3.8 billion who form the poorer half of the planet’s population. Concentrated wealth on this scale invites corruption. Across the world, big money is buying off politicians to procure favors that further enlarge the wealth of those at the top, while siphoning off resources from everyone else. Corruption makes it impossible to fight stagnant wages, climate change or any other problem facing the vast majority of the world’s population that would require some sacrifice by the rich. Popular anger is boiling over against elites seen as irredeemably greedy, corrupt and indifferent to the plight of most people struggling to get by. The anger has fueled uprisings in Chile, Spain, Ecuador, Lebanon, Egypt and Bolivia; environmental protests in the UK, Germany, Austria, France and New Zealand; and xenophobic politics in the US, the UK, Brazil and Hungary. Trump’s support comes largely from America’s working class whose wages haven’t risen in decades, whose jobs are less secure than ever and whose political voice has been drowned out by big money. Although Trump has given corporations and Wall Street everything they’ve wanted and nothing has trickled down to his supporters, he has convinced those supporters he’s on their side by channeling their rage on to foreigners, immigrants, minorities and “deep state” bureaucrats. It seems strangely appropriate, therefore, that the theme of this year’s Davos conclave is “stakeholder capitalism” – the idea that corporations have a responsibility to their workers, communities and the environment as well as to their shareholders. Expect endless speeches touting the “long-term” benefits of stakeholder capitalism to corporate bottom lines: happy workers are more productive. A growing middle class can buy more goods and services. Climate change is beginning to cost a bundle in terms of environmental calamities and insurance, so it must be stopped. All true, but the assembled CEOs know they’ll get richer far quicker if they boost equity values in the short term by buying back their shares of stock, suppressing wages, fighting unions, resisting environmental regulations and buying off politicians for tax cuts and subsidies. This has been their strategy for three decades, and it’s about to get worse. Three researchers – Daniel Greenwald at MIT’s Sloan School, Martin Lettau at Berkeley and Sydney Ludvigson at NYU – found that between 1952 and 1988, economic growth accounted for 92% of the rise in equity values. But since 1989 most of the increase has come from “reallocated rents to shareholders and away from labor compensation”. In other words, from workers. What this means is that in order for the stock market to do as well in coming years, either economic growth has to accelerate markedly (highly unlikely), or chief executives will have to siphon off even more of the gains from growth from workers and other stakeholders to their shareholders. This is likely to require even more downward pressure on wages, more payoffs to politicians for tax cuts and subsidies and further rollbacks of environmental regulations. All of which will worsen the prevailing discontent. There will be no mention at Davos of any of this, nor of the increasing political and economic power of these elites and the diminishing power of average workers and citizens around the world. Nothing will be achieved in the Swiss Alps because the growing global discontent has yet to affect the bottom lines of the corporations and financial institutions whose leaders are assembling to congratulate themselves on their wealth, influence and benevolence. Trump, meanwhile, is likely to be acquitted by Senate Republicans who are so cowardly and unprincipled that they will ignore his flagrantly unconstitutional acts. Trump plans to speak at Davos, by the way: an impeached president addressing world economic leaders while being tried in the Senate. He’ll probably boast about the stock market, bully and lie, as usual. One thing he won’t say is that the whatever-it-takes abuses of economic and political power such as he and much of his audience are engaged in threaten to destroy capitalism, democracy and the planet.

2019-11-03T09:00:10Z,Elizabeth Warren’s project is to remake capitalism. What can British politicians learn from her? | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/03/elizabeth-warren-project-to-remake-capitalism-what-can-british-politicians-learn-from-her,"For 40 years, western democracies have been gripped by the doctrine that unalloyed capitalism works. In 2019, the debate has moved on. Capitalism may rule the planet, but it plainly needs fixing. Disaffection is obvious and rising, variously behind the story of riots in Chile or Hong Kong or Britain’s Brexit vote and France’s gilets jaunes. No economist would now claim, as the Nobel prizewinner Robert Lucas once did, that the central economic problem of depression-prevention is settled: markets are always right. Nor would any central banker now repeat the infamous aphorism of Alan Greenspan, former chair of the US Federal Reserve, that he “had never seen a constructive regulation yet”. The case for austerity, “expansionary fiscal contraction”, as George Osborne dubbed it, is plainly risible. It is a new world. Book review pages are larded with titles critiquing current capitalism. The evidence of our eyes and daily experience – stagnating real wages, phenomenal inequality, indifferent public services, companies adrift, rampaging private equity, grotesque monopoly, a growth in food banks and rough sleeping – demand change. The Financial Times knows it can run a full-blooded campaign calling for “Capitalism. Time for a reset”, confident that few in the business world or economics profession will dare challenge the proposition. In August, 181 CEOs of the top US companies signed a declaration: their aim was not only to serve their shareholders by maximising short-term profits, it was “to create value for all their stakeholders” and the betterment of society at large. This is stakeholder capitalism, US-style – with business taking a lead. In the US, two politicians unambiguously of the left – Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – are riding this wave and vying for the Democrat presidential nomination. Centrist candidates offering just a touch of the tiller so as not to offend business are dismissed as trimmers before the hurricane. Warren, champion of vigorous stakeholder capitalism and a recast US social contract, challenges the businesses that signed the declaration to back her, something Sanders, an outright socialist and enemy of business, cannot do. If Warren wins the nomination, she is projected by many pollsters to be able to beat Donald Trump. It is true that for some years Sanders has won an astonishing degree of support in a US where socialism is seen as the credo of the antichrist. He is the US’s Jeremy Corbyn, a builder of a youthful social movement whose imagination is fired by his sweeping indictment of what unfettered capitalism is doing to US society and his championing of transformative, across-the-board, state-led change. He ran Hillary Clinton close in the Democratic primaries four years ago and, even at 78, just recovering from a minor heart attack, is doing well again. But not well enough, as Warren is overtaking him. Capitalism certainly needs a reset and its worst proclivities prevented, she argues passionately; but equally, when it works as it can be made to, it is still the most impressive instrument we have to create wealth. “Markets are what make us rich,” she says. “They are what creates opportunity.” The role of government is not to subsume markets. Rather, it is to set vigorous regulatory frameworks that attack monopoly, promote competition and outlaw noxious practices. It can also empower countervailing forces, notably trade unions and public agencies to support high-risk new technologies and create a social contract that as far as possible takes the sting and risk out of ordinary people’s lives – from healthcare to pensions. Capitalism needs constant superintendence and if it starts to undermine societal cohesion, it must be stopped at the gate. Warren is today’s embodiment of the great reforming US tradition of the Roosevelts, the Kennedys and Lyndon Johnson. Her chosen enemies are the hi-tech titans of the west coast, whose monopolistic control needs to be unscrambled and recent takeovers unwound. The tax breaks of the vast private equity industry, slicing and dicing viable companies for extravagant personal gain, need to be withdrawn. And the Wall Street investment banks’ connections with commercial banking need to be ringfenced. Her aim is to create a new generation of great US stakeholder companies, complete with empowered workforces represented on boards, who would be bound by law to take their responsibilities to consumers, suppliers and the environment fundamentally seriously. She advocates an interlinked series of initiatives to lower and eliminate carbon emissions, in areas ranging from agriculture to transport in support of the Green New Deal. She will raise taxes on rich individuals and businesses alike. Last week, she proposed doubling her mooted wealth tax and introducing a financial transactions tax to pay for a free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare system. That is on top of proposed tax increases to pay for free college education and universal childcare, and more extensive training. For almost every ill, Warren has a plan. Indeed, the range and details of her plans has become the hallmark for which she is sometimes lampooned. She is, of course, for aggressive gun control laws and against corporate lobbying. Yet for all her radicalism, she stays connected to the centre, in part because she abjures Sanders-style socialism and in part because the centre itself is moving left. Warren speaks to everyday concerns – dread of mass shootings, fearfulness over student debt, worry over wages and a sense that west coast hi-tech has become a 21st-century Big Brother. She gains more traction by the week. These concerns are present in Britain too. Wherever Boris Johnson’s Europhobic Tories stand on Europe, voters know they are not the party that recognises the need to address today’s multiple societal grievances. But there are other lessons from the US. For Labour, it is not to go too far in emulating Sanders’s embrace of “transformatory socialism”; for the Lib Dems, it is to make sure they don’t shrink from the same opportunities propelling Warren to the presidency. British voters, like their US counterparts, may not want a socialist transformation of capitalism, but they certainly want to see it reset and reshaped. This is the moment for bold stakeholder capitalism. It must be seized. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Elizabeth Warren; US elections 2020; US news; Politics; US politics; UK news; Socialism; Gilets jaunes protests; Hong Kong,Opinion
2020-01-20T18:34:13Z,The Guardian view on Davos: capitalists know they must do better | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/the-guardian-view-on-davos-capitalists-know-they-must-do-better,"When Klaus Schwab founded the World Economic Forum in an Alpine ski resort in 1971, he wasn’t to know that the 30-year postwar boom was on its last legs. The original idea of Davos was to promote the German economist’s big idea of “multi-stakeholding” – the notion that companies had broader social responsibilities than the mere pursuit of profit for shareholders. But the subsequent oil crisis, stagflation and recession put paid to any progressive thinking in the boardrooms of the west. As corporate revenues plunged, a different economist laid the theoretical foundations of a new era. By the 1980s, Milton Friedman’s claim that “there is one and only one social responsibility of business ... to engage in activities designed to increase its profits” was the new common sense in business, particularly in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain and Ronald Reagan’s America. Since then, financial deregulation and digitalisation have created the conditions for footloose capital to call the shots in a global economy. The figure of “Davos man” – and only 24% of this year’s attendees are women – has become synonymous with a certain kind of deracinated corporate executive, whose only loyalties and obligations are to the balance sheet. But on the WEF’s 50th anniversary, Mr Schwab, now 81, has gamely tried to go back to where he began, making “stakeholder capitalism” the theme of this week’s gathering, and updating the notion of stakeholders to include those concerned to protect the interests of the warming planet. A wholesale CEO conversion to values of social and environmental solidarity, over the cocktails, would be somewhat surprising. For over 30 years, wages in western economies have stagnated as the proceeds of growth have been funnelled towards shareholders. An Oxfam study last year revealed that the 26 richest billionaires own as many assets as the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of the planet’s population. And Davos 2020 will offer the usual paradoxes that accompany the alleged good intentions of the super-rich, from the private jets which fly business leaders in to discuss global heating, to the $500-plus hotel rooms from which they will review papers on growing inequality. Something is in the air though. There is evidence that, when it comes to defining the bottom line, the huge societal challenges of the 21st century are prompting a rethink at the vertices of western economic decision-making. The climate emergency, rising nationalism, seismic shocks such as Brexit and China’s emergence as an economic superpower have all undermined the case for pursuing business as usual; some of the world’s largest corporations appear to have realised that they risk serious reputational damage if they do so. Last summer, nearly 200 American CEOs, including the leaders of Apple and Pepsi, committed their companies to sustainable practices and fairer wages. Microsoft last week pledged to be carbon negative by 2030 and announced a $1bn innovation fund to develop carbon reduction technology. The devil will be in the detail of course. And this week, Donald Trump, who is in the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change, will strike quite a different tone on the Swiss slopes. But as Mark Carney and, yesterday , the IMF, have pointed out, the existential threat represented by global heating menaces company profits as well as lives, homes and communities. That is a truth that might have given even Milton Friedman pause for thought. Five decades on, Mr Schwab’s big idea might at last be about to get a proper hearing. • This article was amended on 21 January 2020.

2020-01-24T10:15:21Z,Millionaires like me should pay more taxes. Giving to charity is a fig leaf | Chuck Collins,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/millionaires-like-me-should-pay-more-taxes-giving-to-charity-is-a-fig-leaf,"World leaders, powerful corporate executives and influential activists will come together this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. At the top of the agenda is “stakeholder capitalism” – the idea that corporations should consider the interests of all stakeholders, including employees, customers and communities, not just those of their own shareholders. To be sure, if there was ever a moment to recognize that we are all in it together – regardless of race, creed and class – it is now. The ecological catastrophe fueled by climate change and the socio-economic upheaval threatened by grotesque inequalities of wealth and power have the potential to destroy everything we care about. Based on a mountain of inter-disciplinary evidence, it’s clear that extreme inequalities of income, wealth and opportunity undermine democratic institutions, destabilize healthy economic activity, fuel social unrest, and prevent us from nimbly responding to ecological threats. Yet our global economy is on inequality autopilot, funneling wealth upwards at a dizzying pace. A couple thousand billionaires now hold more than half the world’s wealth and with it, much of the power to change things – or to block change, as has been the case for decades. So it would seem a positive sign that many of those billionaires will be joining policymakers and activists this week in Davos to discuss how best to go about changing things. The problem? As last year’s Forum showed, the singular most impactful thing they could do is generally the last thing they want to talk about: that is, paying higher taxes. In many countries, the wealthy pay lower effective tax rates than those with modest means. Without this revenue, governments plead austerity or take on nihilistic levels of debt. Meanwhile, a wealth-defense industry of tax lawyers and wealth planners spend their waking hours gaming tax laws and hiding trillions in wealth. An estimated 10 to 12% of the world’s wealth is hidden in a maze of offshore secrecy jurisdiction, trusts and shell companies. A recent IMF study estimates that 40% of foreign direct investment – about $15tn – passes through “empty corporate shells” with “no real business activities”. This hidden wealth isn’t basking on a Caribbean island. Billions are flowing into luxury real estate investments. The cranes rising across our major cities, constructing luxury towers, are an affront to residents facing a crisis in affordable housing. In many countries, we are seeing a breakdown in social cohesion and a rise in xenophobic nationalism and political extremism. People understandably believe the system is rigged against them, fueling a sense of unfairness and diminished social trust. This process of pulling apart, both within countries and between nations, will all but guarantee that the global community will further polarize and fail to adequately respond to the looming climate catastrophe. This will be disastrous for everyone, including the planet’s billionaires and millionaires. The choice is stark: do we want pitchforks or a working tax system? As a member of the US-based Patriotic Millionaires, which is composed of millionaires and billionaires from around the world advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy, I agree with Dutch historian Rutger Bregman, who said last year, “Stop talking about philanthropy and start talking about taxes.” The bloom has come off the charitable rose. Perhaps the public has started to realize that billionaire philanthropy has become a taxpayer-subsidized extension of private power, another elaborate tax dodge. The Patriotic Millionaires have convened an initial group of 123 millionaires and billionaires from eight countries with a global call to action. We believe that taxes are the best and only appropriate way to ensure adequate investment in the things our societies need. We agree with the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva: “Marginal tax rates can be raised without sacrificing economic growth.” Unfortunately these are things that won’t get the attention they should this week. The inconvenient truth is that the best solution to our most pressing problems may cause some discomfort for many of those invited to Davos. Yet every solution to the global challenges we face requires higher taxes on millionaires and billionaires like us. That’s why we urge others with wealth to accept this simple fact and help us get about the business of repairing our fractured world – including working together to advance effective tax systems within our respective countries and internationally. Our invitation, to our fellow global millionaires and billionaires, is nothing less than to rejoin humanity. Park your private jet and root yourself in a community – not a wealthy enclave but a real community of people and relationships of reciprocity. Bring your wealth home. Bring it out from the shadows, the tax havens, the opaque trusts and secret accounts. Shift capital out of the speculative financial sector and deploy it in service of humanity. Invest in places and in the rooted enterprises that produce the food, goods and services that people depend on. Share your wealth while recognizing that philanthropy is not a substitute for adequately funded governments at the local, state and federal level. Pay your fair share of taxes. Redeploy the professionals who have spent decades working to reduce your taxes down and hide your wealth. Engage with your families and peers and invite them to join this effort and sign our Call to Action. Encourage them to pay their taxes. The hour is getting late and we may not be able to ask again.

2019-08-25T17:07:55Z,US companies tell Apple and Amazon to put planet before profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/25/us-companies-tell-apple-and-amazon-to-put-planet-before-profits,"The bosses of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple and Amazon, have been told to put the planet before profits – not by environmental campaigners but by other multinationals, including Danone’s US arm, and a unit of Unilever. A group of more than 30 American business leaders, including the heads of outdoor clothing brand Patagonia, The Body Shop owner Natura, Ben &amp; Jerry’s (part of Unilever) and Danone’s US business, have taken the extraordinary step of taking out a full-page ad in Sunday’s edition of the New York Times to champion a more ethical way of doing business. The advert is aimed at members of the influential Business Roundtable (BRT) lobby group, which represents 181 of the US’s biggest companies. The letter – addressed to the powerful group that includes Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, and Tim Cook, the boss of Apple – is designed to capitalise on the BRT’s recent landmark decision to change its definition of the “purpose of a corporation” from making money for shareholders to include broader goals such as caring for staff and the environment. “We are part of a community of certified B Corporations who are walking the walk of stakeholder capitalism,” said the open letter. “We are successful businesses that meet the highest standards of verified positive impact for our workers, customers, suppliers, communities and the environment. We operate with a better model of corporate governance – which gives us, and could give you, a way to combat short-termism and the freedom to make decisions to balance profit and purpose.” Billed as a fair trade label for companies, the B Corp movement describes itself as a “global movement of people using business as a force for good”. B Corps commit to focusing as much on social and environmental concerns as they do on profits – the so-called “triple bottom line”. Andrew Kassoy, the co-founder of B Lab, the charity tasked with growing the B Corp movement, said the BRT statement had been a “moment to celebrate”. He said: “It’s a significant cultural shift and represents some of the biggest multinationals in the US recognising the problem with shareholder primacy [making as much money as possible for investors]. That it is not producing the right kind of economic progress or addressing inequality or climate change in the way we would like it to.” The radical change to the mantra of corporate America comes after decades of following Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman’s philosophy, which dates from 1970, that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”. Kassoy said the shift was good news. He said: “The ad is challenging them [BRT] to take action and go beyond the words in the statement.” The B Corp movement is gaining momentum as the climate crisis coupled with rising inequality has made business leaders question what success looks like in the 21st century. So far more than 3,000 companies globally have become B Corps after completing a certification process, with chef Jamie Oliver recently revealing the ambition to turn his business empire into a B Corp.",Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Amazon; Apple; Business; Environment; Unilever,Business
2019-08-19T17:00:26Z,Is US capitalism really abandoning the 'greed is good' mantra? | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/19/is-us-capitalism-really-abandoning-the-greed-is-good-mantra,"Milton Friedman will be spinning in his grave at the heresy perpetrated by the US Business Roundtable. For the thick end of five decades US capitalism has been run along Friedmanite lines – namely that businesses are there to make money for their shareholders. No charitable giving, no diversity awareness. No green audits. Just making money. Period. Now some of the highest paid on the planet have appeared to ditch the idea of shareholder primacy. Sure, they say, shareholders matter but so do a range of other stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers and communities. Workers must be treated with dignity and respect. Businesses will be run sustainably in order to protect the environment. If it’s for real, this represents quite a sea change. Friedman’s essay for the New York Times in 1970 was hugely influential and has governed boardroom behaviour ever since. The whole “greed is good” philosophy that flowered in the 1980s was based on the economist’s idea that the sole task of executives was to enrich shareholders provided they played by the rules. But Friedman also said that playing by the rules meant more than obeying the law: it meant conforming to ethical custom. And in recent years there has been a shift in what the public considers to be right and wrong. The fact that CEOs have seen their pay rocket while average wages have stagnated is part of the story, but so too is the way in which profit-maximising companies have hollowed out communities by moving production offshore. Yet capitalism adapts to changing circumstances. It can survive and thrive where regulations are lax, as they are in the US. And it can flourish where regulations are tighter, as they are in Scandinavia. That’s why it has survived for so long and seen off previous challenges. And those presiding over US boardrooms can sense that politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have struck a chord with their calls for root-and-branch reform of business practices. There are those who will wonder just how genuine the move to stakeholder capitalism actually is, and they are right to be suspicious. The one-page statement is pretty woolly: there is, for example, talk of paying workers fairly but no commitment to pay them more. Better, the roundtablers might think, to take baby steps towards a more inclusive approach now than have a bunch of legislators on Capitol Hill force them into more drastic changes. That shrinking feeling The meeting between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel later this week is not likely to be especially fruitful but at least they will have something in common: both are presiding over shrinking economies. If anything, the short-term problems facing Germany are even greater than those affecting the UK. Europe’s biggest economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019 and, according to the country’s central bank, is on course to do so again in the third. Two consecutive quarters of falling output constitute a recession. The Bundesbank says Brexit and the slowdown in exports caused by global trade tensions are two big contributory factors to the slowdown. It’s a sign of how bad things are that the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, has pledged that €55bn (£50bn) could be spent to boost growth if it proves necessary. But there’s one thing saying the purse strings could be loosened and them actually being loosened. And Germany has not secured the reputation of being the most fiscally conservative country in Europe for nothing. In the meantime Johnson will be hoping that the travails of the German economy will make Merkel more willing to make Brexit compromises. No sign of them so far, though.",Economics; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Brexit; Germany; National Grid; Business; US news; UK news; Europe; World news,Business
2019-11-10T06:00:29Z,Not all Africans’ sacrifice is forgotten | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/10/letters-not-all-africans-sacrifice-forgotten-first-world-war,"I was saddened to read that many of the African soldiers and carriers who served with the British Army in east Africa during the First World War were buried in unmarked graves (“No graves, no dignity. How Britain dishonoured its African war dead”, Focus). The acknowledgment by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission of its past unequal treatment is at least a start in redressing the balance. However, while it may be true that memorials in east Africa do not give the names of individuals who fell, the situation is not the same in at least one southern African former colony: Nyasaland, now the independent state of Malawi. In the old colonial capital, Zomba, lies a memorial to men of the King’s African Rifles who fell in the war. The roll of honour starts with the names of the British commissioned and non-commissioned officers killed, but is followed by a long list of local men, headed “African Rank and File”, with each soldier given his name, rank and number, as on countless memorials throughout France and Belgium. If the individual graves were not marked, at least the sacrifice of these local men was duly commemorated. Melvin Hurst Ventnor, Isle of Wight In our often-divided times it is important to pause and reflect on the things that we share. This Remembrance Sunday, 75 years on from three pivotal battles of the Second World War – Monte Cassino, D-Day, and Kohima and Imphal – we should consider how soldiers from Britain and its allies from across the Commonwealth nations, the US and the free armies of Europe fought side by side to overcome adversity. We welcome this autumn the Remember Together initiative from British Future and the Royal British Legion, which brings communities together to mark our shared heritage. This history of service and sacrifice encompasses the stories of the Polish and Caribbean airmen who helped defend our skies, being marked in Boston, Lincolnshire; and the commemoration in Leicester of the 2.5 million-strong army from undivided India that fought for Britain in its hour of need. It is a message that we should share far and wide across the UK – that remembrance belongs to us all.

What can our politicians learn from her?”, Comment). But reform in the US, as in Britain, faces many challenges. The self-serving doctrine of “shareholder primacy” has to be exposed for what it is. The existence of executive-dominated unitary boards will resist cultural and institutional change that is designed to transform the way corporations and board directors operate. This is a fundamental obstacle to progress. My research over the years has examined stakeholder governance frameworks that have flourished in northern European jurisdictions for well over a century. Corporations in those jurisdictions are required by law to appoint and operate with independent supervisory boards. These boards reflect the interests of all stakeholders, including employees and shareholders. They oversee the activities of the executive board of management. This has fostered a very different style of corporate stewardship and corporate responsibility. Sad to say, these important differences are not widely understood or appreciated in English-speaking countries. The inner-directed nature in which corporate jurisprudence has evolved in both the US and Britain has created a powerful smokescreen. This has distorted our view of what wider purposes corporations have the potential to serve if they are governed appropriately. Richard Tudway, principal, The Centre for International Economics Burgess Hill, West Sussex On tonight’s menu: influence It was a welcome and thought-provoking article from Kevin McKenna regarding elected public servants “supplementing” their salaries with “consultant” fees (“If we bar politicians from lining their pockets in office, we might trust them”, Comment). He mentions the £100,000-a-seat Conservative party dinners and what diners might expect to get, over and above a good meal. It reminded me of a 2011 Vanity Fair article by Joseph Stiglitz: “During the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s – a scandal whose dimensions, by today’s standards, seem almost quaint – the banker Charles Keating was asked by a congressional committee whether the $1.5m he had spread among a few key elected officials could actually buy influence. ‘I certainly hope so,’ he replied.” Bob Pike St-Cyr-sur-Loire, France Why do people migrate? In writing about the deeper causes of the tragedies of Grenfell and Purfleet, Kenan Malik rightly refers to a “tendency to focus on the proximate causes of social tragedies and downplay more distant issues” (“From Grenfell to migrant deaths, we fail to see the deeper causes of tragedy”, Comment). In the case of Purfleet, should we not be asking why people are leaving Vietnam and what can be done to encourage them to remain at home? In 1980, the Brandt report, aptly entitled North-South: A Programme for Survival (the outcome of research led by Willy Brandt, former chancellor of then West Germany), reflected on why there was such a disparity between the rich north and poor south. Surely we should be asking ourselves whether our 0.7% of GDP going to the Department for International Development is sufficient and whether it is properly targeting those countries and communities from which so many migrants are taking the irregular migration route and risking their very survival. Dr Nick Maurice Marlborough, Wiltshire Across the autism spectrum I read with interest Joanne Limburg’s article “Is my autism a superpower?” (New Review) She makes some interesting points but I have to shake my head when I read: “I usually define myself as ‘autistic’ because I don’t recognise any essential difference between myself and non-speaking autistic people.” My son, in his early 20s, has a diagnosis of autism and complex/severe learning disability, attended special schools and will almost certainly never be independent. Limburg, on the other hand, has had considerable success as a writer, has an Oxbridge degree and postgraduate degrees and teaches creative writing at a university. If those are not “essential differences”, what are? This “no essential difference” argument is frequently found in discussions around autism: it is not only risible, it is pernicious, in effect blurring and obliterating the very different experiences that people face. Similarly, I don’t find it at all helpful to read about Chris Packham’s experience of autism, or Greta Thunberg’s; these people have an unusually high level of visibility and they are highly articulate, both things that privilege them over the vast majority of the population (autistic or not.) It is estimated that 75% of people with an autism diagnosis also have a significant learning disability: where are they in this discussion? Sheila Hamilton Eastham, Wirral Death and the maiden I was shocked to read that the discovery of a female Viking warrior “challenges long-held assumptions that Viking warrior heroes such as Erik the Red left their women at home” (“It’s Erika the Red: Viking women were warriors too”, News). Shocked because there is clear documentary evidence that women were found among the warrior dead in battles against the Byzantines in the 10th century; even Saxo Grammaticus, the Christian who bowdlerised the Norse Sagas for references to strong and warrior women (preferring to describe them as “witches”), managed to let a few references through. Viking warrior women were widely called shield maidens (skjaldmær), so the obvious conclusion is that the women were in there, right in the thick of it, in the shield wall along with everyone else, as the forehead gash of “Erika” and, indeed, the weapons with which she was buried openly attest.

2018-09-30T08:00:48Z,Labour has caught the mood of the times. Now it needs new ideas to remake capitalism | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/30/labour-has-caught-mood-of-times-needs-new-ideas-to-remake-capitalism,"Labour, by common consent, is winning the battle of ideas. Even as shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s plans for reshaping British capitalism were being dismissed as a regression to statism and trade union power, his critics were bemoaning that the Tories’ response was either a pale imitation of the same or a reheated and tired Thatcherism. Worse for his critics, McDonnell was winning a hearing because he spoke to widely held concerns about the economy. Suddenly, the economic debate has broken out of the ascendancy of variants of Thatcherism. As an advocate of stakeholder capitalism for more than 20 years, I was both taken aback and pleased to find McDonnell praising the ideas on the Today programme – and just as taken aback that some Tories want to develop their own version. But stakeholder capitalism is not a series of half-remembered magic solutions to breathe new life into traditional socialism or relegitimise free-market conservatism. It is a self-standing, distinct set of interlinked propositions about how capitalism can be made to work for all, requiring a radical change of mindset from the traditional left and libertarian right alike. The starting point is that the capitalist firm is of necessity a social organisation. Entrepreneurialism is not about a succession of individualistic sole traders having lightbulb moments that can only turn into successful businesses if there is little regulation and minimal tax. Rather, wealth-creation, innovation and productivity growth reside in the complicated business of marshalling people and resources. This requires lots of compromises and trade-offs, in substantive institutions that work better the stronger the social glue and shared sense of purpose. That means being animated by more than simply making profits, crucial though that is to the life of the enterprise. Purpose – to create “the happiness of its members” (John Lewis), say, or to make “a better everyday life for the many” (Ikea) – brings the unity of vision around which the firm can manage all the competing claims upon it. Moreover, that purpose is the key to building any sustainable business and means it cannot be a vehicle solely to enrich those at the top. Seen through this prism, workers are not locked in a do-or-die struggle with capital to which the resolution is the socialisation of production. Rather, they are in a complicated relationship of interdependence, resolving conflicts in a joint project of creating great goods and services. In the 1970s, leftwing trade union leaders Hugh Scanlon and Rodney Bickerstaffe were bitterly opposed to workers on boards as proposed by the Bullock commission under James Callaghan: it was a betrayal of socialism’s existential struggle with capitalism. Today, John McDonnell has crossed a line: by wanting workers as shareholders and represented on boards, he signals that capitalism can be made to work for the common good. His comrades from the 1970s would turn in their graves. Scorn has been hurled at his proposed inclusive ownership funds, demanding that every company with more than 250 people progressively allocate 10% of its shares to be held on the employees’ behalf – but with dividends going to the state after the workers have each received £500. It is confiscatory and a backdoor tax increase. But if you recast it as a compulsory employee stock ownership plan, then it is trying to achieve what George Osborne’s 2013 Enterprise Act attempted but failed miserably to do; not one firm has launched an Osbornian employee ownership scheme. This is only the beginning of a very long march. If McDonnell wants to reshape capitalism rather than abolish it, then he needs to further change his mindset and think more systemically. For example, he would have been wiser to plump for another model of employee ownership – the voluntary employee-owned trust– than his controlling, top-down variant. For what stakeholder capitalism aims to achieve is a private sector that improves worker and customer welfare within its own terms. The state sets the framework: it pump-primes; it strategises; it may even create a sovereign wealth fund, but all designed to achieve stakeholder vibrancy. On this, McDonnell said nothing. Worker directors, which he advocates, risk suffering acute conflicts of interest in today’s unreformed firms, as the old left feared (and many board fear too). It is stakeholder companies, unified around a common purpose, which dissolve structural conflicts. This world is already being tentatively embraced, as would be clear to him and critics if they had read the latest Financial Reporting Council’s corporate governance code. It even calls for boards to experiment with a worker-director to guarantee the firm’s purpose. McDonnell could build on these. He could propose a new Companies Act to make a commitment to purpose a condition of forming a company. Companies need more long-term, engaged, substantive shareholders on whom they can depend. He could turn his attention to Britain’s asset management industry and direct it to take its obligations to steward companies much more seriously. He could explain how he wants to reshape the financial system to lower the cost of capital. He could wean himself off an instinctive reflex to nationalise by embracing different corporate forms through which social benefit can be delivered. He could declare that his aim is to create a new generation of great British companies whose strength will be built on the new communities of interest between repurposed trade unions, customers and long-term shareholders. He could build a great political coalition of the left and the centre. This, of course, would be better done within the EU. Stakeholder capitalism, a revived social contract and stopping Brexit are parts of the same vision – a very different one from the Brexiter notion of a turbo-boosted Thatcherism. Labour is inching nearer to a position that would win a public vote and be the basis for national renewal thereafter. There is no other viable political force or set of propositions to save the country. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",John McDonnell; Labour; Politics; UK news,Opinion
2019-07-21T04:59:44Z,Turning our back on studying history fits with a society that’s losing its common purpose | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/turning-back-on-history-fits-society-losing-common-purpose,"One of the saddest aspects of our times is the harsh world that the right has constructed for our children as they approach adulthood. If you are 16, 18 or indeed 21, in employment terms you are an innocent. The young need to join an organisation that is aware of its social obligations and which has an expectation that it will survive over time, an organisation that recognises it is in its own interest to offer young people the chance to lay the foundations of a career. It should not only be the town halls, the leading accountancy firms, the civil service, the BBC or the last few big British companies that are virtually the sole suppliers of such a chance, oversubscribed 20 or 30 times for every job they advertise. We need many more alongside them – even more so in an economy in which technology is making the life cycle of firms so much shorter, now closer to 20 years than the 50 of the mid-20th century. The only answer to this lack of permanence is to stand by those organisations we do have, to help new companies to grow so that they can share the load, and to build public institutions that can take some of the strain. It is stakeholder capitalism – which every instinct within rightwing Johnsonian Brexiters abhors. After all, the young cannot always stand on their own; they need to be offered the first rungs of the ladder. Later, they may strike out, but those first steps are crucial. They need to be nurtured, to get an idea of what work can be – and what might suit their skills, values and ambitions. But the new right does not believe in institutions that exist over time, transmit values and which root societies and the next generation. The one-nation right certainly believed in the value of what Edmund Burke called the “little platoons” in society to which we belong. But the new nihilist Brexit right, often cocooned by privilege and private money, regards such thinking as flabby. It believes individuals should stand on their own two feet as soon as possible; organisations must put their own immediate profitability first and foremost. All British businesses must expect to be taken over by any bidder at any time in the name of efficiency and global Britain. The public sector must put belt-tightening minimalism first. Forget values other than those of the marketplace and lower taxes. Certainly any obligation to the young can go hang. The impact is profound. The young know too many of their elders don’t give a shit and have created a world of unforgiving dysfunction at both the top and bottom. (It’s one if the reasons for the epidemic of drug abuse, discarded needles and addiction a new public health menace.) Even those lucky enough to go to university can read the runes. A history, English, classics or modern language degree is not going to serve you well in the contemporary job market with transient firms that value only immediately useful skills. The degrees that might offer better protection are in computer science, engineering, medicine, law or accountancy. Hence the number doing history degrees has fallen 10% over the past decade – those doing Stem subjects steadily rising. In the US the numbers completing history degrees are down a third over the same period, foretelling an acceleration of the trends in Britain. The country undoubtedly needs more computer scientists, medics and engineers – but as a society surely not at the expense of the humanities, whose essence is captured in the name. A society that has forgotten its history, is ignorant of its poetry and most of whose citizens have no understanding of foreign languages or culture is withering. An organisation staffed only by those with instrumental skills will have little sense of its purpose or social place, which is the ultimate guarantor of success. The best scientists know they need their humanity colleagues – in a firm as much as a college. It is not blinkered university humanities lecturers who are to blame for this intensifying bias – as suggested in a recent article in the Economist. They are committed scholars ready to do whatever they can to make their subjects relevant and accessible. But students will only value the humanities if society values them. And that means nurturing the organisations that have a sufficiently long-term sense of themselves and their purpose to be able to recruit from across the academic disciplines. That in turn requires a vision of the good society – one reason why increasingly I have come to characterise Brexit as a cultural civil war. There is no prospect that Brexit can improve the deal for our young, economically or culturally. Public finances and organisations alike will be under more pressure. The language of very rightwing politicians will become the new common sense. Drug use will intensify at the bottom – and the cultural ballast in our society, loving history or Shakespeare for their own sakes, will decline. The young sense this: it is why they voted so overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, and would do so in greater numbers today. The task is to create and build more great firms and organisations that offer our young a chance – not to throw what we have away as bait for the Chinese, Indians and Americans to do some merciless trade deal. The Labour party used to possess leaders – Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, even Tony Blair – who understood the intertwining of the economic, social and cultural, and its roots in pro-Europeanism. My criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he has never even got close. Surely someone, somewhere can find the words and philosophy around which lost liberal, pro-European Britain can rally – if only for our youth. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Young people; Business; Brexit; Europe,Opinion
2019-03-17T06:00:00Z,Let’s continue to resist Brexit. Our economy and values are at stake | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/17/until-brexit-is-a-done-deal-lets-continue-to-resist-our-economy-and-values-at-stake,"Three years ago, 48% of us voted Remain. If another vote were taken in the near future, the figure would probably top 50%. But perish the current leading politician or businessperson who makes the case for ongoing membership of this remarkable international organisation on our doorstep. Apart from a few outliers, it is taken as a political given that Britain must leave the EU; the divisive question is in what form. For although the focus is largely on the undoubted deleterious economic impact – the worse the harder the Brexit – the bigger question is what country do we want to be. The EU has rightly become the talismanic issue of our times. For if you support EU membership, you will tend to own a cluster of other values and principles. You recognise that today’s economies and societies are interdependent and that it’s imperative to have institutions to manage those interdependencies, whether on climate change or the overarching power of the new technopolists. You are not instinctively distrustful, even hostile, to other cultures, languages and peoples: you find diversity attractive and enriching. You are for openness and tolerance. While proud of your country, you do not see that pride compromised by working with and alongside other countries and peoples. You do not believe in capitalism red in tooth and claw; you see the case for stakeholder capitalism, for the regulation of finance and for using state power to promote competition and innovation. You celebrate the role of trade unions in giving employees voice and vital countervailing power. You do not regard low taxation as the be-all and end-all of public policy. You uphold the values behind a social contract in which members of society accept mutual rights and obligations, so sustaining strong public health and education and social insurance that supplies income in adversity or old age. You believe in strong public institutions, ranging from the BBC to museums, which so enrich our country. Propounding EU membership is thus a civilisational proposition. It does not mean that you regard every aspect of the EU – its unsigned-off accounts or the intricacies of the common agricultural policy – as perfect. But then neither is every aspect of the UK. But it does mean that you sign up for a set of interlocking propositions, shared by other Europeans, which better allow people to live lives they have reason to value. Standing in opposition is a very different set of values and principles. To want to leave is to deny international interdependencies in order to assert national “control”. You reject mutuality of international obligation and the necessary pooling of sovereignty and sharing of law and resource to achieve common ends that would otherwise be impossible. Rather, the moral injunction for state and individual alike is to stand alone and act solely in your own interests. The EU is a hostile “other”: it spends our money and sets objectionable regulations, although when challenged, no regulation can be cited whose aim can reasonably be contested. Small wonder; they reflect the will not just of the British parliament, but of the parliaments of Europe. You object to the EU’s openness – to trade, ideas and people – especially to European citizens who can live and work in Britain as of right. It matters not that the British have equal rights: who would want to have the right to leave their homeland to become a citizen of anywhere? At the limit, you can only trust your own, who share the “indigenous” culture and love of home; those from other cultures, who speak other languages and worship other religions, are the alien other whose presence is necessarily the principal cause of your own and wider society’s ills. Brexit is thus a parallel civilisational proposition – to create a world of closure, intolerance and suspicion of the other. Economically, this will express itself as less trade, less inward investment and less growth – and reduced capacity to work with other countries to confront common challenges. But that is less the point than the impact on our civilisation. We will become more intolerant, more mean spirited, accelerating the trends already clear since the referendum. We will be ever more suspicious and hostile to people of colour, the European, the Jew and the Muslim. We will contract and be diminished. Thus the “vox pop” calls from the bluff Yorkshire pensioner or Essex white-van driver to get on with Brexit or parallel calls from their MPS to respect the “will of the people” cannot be tamely and mutely accepted. I don’t believe that the mass of the British want to embrace the choice Brexit represents or that those who voted Leave hold views that are immutable. They are fellow Brits and fellow Europeans who have fallen prey to callow leaders and trash populist argument. It may be that Theresa May gets a narrow majority on the third or fourth time of asking for her “ deal”. But while trying to limit the economic damage, this will end up with Britain having the worst of all worlds – tracking the EU without influencing it, while embracing closure. But whatever the deal, the civilisational challenge cannot be dodged. I do not want to live in the kind of country that Brexit is creating and I believe a majority share that view. If we leave, millions of us will seek to convert our fellow citizens and remind them that so much of what goes to make us British has roots in very different values from those feeding Brexit. Above all, we will look to leaders, so sadly absent in our two main political parties, who lead and form public opinion, instead of following what they imagine it to be. We did not want or choose this battle. But now it is upon us, we have to take up the peaceful arms of persuasion, words and argument – and fight to win it. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Brexit; European Union; Politics; UK news; Article 50,Opinion
2018-12-15T16:00:15Z,‘It’s essential to life’: Ofwat’s Rachel Fletcher sets a new course for water,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/15/rachel-fletcher-ofwat-set-new-course-for-water-utilities-regulator,"When a regulator looks at you unblinkingly and says she wants the companies she regulates to understand they are part of a social contract, you catch your breath. Yes, replies Rachel Fletcher, chief executive of water regulator Ofwat, as I press her about the term “social contract”. The news is “out there” even if not “fully baked”, she says. Fletcher speaks deliberately, choosing her words with care in a slight Scottish burr. Water is “essential to life – not just another commodity,” she says. “It does not chime with people that the relationship between them and their water supplier is transactional.” The water industry is at an inflexion point, she insists. Gone are the days when loopholes would allow a company like Thames Water, under its previous owners, to load up with debt, financially engineer high returns and route the resulting dividends through tax havens. The whole episode was a “wake-up call to the sector”, she says. Ofwat has closed those loopholes and she argues that the water industry – including other big private names such as Severn Trent, United Utilities and Anglian Water – is in the throes of a makeover. Most, but not all, of its chief executives no longer see their role as simply running water through pipes, conforming with the letter of regulation if not the spirit and aiming to maximise short-term profits. They “can and must play a broader role”, says Fletcher, and understand that they are part of a water system that must be curated as the foundational “natural capital” on which they depend, along with being integral parts of the communities they serve. “Social contract”, “natural capital”, “serving communities” – these are not concepts any regulator in the wake of the Thatcherite privatisations would have promoted. That was a world in which private was good, public bad and all regulation light-touch. Fletcher acknowledges that whatever immediate gains there were after privatisation – leakage rates fell, for example – regulators then took their eye off the ball. She wants to see the companies declare their business purpose in social-contract terms, putting the customer at the heart of what they do. An extraordinary 1.5 million people in aggregate were consulted one way or another – for example through youth panels, questionnaires and online forums – in the formulation of water companies’ business plans for 2020-25, which are now being reviewed. She calls for that clear purpose, reflecting the consumer interest, to be embedded in the companies’ culture and organisation. Fletcher adds: “There are pockets of really good stuff – on the environment, bonuses, delivering to customers and community.” But it is not yet reaching every corner of the industry, she says. Nor is this just trendy environmentalism or woolly communitarianism. She points out that the National Infrastructure Commission calculates that the cost of running emergency water supplies in 2050 will be £40bn a year, given the likely impact of climate change on the industry. Even in the next decade, water shortages are likely to become pressing. Three new towns are planned along the new Oxford-Cambridge corridor, where the population will expand by 3 million. Yet parts of eastern England are “drier than Israel”, says Fletcher. A way has to be found to ensure that the water-rich parts of the country are connected with the water-poor – yet today the privatised companies only trade 4% of their water elsewhere. It is obvious that each water company responding individually makes no sense. Fletcher balks at going so far as creating a national water grid – at least for the moment. But there does need to be “a national framework” to ensure water can be moved to where it is needed – and the framework will depend on water companies accepting that preventing any part of the country suffering shortages is part of the social contract, just as much as keeping rivers clean or planting trees to ensure better run-off. What of their shareholders, about to see surpluses deployed in this way? They understand too, Fletcher says. But she accepts she “still has a job to do to align interests of owners with what we are proposing for customers”. She is not yet calling for water companies to write their purpose into their articles of association and establish themselves as public benefit companies (I declared an interest as co-chair of the Purposeful Company Taskforce, which advocates public benefit companies); rather, she wants a water company to hold itself to account as if it were one. Nor is she a promoter of stakeholder capitalism, although she recognises that everything she is pushing for comes under that label. Meanwhile, the Labour Party’s plan for industry nationalisation sits in the background: the problem, she acknowledges, is that while most consumers register high trust in their local company, that trust is not transferred to the sector was a whole. That is what has to change, and quickly. She is, though, a woman on a mission. Along with most people in the water industry, Fletcher claims she gets out of bed each morning to “make a difference”. Over the next five years we will see if she has succeeded.",Utilities; Regulators; Privatisation; Economic policy; Politics; Business,Business
2018-12-27T07:30:15Z,Lab Rats by Dan Lyons and Seasonal Associate by Heike Geissler review – powerless at work,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/lab-rats-dan-lyons-seasonal-associate-heike-geissler-review,"A few years ago, Dan Lyons, a former technology journalist with Newsweek, endured an unhappy stint with a software startup called HubSpot. Initially dazzled by the company’s youthful vibe – all ping-pong tables and beanbags – he quickly became disillusioned. “Beneath their bubbly exteriors,” he recalls, “many people were anxious, frightened, unhappy, and massively stressed out.” He wrote a bestselling book about that experience, Disrupted: My Misadventures in the Start-Up Bubble (2016). In Lab Rats, Lyons warns that the oppressive working culture he witnessed in the tech industry is being rolled out to other businesses, including some in the public sector, thanks to the efforts of a coterie of high-end management consultants. These are a truly strange breed, combining ludicrous pomposity with an almost psychopathic earnestness. Lyons frequently refers to them as “mad” or “nutty”. Many venture capital-funded tech startups operate a business model premised on high staff turnover, wherein, he writes: “Employees can (and should) be underpaid, overworked, exhausted and then discarded.” The aim is to maximise the value of the company in the short term, with a view to cashing out when it is sold at an IPO. Management gurus have a particular fondness for cloaking their practices in military and sporting metaphors: LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman believes we should think of the employer-employee relationship in terms of a “tour of duty”, while Netflix’s notoriously brutal human resources “culture code” declares that the organisation is “a team, not a family” – the idea being that your place in a team is contingent on your performance, whereas the unconditional love of a family is bound to engender complacency. Lyons rightly points out that the analogy is specious, since “the best pro sports teams succeed exactly because the players feel like a family”. Job insecurity and wage inequality have been rising ever since the years of Reagan and Thatcher, but the advent of digital technology has exacerbated this trend, making it easier for companies such as Uber to assemble and manage large armies of low-paid contract employees. Whatever these workers might gain in flexibility is more than cancelled out by the disadvantages: “gig economy” work invariably means no health insurance, no retirement pension, no child-care provisions or paid holidays – all things Stephen DeWitt, the CEO of a startup selling “labour clouds” of freelance contractors, breezily dismisses as “old-model inefficiencies”. Citing evidence linking chronic mild stress to declining mental health, increasing antidepressant usage and rising suicide rates, Lyons reminds us that an economy built on insecurity is a public health time bomb. It is a cruel paradox that the very workers who are enervated by long-hours culture are expected to surrender ever more of their depleted emotional energy to their employers. Competence alone no longer cuts it; Lyons interviewed one woman whose boss fired her because she didn’t “seem excited enough”. Lyons isn’t calling for radical industrial democracy but a move away from “shareholder capitalism” – which prioritises short-term profits over all else – in favour of “stakeholder capitalism”, as part of which employers invest in the health and happiness of their staff. In the latter sections of the book, he enumerates several examples of progressively minded entrepreneurs who have eschewed the “tour of duty” philosophy, and prefer to treat their employees with respect. Here the author addresses himself to the business community at large, urging them to mend their ways. The sentiment is welcome, if perhaps a tad wishful. Enlightened leadership can only to do so much: meaningful change must entail legislative protections, and these will only be won through politics – either at the ballot box or the picket line. Lab Rats is a lively and spirited takedown of a human resources industry that is increasingly brazen in its unabashed parasitism. Its core argument – that “dignity, respect, stability and security still matter” – is surely irrefutable. The book is the latest addition to a growing body of literature taking issue with the normalisation of precarious and long-hours work. These include David Graeber’s Bullshit Jobs and James Bloodworth’s Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain, both of which were published last year. The German novelist Heike Geissler has taken a slightly different approach to the same subject. First published in 2014 and now available in English courtesy of Katy Derbyshire’s translation, Seasonal Associate is Geissler’s account of her spell at an Amazon distribution warehouse – a “fulfilment” centre – in Leipzig, where she carried out data-entry work processing incoming packages. It’s a blend of reportage and memoir, embellished with novelistic frills: the narrative voice alternates between first and second person, and is prone to introspective digressions. This diaristic mode of writing enables Geissler to move beyond journalese and into more subjective terrain, exploring the feelings of powerlessness and despair she experienced during her time on the payroll of the world’s richest man. The result is a bleak meditation on 21st-century drudgery. “You’re alive in the physiological sense,” she writes, “but your potential lies deeper than usual, buried beneath your fatigue.” There were no avenues for promotion or development: “You can’t flick forward to a new chapter offering you fresh, interesting material. You remain on this level … It’s all about sheer endurance.” The employees here were “nothing but a placeholder for machines that have already been invented”, though it doesn’t yet make economic sense “to permanently replace you and your workmates, who are very low-cost”. Quite apart from the tedium of the work itself, Geissler experiences various petty workplace humiliations. She is asked to attend an unpaid training day at the start of her employment, and claims that she is later subjected to persistent passive-aggressive banter from a sexist colleague; she loathes her line manager with “a child’s unrelativised intensity”. Geissler flirts with the idea of walking off the job or sabotaging the workplace in some way, but ultimately restricts her recalcitrance to elongated toilet breaks and working very slowly. Seasonal Associate is told in a weary monotone, aptly evocative of the stultified torpor it describes. Having belatedly noticed a minor logging error she had made earlier in the day, Geissler notes that: “A small bunny will be sent out into the world with the product number of a big bunny.” Her portrayal of zoned-out apathy is perhaps a little too convincing: there is a listlessness about the prose. Relief – for author and reader alike – comes in intermittent moments of sardonic spikiness, as Geissler finds solace in gallows humour and flights of fancy. At one point she picks up an obscure book from the stock pile, a memoir by the former football hooligan Mark Chester, and props it up on her desk as though it were a family portrait: “It feels like you now have a thug with a provocative glare on your side. Mark Chester is your own private thug … You stand in front of the book and say: ‘Mark, those people over there, they’re bothering me. You know I wouldn’t ask you if it wasn’t important to me …’” • Lab Rats: Why Modern Work Makes People Miserable by Dan Lyons (Atlantic, £16.99) and Seasonal Associate by Heike Geissler (Semiotext(e), £13.99).

2018-03-15T16:47:33Z,Brexit to blame? Not in the case of Unilever | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/15/brexit-to-blame-not-in-the-case-of-unilever,"Nothing to do with Brexit? Actually, one shouldn’t be too sceptical about chief executive Paul Polman’s “categorical” denial that Brexit shaped Unilever’s choice of Rotterdam over London. Leaving the EU plainly didn’t help the UK’s pitch, but one suspects the Netherlands got the nod for two unrelated reasons – one the company is happy to shout about, and one that it isn’t. First, the official technical one. Some 55% of Unilever’s shares are currently held via the Dutch NV company, as opposed to the UK plc, and the group reports its results in euros. Sole incorporation in the Netherlands was the more natural way to unpick an Anglo-Dutch structure that has existed since the merger of Margarine Unie and Lever Brothers in 1929. At Relx, the former Anglo-Dutch combine Reed Elsevier, the currency and share factors were the other way around. The company opted for London as its sole HQ last month, a decision that should not be sniffed at. The owner of LexisNexis has a gloriously low profile but it is a top-20 FTSE 100 company, only slightly smaller than Barclays. The second factor – despite the formal denials – is surely the Dutch and UK views of hostile takeovers. Unilever folk like the Dutch approach. Remember the context. Unilever’s review was prompted by last year’s £115bn offer from the US giant Kraft Heinz. Polman defeated the bid over a weekend but the episode was an almighty shock to the corporate sense of identity. Unilever could previously assume it was so big it was immune to hostile raiders, even those with a “fast and ruthless” style, as Polman described Kraft. It was surprised to find everybody is seen as fair game these days. Unilever hates the accusation it is seeking sanctuary in the Netherlands. It is true, as Polman argues, that UK and Dutch takeover codes are similar. But, come on, he has said time and again that “a level playing field” is more likely to encourage the inclusive form of “stakeholder” capitalism that Unilever preaches, and he has always implied that Dutch fields are flatter. Note that the US group PPG encountered a political storm last year when it tried, and failed, to buy the famous Dutch paint-maker AkzoNobel. Dutch scepticism about hostile bids may not have been the clincher, but it must have entered Unilever’s thinking. Nor should anyone be surprised that a company with a Dutch chairman and a Dutch chief executive picked the country where the prime minister, Mark Rutte, is a former Unilever employee. Does the choice of the Netherlands matter? It does in that Unilever will probably disappear from the FTSE 100 index. That’s an embarrassing blow for the London market. It is also a defeat for ministers who lobbied furiously for London and would have crowed if they had succeeded. But the UK jobs, as Unilever was at pains to say, are staying and two of the three divisions will be run from the UK. If the operational bases for personal care or home products had been exported, the link to Brexit would have been direct, obvious and alarming. Such calamities will probably follow in time elsewhere in UK industry, but Unilever’s legal rejig doesn’t qualify. Airbus warning may mean turbulence for Melrose’s GKN bid “It would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don’t know who will be the long-term investor.” That’s one hell of a statement for a senior Airbus executive – Tom Williams, chief operating officer of the commercial aircraft division – to make. Everybody knows whose model he means – that of Melrose, currently bidding £8bn for GKN. If the threat/warning/statement is sincere, it’s hard to dismiss as irrelevant. Airbus is GKN’s biggest customer, representing £700m of revenue, or 20% in the aerospace division. Melrose can declare that it would spend as freely on research and development as GKN, but Williams’s main point is different. He’s worried about who will eventually own GKN’s businesses. Since Melrose aims to sell everything it buys within three to five years, there’s no easy comeback on that score. One could take the view that the comments are a ruse. Airbus and GKN are obviously cosy. And Mike Turner, chairman of GKN, used to be the boss of BAE Systems, which used to have a 20% stake in Airbus. Well, yes, but Williams’s remarks are a long way from the usual rough and tumble of takeover bids. Maybe Airbus means it. Melrose has a telephone call arranged with Williams’s French boss. Let’s see what that “trust us” pitch produces. If Airbus goes on the offensive again, or if other GKN customers join in, floating voters in this takeover scrap have something serious to think about.",Brexit; Business; Netherlands; European Union; UK news; Europe; GKN; Airbus; Melrose; Airline industry,Business
