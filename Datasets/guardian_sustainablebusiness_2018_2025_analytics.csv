2025-06-23T05:37:12Z,Rich Americans flock to apply for New Zealand’s ‘golden visas’ after rules relaxed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/americans-new-zealand-golden-visas-trump,"Wealthy Americans are leading the charge in applications for New Zealand’s “golden visas” after rules on applying were relaxed. New Zealand’s coalition government in February loosened the requirements for its Active Investor Plus visa – commonly known as the golden visa – offering residency to wealthy foreigners in a bid to boost the flagging economy. The new rules, which came into effect in April, lowered investment thresholds, removed English-language requirements and cut the amount of time applicants must spend in the country to establish residency from three years to three weeks. Immigration New Zealand says the scheme has attracted 189 applications, representing 609 people, under the new rules. Prior to the changes, the visa attracted 116 applications over 2.5 years. Nearly half the investors who have applied hail from the US, representing 85 applications, followed by China, 26, and Hong Kong, 24. Residents from countries across Asia and Europe make up the rest of the applicants. “Nearly everyone who is applying is applying because of the changes they’re seeing under the Trump administration,” said Stuart Nash, a former Labour party minister, who now runs Nash Kelly Global, an immigration and relocation consultancy. Under the new rules, 149 applied under the visa’s “growth” category, which requires a minimum $5m investment over three years, and 40 applied under the “balanced” category, which requires a minimum $10m investment over five years. Immigration has approved 100 applications in principle and seven have transferred their funds – netting New Zealand $45m. There has been a significant increase in interest in the visa since the changes, with investors drawn to New Zealand’s stability and innovation in sustainable business and technology, said Benny Goodman, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s general manager for investment. “This is a rare combination, and one that deeply resonates with investors thinking about legacy, not just returns,” he said. Global instability makes New Zealand – with its stable democracy, independent judiciary and safe banking system – an attractive destination, particularly to Americans, Nash said. “We are seeing more people looking for a safe haven than a tax haven – and that’s what we have got here in New Zealand, Nash said. It is not the first time New Zealand has attracted the interest of Trump-weary Americans and other wealthy foreigners seeking to make New Zealand their “bolthole” at a time of societal division. Following Trump’s 2016 election, visits to the country’s immigration website rose almost 2,500%. After the supreme court decision removing abortion rights, New Zealand’s immigration site visits quadrupled to 77,000. After Trump’s 2024 election win, New Zealand’s property market saw a surge of interest from the US. Meanwhile, billionaires acquiring residency or citizenship in New Zealand have been subject to political controversy in the past. In 2017, news broke that Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, was granted citizenship despite spending only 12 days in the country, prompting former Labour prime minister Jacinda Ardern to tighten the rules on investment visas and foreign home ownership in 2018. The loosening of the visa rules is one of a number of Ardern-era policies the right-wing coalition has wound back in its bid the boost the economy. Earlier this year it relaxed other more restrictive visa settings to attract so-called ‘digital nomads’ to New Zealand. New Zealand’s economy suffered as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the country experienced the biggest contraction in GDP of any developed country in the world in 2024, due to high interest rates and unemployment. In a statement on Monday, economic growth minister Nicola Willis said so far the visa could represent “a potential $845 million of new investment in New Zealand business”. “New investors don’t just bring their dollars to our shores, they also bring skills, knowledge and experience that will drive future economic development,” Willis said. “It’s a win-win.”",New Zealand; US news; Trump administration; US immigration; Asia Pacific; World news; US politics,World news
2025-03-06T14:12:40Z,Danish postal service to stop delivering letters after 90% drop in numbers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/danish-postal-service-stop-delivering-letters-drop-numbers,"The Danish postal service has said it will deliver its last letter at the end of this year, instead focusing on packages to respond to changing forms of communication. PostNord said on Thursday it would cut 1,500 jobs in Denmark and remove 1,500 red postboxes, citing the “increasing digitalisation” of society. The company, formed in 2009 in a merger of the Swedish and Danish postal services, is owned by the Danish and Swedish states in a respective 40:60 split. Letter distribution in Sweden would not be affected, it said. The Danish postal service has been responsible for delivering letters in the country since 1624, but since 2000 the number of letters has declined by more than 90%, it said. PostNord Denmark will deliver its last letter on 30 December. “With increasing digitalisation, the number of letters in Denmark is rapidly decreasing, and therefore PostNord in Denmark will stop delivering letters in 2026 to focus on being the Danes’ preferred package supplier,” the company said in a statement. Kim Pedersen, the chief executive of PostNord Denmark, said: “In order for us to create a sustainable business, we need to adapt, and unfortunately this means a difficult decision to say goodbye to some of our colleagues.” He added: “We have been the Danes’ postal service for 400 years, and therefore it is a difficult decision to tie a knot on that part of our history.” PostNord lost its obligation to deliver post to the whole of Denmark last year in a move towards market liberalisation, meaning the company also lost much of its financial support. The government said it would still be possible to post letters despite the changes. “We can still send and receive letters everywhere in the country,” the transport minister, Thomas Danielsen, told the Ritzau news agency. The distributor DAO, which won the contract to deliver public service mail last year, has said it is ready to strengthen its letter distribution service. Many postal services are struggling across Europe due to digitalisation. The German postal service, Deutsche Post, announced on Thursday that it would cut 8,000 jobs in Germany to reduce costs. The core letters business of Britain’s Royal Mail has also been ravaged. The UK communications regulator, Ofcom, has proposed Royal Mail deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdays, potentially saving the company hundreds of millions of pounds.

2025-03-14T13:40:07Z,Tate cuts 7% of workforce in effort to reduce funding deficit from pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/mar/14/tate-cuts-workforce-reduce-funding-deficit-pandemic,"Tate is cutting 7% of its workforce as the British arts institution seeks to address a funding deficit left over from the pandemic. About 40 roles have been affected by the cuts, made through voluntary departures and recruitment freezes. Tate, which has four galleries across London, Liverpool and Cornwall, said it had been working with staff for a number of months to achieve the reduction. “Tate has an ambitious programme to grow our audiences across the nation and beyond,” a spokesperson said. “To eliminate the deficit left over from the pandemic, we have strengthened new income streams, strategically prioritised our most impactful activities, and carefully streamlined out workforce.” The spokesperson said Tate had achieved its goals “by not replacing vacant roles and by accepting voluntary exits, working closely with colleagues and unions over a number of months”. They added: “Such changes ensure we have the stability we need to continue being as ambitious and innovative as ever.” While the number of domestic visitors to museums and galleries has returned to pre-pandemic levels, there are still fewer visitors from abroad. Overall, visitor numbers are about three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels which, combined with cuts to culture budgets, is putting pressure on institutions to reduce costs. Last year, Tate’s trustees approved another deficit budget to give the institution time to develop a new financially sustainable business model. About 30% of Tate’s income comes from government grants. The rest is raised through private fundraising – including corporate support, philanthropic donations and legacy bequests – as well as money from exhibition ticket sales. Tate Liverpool, which opened at the Royal Albert Dock in 1988, is undergoing a £29.7m redevelopment, which includes the installation of new galleries. Tate St Ives is restoring the Palais de Danse – Barbara Hepworth’s second studio space. In May, Tate Modern will mark its 25th birthday with free performances and events, as well as the return of Louise Bourgeois’s spider, Maman, to the Turbine Hall. The Prospect union said it was engaging with Tate on the planned changes and would support any staff affected. The union’s national secretary for heritage, Sharon Brown, said: “We are clear that the expertise and experience of museum and gallery workers, who are often underpaid and undervalued, is what brings the collections alive and is fundamental to the success of the sector. “Budget cuts and the impact of the pandemic have hit the sector hard and more must be done to invest in these institutions and the workforce, which are an essential part of our domestic and international visitor economy as well as of Britain’s cultural landscape.”",Tate Modern; Tate Britain; Tate Liverpool; Tate St Ives; Arts funding; Culture; Art and design; Museums; UK news; Job losses; Art; Business,Art and design
2025-04-05T12:00:22Z,"Girl Scout cookies contain heavy metals beyond safe limits, lawsuit alleges",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/girl-scout-cookies-heavy-metals-lawsuit,"Girl Scout cookies contain lead, arsenic, cadmium, aluminum and mercury at levels that often exceed regulators’ recommended limits, as well as concerning amounts of a toxic herbicide, a new class action lawsuit alleges. The suit bases its allegations on a December 2024 study commissioned by the GMO Science and Moms Across America non-profits that tested 25 cookies gathered from across several states, and found all contained at least four out of five of the heavy metals. Lead was found in all but one cookie, and all samples contained glyphosate, a highly toxic and controversial weed killer that is banned in many countries because it’s so dangerous. The Girl Scouts took aim at the study in a blog post. “The health and safety of Girl Scouts and cookie customers is our top priority,” it stated. “Rest assured: Girl Scout Cookies are safe to consume.” It added: “Our trusted baking partners continue to ensure the integrity of our recipes and the safety of all Girl Scout Cookie products in accordance with federal regulations and Global Food Safety initiative standards.” However, the lawsuit states: “While the entire sales practice system for Girl Scout Cookies is built on a foundation of ethics and teaching young girls sustainable business practices, defendants failed to uphold this standard themselves.” The lawsuit seeks $5m in damages and asks a New York state court to order Girl Scouts of America to affix a warning to the cookies. The heavy metals are especially dangerous for young children, and can cause brain damage and developmental issues. Glyphosate exposure in children is linked to liver inflammation and hormone disruption, among other issues. About 200m boxes of the cookies are sold annually. Thin mints showed the highest levels of glyphosate, and the Peanut Butter Patties, S’mores, Caramel deLites and gluten-free Toffee-tastic had the highest levels of toxic metals. Though the report compared its findings to the federal limits on metals in water, the US Food and Drug Administration typically limits the amount of lead in food from two parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb. All but three cookies exceed 2 ppb. The non-profit Girl Scouts said heavy metals occur naturally in soil, suggesting that its cookies contained “trace amounts”, which is common in food and not a safety issue. However, the levels found in most of the cookies are higher than what are considered trace amounts. It also stated that glyphosate is found “nearly everywhere” in the food chain. Glyphosate is often in produce and processed foods, and the levels found in the cookies – with the exception of the Thin Mints – are lower than the EPA’s recommended intake for an adult. But it is unclear what the impact on children might be. Organic produce and processed foods broadly contain no or much lower levels of glyphosate and other pesticides. The high levels of metal contamination are also not unique to Girl Scout cookies – cinnamon in Gerber baby food was found to contain lead and the company was sued for violating California’s Proposition 65 limits in 2021. Vineet Dubey, an attorney who sued Gerber but is not involved in the Girl Scout lawsuit, said the toxins likely stem from Gerber and Girl Scouts “buying inexpensive ingredients and from places that are known to have problems with polluted soil, air and water”.",Food safety; Scouts and scouting; Food; Law (US); Health; New York; US news,World news

2025-05-22T18:00:07Z,"Sunderland face playoffs with teenage stars, left-field Le Bris but investment issues",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/22/sunderland-playoffs-regis-le-bris-young-stars-invesment,"Régis who? It is May 2024 and Illan Meslier, the Leeds goalkeeper, is singing the praises of a former Lorient youth coach whose astute mentoring shaped his career. But who is this left-field thinker who dispatched his young goalkeepers to undergo professional boxing training, spend hours performing acrobatics on trampolines and talk intensely to sports psychologists? Régis Le Bris eventually became Lorient’s first-team manager in 2022 but, after a promising opening season, the Breton team were relegated from Ligue 1 last spring. No matter; a month on from that chat with Meslier in North Yorkshire, Sunderland named Le Bris as their head coach and, now, the 49-year-old is preparing to lead the club out at Wembley on Saturday. Along the way the self-confessed “average” Rennes defender turned academically inclined youth coach – he holds a doctorate in human physiology and biomechanics and a psychology diploma – has delighted in trampling on convention. Unusually, a man who began learning English in 2022 arrived on Wearside alone and was happy to work with Sunderland’s coaching staff. He lives near his Newcastle counterpart Eddie Howe, and a host of north-east footballers, in an upmarket area of Northumberland but that is about as conventional as Le Bris gets. Part of those doctorate studies involved compiling a dissertation on new ways of using oxygen to revive fatigued and distressed athletes. Whatever happens on Saturday his sometimes unorthodox tactical methodology has breathed new life into Sunderland. What’s trigonometry got to do with it? Although Le Bris adapts formations, personnel and tactics to the opposition, his philosophy is underpinned by a belief that the game is a form of trigonometry. “Triangles are the basis of everything we do,” says a coach whose often counterattacking winger-propelled gameplans tend to be heavily dependent on triangular passing interactions between full-backs, wingers and No 8s. As the forward Eliezer Mayenda says: “It’s all about finding the right triangles.” During Le Bris’s teenage years in the western Breton village of Pont-l’Abbé, he devoted his spare time to completing an in-depth analysis of Arsène Wenger’s tactics as Monaco’s manager. As an adult, he spent holidays touring clubs across Spain and England – Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Everton and Leeds included – to watch their coaches. “He’s not someone who shouts at you,” the Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor says, “but he makes you understand things really, really thoroughly.” The winger Patrick Roberts agrees. “He’s efficient,” he says. “He’s brought us new ideas and he’s capable of changing our play depending on the opponent. He’s modern.” How come they’re so young? With a median age of 22.4 Sunderland have, on average, fielded the Championship’s youngest starting XIs this season. A squad notable for the absence of outfield players over 30 ranks as one of Europe’s most youthful and is often heavily reliant on the much-coveted midfield skills of the 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham and 17-year-old Chris Rigg. It is part of a strategy devised by Kristjaan Speakman, Sunderland’s sporting director, involving the fusion of promising youngsters from the highly regarded academy with raw, often flawed, young talent acquired relatively cheaply from across Europe. There is no squeamishness about buying to sell. Last season’s star winger Jack Clarke joined Ipswich for £15m last summer, and another winger, the 19-year-old Tommy Watson, will sign for Brighton for £10m this summer. Bellingham was bought from Birmingham for £1.5m but could be poised to join Borussia Dortmund for £25m. Clarke’s replacement has been the excellent Romaine Mundle, a former Tottenham youth player recruited from Standard Liège for £1m. Le Bris’s two main strikers, Isidor, a £5m purchase from Zenit St Petersburg, and Mayenda, £1m from Sochaux, have appreciated considerably in value. Whether this strategy could continue working in the Premier League remains to be seen but Sunderland’s owner, the 27-year-old Swiss-French billionaire Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, is on a mission to run the club as a sustainable business. Could they possibly survive in the top tier? It helps that Le Bris, unlike some recently promoted managers (see Russell Martin at Southampton), is not a slave to positional-style, play-it-out-from-the-back football. Sunderland overcame Coventry in the playoff semi-final courtesy of about 25% possession and an ultra-low block so winning ugly poses few problems. Nonetheless, a significant investment in higher-calibre players would appear essential if immediate relegation were to be avoided. The infrastructure – a 49,000-capacity stadium and Premier League-standard training facility – is in place but commercial revenues are about a third of those commanded by Leeds, the Championship winners, and require significant boosting. Potential investors are thought to be waiting in the wings, with Louis-Dreyfus believed to be ready to invite them on to the board should promotion be secured. What about the Enzo factor? Enzo Le Fée helped create Sunderland’s three goals against Coventry. No matter that the Roma loanee playmaker was largely deployed out of position on the left wing, Le Fée underlined why Le Bris persuaded Speakman to relax club recruitment rules to be reunited with his former Lorient protege in January. Should Sunderland win promotion, a 25-year-old who revels as a No 10 will automatically see his loan morph into a £20m transfer. Much may hinge on whether the recently hamstrung Mundle is fit to start wide on the left at Wembley.",Sunderland; Championship; Football; Sport,Football
2024-12-10T02:17:48Z,Rugby Australia sets out bold plan to return to top of the sport amid fears over jobs cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/10/rugby-australia-five-year-plan-rights-negotiations-job-cuts,"Rugby Australia has declared it wants to be the sport’s No 1 nation by 2029 in a strategic plan launched on Tuesday that flags job cuts at head office if an anticipated revenue windfall led by broadcast negotiations currently underway is not forthcoming. RA and Channel Nine – the code’s current broadcast partner – are in an exclusive negotiating period around a deal that would follow the current agreement that expires at the end of 2025, but the governing body will expand discussions to other parties if a deal isn’t signed before January. The coming years have been dubbed Australian rugby’s “golden decade”, and include a British and Irish Lions tour next year, a home men’s World Cup in 2027 and the women’s tournament in 2029. RA chief executive Phil Waugh said talks with Nine have been “constructive” but the game needed strong broadcast revenues in order to deliver its strategy. “Right now, we don’t have the revenue lines that we require to do everything we’d like to do,” Waugh said. “Therefore you have to prioritise different programs depending on the revenues, and then make sure that you’ve got the cost discipline across the organisation.” The strategy includes an action to “right-size the business”. RA has taken out an $80m loan to sustain the game until an anticipated increase in revenue arrives in the coming years, and Waugh said there have already been some changes made at head office since he came in last June. Waugh warned the code would have to look at staffing cuts if revenue increases weren’t forthcoming. “Your cost base needs to be appropriate to your revenue line,” he said, underlining the need for a sustainable business. “So naturally that looks at number of FTE [head count] and your cost base, equally we’ve got a good opportunity for this new period to maximise our revenue.” The new strategy covers the period to 2029 and includes pillars around performance, participation growth and promotion, all enabled by “resource and ecosystem efficiency”. In addition to a goal of being the world’s No 1 rugby nation, the strategy specifically targets top four finishes at the 2027 and 2029 World Cups, sevens medals at LA 2028 and two Super Rugby Pacific titles, participation growth among women of 70% and to expand rugby’s fan base from 35% to 50%. Chair of RA, Daniel Herbert, said the game wanted to be ambitious. “You have to give the public and all of our stakeholders, our fans, some very lofty ambitions, otherwise what are we aiming for? We’re aiming for excellence.” Waugh said the performance of the Wallabies – who demonstrated promise on their recent tour of the UK and Ireland – was crucial. “We know that ‘winning teams in gold’ ultimately drives the value of the game,” he said. “86% of our revenue comes through men’s fifteens, so we need to ensure that our Wallabies performances are where they need to be to ultimately fund the rest of the game.”",Rugby union; Rugby Australia; Australia rugby union team; Australia women's rugby union team; Australia sport; Sport,Sport
2025-07-25T09:14:28Z,‘I’m ready to make an impact in the world of work’: how the University of Derby equips students for career success,https://www.theguardian.com/shaping-the-next-generation-of-gamechangers/2025/jul/25/how-university-of-derby-prepares-students-for-career-success,"Preparing students for the world of work is an ever-changing challenge for modern universities. At the University of Derby, a wholehearted commitment to applied learning ensures graduates enter the workforce armed not just with qualifications, but with the technical skills, confidence, connections, and mindset to succeed and achieve. Equipping students for the real world is at the very heart of the university’s purpose, according to Duncan Marson, programme leader and senior lecturer in tourism and applied management at the University of Derby. “Our students are not just leaving with an academic qualification,” he says. “They can be confident that they will graduate with the skills that employers seek. At Derby we have always taken great pride in our approach to teaching and learning and ensure our students leave with real-world readiness and the tools they need to be successful.” Futureproofing students and supporting them to thrive within an unpredictable jobs market is one of the many passions of both Marson and the wider academic team, and it underpins everything on offer at the university’s Derby International Business School. From teaching placements to ongoing career support for graduates, the emphasis is firmly on career readiness, not just academic performance. “At the University of Derby, every module we teach and every project we deliver is grounded in applied learning. It’s industry-linked, often shaped directly by the challenges businesses are facing right now and those anticipated in the future too.” The university’s new Cavendish Building – the soon-to-be home of Derby International Business School – is set to provide an exceptional learning environment and has been designed with a “living lab” ethos in mind. A centre for innovation, circular economy projects, and hands-on learning, it’s planned to change the way students engage with issues such as sustainability. “Teaching modules are mapped to the UN sustainable development goals,” says Marson. “We’re part of the SDG Teach In initiative, and that focus on sustainability – both environmental as well as the inevitable economic parameters – runs through everything we do.” Derby’s rich industrial heritage – particularly in engineering, rail, and aerospace – is a huge influence on the university. This is reflected in pioneering enterprise partnerships. Rolls-Royce, which has operated a manufacturing facility in Derby for more than 60 years, recently co-developed an international business and AI degree with the university, inspired by research from Derby’s Sustainable Business and Green Growth Research Cluster. While the location of the university in the East Midlands is of profound importance, the University of Derby retains a distinctly global focus. “Our students get to work on projects with organisations all over the world, including the Bank of England, the FA, and Boots, as well as Marketing Derby, which is focused on generating inward investment into the city and takes a very global approach to doing so,” says Marson. As well as supporting international enterprise, the University of Derby champions regional SMEs – an approach that earned it the small business charter, the national accolade that recognises excellence in SME support. It’s well documented that businesses must establish a robust talent pipeline in order to survive. In response, the university tailors its curriculum to ensure it is aligned with changing industry needs. Max Smith, who graduated from the University of Derby this summer with a first-class degree in business management, credits the university’s career-focused approach with preparing him not just for work, but for life. Having secured a role with Alstom, a supplier of trains and train services, Smith believes the University of Derby’s commitment to real-world, applied learning helped sharpen his career and ensured he stood out when applying for the role. “The careers and employment service were a great help,” he says. “A lot of praise goes to them. They helped completely restructure my CV, and even launched an initiative where you could pick up smart clothes for interviews if you needed them.” Originally from Poland, Natalia Jarczyńska graduated from the University of Derby with a BA (hons) in business management and is now a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs in the US. Jarczyńska says the University of Derby’s practical approach not only helped her develop vital business acumen but crucial soft skills – including active listening, communication, and adaptability – that she uses daily in New York’s financial district. “At Derby, we didn’t just write essays,” Jarczyńska says. “We pitched to clients, worked on real problems, and got feedback from actual stakeholders. That gave me confidence and communication skills that I use every day. Derby gave me a foundation few other universities offer.” Should she ever wish to further her academic qualifications, Jarczyńska says she would think about returning to the East Midlands. “In terms of my career goals, I want to stay in finance, but if I ever think about doing an MBA or maybe a PhD in future, I will definitely consider returning to Derby, that’s for sure,” she says, underscoring the university’s impact on her both professionally and personally. The University of Derby empowers students to hit the ground running when they graduate, but its commitment to employability doesn’t end there. Graduates can continue accessing career services – including job hunting, networking, CV advice, and mentoring from industry leaders – for up to three years after they graduate. For students like Smith, the impact of studying at Derby is profound and long-lasting. “I feel ready to step into the job market and make an impact,” he says. “Derby doesn’t just teach you for exams – it teaches you for life.” ‘Derby helped create a safe, nurturing space for me to grow’ Los Angeles-born Tyra Tucker graduated from the University of Derby in 2020 with a degree in international relations and diplomacy. Now living in the UK, she works as a civil servant. While studying at Derby, Tucker joined one of the university’s business development programmes, which offered workshops, mentors, one‑on‑one support, and grant funding to help students launch their own ventures. Inspired by her entrepreneurial mother, Tucker had an idea for a cultural platform and attended additional classes through the programme on design, finance, and marketing. She then registered her business, secured mentoring, and qualified for a startup grant, which enabled her to assemble a small paid team of student interns – a videographer, marketer, and social media coordinator – to help launch a multimedia site dedicated to global culture. A turning point came when her mentor persuaded her to pitch at a university showcase. Nervous but encouraged, Tucker presented to a live audience and won decisively with 42% of the vote – a moment that built her creative confidence and strengthened her belief in her business. Tucker says Derby didn’t just nudge her into entrepreneurship – it equipped her. Through practical training, mentor support, collaborative teams, and a “just start” culture, Tucker learned to “stop over‑perfecting” at the same time as developing her practical skills, such as how to manage finances. Her advice to current students is simple.“Now is the best time to start something,” she says – university offers the time, creative community, and entrepreneurial freedom that can vanish after graduation. Looking back, Tucker says that Derby didn’t confine her – it “unboxed” her. She arrived with ideas and passion, and left with tangible achievements, experience, confidence, a professional network, and enduring support that continues to this day, long after she graduated and moved into the world of work. “I walked in with ideas and walked out knowing they mattered,” she says. “Confidence isn’t built by dreaming but by doing,” she adds. “Derby helped me to tap into what was already within me and created a safe, nurturing space for me to grow without limit.” Tucker’s current role proves that creative student ideas, supported by the structure and community on offer at Derby, are laying the groundwork for real-world leadership.

2025-02-01T09:00:37Z,‘People want clothes that match their values’: sustainability takes centre stage at Nairobi fashion week,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/01/sustainability-nairobi-fashion-week-african-designers,"From recycled wide-leg denims to Afrofuturistic designs made from secondhand curtains, the catwalk at Nairobi fashion week has featured a wave of new designers focussed on sustainable fashion in Africa. The annual event, which began in 2013 to promote Africa’s then nascent fashion industry, has grown to become a showcase for sustainability in recent years amid concerning reports on the environmental impacts of textile waste on the continent. Eco and culturally conscious brands, such as the Kenyan studio Maisha by Nisria, have shown collections this year. The label makes designs by hand from discarded textiles sourced at flea markets, wholesalers, recycling factories and landfill. One piece from its new Afropia collection, showing on Saturday, the last day of the event, is a cropped high-collar jacket and boxy miniskirt made from repurposed curtains. “You can use anything and everything to make something interesting,” says Tausi Conde, the label’s head of design. Conde says he stumbled into sustainable fashion at university, when limited access to fabrics pushed him to get creative: repurposing his mum’s old clothes to design stylish outfits for student models. Today, it is an integral part of his brand. He and his team follow a strict zero-waste policy, leftover fabric is transformed into patchwork bags and accessories. Sustainable fashion is about more than just being environmentally responsible, it’s about ethical sourcing and labour practices and passing on African cultural heritage through designs, according to designers showing their work. The Rwandan designer Jean Maurice Niyigena, who runs the urban streetwear label Bone Koboyi, uses repurposed or recycled materials to make his range, working with local artisans to source and tailor the clothing. His new Exodus collection uses exaggerated silhouettes, from flared trousers to oversized pockets, and hand-painting inspired by traditional textile art. The pieces reflect the balance the designer straddles in his work, breaking away from restrictive conventions while honouring African culture and craftsmanship. “It’s about innovating without fear, while remembering where you come from,” says Niyigena. “The [sustainable fashion] market is growing, especially among young conscious consumers who are more aware of environmental and social issues, and are looking for options that match their values and honour culture, and have global appeal.” The Cameroonian designer Sikoti Mbaitjongue, who has showcased playful cotton pastel designs at the fashion week, says a big challenge she has faced running her Dakar-based label, Sokolata, since 2022 has been sourcing and processing raw cotton. While west Africa is a major producer of cotton, many countries on the continent export the bulk of the raw material, which is processed elsewhere and re-imported as fabric. With little left to meet national demand or support the growth of local textile industries, designers go to great lengths to find and make quality fabric. Mbaitjongue now imports cotton from Benin, but it affects the overall cost of her range, pricing many African consumers out. “For [sustainable fashion] to become more accessible, our industries will need to deliver,” says Sikoti, whose permanent collections range mostly from £40 to £90. Her main clients are from the African diaspora and Senegalese expat communities. “For now, sustainable fashion is not a sustainable business – we can’t compete with fast fashion. But as more of us [eco-conscious designers] come up, I’d like to see a future where it is,” says Conde. Conveners of the fashion week are calling for policies across the continent that support designers and textile industries. While there is growing interest among emerging designers in sustainable fibres produced on the continent such as jute, kenaf and kapok, producing eco-friendly fashion has its challenges, such as competition from the influx of secondhand clothing from other countries that critics say is stifling the growth of local industries and causing irreversible environmental harm. Studies on textile waste in Ghana suggest that up to 60% of the imported garments are found to be unsellable and end up in dump sites, gutters and open spaces. Nairobi fashion week organisers have also called for tighter regulations on imported garments. Brian Kihindas, creative director of the Nairobi Fashion Week, convened a group of traders, consumers, designers and policymakers to discuss the issue over the week and make recommendations. “The quality [of second hand clothes] has been watered down, and that’s a textile waste issue,” he says.",Global development; Fashion weeks; Fashion; Fashion industry; Life and style; Kenya; Africa,Global development
2025-04-05T07:00:16Z,Farmers in England fear for nature after sustainable farming funding frozen,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/05/farmers-in-england-fear-for-nature-after-sustainable-farming-funding-frozen,"Farmers fear they will no longer be able to afford to restore nature in England and reduce their carbon footprint after government funding for doing this was frozen. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, recently announced that the sustainable farming incentive (SFI), which pays farmers for making space for nature on their land, would be paused and overhauled before June’s spending review. The scope of the scheme – and its budget – are being reassessed. He is considering blocking farmers who make a lot of money from agriculture from applying for the scheme, which is part of a package of payments that replaced the EU’s common agricultural policy and paid land managers for the amount of land in their care, with the aim of paying farmers to look after nature, soil and other public goods, rather than simply for farming and owning land. In England, 70% of land is farmed, so if nature is to recover, farmers need support to make space for it on their land. This includes planting trees and hedges, digging ponds and leaving strips of land for wildflowers. Amelia Greenway, 24, farms native cattle and pigs on 365 hectares (900 acres) of the National Trust’s Killerton Estate in Devon. She was applying for £94,000 worth of SFI payments when the application was frozen. “We are already sustainable as we are organic. We have highland cattle and rare breed pigs which we conservation graze,” she said. But she wanted to go one step further. “We were going to start growing our own pig feed to create a circular system in our farm, we were going to sow wildflowers in there as well, and it was going to be a good thing for pollinators. We now can’t afford the seed to do that,” she said. It is hard for tenant farmers to apply for schemes as they have to work with the landlords. Greenway had been working on her funding application for months – time that has been wasted. “The planning we have had to do over SFI has been immense,” she said. “This has seriously wasted our time. We had to do so many paperwork applications that delayed the process.” She said farmers were giving up on the government to provide funding and solutions for nature, and had to accept they would need to do it themselves. “I hope this gives farmers the opportunity not to put their heads in the sand. We weren’t reliant on subsidy but it was great to have that cash boost we could reinvest. Not having the reinvestment will make us become a bit stagnant if the SFI doesn’t become available again.” Greenway says she is lucky to have a good landlord in the National Trust, which supports nature-friendly farming, but not all farmers are so fortunate: “Since the shocking news of SFI closure, it’s just reminded us of our gratitude towards the National Trust. Without the support of empathetic landlords who want to allow sustainable farming to be a viable business we wouldn’t be a sustainable business. I am very stagnant now, not moving forward with nature recovery. I have to count my blessings, but I have to look forward to the future and work even more closely with my landlords.” She feared other farmers may be discouraged from nature-friendly farming: “I am really worried for the landscape actually; for those farmers who were considering going into regenerative farming, the chopping and changing has completely reduced confidence so it’s caused them to want to intensify instead.” Anthony Curwen, 63, is the country estate manager of Quex Park in Kent, which grows wheat, oilseed rape, oats, beans, potatoes and maize silage across 1,012 hectares (2,500 acres) of arable land. He applied for the SFI just before the application window closed, and has now been left in limbo. “It is just very shocking and surprising that it was withdrawn last week,” he said. “What we are doing is helping sustainable farming, pollen and nature strips. We don’t use insecticides, we plant cover crops. We have already started doing everything. We were hoping to get the money for doing it.” Curwen has loved seeing nature come back to the farm. “I’ve noticed more insects, more birds. Lots of things were here 40 or 50 years ago and disappeared then came back. We’ve seen turtle doves come back to the farm, we’ve seen yellow hammers which I haven’t seen for a long time. It is joyous to see it all return.” He is worried other farmers will not get this same opportunity: “We’ve been on this journey for several years, but the vast bulk of farmers don’t know what to do. They need persuasion, they need help. It will take a lot of rebuilding trust to hit government targets on biodiversity, carbon and soil regeneration. It is quite scary going on that route as it is very different to what they would have been doing.” Curwen does not agree with the government’s plans to means test it, as it will encourage larger farms to intensify food production with more pesticides and less nature. “Who could say that nature doesn’t matter on a big farm? Nature matters on every farm. Many big farms may go in the opposite direction and intensify and that will hurt nature. It is trying to divide and rule to be honest with you.” Despite using fewer pesticides and creating more space for nature, productivity has not reduced on his farm: “Less inputs and more circular farming actually give us more food security. This is all being put at risk because of the clumsy way this is all going on.” He did not realise this would be the case to begin with, but now is a true convert and a member of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. “I was sceptical of regenerative farming but we have now realised it makes a huge difference to everything around you,” he said. “I am in despair. I am just saddened as I think it is going to be harder now. I thought we were a world leader in this journey and now it’s all up in the air.” • This article was amended on 5 April 2025 to correct the spelling of Amelia Greenway’s surname.",Farming; Agriculture; England; UK news; Environment,Environment
2024-09-23T13:22:25Z,"Batterymaker Northvolt to cut 1,600 jobs amid electric car ‘headwinds’",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/23/battery-maker-northvolt-cut-jobs-sweden-electric-car-market,"The Swedish batterymaker Northvolt is to cut 1,600 jobs, in response to “headwinds” blowing through the electric car industry. The battery company announced redundancies across three of its sites on Monday, including 1,000 in Skellefteå, in northern Sweden, where it is suspending the expansion of Northvolt Ett, Europe’s first homegrown battery gigafactory. The company, which has been seen as Europe’s most promising contender to China’s battery producers, will also cut 400 jobs in Västerås, in central Sweden, where Northvolt Labs is based, and 200 in Stockholm, home to its head office. Peter Carlsson, the company’s chief executive and co-founder, insisted that “overall momentum for electrification remains strong” but that “tough” decisions were needed to ensure the company’s future. Northvolt’s employees have endured weeks of uncertainty over the company’s future amid reports of urgent financial problems and a halt on expenses. Cost-cutting measures, including job cuts, were announced two weeks ago, and the company is also looking for new investment. Europe’s electric vehicle sector has been struggling as consumer demand for greener vehicles struggles to increase quickly enough. Last week, industry figures showed the number of cars sold in the EU fell to 643,000 in August. “While overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate. We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business,” Carlsson said. “Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we’re taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt’s future.” Northvolt, which counts Volkswagen and BMW among its customers, said it would focus on scaling up operations in Skellefteå to produce battery cells with a 16GWh production capacity. The Ett project was expected to provide an extra 30GWh of annual capacity. All redundancies are “subject to ongoing union negotiations”, the company said. The cuts are the latest in a wave of job losses sweeping the industry, including 14,000 announced by Elon Musk’s Tesla earlier this year and thousands linked to potential factory closures by Volkswagen in Germany. Separately, the Swedish broadcaster SVT reported on Monday that faulty pipes at Northvolt’s factory in Skellefteå, which is close to the Arctic Circle, have leaked a toxic chemical, NMP, used in battery manufacturing because the facility was not built to withstand the cold. In response, Northvolt told the broadcaster that the company makes detailed risk assessments, any leaks were not caused by the building’s design, which is built for the climate, and emissions were handled according to permits. A Northvolt spokesperson said: “The factory is built for the climate in Skellefteå. The part of the building that receives NMP is not directly related to building design so leaks should not be related to the design. “We have taken preventative and corrective measures to prevent and minimise any incidents. We also, always, undertake detailed risk and task assessments that help develop informed work instructions which all operators are trained in.”","Automotive industry; Technology sector; Business; Sweden; Europe; World news; UK news; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Environment",Business
2024-11-25T07:00:34Z,"Multilateralism faces a toxic brew of debt, climate crisis and war. It’s time for a reboot | Mo Ibrahim",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/25/global-stability-multilateral-international-development-association-seoul-conflict-climate-crisis-debt-bretton-woods-africa,"Multilateralism is under attack. A toxic brew of multiplying conflicts, worsening climate impact, new pandemics and spiralling debt has brought the system to its knees, appearing almost incapable of properly addressing these converging crises. Adding the unknowns of a Trump administration into the mix will do little to allay concerns. My own critiques of the current multilateral system are well documented, but I do not subscribe to the view that it has no future. What’s needed is a total reboot. By the end of the year, we have a unique opportunity to demonstrate that multilateralism can address these challenges. Next month, the world’s wealthier countries will decide what they can commit in development finance to further support the world’s low-income countries at the World Bank-led International Development Association’s (IDA) 21st “replenishment” in Seoul. These pledges are made only every three years. The decisions made in South Korea will therefore determine how equipped we are to meet the challenges on the horizon. Among countries that have already made pledges ahead of the meeting are Poland and Norway, with a 100% and 50% increase over their previous contributions. Others must now follow suit. The IDA’s track record is strong. In 2024, it committed $31.2bn (£24.3bn) to projects in low-income countries, with more than 70% going to Africa. As a result of IDA commitment between 2012 and 2023, more than 1 billion people received essential health services, 117 million people gained access to improved water services, and 92 million people obtained new or improved electricity services. Since 1960, 35 nations have graduated from IDA, with many, such as India and South Korea – which has announced a 45% increase in its contribution this year – returning as donors, the best proof of success nurtured. This replenishment comes at a critical time, and there may be no second chances. The stakes are unusually high, both for people in low-income countries and for the reputation of the financial multilateral system. The higher-income countries’ decisions come at a tipping point. Implementation of the UN’s sustainable development goals has veered totally off-track for poorer countries, drowning in the very same toxic brew of conflict, climate crisis and post-Covid debt. Let us avoid a blinkered view. Unmet expectations feed frustration and anger, fuelling instability and conflicts. Less development in these countries means more insecurity globally. The ageing Bretton Woods global financial system, to which IDA belongs, is increasingly challenged for its inability to properly address these countries’ specific needs. But this isn’t just about need, it’s also about opportunity. Africa is home to a wealth of key assets. The continent is forecast to have the world’s largest, youngest workforce within just 10 years – provided these young people get the relevant skills. And they will have the entrepreneurial and innovative mindsets needed in this rapidly changing world. Africa also owns major reserves of critical and low-carbon minerals, a huge carbon-sink potential and a wealth of biodiversity, all crucial for the world’s green transition. The IDA can play a pivotal role in turning this potential into reality. Funding health and education remain vital, but access to energy, digital advancement, AI and climate-resilient and sustainable infrastructure and cities will be the gamechangers. Access to energy is a prime example. Without it, there can be no development, no health, no education, no jobs, no sustainable business opportunities. Closing the energy gap for the continent’s 600 million people is essential. I don’t expect the IDA to solve all the challenges. In my foundation’s recent report, Financing Africa: Where is the Money?, we conclude that the funding is often there, but without the relevant mechanisms to use it efficiently. For example, we are still waiting for the mechanisms to ensure that the $650bn of additional special drawing rights (SDRs) pledged after Covid, more than two years ago now, benefit those who need it most. This is an unacceptable waste. Money is an important part of the equation, but not the whole story. In parallel to just replenishing IDA’s resources, we need to seriously work on allocation mechanisms and processes. The world is watching to see whether the already developed countries, and the institutions they established to ensure a peaceful and prosperous world, are equal to the challenges we share today. The stakes are high in a rapidly evolving geopolitical order.

2025-05-08T07:00:25Z,Could a new wave of urgent theatre hold the key to tackling climate change?,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/may/08/the-beautiful-future-is-coming-hot-mess-bringing-the-outside-in-the-herds,"Climate stories are typically defined by despair. The future we are told of is such a tragic, barren dystopia, it’s hard to look at head-on. But a flood of theatre-makers are writing their way past fear into something more useful, inspiring action through love, music, puppetry and folklore. “The ones who profit most from the idea that we’re doomed are the oil companies and the people massively polluting our planet,” reasons playwright Flora Wilson Brown. “If we allow ourselves to think there’s nothing we can do, we won’t do anything. There’s still time to act.” Wilson Brown rejects this nightmarish narrative in her play, The Beautiful Future Is Coming, at Bristol Old Vic. Exploring the impact of the climate crisis through the eyes of three couples, the play jumps between 1856, 2027 and 2100. In the scenes set in the past, life is returned to Eunice Foote, the real scientist who discovered the greenhouse effect years before the man who took credit for it; in the future, we visit the Svalbard seed vault, where humanity has stashed the ambition of life on another planet. “It’s about making the impact emotional,” Wilson Brown says, “rather than statistical.” In the timeline closest to the present day, The Beautiful Future Is Coming holds a mirror up, reminding us that we still have choice in our actions. “It’s easy to go: ‘I’m overwhelmed, I don’t know what I can do,’” says Nancy Medina, the show’s director and artistic director of Bristol Old Vic. “Actually, what you can do is care.” To nervously look away is a privilege, she says. “The majority of people being affected by the climate crisis, in the global south, don’t have the time or the energy to be scared of it. They are only just surviving it.” Through this lens, hope becomes an active, life-grabbing choice. A way of fighting for a future we can bear to look at. Stories have long been the way we share possibilities of a better world. During the research and development for Bringing the Outside In, a show made by and for young people around Southampton and the New Forest, playwright Kit Miles learned about the folkloric tale of Yernagate the giant. As protector of the New Forest, the giant helps an old woman defy the man who is single-handedly cutting down all the forest’s trees. “The young people we worked with spoke about how the doom mentality makes them feel powerless,” explains Miles, who grew up on the edge of the New Forest. “As though they can’t do anything, as though it’s all lost. We are using the story of Yernagate to show that something can be done.” A collaboration between community arts organisation Theatre for Life and the New Forest National Park Authority, the place creates a sense of intimacy through localisation. “We looked at the effects of climate change in our own community,” explains actor Imani Okoh. They spoke to climate scientists, marine biologists and rangers. Supported by the YouCAN (Youth for Climate Action for Nature) scheme, the show has been built round the young participants’ responses and concerns. “They felt strongly about the invisible parts of climate change like air pollution,” says Miles, “which then became the focus of the story.” They read about the tragic death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old who died from an asthma attack, the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as the cause of death. “It’s not our grandchildren’s lifetime,” Miles says soberly. “It’s ours.” In their story, Yernagate helps a young, isolated, asthmatic teenager, played by Okoh, as she struggles with the weight of climate anxiety. Power is handed to their young audiences through the idea of a community garden, a small act of accessible protest, with a mother inspired by Ella’s mum Rosamund “who is quietly doing everything she can”, Miles says. When they took it to show a group of young people living in social housing in Southampton, the response was effusive. “They said it represented them and their community,” Okoh says. “It’s their world, their high rise, their home.” By making their story local, the climate emergency becomes easier to grasp, easier to fight. Though the topic is thorny, comedy snakes in, with The Beautiful Future Is Coming rolling its eyes at sustainable business as a marketing consultant takes a plane to pitch to Greenpeace. With Birmingham Hippodrome’s New Musical Theatre department, Jack Godfrey and Ellie Coote have been experimenting with the same idea. “We wanted to make something entertaining and silly that also talks about these really serious issues,” says Godfrey. “I don’t think those things need to be in opposition to each other.” Their new musical is a romantic comedy. Pitching the Earth and humanity as two partners in a troubled relationship, Hot Mess premieres at the Edinburgh fringe this year. The duo wanted to write a show that spoke to the climate crisis, but it took a breakup and a bike ride for the idea to click. “I was writing angsty breakup songs,” Godfrey laughs, “and I was cycling to work when I realised a song I’d written could be sung from the perspective of humanity to the Earth.” Drawing out the metaphor, they played the beats of a romantic relationship against Earth’s bumpy history with its inhabitants. “There are some dark moments which will feel relatable for people when they think about their own relationships,” says Coote, “and some will feel existential when thinking about our relationship with the planet.” But they wanted to root it in humour, not fear. “We wanted to disarm the audience with a familiar story,” she says, “and let them feel their way through.” Like the teams in Bristol and Southampton, they felt the facts of the climate crisis too easily slip from our fingers. “We wanted to use the superpower of musical theatre,” says Godfrey, “which is to move people.” These plays seek to take what often feels invisible and lay it out for an audience to see more clearly. Abroad, a stampede of animals are confronting this challenge on even larger stages. In 2021, a 12ft-tall puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian girl, called Little Amal, walked 8,000km (5,000 miles) from Turkey to the UK to raise awareness of the urgent plight of refugees. This summer, the same team began a 20,000km (12,400 mile) journey, shepherding The Herds, a group of lifesize animal puppets, from the Congo basin to the Arctic Circle. “The people who depend on the forest are feeling the climate crisis now,” says David Lan, one of the core team and former artistic director of the Young Vic. “Animals are already moving from their ancient habitat because the Earth is too hot. We wanted to dramatise this to express the way life is already being strongly affected by what’s happening to the climate.” The project leapfrogs people’s resistance to admit that the climate emergency is already making our home uninhabitable by placing it in front of them, in public spaces. “Climate scientists we’ve spoken to say there is good, meaningful data,” says Lan, “but they need artists to tell it as a story people can connect with.” The idea came from taking Little Amal to the UN’s climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. The Herds will grow in size, from roughly 30 in Kinshasa to more than a hundred by the time it reaches the Arctic Circle, with new species added along the way by South African puppet company Ukwanda. “I say with confidence that the animals will have power,” Lan says, “when they rampage into city centres.”The extraordinary scale of the project, which will pass through London and Manchester in late June and early July, is part of its power. “We hope it being so extensive expresses that you can do big things,” Lan says. “You can bring people together. You can change things.” Like Bristol Old Vic and Theatre for Life creating local connections, The Herds is made possible by its partnerships; Little Amal formed collaborations between organisations who had existed next door to each other for years but had never thought to work together. “The provocation is to engage,” Lan says. “Find the place where your energy can be effective, where you can connect to other people.” By shifting the narrative from doom to hope, these theatre-makers aim to inspire conversation, action and collaboration. “We can only do it together,” Lan says of changing our minds and our future. “Doing it by instruction is not going to work. It’s got to be felt.” While their stories take different forms, they all believe in the power of the emotion that can gather in a crowd. “Hope is built on community,” notes Miles. “All it takes is a theatre’s worth of people to do something big.” The Beautiful Future Is Coming is at Bristol Old Vic, 15 May to 7 June; Hot Mess is at Pleasance Two, Edinburgh, 30 July to 25 August; Bringing the Outside In is at Mayflower, Southampton, 15 July, then touring in 2026; The Herds visits London, 27 to 29 June, and Manchester, 3 to 5 July.",Theatre; Climate crisis; Bristol Old Vic; David Lan; Stage; Culture; Environment,Stage
2025-02-04T08:00:16Z,Cricket’s going bananas: nothing is real at Hundred auction but it still costs £145m | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/04/hundred-auction-london-spirit-cricket-going-bananas,"Five years ago an artist named Maurizio Cattelan bought a banana from a grocery store in Miami and taped it to the wall of a gallery. People came to look at the banana. People wanted selfies with the banana. The banana divided opinion. Some were affronted and insulted by the banana. Some applauded the artist on his clever subversion of traditional artistic tropes. Either way, pretty soon everyone was talking about the banana. In November 2024, the banana – not the same banana, obviously, but a fresh banana bought that morning – was taken on a global publicity tour to drum up business before its auction at Sotheby’s. After a frenzied bidding war, the banana was bought for about £5m by Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency investor. Shortly afterwards the winning bidder called a press conference and, in front of the watching media, promptly ate the banana. “It’s much better than other bananas,” Sun said. “It’s really quite good.” The only reason for recounting all this is that something similar appears to have just happened with the London Spirit. Take a renowned British institution. Round up all the tech magnates and gaudy new money you can find. Create a bit of theatre and buzz in advance. Draw a VIP circle, and then a VVIP circle inside the VIP circle. Hire yourself a reassuringly plummy-voiced auctioneer in a pinstripe suit. And that is it. You can start the bidding. As for the thing you are actually selling, it does not matter. Just make up any old shit. Look, here is a cricket team we invented this morning. They are called the London Spirit. We have put them in blue shirts, although feel free to change their name and dress them however you want. Here is a picture of Liam Dawson wearing a London Spirit shirt. Obviously you will not actually own a physical Liam Dawson. The real Liam Dawson will decay at regular intervals and need to be replaced. What you are paying for is the idea of Liam Dawson. The sheer audacity of putting a skiddy left-arm spinner in a blue shirt and selling it in the first place. And so it was that on Friday, at Berkeley Square in London, a consortium of Silicon Valley investors paid £145m for 49% of a name, a set of fonts, and a sporting franchise that has won 23 of its 65 games. Like the other seven Hundred teams being sold off last week and this, the London Spirit contains no actual physical assets. Players and staff are hired on a freelance basis. Their ground, Lord’s, belongs to the majority owners MCC. As for digital assets, the London Spirit X account has 162 followers at the time of writing and has not posted since July 2021. None of this, in short, feels real. And yet the money is real: real cash, from real people, that can be spent on real things. The first five franchise sales alone yielded around £350m, which will be shared between the recreational game, the 18 counties and MCC. Debts can now be paid off, grassroots facilities improved, new infrastructure built. Pretty much overnight, English cricket feels like a place of dreams and enterprise. Was it all worth it, then? Did the marketing geniuses at the England and Wales Cricket Board just manage to sell eight bananas for half a billion pounds? Well, kind of. For all the whiff of novelty and gimmick, of course the Hundred was not created out of thin air but carved out of the existing architecture of English cricket: those precious August holiday weeks, the Twenty20 Blast that was the financial lifeblood of so many counties. Built on the toil of the schools and clubs and academies and coaches that produced these market-ready players in the first place. Forced through with bullying and threats, secrecy and often just plain lying. Even so, this column extends a cordial invitation to any reader who can plot a more palatable course through a landscape of declining interest in bilateral international cricket, who can devise a more painless way of raising £500m. Because – and let’s be clear about this – there is no empirical market value here. No algorithm can possibly tell you the true worth of a made-up team in a made-up competition, and in any case to the buyers involved the sums are so trivial as to be essentially meaningless. The Ambani family, who just bought 49% of Oval Invincibles, is worth around £240bn. Their £61m stake is comfortably less than the amount they reportedly spent last year on a Mediterranean cruise featuring private performances from Katy Perry and Pitbull. And when you possess this kind of wealth, there are more efficient ways of multiplying it than by investing in cricket. In this context, it makes more sense to think of the Hundred as a kind of luxury good than a hard-nosed business investment. Revenue remains negligible, overseas broadcast rights an entirely speculative market. The AI-driven future in which Dawson’s death‑overs hitting is being beamed to a billion phone screens, overlaid with live betting prices, remains largely theoretical. What really matters is the prestige, the hubris, the invited influencers and Bollywood actors taking selfies in the Lord’s pavilion. The idea of buying a cool thing simply because you could, and then eating it live on camera. Of course English cricket gets sniffy about these things, because English cricket is conservative and racist, suspicious of new things and suspicious of brown people and – above all – suspicious of new brown people. But by the same token English cricket has had 150 years to create a sustainable business model for itself, and basically failed. Perhaps, in the absence of any actual sellable product, the only real option left was to flog the vibes, soft power, authentic whiff of Ye Olde English Cricket, Eau de Lord’s. England no longer loves or values cricket. Why not pass the reins to people who actually do? Why indulge the pretence that the entire English game can be run off the subscription fees of Kent members and the few private schools with working nets? For all the dizzying sums of money involved, the pall of unchecked capitalism, the billionaire brazenness, this is in essence a bet on cricket: its past, its present, its future. It is a monumental gamble. But when all you have is a banana on a wall, you may as well get what you can for it.",The Hundred; ECB; Cricket; Sport politics; Sport,Sport
2024-06-18T07:45:07Z,Australian online seller Booktopia enters share trading halt a fortnight after major job cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/18/booktopia-asx-trading-halt-shares-job-cuts,"Australia’s largest online bookseller has entered into a voluntary share trading suspension, just two weeks after axing 50 jobs and losing its chief executive.

The company’s net loss between July and December was $16.7m, with net liabilities of more than $20m. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup At an investor presentation in February, Booktopia announced it had reduced its sales aspirations by between $1m and $3m based on existing market conditions, citing BookScan figures showing an 8.3% industry decline in January 2024. Economic pressures affecting consumer spending, an increasingly competitive landscape and the volatility of the book market were cited as the reasons for the downturn. On 3 June the company withdrew completely the already heavily reduced sales expectations for 2024. “With this decline in revenue and with the organisational restructure about to be implemented, the company is no longer in a position to provide guidance and withdraws the guidance provided to the market in its announcement made on 9 February 2024,” a company statement said. The Booktopia co-founder and board member Tony Nash told Guardian Australia on Tuesday he was unable to comment further at this stage. “We’re in motion at the moment, so [an announcement] will be probably more relevant towards the end of this week or early next week,” he said. In the past fortnight Nash has stepped into the role of executive director and sales director after the resignation of the chief executive David Nenke on 3 June, just 12 months into the role. Booktopia is now in the process of making at least 50 employees at its Rhodes headquarters in Sydney redundant, funded in part by a $1m revolving debt facility secured externally. The Booktopia chairman, Peter George, said the redundancies would result in $6.1m annualised cost savings, which would be realised in 2025 and assist with the company’s restructure. “The sustained volatility of the economic climate, in addition to changing consumer spending behaviours, have continued to contribute to business results that have been below our expectations,” George said in a statement issued earlier this month. “The Board remains committed to building a profitable and sustainable business in the short and long-term and as such, we have regrettably had to make the very difficult decision to make a large reduction in headcount … we recognise we will be losing many talented staff in this process.”",Australia news; Australian books; Business,Culture
2023-04-20T17:27:37Z,BuzzFeed News to close and parent company to make substantial layoffs,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/apr/20/buzzfeed-news-close-layoffs-shutting-down,"BuzzFeed is shutting down what remains of its award-winning news department, signalling the end of an era for a website that once promised to upend the industry. Founder Jonah Peretti told staff on Thursday that “the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News” and would be looking to make substantial redundancies across the company. He said the whole company had been hit by the pandemic, a troubled stock market listing, a tough economy, a declining stock market, a slowdown in digital advertising, and changing audience habits. Peretti suggested that there may not be a sustainable business model for high-quality online news. He wrote: “I made the decision to overinvest in BuzzFeed News because I love their work and mission so much. This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn’t provide the distribution or financial support required to support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social media.” BuzzFeed raised hundreds of millions of pounds from investors in the early 2010s as it surfed the explosion of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to distribute content. In addition to producing viral content such as quizzes and lists it invested in original news reporting, in the belief this would attract a higher quality of advertiser. This expensive process involved hiring hundreds of journalists around the world and culminated in the company winning a Pulitzer prize for its reporting. Peretti said he regretted not holding the company to “higher standards for profitability” and said he “exhausted many other cost-saving measures to preserve as many jobs as possible” including cutting costs and closing physical offices. Other similar online news sites – including Vox and Vice – that boomed during the 2010s have also struggled as audiences and advertisers moved away from social media and towards video services such as YouTube and TikTok. Insider – formerly known as Business Insider – also announced it was making substantial job cuts on Thursday. BuzzFeed staff learned about the job losses after being invited to dial into a conference call hosted from a room called “Doomsday”, in line with the company’s tradition of having quirky names for its meeting rooms. When the company made redundancies to its former UK operation staff were invited to hear their fate in a room called “Black Mirror”. In addition to closing BuzzFeed News, Peretti said there would be substantial job cuts across the rest of the business totalling about 180 redundancies – representing about 15% of the company’s workforce. As part of the changes, Peretti announced that two leading executives have made the decision to leave the company. BuzzFeed also owns HuffPost, which will continue to publish news but has also seen deep cutbacks to its coverage in recent years. Peretti said this site was profitable because it had a more loyal audience who visit its homepage directly, rather than relying on social media for distribution. BuzzFeed’s financial challenges reflect the challenges of the online news industry. At one point in 2014 Disney considered buying the site for about $1bn but no deal could be agreed. The company eventually listed on the stock exchange seven years later, since when its share price has collapsed, with the business currently valued at less than $100m. The announcement triggered a slew of reactions online, with many journalists mourning the closure of BuzzFeed News. “Was just at the George Polk Award watching talented BuzzFeed journalists win an award for exposing how a private corporation treated people with severe disabilities and less than a week later BuzzFeed News is shutting down. Sometimes it feels like our industry is in shambles,” wrote Laila Al-Arian, a producer at Al Jazeera English. Tom Namako, an executive editor at NBC News, tweeted: “BuzzFeed News deserved so much better, and has for a long time.” “Absolutely devastated for @buzzfeednews. You have to understand that some of the most talented people in our industry were there fighting to keep it alive,” said Sara Yasin, a Los Angeles Times managing editor. Meanwhile, Kat Tenbarge, a tech and culture reporter at NBC News, tweeted, “This shutdown … highlights the failings of the online information economy. People may *want* information that is newsworthy and accurate, but by design platforms don’t value it.” Others took aim at Peretti himself, with Jon Christian, an editor at Futurism, writing: “Wild that Peretti doubles down on AI in the same memo where he kills the award-winning BuzzFeed News,” referring to Peretti’s pledge to “bring more innovation to clients in the form of creators, AI, and cultural moments …” Kate Erbland, an executive editor at IndieWire, wrote: “So, is Jonah Peretti axing himself too, or …? Because in his memo he calls out about half a dozen ways in which he personally screwed BuzzFeed News.”",BuzzFeed; US news; World news; Technology; Media; Internet; Digital media,Media
2024-05-21T01:46:49Z,"Telstra to cut 2,800 jobs but chief executive insists change won’t affect retail customers",https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/21/telstra-job-cuts-2800-roles-changes-customer-impact,"Telstra has announced it will cut 2,800 jobs when overhauling its enterprise business, with the chief executive, Vicki Brady, saying it was a “very hard day” for the telecommunications giant. Brady, in an announcement to the Australian Stock Exchange, said resetting the Telstra arm that services large businesses and government agencies would lead to a “streamlined product portfolio”, a reduced number of network applications and services products, and simplified customer sales and service. Brady said on Tuesday that the majority of the roles being axed were in the enterprise business, with most to be finalised by the end of 2024. The company said it would consult with the union as part of the changes. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The actions we are announcing today are difficult, but they are necessary to be a more efficient and sustainable business to ensure we can keep investing at the level required to meet the ever-increasing demand for our connectivity,” Brady told reporters. “The jobs that we will commence consultation on today do not impact our consumer customer service team.” The chief executive said the changes were needed to deal with inflation and higher energy costs – as well as tough market conditions. “Our industry and the world we are operating in are changing. We have new and different competitors. We have rapid advances in technologies happening. Our customer needs continue to evolve and we have ongoing inflationary and cost pressures,” she said. “At the same time, the need for better connectivity right across the country only continues to grow. We continue to see growth in data on our mobile network at 30% per annum.” Brady said the growth in data meant the company needed to make significant ongoing investments in infrastructure. The Communication Workers Union national assistant secretary, James Perkins, rejected Telstra’s claim that the cuts would not affect customer service. “While the detail of where exactly these jobs are being cut from is still unclear, one thing is certain – it will have a devastating impact on services,” he said. “You can’t slash thousands of jobs without seriously impacting the delivery of services across the country. Telstra has to answer to this.” In February, Telstra announced a review of its enterprise business. The review remains ongoing and Telstra said it came amid “challenging market conditions”. As of mid-2023, Telstra had more than 31,000 employees. The company said it expected the restructuring to cost between $200m and $250m in the 2024 and 2025 financial years. The company announced it would stop the annual price review for postpaid mobile plans falling in July and being tied to the consumer price index. Brady would not say what this meant for the price of Telstra plans broadly, but said the company needed to consider a range of factors in its pricing beyond just CPI and there would be no pricing announcement in July.",Telstra; Telecommunications industry; Australia news; Business,Business
2024-06-17T16:30:59Z,Blumhouse comes to video games with six different indie horror projects,https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/17/blumhouse-comes-to-video-games-with-six-different-indie-horror-projects-summer-game-fest-2024,"A new indie video game publisher made its debut in Los Angeles last week: Blumhouse Games, a division of the horror movie production company co-founded by director Jason Blum in 2000. Unsurprisingly, its specialty will be horror. During the livestreamed Summer Game Fest showcase, Blum and creative lead Louise Blain announced a slate of six experimental horror games, the first of which, Fear the Spotlight, will launch later this year. Blum described the games label as “going back to our roots, with a focus on indie horror, pushing boundaries and elevating new, original stories”. Like the company’s movies, from Paranormal Activity to M3GAN, its games are all low-budget productions with interesting ideas. The slate includes Project C, a new project from the creators of the brilliant and unusual cine-game Immortality; Grave Seasons, a farming-life game where one of the townspeople is a serial murderer; and Fear the Spotlight, a 90s-styled low-poly horror game about two teenaged girls and a seance gone awry, made by a two-person husband-and-wife team. “It’s a pretty conservative business model,” explains Blumhouse Games’ president Zach Wood (brother of Elijah), who has been working in video games for over 20 years – including eight years at PlayStation during the PS4 era, when the company’s investment in indie games won it huge popularity among players. “We don’t need everything to be a hit. Everybody can make money at a moderate success level, and that’s really important for us, especially given market conditions. We want to make a profit for everybody that we work with. It’s important that our development partners have a sustainable business, and can continue making games.” The launch comes at a time when the relationship between movie and TV studios and video games is closer than ever, thanks to several extremely successful video game adaptations. Both Illumination’s Super Mario Bros movie and HBO’s The Last of Us were made in close collaboration with the game developers that birthed them. But Blumhouse Games is not looking to simply adapt its film IP – its first signings are unique games that aren’t tied to any franchise (though Blum doesn’t rule out games based on Blumhouse’s own stable in future, “if the timing is right”). “We were looking for an innovative approach to horror, something we haven’t seen before,” said Blain, who joined the company late last year. “There’s no prerequisite, we’re just taking what’s interesting ... I’ve been a big lover of Blumhouse for a very long time, and so many of my favourite Blumhouse movies come from limitations – something like Paranormal Activity, smaller projects that were doing cool things. And when you transfer that over to games, it means taking different approaches to scary stories.” The six games that Blumhouse has signed so far are all very different, from slow-paced creeping narrative games to horrific action games such as Crisol: Theater of Idols, which has you fighting possessed statues of saints in a nightmarish version of Spain. Sleep Awake is described as a psychedelic first-person game: people are disappearing in their sleep, and so all of humanity is caught in a desperate attempt to stay awake. The Simulation, meanwhile, is a fourth-wall-breaking murder mystery set inside a game whose events connect disturbingly to reality. What connects them all? Blain and Wood agree that a good horror game should be an exploration of the unknown. “And a human exploration,” adds Blain. “I think fear is a very common emotion, and when we experience good horror, we’re experiencing a human story that we can relate to. We as humans all have individual fears, but good horror takes us on an empathetic journey.” This interview took place at Summer Game Fest in Los Angeles.

In 2016, after talks in Paris, 196 countries signed an agreement to limit global heating as a result of carbon emissions to at most 2C above preindustrial levels, with an ideal limit of 1.5C to prevent the worst impacts of a drastically changed climate. Many countries have since promised to reduce carbon emissions, but the latest research shows private interests continued to funnel money to oil, gas and coal companies, which have used it to expand their operations. Eight in 10 of the world’s most eminent climate scientists now foresee at least 2.5C of global heating, according to the results of a Guardian survey published last week – an outcome expected to lead to devastating consequences for civilisation. Researchers for the banking on climate chaos report, now in its 15th edition, analysed the world’s top 60 banks’ underwriting and lending to more than 4,200 fossil fuel firms and companies causing the degradation of the Amazon and Arctic. Those banks, they found, gave $6.9tn in financing to oil, coal and gas companies, nearly half of which – $3.3tn – went towards fossil fuel expansion. Even in 2023, two years after many large banks vowed to work towards lowering emissions as part of the Net Zero Banking Alliance, bank finance for fossil fuel companies was $705bn, with $347bn going towards expansion, the report says. US banks were the biggest financiers of the fossil fuel industry, contributing 30% of the total $705bn provided in 2023, the report found. JP Morgan Chase gave the most of any bank in the world, providing $40.8bn to fossil fuel companies in 2023, while Bank of America came in third. The world’s second biggest financier of fossil fuels was the Japanese bank Mizuho, which provided $37.1bn. London-based Barclays was Europe’s biggest fossil fuel financier, with $24.2bn, followed by Spain’s Santander at $14.5bn and Germany’s Deutsche Bank with $13.4bn. Overall, European banks stumped up just over a quarter of the total fossil fuel financing in 2023, according to the report. Tom BK Goldtooth, the executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, which co-authored the study, said: “Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis. Paired with generations of colonialism, the fossil fuel industry and banking institutions’ investment in false solutions create unlivable conditions for all living relatives and humanity on Mother Earth. “As Indigenous peoples, we remain on the frontlines of the climate catastrophe, and the fossil fuel industry targets our lands and territories as sacrifice zones to continue their extraction. Capitalism and its extraction-based economy will only perpetuate more harm and destruction against our Mother Earth and it must come to an end.” Critics of the report said its methodology, which relied on investigating deals reported by financial market data companies such as Bloomberg and Refinitiv, meant researchers did not have a detailed view of what was being financed, and by whom. Specifically, syndicated loans, bond issues and underwriting arrangements often involved several banks with varying levels of exposure. And financing to fossil fuel companies to fund transition technology projects could not be distinguished from financing for new oil wells, they said. Spokespeople for Barclays, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Santander all emphasised that their organisations were supporting energy sector clients’ transitions toward more sustainable business models.

2024-10-01T15:24:50Z,‘Huge losses’: Sweden fears for future of batterymaker Northvolt,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/01/sweden-fears-for-future-of-batterymaker-northvolt,"Just three years ago, Sweden’s then prime minister, Stefan Löfven, visited Northvolt’s base near the Arctic Circle in Skellefteå – Europe’s first homegrown battery gigafactory – and declared the city “the future” in the fight against the climate crisis. Its work had huge significance for Sweden and the world, the Social Democrat said. The arrival of the battery manufacturer was not only supposed to be a flagship project for Sweden’s “green industrial revolution” but hailed as Europe’s big hope against dependence on oil and imported batteries from China. Since its foundation in 2016 to build “the world’s greenest battery”, Northvolt’s rapid rise has attracted billions of dollars of investment and orders from the world’s biggest car companies including Volkswagen, BMW and Volvo. But as Europe’s electric car market struggles, much of this enthusiasm is starting to look like fantasy. In June, BMW cancelled a $2.2bn contract with Northvolt. And last week, amid a spiralling cashflow crisis, the battery manufacturer announced it was making 1,600 redundancies and suspending expansion of its Northvolt Ett factory in Skellefteå. Rumours swirl of potential imminent bankruptcy and even Chinese sabotage – both dismissed by Northvolt as “speculation”. Meanwhile, police are investigating the death of a 25-year-old man at the factory amid suspicions that workplace violationsmay have led to his death. The mood among employees, known as “Northvoltare” (Northvolters), is said to be one of deep concern as they await redundancy details, while workers hired from outside Sweden are faced with the prospect of having to leave the country. Oliver Szabo, the chief security officer for the union IF Metall, said at the Northvolt Labs research and development campus in Västerås, central Sweden, where 400 jobs are to be cut: “Of course people are worried. We see that people don’t know if they will be affected or not.” Although there had been problems, generally Northvolt had been a good workplace, Szabo said, but leadership could have been better. And the alleged workplace death in Skellefteå was “unacceptable”, he added. The company has said it is in contact with prosecutors and police, and told Swedish broadcaster SVT it was refraining “from commenting on the ongoing preliminary investigation”. The Swedish government has ruled out a bailout for Northvolt, but the company’s fate threatens to be a political problem for Sweden and the EU. The energy and industry minister, Ebba Busch, has said the Swedish government was “working actively” to help Northvolt continue operations and following developments closely, but it would not be appropriate for the state to step in with taxpayer loans or as a partner. However, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, has said the government was helping to find new backers and ownership models, which he said they had discussed with Germany, which has also ruled out a financial lifeline for the firm. Mats Engström, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank (ECFR), said the company’s management had “overpromised and underdelivered”, adding that its future was on a knife-edge. “Now it is an open issue if Northvolt will survive,” he said. “Money is rapidly running out. If owners and lenders can agree on financing for the near future it might still be possible to save the core business.” Engström warned that if Northvolt were to collapse, the repercussions would be far from a domestic headache. “It would certainly be a political problem for the Swedish and German governments as well as for the European Commission who all have supported the company’s plans,” he said. He said any collapse would not be a failure for green industrial policy, but rather an indication of the difficulty of large-scale battery cell production, which – unlike iron and steelmining – Sweden did not have a history of experience in. Nevertheless, critics suggest the crisis at Northvolt is a “harsh awakening” for Sweden’s green transition plans and the EU’s green deal. “Northvolt has more than 60bn kronor (£4bn) in debt, is making huge losses, and can’t ramp up its production,” said Christian Sandström, an associate professor and a columnist for the business paper Affärsvärlden. “Any new funds will only go to creditors at this point. The only way to resolve this is via bankruptcy.” The company, he believes, could file for bankruptcy “any day now”. It did not bode well for the multitude of green businesses that had opened in the north of Sweden in recent years, Sandström said. “Handing out cheap government money to capitalists who say they will save the world by setting up factories in the rural north where there’s a lack of skilled labour – maybe it wasn’t such a great idea after all.” The Swedish government recently announced the launch of a “green acceleration office” and proposals to shorten the time it took for businesses to get a permit. “Sweden has enormous potential in the climate transition,” said Kristersson. But some have accused the government of naivety. Jonas Algers, a PhD student at Lund University’s environmental and energy systems studies department, said: “Everyone likes the idea of a slick startup with a charismatic CEO and fancy PowerPoints revolutionising a sector. “But at the end of the day, if you want to build a massive, largest-in-Europe plant it will require lots of workers who need to be coordinated, lots of construction that needs to be done in a safe manner, and skills and technology that need to be developed. None of this is a simple task.” H2 Green Steel, in Boden, northern Sweden, had learned from Northvolt’s mistakes, Algers said, but there were issues in the Swedish labour market for large-scale projects like Northvolt. Citing issues with cashflow, workplace accidents, and problems with subcontractors and machines, he said: “What policymakers need to understand is that the Swedish labour market model is in a bad state due to loopholes and excessive subcontracting which undermines Sweden’s ability to build large and advanced industrial projects.” Matti Kataja, Northvolt’s communication and public affairs director for the Nordics, said: “We are focusing all energy and investments into our core business – large-scale manufacturing of battery cells. Success in the ramp-up of production at our factory Northvolt Ett in northern Sweden is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path.” But, he added: “It’s no secret that we are involved in a financing round. In the past couple of weeks, we have seen significant progress. We hope we will be able to share more information as soon as possible.” The company, he said, was “taking what we believe are the necessary measures to maintain our position as the leading homegrown cell manufacturer in Europe” and was “committed to its founding intention of establishing a European industrial base for battery production”.","Automotive industry; Sweden; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Business; European Union; European Commission",Business
2024-08-30T01:47:41Z,Future-proof: why businesses are seeking sustainable skill sets,https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-mba-leading-the-way/article/2024/aug/30/future-proof-why-businesses-are-seeking-sustainable-skill-sets,"A growing number of progressive organisations are moving away from the traditional industrial model towards an approach that prioritises purpose as well as profits. Little wonder that leaders who have the knowledge and skills to help businesses make the transition are in such high demand. It’s no secret that, as a planet, we’re facing urgent social, environmental and economic challenges – cost of living, climate change, resource depletion and inequality among them. Prof Naomi Birdthistle, the MBA director at Griffith University, says it has become a necessity for organisations to have experts at the helm who can navigate these complexities and drive responsible solutions. “Sustainability leadership is crucial for organisational viability, reputation and positive impact on the planet and society,” Birdthistle says. “It includes economic, social and environmental dimensions, recognising that progress must benefit people, the planet and prosperity simultaneously.” Griffith has become the top choice for leaders (and the up-and-coming) who are working to create a more sustainable future within organisations or their own businesses. And, no, it isn’t just marketing spin. The Corporate Knights Better World MBA ranking has named Griffith’s MBA the world’s leading sustainable MBA for the past four years in a row. As well as covering all the bases of business strategy, each subject in Griffith’s MBA is built on progressive values that are vital for success in a sustainable, equitable economy. Why sustainable leadership is in high demand Griffith Unviersity MBA director, Naomi Birdthistle One of the reasons sustainability is such a growing focus for businesses is that customers, investors, employees and communities increasingly expect businesses to operate ethically, minimise their environmental impact and contribute positively to society. “Sustainability leaders align organisational goals with these stakeholder expectations,” Birdthistle says. To compound matters, governments worldwide are implementing stricter environmental regulations. Sustainability leaders ensure compliance with these and proactively address emerging requirements, implementing practices that drive innovation, cost savings and resilience. Griffith’s MBA is a clear standout for leaders looking to upskill and broaden their understanding of sustainability’s role in business and our global future. The world-renowned MBA program is based around the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). A values-led education The Griffith MBA, and indeed all Griffith programs, are created with a strong focus on values, and a commitment to reconciliation with First Peoples, environmental sustainability, diversity, inclusion and social justice. “We are attracting students who are looking for this focus on sustainability,” Birdthistle says. “It’s the future leaders who want to be ethical in their thinking and in their business practices, who want to think beyond profits, to people and the planet as well. “We are attracting that mindset and that thinking, and also we’re attracting participants who want to have an experience with an institution that actually does what it says it does on the tin. It’s important to them that their values are aligned.” Professor Ashlea Troth, deputy director of Griffith’s Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing Prof Ashlea Troth, the deputy director of Griffith’s Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing, points out that the Griffith MBA was the first course of its kind to underpin its courses with three core values (responsible leadership, sustainable business practices and an Asia-Pacific perspective) that are all intrinsically linked to the UN’s 17 SDGs. “The Griffith University MBA is truly values-led and the staff and MBA students genuinely embrace these values in their teaching, research and work lives,” she says. “We attract MBA students who embrace this ethos, want to make a difference and view themselves as part of the solution for the world’s environmental, social and economic challenges.” Training tomorrow’s leaders to put people first Organisations run by emotionally intelligent leaders are a step ahead when it comes to building healthy and productive workplace cultures. Troth says healthy workplaces have become less about lunchtime yoga classes and more about genuinely supporting employee wellbeing with comprehensive workplace mental health strategies, policies and practices – and that these should have a preventative focus. “While yoga classes or massages are a nice gesture and might reflect good intentions, they might actually be viewed as a tokenistic or Band-Aid gesture by the organisation to avoid addressing serious underlying issues such as a toxic or stressful work environment,” she says. People with higher emotional intelligence are not only more likely to emerge as leaders but are more likely to have employees that report higher job satisfaction and demonstrate higher job performance, says Troth, who teaches MBA students about leading for sustainable people outcomes. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and manage one’s own and others’ emotions. “Leaders not only need to regulate their own emotions using various strategies, they also must routinely help others to regulate or manage their emotions,” Troth says. “People often assume sustainability is all about environmental and financial sustainability, but in this course, the underlying premise is that sustainability should also focus on sustaining the workforce – so people don’t get burnt out and leave or underperform. In most cases, the workforce is an organisation’s biggest asset, so energy needs to be put into supporting them and creating inclusive and healthy workplaces.” Diverse perspectives Diversity and inclusion are issues that are evolving in the business context. Along with influencing hiring policies, a focus on inclusion ensures decision-making processes consider the perspectives of different genders, First Peoples, a variety of world opinions, and different stakeholders inside and outside an organisation. Birdthistle says: “Across the whole MBA, we have content that is aligned with Griffith’s values in understanding First Peoples’ ways of knowing, doing and being.” First Peoples academic staff and First Peoples MBA alumni have co-designed content and shared their experience and knowledge with students throughout the curriculum, which Birdthistle says adds a new dimension to the MBA and expands its focus. “So, yes, the MBA is about sustainability, but it’s also ingraining in the thinking of our future leaders an understanding of the First Peoples’ knowledge to solve our grand challenges that we are faced with.” Help shape a better future with the Griffith MBA.",,Griffith MBA: Leading the way
2024-09-01T11:00:04Z,‘This is about all girls’: how FC Copenhagen are building their women’s team,https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/sep/01/this-is-about-all-the-girls-how-fc-copenhagen-are-building-their-womens-team,"FC Copenhagen’s chief executive, Jacob Lauesen, is a little late to our morning interview but he has a good excuse, having been delayed travelling back from Gothenburg, where he watched Rosengård’s 1-0 defeat of Häcken in the Swedish women’s league. “It was just to get a glimpse of what that looks like,” Lauesen says of why the CEO of Denmark’s most successful men’s club made the trip to watch a Damallsvenskan match. Lauesen and Copenhagen’s head of women’s football, Rebecca Steele, have spent a lot of the past 18 months observing and conversing with clubs around the world as they prepared for July’s launch of their own women’s team. Copenhagen, having failed to have a side fast-tracked into a top league, went into discussions with the local women’s team FC Damsø, resulting in a club launching as FC Copenhagen on FC Damsø’s licence in the third tier. This type of merger is not new to the club, because Copenhagen are not a normal club. They were launched in 1992 by two financially struggling clubs, Kjøbenhavns Boldklub (continental Europe’s oldest club) and Boldklubben 1903, the former becoming the academy team and the main side operating on the licence of the latter. A new strategy was formulated three years ago and a move into women’s football was highlighted as a priority. On 18 August Copenhagen Women secured a 3-0 win over B73 Slagelse in their league opener in front of an impressive 5,165 fans. Why women’s football and why now, though? Put simply, they have had a space problem, with 5,000 players sharing six pitches, which has held them back. “We live in the densest area of Copenhagen,” Lauesen says. “That is one of the reasons why we haven’t moved faster [to launch a women’s team]. We started girls’ football seven years ago and are now at the age of under-14, moving up a year every year to implement it. So, in that sense, we decided to go and look for basically a different parent club.” Meanwhile, the makeup of spectators at their men’s games is changing. “Since Euro 2020, which took place in 2021, we have seen a very big increase in female spectators, going from 15% to 25%,” Lauesen says. “On the waiting list [for season tickets] the rise is greater because, of course, season tickets are sold out. So if you look at the waiting list, even for the ultras stands, it’s close to 50-50 girls and boys.” Accommodating the rise of female fans in men’s grounds “could take a generation”, he adds. Critical to the launch of their women’s team is having a business- and commercial-focused approach. “We’re a very young club. Even though one of our parent clubs is close to 150 years old, we are only 32 years old. Playing in the round of 16 of the Champions League, our fans have an understanding that we have reached that level not from a rich history but from being decent businesspeople. We’re not owned by Danish rich people, but we have earned our own money, we have built a sustainable business model. And the fans see that as a core value. “We don’t even compare our media rights to the media rights in the UK. But even if we compare to the media rights in Holland, Belgium, Scotland, Portugal, they are getting two or three times the amount we are getting, but we expect to play at the level of teams such as Celtic and PSV. So we need to be able to utilise our business model faster than other clubs. That’s not why we’re doing a women’s team, but that’s how we’re going to do a women’s team.” It means Copenhagen are asking their main partners whether they can make a separate commitment to women’s football. At the same time, they do not necessarily want to stick the women’s team in the same kit and provide the same merchandise – these things must fit the profile of the players and supporters. “A club can’t create a women’s shirt that is the same as the men’s shirt, with a tyre company on the chest, for example, and expect a young teenage girl to run around in this shirt the next day,” Lauesen says. “From a brand perspective, that is naive.” That strategy has worked wonders: about two weeks after the launch of their shirt for the women’s side, during Copenhagen fashion week, they had “sold more than the bottom team in the top-tier men’s league”. Commercially they have a blank slate, but taking on a side and elevating them up the leagues isn’t easy. Some players are training with Copenhagen’s boys’ teams to help the development pipeline in the absence of an academy. “We want to give them the best football education we can and hopefully they can develop with the project so, in five years maybe, then we will have homegrown players that we have given the best football education,” Steele says. That is helping their boys too. “If you are a talented boy then within the academy you go to school with the boys, you have male teachers, you have male trainers, everything you see from the age of around 12 is boys and men. At FC Copenhagen, we want to create the whole person and I very strongly believe that also means that these boys need to be around female players and trainers.” The women’s team are an equal mix of new players and Damsø players, but the buy-in from the latter wasn’t hard to get. “There is of course some nervous activity around what will happen to the club,” Steele says. “Will we just come in and ruin everything? We had a lot of chats about how we can do this in the right way. At the very first meeting I had with the players they were of course all very nervous for themselves, for the team that’s been built over a number of years, but one player stood up and said: ‘We have to realise this is not about us, this is about all the girls around Copenhagen and this is the future of football and this has a bigger potential than just us.’ “I think that was, for me, very, very well said and it’s also what I’ve experienced within the club in general since coming in: that they know the potential with this team is so much bigger than just what is happening on pitch.”",Women's football; FC Copenhagen; European club football; Football; Sport,Football
2024-03-28T16:17:55Z,Independent to take control of BuzzFeed and HuffPost in UK and Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/28/independent-to-take-control-of-buzzfeed-and-huffpost-in-uk-and-ireland,"The Independent will take control of BuzzFeed and HuffPost in the UK and Ireland with the intention to create “Britain’s biggest publisher network for gen Z and millennial audiences”, the publishers have said. The two media companies will combine their publishing, data and advertising platforms “to allow commercial partners to seamlessly buy across their sites”. As part of a multiyear licensing deal the Independent will take over HuffPost UK as well as BuzzFeed’s sub-brands in the UK including Tasty UK and the black British identity brand Seasoned. The move marks a new era in the youth media field, which BuzzFeed looked set to dominate after its launch in 2006. Once looked on with envy by legacy publishers who coveted its reach with younger audiences, its star has faded after huge losses at its parent company. The drop in BuzzFeed’s share value – which fell 95% from when the company went public at $10 (£8) a share in December 2021, according to a CNBC report last year – has been precipitous for an organisation that won awards for its news coverage and was seen as a new media model. In March 2021, HuffPost shut down its national news operation, retaining only the politics team. Then, in April last year, BuzzFeed closed what remained of its news department, with the founder, Jonah Peretti, telling staff that “the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News” and suggesting there might not be a sustainable business model for high-quality online news. It will now come under the control of the Independent, which was launched in 1986 and is part-owned by a bank controlled by the Saudi state. The Independent went online-only in 2016 and has been profitable since, reporting an operating profit of £1.9m in the year to 30 September 2022. However, all online news publishers are facing a torrid financial time as social networks such as Facebook are no longer delivering as many readers, while advertisers are cutting spending. In January, the Independent experienced the biggest monthly audience drop of 12%, down to 19.2 million, according to Press Gazette’s monthly audience rankings. Christian Broughton, the Independent’s chief executive and former editor-in-chief, said the partnership with BuzzFeed “represents a new leap forward” for its business. “Combining these world-renowned brands, each celebrated in its own right for industry-leading digital innovation, is designed to create unprecedented opportunities for these titles and all the commercial partners we work with,” he said. “By pooling the talent, tech and data, and creating Britain’s biggest publisher network for gen Z and millennial audiences, we seek to unlock investment in new editorial products and services that will ultimately benefit the readers of all the titles.” Making their pitch to the dwindling news advertising market the companies said that “commerce, events, audio, content syndication and licensing opportunities will be supported by significant high-yield targeted data segments as publishers and marketers move to first-party data and away from reliance on third-party cookies”. Richard Alan Reid, the Buzzfeed executive vice-president for global content, said: “[The Independent’s] ambition in the digital space is hugely exciting, and we believe makes them the perfect partner to deepen the connection with our young, diverse audience. The synergies between our companies have been clear from day one.”",The Independent; Digital media; Newspapers; Media; Newspapers & magazines; UK news; BuzzFeed; HuffPost; Internet; Advertising; Ireland; Mergers and acquisitions; Technology; National newspapers; Europe; Business,Media
2024-10-04T14:00:05Z,‘VCs need their money back’: why sustainable startups struggle to fix our broken food system,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/sustainable-food-brands,"When Andrew Carter and Adam DeMartino started their business Smallhold in 2017, they set out with a simple vision they thought could have a big impact: feed people mushrooms. “Mushrooms are one of the most sustainable calories on the planet, in every aspect,” Carter said, whether you’re looking at water, waste, plastic use or greenhouse gas emissions. “We just wanted to get more people eating them.” For the better part of seven years, Smallhold successfully did just that, getting specialty mushrooms such as shiitake, blue oyster and trumpets into grocery stores and on to Americans’ plates. And they built a cult favorite brand while doing so – a feat made notable by how much harder it is to accomplish with produce than, say, processed snack foods. (Think about how differently you shop for chips or ice-cream, on the lookout for a specific brand you like, versus peaches or tomatoes, the brand of which you may not even notice.) As mushrooms became emblematic of a new vision of sustainability at the start of the pandemic lockdowns, achieving zeitgeist-y star status, Smallhold found itself both riding that wave and helping propel it, earning a range of buzzy media coverage and being valued at $90m at its peak. Just six years after starting in a shipping container in Brooklyn, the brand had built out farms in New York, Texas and California, and had begun selling in 1,400 stores across the country, including Whole Foods. “We gave others hope that a sustainable business could rise quickly, become popular, and change an entire category for the better,” said DeMartino. Smallhold was just one of a host of food startups that have cropped up with the promise that they’re growing food more sustainably or reducing waste. So it came as a disappointing shock to many when the founders both stepped down this spring and Smallhold announced that it was filing for bankruptcy shortly thereafter. Though the company was taken over by investors who restructured and brought the company out of bankruptcy at the end of August, Smallhold emerged as a “shadow” of the company DeMartino once envisioned; it shut down its farms and laid off much of its staff without severance, to the dismay of the founders and customers who had come to associate the brand with the ethical treatment of its employees and farmers as well as the earth. (The brand’s current leadership declined to comment for this article.) What does the brand’s trajectory mean for the prospects of using entrepreneurship to right traditional agriculture’s wrongs? In the example of Smallhold and other produce-focused startups like it, there are lessons to be learned about what role business can – and can’t – play in fixing our food system. Do: find a niche, and sell more than sustainability Elly Truesdell was working at Whole Foods as a “forager” who helped the grocery chain identify new local suppliers when Smallhold started out, and she remembers being impressed at their unique offering. Where most shoppers had only encountered the most common varieties of button mushrooms, Smallhold was introducing varieties with more interesting and varied flavor profiles, such as lion’s mane and blue oyster. “I traveled the country and visited a ton of local food stores and other grocers and very, very rarely could you see specialty mushrooms of the varieties that they were growing in grocery stores,” she said. That’s some of what convinced her, once she left Whole Foods to get into venture capital with a focus on food businesses, to invest in Smallhold. For a world increasingly thinking about both personal and planetary health, mushrooms hold great appeal as an easy and nutritious meat alternative. And Smallhold was paying farmers a living wage to grow them on waste material, using minimal water and electricity, composting the leftover materials after, and selling their product in compostable retail packaging (an industry first). But startups that gain a foothold in the produce aisle have to offer customers more than that to succeed, Truesdell said. “You cannot hang your hat on sustainability only. Product quality, cost – all of the things that matter in a typical food business still matter.” In some ways, Smallhold excelled at that: in addition to the unique flavor and high quality of its produce, it also built a strong brand through a combination of the charming aesthetics of the mushrooms themselves, a witty social media presence and the relationships its founders built with tastemakers who helped cement Smallhold as part of the zeitgeist. Smallhold isn’t the only produce company that has benefited from creating a unique visual identity. Bowery Farming, an indoor agriculture company that sells greens and berries, and Gotham Greens, which sells salad greens, dressings and herbs, are two others that have invested in top-notch design and branding. While all three companies have claimed to be growing food more sustainably than peer companies in their categories, their unique approach to branding produce is part of what lures in new customers, Truesdell noted. Don’t: take on too much money Entrepreneurs who want their business to be sustainable by environmental standards have to also be sustainable in the financial sense of the word. Though what Smallhold set out to do was sell mushrooms that would help people “reconnect with their food, environment, and farmers”, the technology it was using to do so was often what excited funders. “Over time, we were really leading with that,” said DeMartino. “The pitch got crafted around technology further and further.” He often felt that they were adding tech that was cool, but overcomplicated things: “You don’t need to press a button to open a window. You can just open the window,” he said. Plus, creating and maintaining the technology infrastructure was expensive, which made building new farms costly. That in turn made becoming profitable more difficult to do – and when venture capitalists are looking for a return on their investment quickly, a slow path to profitability can be a death knell. “VCs need their money back,” said Ari Greensburg, professor of entrepreneurship and management at NYU Stern. “They need you to get there by five, six years, seven maximum ... If you can’t do that, they abandon you.” That is, in some sense, what happened to Smallhold: after years of ample VC funding, investors decided they weren’t making enough progress toward profitability, stopped cutting them checks, and the company was left without adequate cashflow. Smallhold wasn’t the only buzzy produce company to go bankrupt under these circumstances. AeroFarms and AppHarvest, two other indoor farming companies that had attracted big venture capital investments in the past, also declared bankruptcy last year when the VC landscape began to shift away from its former optimism about tech-based food startups. Lessons for other entrepreneurs It’s easy to tell an entrepreneur that it’s dangerous to take on VC funding, but often harder to offer viable alternatives for startups that need cash. But those options do exist, insisted Truesdell, especially for agriculture companies. She pointed to Ark Foods, a produce startup founded in 2013 that helped create the US market for shishito peppers, as an example. Though the company has taken on some modest equity investments from funds including Truesdell’s, those haven’t made up the bulk of the company’s funding. “They rely a ton on farm credit and on loans from the Farm Bureau, rather than on venture dollars,” she said. “They’re almost always hovering at break-even or slightly profitable, so that they’re not in this difficult situation that companies like Smallhold found themselves in.” She named the family-owned salad and greens business Taylor Farms, which has opted to grow slowly over time rather than taking on big investments in the hopes of scaling up quickly, as another example of how to do things differently. There’s no one-size-fits-all way to build or run a produce startup to ensure that it’ll be around in the long run, and the most effective strategy for changing the food system for the better won’t rely on entrepreneurship alone, but will incorporate policy change and regulation, too. But there are a few lessons worth trying to take away from the successes and failures of the startups that have tried to do so in the last few years: build a strong brand, even in a category like produce that hasn’t historically been known for branding. Offer sustainability, but pair that with other values, such as new flavors or higher quality to lure in customers. And take financial responsibility just as seriously as planetary and social responsibility. “No matter how much you love it, this business runs on money, not on love,” DeMartino said. “We needed to make really key decisions around that in order to sustain the vision of a circular economy business.” Lastly, learn to define success on your own terms. Despite its eventual bankruptcy, Smallhold did help carve out a market across the nation for specialty mushrooms – and getting more people hooked on what could be the “most sustainable calories on the planet” is a legacy the company’s founders think is worth celebrating.",Agriculture; Fungi; Food; Climate crisis; Technology; Farming; Brooklyn; US news,Environment
2024-03-14T08:04:40Z,John Lewis bounces back to profit but no bonus for workers again,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/14/john-lewis-bounces-back-to-profit-but-no-bonus-for-workers-again,"The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has returned to annual profit but will not pay its workers a bonus for the second year in a row. The John Lewis Partnership (JLP) said it made a £56m pre-tax profit in the year to 27 January, compared with a £234m loss in the previous year. The staff-owned retailer, which employs about 74,000 people – known as “partners” – said that after careful consideration it would not pay its staff an annual bonus for the third time in four years. It said that instead, “at this point in our transformation”, a sustainable business was best served by investing in its retail businesses and the base pay. of its staff. JLP plans to open its first new Waitrose stores in a decade and refurbish 80 more supermarkets while investing in technology to improve the John Lewis website and customer service for shoppers in stores. The company said it was “entering a year of significant investment”, with £542m planned to be spent – up 70% on a year before, adding that it was “on track” to hit its target of making £400m in profit by 2028. The £542m is in addition to £116m being spent on increasing pay to a minimum of £11.55 an hour – although that remains behind key players including Sainsbury’s and Marks &amp; Spencer. Part of the investment will also go towards “simplifying the way we work”, said JLP, suggesting job cuts may be on the cards this year. The group is thought to be considering cutting up to 11,000 jobs over the next five years. Sharon White, the JLP chair, said there was no target for job reduction but that action to make the business simpler and more flexible meant there would be “less need for some roles over the coming years”. She added: “We have made significant progress in the last year to return the business to profitability and delivered results that allow us to increase investment in our retail businesses; we expect profits to grow further this year. “This shows our plan is working, while we know there’s much more to do … This year we will unashamedly focus on investing back into our retail businesses for our customers.” White said a target of making 40% of JLP profits from non-retail business by 2030 had been ditched because of changes to the economic climate. “That target was set in 2020 when inflation was 2% and interest rates zero. We all know the world of the last few years,” she said. Last year, John Lewis ploughed 10% of its overall investment into non-retail including financial services and building homes to rent. It plans to invest 5% this year, with White arguing a “complimentary family of businesses are important to the partnership’s long term profitability”. She said the return to profit came after making £88m of savings, mainly by better matching staff hours to need in Waitrose stores and also by cutting energy use as well as more automation at John Lewis’s distribution network. That helped offset an £112m increase in costs caused by inflation, particularly in relation to pay and energy bills. The company said its plans for the next four years would be self-funded through cashflow. Rumoured plans for the sale of a stake in the business have been ditched. Sales, excluding VAT, rose by 2% to £10.8bn. At Waitrose supermarkets, sales rose by 5% but the volume of items sold was down 1.5% as shoppers faced a cost of living crisis. However, sales at the John Lewis department stores fell by 4% to £4.8bn. The company said it had recorded weak sales in homeware and tech, while those in fashion, including beauty products, were up. Beauty sales were up by 4%. Strong fashion sellers included men’s tailoring (up 48%) and lingerie (up 8%). Peter Ruis, the new boss of the group’s department stores who will set out further details of his revamp plans later this year, said he was confident the chain would return to sales growth this year. James Bailey, the chief executive of Waitrose, said the business would be investing more in keeping prices down as well as improving the look of its stores including fresh food counters and in-store services.",John Lewis; Retail industry; Business; Waitrose; UK news; Sharon White,Business
2024-01-25T17:51:06Z,Royal Mail is failing to deliver any service at all | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/25/royal-mail-is-failing-to-deliver-any-service-at-all,"In the wake of this week’s announcement (Royal Mail could save £650m by moving to three-day-a-week service, says Ofcom, 24 January), maybe someone could send out a postie to knock on Vince Cable’s door for a comment or two. It was he who, as business secretary in the coalition government, oversaw the privatisation of Royal Mail, pledging that it would not threaten the universal service obligation to deliver to any home in the UK on six days a week. Indeed, Mr Cable went as far as claiming that securing that specified level of service provision was the “overarching objective” of privatisation – despite warnings to the contrary from unions, industry and other dissenting voices. But this somewhat inevitable outcome should come as no surprise. As we’ve seen with most privatisations in the UK, it’s never been about achieving a long-term sustainable business model, more responsive to the needs of the communities and ordinary people; it’s about making a quick buck and damn the consequences. The evidence abounds. Be it the privatised water companies, utilities, train companies or the Royal Mail – nobody delivers for the public any more. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh • Deliver three days a week? If only! Where we live, in north-west London, you’re lucky if you get mail delivered one day a week. And as for parcels, whistle for it. A once-edible birthday present that was sent on 9 January still hasn’t arrived. A book sent in November? Nix. A DVD sent two weeks ago? All I have is emails from eBay asking me to rate it. On one of my despairing visits to the local delivery office to pick up our mail (letters only – parcels vanish into a black hole), I asked why this is. The woman at the counter (open 8am-10am only) said that they used to have 15 posties, but eight were “let go”. If they’re going to run a poste restante service, why not say so and have done with it? At least then we’d know where we are. Ruth Brandon London • I’m not sure what Ofcom is basing its plans on. Here in Portsmouth we are already on a three-days-a-week (or fewer) delivery schedule. It is not probable that we could get as many first-class letters in one delivery, all with different posting dates, if Royal Mail weren’t storing up post until there was enough volume to put a postie on the route. My retired parents, in a more rural location in Norfolk, don’t get deliveries more than once a week. They’ve taken to driving over to the local office every couple of days and collecting their mail. Even then letters are being lost for weeks. Before Christmas, a “Tracked 48” parcel took six days to reach us. It was left in our recycling bin after we had already left for the holiday. It is fortunate that we have good neighbours who found it before the bins were emptied. David Hague Portsmouth • Any decent citizen should welcome the prime minister’s commitment to maintaining Royal Mail’s universal six-day delivery. However, constructive help is needed. The government should scrap the VAT on Royal Mail’s extra services such as the special delivery. A more sustainable service is good for small business customers, the lifeblood of our economy. Good communications and infrastructure such as the universal delivery are key. John Barstow Fittleworth, West Sussex • Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

2024-06-27T05:00:29Z,Ganni: what’s the secret of the covetable Danish label’s success?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/27/ganni-whats-the-secret-of-the-covetable-danish-labels-success,"It’s the middle of August 2023 and the Danish It-girl brand Ganni is throwing a party to celebrate the last night of Copenhagen fashion week. In a room hidden behind a heaving dancefloor, Paloma Elsesser, the curve New York model who opened Ganni’s show hours before, is dominating the karaoke room and creative director Ditte Reffstrup is dancing on the bar. It feels like a celebration from a different era. Independent designers are struggling. The news of Matches Fashion’s closure in March was followed by announcements that the Vampire’s Wife and Mara Hoffman would shut down. Roksanda had filed a notice of intent to appoint an administrator, a fate avoided only by the entrance of a buyer. All offer similarly playful garments and are, in many ways, despite higher prices, Ganni’s peers. But the Danish brand, which Reffstrup took over in 2009 alongside her husband, Nikolaj, has reason to be cheerful. The brand is stocked at more than 600 retailers globally and has 70 concept stores across Europe, North America and Asia. The Ganni Girls hashtag, a social media calling card for anyone wearing the brand, has been used more than 111,000 times on Instagram. Laura du Rusquec, the former deputy CEO of Balenciaga, was recently named CEO. In 2017, LVMH-backed investment firm L Catterton bought 51% of the business. Last year, Ganni launched a series of high-profile collaborations that included Barbour, New Balance and Dr Martens and in May this year a line in collaboration with Elsesser. If you haven’t heard of Ganni, you have probably seen it. For several years it has been the choice brand of a certain well-heeled young professional, offering easy-to-wear, feminine garments that can be worn at the office and for the bike ride in, or to dinner out afterwards. They represent the sartorial side of the Scandimania that took over our lives in recent years, from TV to baked goods and furniture. True to Scandi-form, Ganni is big on sustainability, too. It has set the ambitious goal of halving its emissions by 2027 and, according to its latest responsibility report (the brand eschews the word “sustainability” due to overuse) in 2023, Ganni’s carbon emissions were 7% lower than a 2021 baseline – despite revenue growing by an average of 18%. It is an impressive achievement that timed perfectly with the publication of The Ganni Playbook: How to Get Started Creating a Responsible Business, a sort of sustainable business manifesto out now. Almost 10 months have passed since the party, and I am back in Copenhagen, sitting in the Reffstrups’ eclectic, airy home – the living room is all bright colours and natural textures – to talk about the book and the formula that keeps Ganni, and the look it epitomises, thriving against the odds. The couple themselves are a good place to start. They met on a dance floor 20 years ago and were married in seven months. “She was always wearing a mix of vintage so she would kind of look like the lead singer from Bananarama one day and something else the next,” says Nicolaj, some helium balloons – probably from one of their three children’s parties – bobbing against the ceiling behind him. Today Ditte is wearing an oversized silver blazer, a white T-shirt, against which a turquoise pendant hangs, and a black pointelle skirt. A few years after they met, Ditte – an experienced fashion buyer – was approached to design some cashmere garments for a friend’s small fashion label called Ganni. Nicolaj was working in tech start-ups and understood how to scale a brand. Together, they identified a customer who was not being served by the minimalist, normcore Scandi designers that were popular in 2009 and decided to take over the business.The customer they identified as underserved was essentially Ditte – the original so-called Ganni Girl. She has proven to be the business’s silver bullet, embodying something aspirational that appeals to women of many ages, nationalities and body types, as well as having a keen understanding of what women want from clothes. While the term Ganni Girl may sound like cloying marketing jargon, it came about shockingly, almost irritatingly organically. In 2015, the model Helena Christensen came to lunch with a friend, the actor Kate Bosworth. Both wore the same Ganni jacket. They snapped a selfie, wrote #GanniGirls in the caption and a clique was born. “[The Ganni Girl may] not be the most obviously beautiful girl in the room or wearing the most trendy clothes,” says Ditte. “But she’ll just have this certain aura around her – an energy and the confidence that comes when you dress for yourself and no one else.” The term has inspired a coffee table book and the trope has even made it into literature. In his Sunday Times bestseller, Trivial Pursuits, the writer Raven Smith describes a drunk party trick so misguided it resulted in “much spilled prosecco and many a drenched Ganni dress.” The line is a gripe – the Ganni girl can be seen as a bit, in modern parlance, “basic”. But it shows how far she has come.Ganni has been shrewd, capitalising on the immediacy and community social media offers by focusing on local influencers that have a more engaged following over celebrities with bigger audiences. Although the hashtag was a happy accident, building a community around it was strategic. For all its local roots, Nicolaj knew the brand would not survive if it did not work for customers outside Denmark. Ganni’s outlook has always been purposefully global. They have kept prices accessible, believing it would help the brand to endure. “It has always been a joy to create something that people actually use,” says Ditte. “Like having a restaurant that people actually enjoy eating in, or making music that people are actually listening to.” The only time Ganni’s pursuit of the best product is forsaken is when it comes into conflict with achieving their carbon goals. If the book has one recurring theme it is how to make money without maximising it at the expense of the planet. This will be interesting to watch play out over the next few years – to halve their emissions they will have to focus on materials, which are responsible for 58% of Ganni’s total carbon footprint. Ditte is honest about her design perspective on sustainability: initially she only saw limitations. But Ganni has become a champion of, and investor into, next-generation materials and one of their biggest achievements was phasing out virgin leather at the end of 2023, which accounted for a third of the brand’s carbon footprint. Doing so meant discontinuing two colour ways of their best-selling cowboy boots at a cost to the company of £300,000 a year. Nicolaj is upfront about how expensive it is to be a responsible business. There’s a “direct investment that’s invisible … in the certifications, the consultants, the premium fabrics,” he says. But what hurts more is “the sacrifices, the frustrations, like the letting go of bestsellers and saying no to collaborations.”Of course for all of the worthy talk, like all fashion brands, the business is far from faultless – synthetic materials, which are blended through most of Ganni’s garments, shed microfibres into the ocean, will never biodegrade and currently, are not able to be recycled. Nicolaj returns to a tech tagline again and again: he’d rather build knowledge through trying and failing, being clear on the vision and loose on the details, rather than not trying at all. If nothing else, Nicolaj promises: “Ganni is honest, not perfect.” The Ganni Playbook: How to Get Started Creating a Responsible Business by Nikolaj Reffstrup with Brooke Roberts-Islam, is published on 27 June by Penguin.",Fashion; Sustainable fashion; Life and style; Business; Denmark; Europe,Fashion
2024-02-15T19:44:12Z,Independent in talks to take over BuzzFeed and HuffPost in UK and Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/15/independent-in-talks-to-take-over-buzzfeed-and-huffpost-in-uk-and-ireland,"The Independent is in talks to take control of BuzzFeed and HuffPost in the UK and Ireland, as part of a “strategic partnership” that aims to boost the fortunes of two strikingly different players in the UK media landscape. BuzzFeed UK was once looked upon with envy by legacy publishers who coveted its reach with younger audiences, but its star has faded after huge losses at its parent company. Free online news publishers are facing a torrid financial time as social networks such as Facebook are no longer sending as many readers, while advertisers are cutting spending. It could now come under the editorial and commercial control of the Independent, which was launched in 1986 and is part-owned by a bank controlled by the Saudi state. In a move of symbolic significance that reflects the shifting sands of the UK media, BuzzFeed’s UK brands HuffPost, Seasoned and Tasty will be included in the deal, but US brands Celeb, Tech, Admin and HuffPost US will not. Announcing the news on Thursday, the BuzzFeed founder and CEO, Jonah Peretti, told UK staff of his “excitement” about “the partnership we are exploring with the Independent”, which he said put the organisation “in a strong position to join forces with a local partner who can expand resources on the ground, unlock more strategic value for the brands, and take our UK business to the next level”. In an email to all staff, Peretti said that under the proposed partnership, the Independent would offer “increased resources across editorial and sales, and offer a wide mix of products across their portfolio”. He added: “Since 1986, the Independent has been a news organisation at the frontline of journalism – and together with BuzzFeed’s UK brands, the two portfolios would create one of the region’s largest combined audiences.” Sources at the Independent said the move would offer growth and stability to the publication, which like the rest of the British media has been facing strong financial headwinds, steep drops in advertising revenues and fierce competition for readers’ attention. Last month the Independent experienced the biggest month-on-month audience drop of 12%, down to 19.2 million, according to Press Gazette’s monthly audience rankings. “It’s an opportunity for us to extend our reach and find a different generation, to keep growing and be a global player,” said the source. “A different generation and different margins is a pretty attractive offering.” They said that readers of the Independent should not expect to see a proliferation of listicles and other highly shareable content as popularised and mastered by BuzzFeed, as the publications would remain entirely separate. UK-based BuzzFeed staff would be transferred to the Independent’s London offices, the Financial Times reported. Alex DeGroote, a media analyst, said it was unclear if any money was changing hands in the proposed deal, which was likely to be a “needs must” partnership for both publishers. “The digital media and advertising market is pretty dire for all publishers in 2024, so a merger is a logical response,” he said. “This will give Independent more scale, eyeballs and resources.” While recent online audience trends for the Independent have been challenging, BuzzFeed has had its stock fall 95% since the company went public at $10 (£8) a share in December 2021, CNBC reported. “This move may allow BuzzFeed [to] cut off UK losses and focus purely on US operations, thus improving overall financial performance,” said DeGroote. “The market may speculate that this is [the] first step towards full-scale combination of Independent and BuzzFeed.” The drop in BuzzFeed’s share value has been precipitous for an organisation that won awards for its news coverage and was seen as a shining example of a new media model that could attract a younger audience. Despite vast sums ploughed into the organisation by investors, it has struggled to become financially secure. In March 2021, HuffPost shut down its national news operation, retaining only the politics team. Then, in April last year BuzzFeed closed what remained of its news department, with Peretti telling staff that “the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News” and suggesting there may not be a sustainable business model for high-quality online news. The Independent appointed the former Daily Mail editor Geordie Greig as editor-in-chief at the start of last year, as the news outlet was facing tough financial challenges and dealing with a round of redundancies.",BuzzFeed; HuffPost; Independent News & Media; Jonah Peretti; Media; London; UK news; Internet; Newspapers & magazines; Digital media; Ireland; World news,Media
2024-08-29T13:00:33Z,How many Black farmers are there in the US? Why we doubt the government stats | Nathan A Rosenberg and Bryce Wilson Stucki,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/29/black-farmers-us-census,"Earlier this summer, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) released data that suggested that, after years of decline, the number of Black farmers has grown to more than 45,000. This is in stark contrast to the dire situation of Black producers in the 1990s, when a New York Times article predicted their coming extinction; Black farm numbers had fallen below 20,000 in that decade. Yet we now seem to see a renaissance, something the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, took credit for at the end of his first term as secretary of agriculture. In a 2016 essay, Vilsack wrote that the department was “forming new partnerships in diverse communities and regaining trust where it was once lost. This is most evident in the rising number of Hispanic and African American farmers.” It’s a narrative that undeniably flatters the USDA, which stands to gain from public perception that there are far more Black farmers than there really are. After all, the department is the main culprit behind the huge land loss suffered by Black farmers in the 20th century, when African Americans lost almost 90% of their acreage, worth more than $326bn today. And the department’s atrocious record of discrimination is by no means in the past. An award-winning 2021 Mother Jones investigation found that USDA agents still generated hundreds of discrimination complaints each year. The agency’s civil rights office, meanwhile, functioned as a “closing machine”, finding ways to dismiss or resolve complaints without real investigation or a favorable disposition for the complainant. As one employee told us: “Doing right is a lonely, lonely, lonely business” in the civil rights office. Despite the department’s continued dysfunction, the latest agricultural census, which counts farmers around the nation every five years, would have you believe that there has been a surge in the number of Black growers since the 1990s. A closer look at the data and interviews with Black farmers and other experts, however, show that the reality is quite different. As Jillian Hishaw, a well-respected Charlotte-based agricultural lawyer, tells us, the census counts are “overly inflated”. Hishaw’s more than two decades of fighting land loss have given her extensive first-hand knowledge of the current state of Black farming. She is not alone in her assessment; older Black farmers widely believe that the census overcounts. In 20 years of combined experience speaking with African American farmers and analyzing census data, we have come to the same conclusion. In a lengthy 2019 investigation for the Counter, we demonstrated that changes to the census methodology explained recent increases in census counts. To understand the problems with USDA’s counts, it’s important to understand the nuances of the agriculture census. It is the most comprehensive single source of farm data in the country. Unlike the decennial national census, which publishes a straightforward population count, the farm census uses statistical methods to estimate numbers of farmers. In fact, about 60% of the count of farms with Black producers came from adjustments in 2022, the most recent agricultural census year. Since USDA took over the farm census from the US Census Bureau (which administers the national count), the agency has made many changes to the survey. Many of these alterations were long overdue and made the census more accurate, such as adjustments to account for farmers who should have been included in the original survey but weren’t or better outreach to Black farmers and their organizations. However, while making the census more accurate, these changes also made newer counts impossible to compare with older counts, at least without certain caveats. One consequence was that the more accurate counts created a “false trend” in Black farmers, as a 2002 paper put it; the number of Black farmers appeared to increase, when in reality, they were just being counted more accurately. But the problems with the USDA’s census go deeper than the “false trend”. The census lumps together non-farm rural properties, non-commercial hobby or retirement operations, very low-income farms, and those that bring in significant incomes into a single, incoherent count. The clearest indicator of this problem is the significant rise in “farms” with no sales. The department has stretched its definition of a farm from any operation that produced or normally would produce $1,000 of agricultural goods to include operations with the potential to produce $1,000 in goods, whether the operation produces anything or the owner intends to use it that way. Properties with a few rows of berry bushes, five acres of pasture for horses or an acre of land for cattle all count as farms. Farms with zero sales went from 100,000 in 1992, before the USDA assumed control of the census, to 400,000 in 2017 – making up a fifth of the total. Almost 30% of African American farmers had zero sales that year, meaning they were almost certainly non-farmer rural property owners. Lloyd Wright, a former director of civil rights at the USDA and a Virginia farmer, points out that in addition to zero-sales farms in the 2022 agricultural census, 57% of farms with African American producers bring in only marginally more than the minimum: less than $5,000 in sales. That’s simply not a sustainable business. In fact, most of these operations are probably taking a loss. Virtually all farm sales – about 95% – come from operations with more than $100,000 in sales; only 2,500 Black farmers reach that threshold. This is probably close to the minimum of sales needed to make a living from the farm: after expenses, farms with $100,000 to $250,000 in sales averaged $39,000 in net income in 2022. In any case, that means many Black farms are barely surviving and are vulnerable to closure. Wright has long been troubled by census overcounts. In a 2019 interview, Wright said that in his work with Black farmer groups and 1890 land grant institutions (historically Black schools founded as agricultural training centers) across the country, he found that “none of them agree with what is being displayed in the census. That doesn’t meet their experience in the field.” He underscored this point with his own counts of Black farmers in Virginia’s Northern Neck region, where he farms. In response to a request for this article, Wright reported 16 African American farmers as against the USDA’s 64 – a whopping 75% difference. Michael Stovall, a fourth-generation farmer who is from and lives in north-western Alabama, also says the census count is far too high in his area. “A lot of the people that used to have small farms, they’re not here any longer. I’m riding everywhere – every county in this area, I’m normally riding around – and you don’t see anybody any more.” He continued, “In the whole area, north Alabama – it’d surprise me if it was 150.” For the eight counties Stovall referenced, the census reports 332 farmers. Referring to the latest count of Black farmers, Bernice Atchison said: “No way. No way. There’s nothing like 45,000 farmers at this particular time … Because of circumstances that have occurred down through the years of many being foreclosed on, many have died. The pandemic took out quite a few.” Atchison, of Chilton county, Alabama, has been part of the struggle for justice for Black farmers for more than 40 years and assisted many other farmers with their discrimination cases. She also works with numerous organizations that advocate for Black farmers, such as Friends of the African Union, a civil society organization. Based on this experience, Atchison estimates “we’d be doing good if we were to have 18,000 [Black farmers] at this point,” she said. Thomas Burrell, leader of the Memphis-based Black Farmers &amp; Agriculturalists Association, told us several years ago: “We believe, based on our research and representation, there are less than 5,000 farmers.” These advocates are united in their belief that the agricultural census, in its current iteration, grossly overstates the number of Black farmers in the country. But just how much it overstates them or – more precisely, how few Black farmers there actually are – is unclear, with their anecdotal estimates varying from the low thousands to Atchinson’s higher figures. More research, by organizations independent of the USDA, is needed to understand the true state of Black farming today. When asked for comment, a USDA spokesperson sent a statement that referred to the 2022 census’s “rigorous methodology” and “extensive quality controls” as well as agency efforts to improve counts of minority producers and to conduct outreach to all producers, including those from “underserved communities”. The response did not explicitly address our questions about the discrepancies between census counts and what Black farmers report, the effect of zero-sales farms on census counts or related issues. As the prime culprit in the dispossession of Black farmers, the USDA benefits from the perception that the number of African American farmers is increasing or is higher than it really is. If the public were aware that, instead of 45,000, there are only 5,000 African American farmers with real access to the farm economy and viable businesses, then the threatened extinction of the Black farmer would seem less like an averted danger and more like a nearly accomplished fact. It was bad enough for the USDA to engage in widespread discrimination against Black farmers and drive almost all of them from the industry. Now the agency claims there’s a renaissance, using numbers Black farmers do not trust to do so. That’s the sign of an entity that is simply not capable of facing the reality it created and therefore not capable of rectifying it.",Black farmers; Agriculture; Race; Farming; US news,Environment
2024-03-12T11:24:09Z,Mercury/13: the group aiming to ‘rethink football ownership’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/12/mercury13-the-group-aiming-to-rethink-football-ownership-moving-the-goalposts,"On a March morning on the shores of Lake Como, a piece of history was made. Mercury/13, a new ownership consortium that focuses purely on women’s football, acquired its first club – FC Como Women, from Serie A Femminile. Mercury/13, founded by Victoire Cogevina Reynal, has pledged $100m (£85.5m) to building up a portfolio of teams across the globe, a “pure play” investor that unlocks clubs’ commercial potential. Reynal and her co-CEO, Mario Malavé, have brought notable figures on board, including the former England international Eni Aluko and Women in Football’s Ebru Koksal. “The aim that we’ve had since day one was to rethink football ownership,” Cogevina Reynal tells Moving the Goalposts. “Women’s football gives this opportunity to build a business from the ground up, having had a predecessor in the men’s game that has been very successful but which has also done some things not in the right way. How can we learn and improve the model? Outside of being investors and operators, it is really about building a sustainable business model so they can become truly independent.” Como was a perfect fit for its inaugural investment. “Como came to the top of the list very fast for several reasons,” Cogevina Reynal says. “The location is the more obvious one. Our entire thesis is ensuring that we can commercialise clubs ... and having a great location certainly helps. “Once we started digging into the reality of the club and understanding the way it’s structured, we came across a fantastic owner. Stefano Verga [Como’s president, who will continue in his role and remain a shareholder] is incredibly passionate about the team. He took over five years ago, got them promoted several times, and now they’re playing at the top of Italian football with a fraction of the budget of their competitors. They do it all with a lot of pride and care.” It is clear the potential Cogevina Reynal sees and the importance she places on the sport being able to plough its own course. Recent valuations of National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) clubs – Sportico valued Angel City, backed by celebrity investors including Serena Williams, Christina Aguilera, Eva Longoria and Billie Jean King, at an eye-catching $180m, for example –show how they can thrive. It should be noted, however, that the culture of women’s football in the USA is different from that in Europe, where most teams operate under the umbrella of men’s organisations. Mercury/13 places a lot of emphasis on the sport’s commercial potential. “It’s really exciting because you get to speak to brands that never really even saw football as a thing to do,” Cogevina Reyna says. “We’re speaking to beauty and fashion brands, pharmaceutical, baby products, and fertility clinics. There are so many that have women at the core of their strategy. We show them a new world and we show them what it can look like.” Women’s teams have been burned in the past, promised much only to see it taken away when waters get choppy. Cogevina Reynal is insistent that Mercury/13 is in it for the long term. “In Europe we get the interest of big players that will want to come and play for us because they’re excited about the fact that we’re thinking 10 years ahead, and that we’re really trying to understand the best way to build this club,” she says. “That will trickle into many different ways, whether that’s their playing experience, whether that’s the additional services that we can provide, but also post-career. “All these things are happening because the only thing that we do from day to night is think about women’s football. That’s the reality that big men’s clubs don’t have today. It’s not personal. It’s just a business decision where you need to focus on something else.” The road has not always been smooth in Mercury/13’s fledging journey. The group was engaged in discussions to take over Lewes but ended up pulling out, something Cogevina Reynal considers “a very normal thing for a fund to do”. Despite the setback, entering the UK market remains a goal and the group hopes to invest “before the end of this year”. For now, however, Como is Mercury/13’s focus, with the team already on the ground. “I really believe that the world will fall in love with this club the way that we have,” Cogevina Reynal says. “It is this kind of utopia in the world, especially in a country like Italy where women are not where they deserve to be. “Obviously, [we want] a better performance on the pitch but most importantly for it to become this true example of commercial success. We’re all waiting for that example. Angel City was a great one in the US, but we’re missing one in Europe. Hopefully, that’s going to be Como.” Get in touch If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com.

2024-02-22T15:21:34Z,Sunderland’s managerial churn will continue until their owner sees the light | Louise Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/22/owner-needs-to-see-the-light-over-experience-required-at-sunderland-championship,"When the lights went out, quite literally, on Michael Beale in late January it seemed a metaphor for his impending divorce from Sunderland. Beale was only minutes into a press conference at the Academy of Light, the Championship club’s training base, when a power cut plunged the complex into darkness. As the manager began talking after guiding reporters to a daylight-flooded atrium, the sense grew that it could well be a matter of time before the board pulled the plug on Tony Mowbray’s successor. Sure enough, on Monday, Kyril Louis-Dreyfus, Sunderland’s 27-year-old majority owner, sacked Beale two months, 12 games and four wins into his two-and-a-half-year contract. Mike Dodds will be in caretaker charge for the remainder of the season, starting with Saturday’s home game against Swansea, where he will aim to start closing the seven-point gap separating 10th-placed Sunderland from the playoff places. The 37-year-old coach is much admired at the Stadium of Light, where he has forged close bonds with first-team players, most notably the key attacking midfielder Jobe Bellingham. During a previous stint as caretaker manager after Mowbray’s dismissal he presided over wins against West Brom and Leeds, surprising the latter by switching to a back three. With hindsight, perhaps Louis-Dreyfus would have been better sticking with Dodds in December. Instead Beale was hired and swiftly floundered, a particular nadir reached in a home defeat by Hull on the weekend preceding that press conference punctuated by the power cut. The Londoner was clearly feeling the strain involved in replacing the much loved, and judged by most reasonable metrics, rather successful, Mowbray and allowed his emotions to show. “People didn’t want me here in the first place,” said the former Rangers and QPR manager, who made his name as Steven Gerrard’s assistant at Rangers and Aston Villa. “You can say it’s about style or this and that, but, let’s cut to the chase, people didn’t want me.” Beale compounded his problems by declaring himself “bemused” by supporter criticism he had evidently taken so personally. He rightly pointed out that Sunderland have the youngest team in the division, one of the second tier’s lowest budgets and were ahead of schedule in reaching the playoffs last spring, only a year after escaping League One. The only problem was that Mowbray performed better than he did with similar resources, not to mention presiding over a more attractive playing style. Accordingly, when Sunderland lost 2-1 at Mowbray’s new club, Birmingham, last Saturday, Beale’s position became untenable. Rather than travel back to Wearside on Saturday night, the outgoing manager boarded a flight to Glasgow en route to his family home before a scheduled day off. By then many observers suspected Beale would soon be spending a lot more time in Scotland. Such suspicions were duly confirmed on Monday morning. Dodds swiftly became caretaker and Will Still, the 31-year-old Anglo-Belgian coach managing Reims in Ligue 1, promptly announced he was keen to “come home” to England and stressed that an ambitious Championship club would suit him just fine. Louis-Dreyfus and his idealistic director of football, Kristjaan Speakman, should count themselves fortunate that Sunderland remain an attractive proposition to a bright young manager. After all, decent coaches could be forgiven for steering clear of a club seeking its 22nd manager in 22 years – and fifth in the three years since the French-Swiss owner became chairman. Yet with an impressive, Premier League-standard infrastructure featuring the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light and well-appointed Academy of Light, not to mention this season’s near-41,000 median Championship home attendance, Sunderland still possess considerable pulling power. In theory they should be fighting off applications from high-calibre managers with points to prove in the Graham Potter mould but the reality is different. Although it is entirely sensible that the billionaire Louis-Dreyfus wants to run Sunderland as a sustainable business, his blueprint for success is flawed. Like legions of other clubs Sunderland aim to identify exciting young international talent and coach those players so well that they bring the team glory before being sold for huge profits. Unlike other adherents to this model, though, they seem to fail to accept that a certain amount of experience is necessary to provide on-field leadership and consistency. Beale, like Mowbray, departed not long after he publicly queried Speakman’s failure to provide him with a proven centre-forward. At present the Chelsea loanee Mason Burstow and Ukrainian striker Nazariy Rusyn are not capable of polishing off some fine approach work from, among others, Bellingham and the talented winger Jack Clarke. Moreover, the team, and Beale, were further undermined by Alex Pritchard’s refusal to continue playing for Sunderland before joining Birmingham last month. The 30-year-old attacking midfielder was their most experienced player. Louis-Dreyfus remains desperate to oversee promotion but, unless Dodds works miracles, doing so will necessitate a certain amount of speculating to accumulate. In the absence of such investment Sunderland’s managerial churn seems destined to continue at its current, absurd rate.",Sunderland; Championship; Football; Sport,Football
2024-09-04T08:04:34Z,‘It’s a very tough time in Hollywood’: inside the shrinking world of the TV writers’ room,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/04/tv-writers-room,"When a powerful earthquake struck near Los Angeles last month, it was a neat metaphor for a Hollywood film industry shaken in recent years by a streaming revolution, Covid pandemic, racial reckoning and crippling strikes. And nowhere are the aftershocks felt more keenly than in the writers’ room. These are collaborative spaces where writers come together to brainstorm ideas, debate plot twists, bounce jokes off each other and punch up scripts so they are ready for production. The formula has produced TV greats from The Dick Van Dyke Show to Saturday Night Live, from The Simpsons to The Sopranos. In the era when networks would commission a season of 22 episodes of a sitcom or drama, these rooms would often boast a dozen or more writers (dominated by white men) who would also assist on set if the actors needed guidance during filming – an exposure that many say was invaluable. The rooms were precious training grounds for young writers to cut their teeth and build a network of contacts. But that was then. Today, with the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix, studios increasingly rely on so-called mini-rooms with just four or five writers to create shows, often with fewer episodes. “In most cases the writers’ rooms today are very different from 10 or 20 years ago,” says Matthew Belloni, an entertainment lawyer and former editor of the Hollywood Reporter. “Most shows have far fewer episodes. The days of 22-episode network sitcoms and dramas are mostly gone, with exceptions, and consequently the number of writers in a writers’ room is typically much fewer than it was. Now, there are more shows than there were back then but the number of shows is coming down from the peak of three or four years ago.” These factors – and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) – were bones of contention during last year’s writers’ strike, which at 148 days was one of the longest in Hollywood history, compounded by actors downing tools at the same time. The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which did not respond to requests for comment for this article, fought to preserve the writers’ room as an inherently valuable concept. At one point this prompted a retort from the studios: “If writing needs to be done, writers are hired, but these proposals require the employment of writers whether they’re needed for the creative process or not.” The studios proposed that writers’ rooms should have a minimum of just three writers including the showrunner. The union managed to fend this off and reach an agreement that shows intended to run at least 13 episodes will have at least six writers on staff, with numbers shifting based on the number of episodes. Staff on shows in initial development will be employed for at least 10 weeks, while staff on shows that go to air will be employed for three weeks per episode. Anton Schettini, 35, who has worked in 14 TV writers’ rooms and is the author of Breaking into TV Writing, says: “Because streamers have shorter seasons, writers’ rooms last a shorter amount of time. There’s fewer episodes – something like six to 10 – on streamers, whereas networks would do 22 or, in the days of cable, there would be like a 12-episode season. “Your time working in a writers’ room has certainly shortened and we have seen up until the strike the writers’ room getting smaller and smaller, which is why the WGA fought for a minimum in the negotiation, which was implemented.” The three-year contract also secured an increase in pay and future residual earnings of between 3.5% and 5%. That was a boost for those who can get work. But for many writers who endured the strike in the hope that good times were just around the corner, conditions remain brutal. In a May article headlined “The Daily Terror of Being a TV Writer Right Now”, Gideon Yago, whose credits include The Newsroom and The Mosquito Coast, told Vanity Fair: “I just don’t sleep. These last couple of months have been the hardest. I haven’t had a single conversation with anyone in the industry that hasn’t expressed fear and frustration. That’s really, really bad when you’re in the enchantment and entertainment business.” A screenwriter, who has worked on several high-profile shows and wishes to remain anonymous, tells the Guardian that some of his former co-workers are no longer getting hired. “These are people who are not breaking in – they worked on the same shows that I did right before,” he says in a phone interview. “Now they’re saying, ‘We’re not getting any work. Our agents and managers are saying staffing is tricky out there.’ Partly it’s because the strike brought us a lot of benefits – salaries have increased, mini-rooms are much better paid than before – and as a result of that there are fewer of them.” Despite the reduced episode count, writers argue that the workload remains just as arduous and, with shorter employment periods, they must constantly be on the lookout for the next opportunity to earn a living wage in Los Angeles. The current climate is forcing them to make difficult decisions. The writer adds: “There are people I know that have been in the industry for a long time and they used to say, ‘I only work on the east coast, I’m not going to travel to LA,’ or, ‘I prefer Zoom because I’m a full-time single parent.’ But now they’re saying: ‘I need the money so if I have to pack up my kids and family full-time for 20 weeks with potential hiatuses built in, I guess that’s what I have to do’.” Virtual writers’ room sprang up during the pandemic, although there studios are pushing for a full return in person. The screenwriter adds: “Remote work is dwindling a bit. It became very popular during the pandemic. People were used to rooms fully virtual but now things are starting to go back to normal.” The writers’ strike began five months after OpenAI released its AI tool ChatGPT. The new agreement stipulates that scripts must be written by humans, not AI. Studios and production companies are obliged disclose to writers if any material given to them has been generated by AI in full or partly. In addition, AI-generated storylines will not be regarded as “literary material” – a term in their contracts for scripts and other story forms a screenwriter produces – so writers will not have to compete with AI for screen credits. The companies are not barred from using AI to generate content but writers have the right to sue if their work is used to train AI. For now, studios seem content to let writers do the work rather than spending more money on AI. The anonymous screenwriter comments: “Last year AI was the conversation of the moment: ‘Hmm, could we come up with a bit of content or an outline or treatment without hiring writers?’ “But once a room is fully up and running and you have access to all these creatives no one is going to look outside for additional AI content. Most people are like, well, we pay you guys, so come up with this on your own.” He gave the example of fake newspapers or the fake crawls that run across the screen on a cable news channel on a TV in the background of a scene. “That’s something you’d think people would pay to use AI to generate but we write it manually. “In the morning you’re like, let’s write the crawls that are coming on this fake CNN report that’s on the TV in the background. In that sense that’s been encouraging. All writers respect the process enough that it’s not part of the conversation; it’s not something you default to.” Another upheaval for writers’ rooms over the past five years have been the racial reckoning that followed Black Lives Matter protests over the police murder of George Floyd, an African American man, in Minneapolis in 2020. Most studios have diverse writer programmes and some actively mandate that each writers’ room has a diverse element. The unnamed screenwriter, who is Black, comments: “It adds a safety to my career in that there is an element of, if we have an all-male or all-white writer’s room, showrunners will feel the need to add some diversity. It’s crass to say they’ll pick from a pile but they will seek to rectify that. “I do think, though, that role is limited. Some former colleagues say, ‘It’s easier if you’re a person of colour to get hired right now.’ I always bristle against that because there’s only one in my room and it is me. I know other writers of colour who are in rooms of two writers of colour so it feels like a checkbox that, once it is checked, people don’t look beyond that to fulfill that need. “To me it feels like I’m not taking a spot that would go to other people; I’m competing with a lot of people who look like me to fill the only spot and, once that spot is filled, diversity has been ‘met’.” Writers suffered financially even when streaming was booming as studios tried to compete with Netflix and, adopting a Silicon Valley mindset, prioritised subscriber growth and hoped profits would follow. The result was content saturation, with some expensive shows barely watched or even left on the shelf. Studios have been grasping for a sustainable business model and writers now face even greater hardship as they scale down and consolidate. Earlier this month Paramount shut down its television studio as part of a cost-cutting measure to save half a billion dollars. Belloni, the entertainment lawyer who is a founding partner of the website Puck, says: “When Netflix became the dominant streaming service all of the legacy media companies bolted out to try and compete. Now they are pulling back because they spent so much money and their investors are asking for profit, not subscriber growth necessarily.” He concludes: “It’s a very tough time in Hollywood. The pullback in content and the bursting of the TV bubble has led to fewer jobs, more competition and tougher negotiating positions for these writers. All of it means it’s tougher than ever to be a working professional screenwriter.”",US television; Business; Television; Television industry; Culture; Television & radio,Television & radio
2023-03-22T00:28:14Z,You’ve got to start somewhere: simple ways to make your business more sustainable,https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-mba-lead-a-better-world/2023/mar/22/youve-got-to-start-somewhere-simple-ways-to-make-your-business-more-sustainable,"For many businesses, the road to sustainability is paved with good intentions. After all, a sustainable business model can actually translate to long-term financial success for your business, even if you’re operating a small-to-medium enterprise. It’s no longer a case of “get woke, go broke”. These days, you could be doing your bottom line a disservice if you don’t take the leap. However, transitioning to a truly sustainable business model without affecting your product, culture or customer relations is a complex process that’s challenging in many ways. How do you put sustainability at the core of your business’s mission? The Guardian asked four current students and graduates of Griffith University’s MBA program – ranked the world’s most sustainable MBA – for guidance on rising to this vital challenge. Rachell Hansen, carbon neutral project lead More than a decade in the public service and not-for-profit sectors gave Rachell Hansen an appreciation of the complexity of the climate crisis and the myriad ways it affects our lives. The birth of her first child solidified her drive to embark upon a purpose-driven career that would make a difference in her community and to the future of our planet. At the moment, that’s helping the government organisation that she works for achieve carbon neutral status. Hansen believes there’s power in knowing where you’re at from a sustainability perspective before investing time and money into projects and initiatives that might not shift the dial in the ways that you’d hoped. She recommends engaging with carbon footprint measuring programs, which can help your business establish a view of emissions over time. “The proof is in the pudding,” she says. “It gives you indications of where your pain points are. “And when you start to know and understand the intricacies and the granularity of that information, you can really start to create a strategy and a carbon reduction management plan for your organisation. But more importantly, you can also even identify unique opportunities that maybe haven’t been explored before.” Ronan Clinton, senior sustainability program manager Ronan Clinton is working in a job that didn’t exist when he first became interested in sustainable business practices more than a decade ago. But the initiative taken by people like him to integrate sustainability into their work has resulted in these types of roles becoming commonplace inside the world’s biggest companies. Undertaking Griffith’s sustainability-focused MBA has only made Clinton more motivated to keep pushing the boundaries. Forging his own career path in sustainability has shown Clinton that many businesses fall down at the first hurdle: knowing where to start. “There’s a general consensus that climate change and social wellbeing and economic growth are all complex issues that don’t necessarily have one single solution or outcome,” he says. “You need to look at it holistically across … the pillars that sit within your organisation.” But don’t panic: the rapid evolution of sustainable business practices is such that an entire industry has sprung up around helping businesses get started, and Clinton encourages all business leaders to ask for help from outside sources. “Leadership talks around sustainability and the impact your organisation can have … [can] create a greater awareness,” he says. Clare Burns, corporate sustainability academic Clare Burns describes herself as an “accidental academic”. She completed an MBA through Griffith when she was ready to take the next step in her corporate consulting career. Inspired by the course’s content, Burns strayed from her corporate career to complete a PhD focused on corporate sustainability. She worked as a part of the academic team in Griffith’s Department of Business Strategy and Innovation – a role that allowed her to share and apply MBA principles in a bigger-picture way. There are few people better qualified to help businesses on their sustainability journeys. Burns says it’s rarely practical challenges that prevent businesses from meeting this moment. Rather, it’s a clash of mindsets that can really hinder progress on sustainability. How do you get everybody on the same page? Education is paramount, she says, to circumvent the short-termism of traditional financial models and stakeholder management, particularly where upper management is concerned. “Being open to learning from and working with a broader range of stakeholders will be helpful in terms of really meaningfully addressing corporate sustainability,” she says. “I want [directors] to have confidence that they’re doing the right thing and asking the right questions within the organisation to start making change.” Pamela Caspani, urban designer Sustainability is a cause close to the heart of urban designer Pamela Caspani. While she enjoyed the work she did for much of her career, she felt there was potential to make a bigger impact. The Griffith MBA opened up opportunities to pursue personal goals and remedy what she sees as a lack of women and creatives in leadership positions. “Urban designers and planners have always been at the forefront of [sustainability],” she says, noting that that doesn’t necessarily translate to C-suite representation. For that reason, Caspani believes seeking out expertise from all corners of your business – especially the “extremely knowledgeable” junior staff moving through the ranks – is key to building an authentically sustainable business. “I think the business leaders are the ones that really need to be influenced and if you get the opportunity to influence them or be one of them, that’s where you have more of an opportunity to make significant change,” she says. The lesson? Don’t be so quick to dismiss the people who bring non-traditional perspectives. Their passion could well be the missing piece in your sustainability puzzle. Make it matter.

2024-03-16T19:00:13Z,Epic Games takes on Apple and Google in Australia over alleged misuse of market power,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/17/epic-games-vs-apple-vs-google-australia-lawsuits-alleged-market-power,"When Apple’s first iPhone launched in 2007, all its apps were made by Apple. Steve Jobs was reluctant to allow the apps of third-party developers on the iPhone, according to his biography by Walter Isaacson. He ultimately caved to pressure with the launch of the App Store in 2008. But the company wanted strict control over what was allowed on the platform, an email released in 2021 revealed. Apple’s control over its empire will be front and centre in a case heard over the next five months in Melbourne’s federal court. At the same time, Google – which has prided itself on having a more open ecosystem than Apple – will have its own practices put to the test. Two Australian federal court cases were put on hold in April 2021, pending the outcome of similar cases in the US. Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, has spent the past three years in a global legal battle against Apple and Google, alleging misuse of market power over the control they wield over their app stores. Fortnite was kicked off the Google and Apple app stores in 2020 after Epic Games offered its own in-app payment system that bypassed the one used by the platforms, and cut out the fees Apple and Google receive for in-app payments. Epic lost its 2021 antitrust case against Apple, but won its case against Google late last year. Originally separate, the Australian cases have now been combined into a single monolith. Justice Jonathan Beach decided to hear the two cases and an associated class action at the same time to avoid duplication of witness evidence. David and Goliath? In the Australian cases, which originally kicked off in 2020, Epic Games has alleged that Apple’s control over in-app purchases and its actions in banning the Fortnite app are a misuse of market power, which has substantially lessened competition in app development. The company has also alleged Google harmed app developers and consumers in Australia by preventing choice over app distribution and in-app payments on Android devices. Just like their phone operating systems, the legal cases between Apple and Google have many similarities – but also key points of difference. Apple’s iOS and App Store are completely closed and controlled by Apple. That means if an app is on your phone, and there is a payment through that app, it has to go through Apple. Similar rules operate on Google’s Android operating system for the Play Store, but Google also allows “sideloading” of apps – meaning apps installed directly on the phone without using the app store. It also allows for phone manufacturers such as Samsung to have their own app stores. Fortnite is still available on Android, but only through sideloading or through the Samsung store. Each company charges fees for transactions in their app stores. Google Play charges a 15% fee for the first US$1m earned by developers each year, increasing to 30% above that. Apple developers pay a 15% fee if the revenue generated the previous year is lower than $1m, but pay 30% if they earn more than that. Fees are common in the industry – Epic’s own store charges developers a 12% fee. Epic argues that it should be able to offer its own store as competition to Apple’s store, and also offer alternative payment options within their app in the official Games Store. While Google has argued it is more open than the Apple App Store, it was this openness that cost the tech company in the US case. A jury found that tying the Google Play Store to payments in apps was illegal, and that the company had entered into anti-competitive agreements with select developers to keep their apps in the Play Store. In the Apple case, the judge took a narrower view, considering mobile gaming transactions specifically rather than the app store as a whole. The judge found that Apple was not a monopoly, instead it was competing against Google and others. The judge also backed Apple’s concerns about the security implications of opening up the App Store, and supported the company seeking a fee for the use of its intellectual property through in-app payments. Apple is expected to run a very similar case in Australia. The company believes there is little difference between the cases, and the principles underlying Australian competition law are similar to those in US antitrust laws. Apple sees Epic not as David to its Goliath, but as a multibillion dollar company seeking to further profit at the expense of the security of iPhone users. Google argues it does offer customers a choice in app stores, as well as alternative options for developers to sell content outside Google Play. It also points to its permissions allowing the sideloading of apps while also trying to preserve security for users – something it argues Epic is attempting to water down. “It’s clear that Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform and it’s a model that’s good for Australian developers and consumers,” Google’s VP of government affairs and public policy, Wilson White, said in a post this week. “We will continue to vigorously defend our right to a sustainable business model that enables us to keep users safe, partner with developers to grow their businesses and keep the Android ecosystem thriving and healthy for all Australians.” Apple compelled to make changes in EU App Store Opening submissions will last two weeks, followed by evidence from fact witnesses and experts spanning three months, followed by two weeks of closing submissions ending in mid-July. Witnesses expected to testify include Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, who is in Melbourne for the hearing, as well as key executives from Apple and Google. A class action being run at the same time on behalf of Australian developers and consumers will fail if Epic’s case fails. The case is unlikely to be resolved this year, with Beach not expected to deliver a judgment within six months, after which there could be appeals. Regardless of whether Epic wins the battle, Apple and Google may ultimately lose the app store war. Apple has been forced to implement changes to its App Store in the European Union – including allowing alternate payment options and marketplaces – following the Digital Markets Act. As a result, Apple restored Epic’s developer account in the EU last week. According to Epic, Apple’s implementation of those changes is imperfect, but it may lead to other governments, including Australia, following suit.",Apple; Fortnite; Technology; Google,Technology
2024-01-19T17:15:21Z,"‘Devastating’: Port Talbot steelworks to shut blast furnaces and shed up to 2,800 jobs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/19/port-talbot-steelworks-blast-furnaces-to-close-costing-almost-3000-jobs-tata,"The owner of Port Talbot steelworks has confirmed that its two blast furnaces will shut down, in what unions have condemned as an “absolutely devastating” blow that will cost up to 2,800 jobs directly and many more in the south Wales community. Port Talbot’s parent company, the Indian-owned Tata Steel, said it was not “feasible or affordable” to adopt trade union proposals to continue production at the loss-making plant during a transition to greener, cheaper steelmaking operations. Amid fury and despair in the Welsh town, Tata could now face strikes at the plant, according to Unite, one of three unions representing steelworkers, which said it was considering industrial action. On Friday, after trading on the stock exchange ended in Mumbai, Tata officially confirmed its plans, which will result in most of the plant’s 4,000 workers losing their jobs. Of the positions slated for redundancy, 2,500 are expected to go within 18 months. About 200 positions will be saved by maintaining operations at the site’s hot strip mill, which rolls steel slab, while some temporary jobs will be created in the construction of new electric arc furnaces (EAFs). The cuts come despite the government providing £500m of financial backing for Tata’s £1.25bn four-year plan to build EAFs to produce steel from scrap metal, rather than virgin steel which is made from scratch. Keir Starmer urged the government to look again at the union’s proposals to avoid compulsory redundancies, which the Labour leader said were “viable” despite an estimated extra cost of £683m. “This government plan could lead to the end of steel in the United Kingdom,” he said. Labour has said it would invest £3bn in the transition to green steel. Rishi Sunaksaid the government’s smaller investment showed it was “absolutely committed” to British steelmaking. However, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he had written to Sunak asking for urgent talks about the furnace closures but had been told the prime minister was “not available”. The blast furnace closures, together with similar proposals at the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, would leave the UK as the only G20 economy without the ability to make steel from scratch. Instead, the UK will produce recycled product, using the surplus of scrap steel that is currently exported. Tata, which says the plant is losing £1m a day, said it would seek voluntary redundancies where possible and would provide £130m to fund severance payments, community programmes, skills training and job-seeking initiatives. The company rejected a proposal put forward by the Community and GMB unions that would have kept the blast furnaces open, protecting jobs during the transition. The two unions said that governments in France, Germany and Spain were all “committing billions to secure the future of their strategically important steel industries, and our government must show similar ambition”. They added: “More than 3,000 jobs and the future of British steelmaking are at stake. It is an absolute disgrace that Tata Steel, and the UK government, appear intent on pursuing the cheapest instead of the best plan for our industry, our steelworkers and our country. “It’s unbelievable any government would give a company £500m to throw 3,000 workers on the scrapheap, and our government must re-evaluate its miserly offer to support investment at Tata Steel.” Community said the closure was “absolutely devastating” to the local economy and called Tata’s plan “decarbonisation on the cheap”. Amid a schism between trade unions representing steelworkers, the GMB and Community also lashed out at Unite, which had put forward a separate £12bn plan to revive UK steelmaking over 12 years that they described as “discredited fantasy”. The Unite Wales secretary, Peter Hughes, said: “Our members are angry and frustrated and will do everything in their power to preserve steelmaking at Port Talbot including taking industrial action.” Sunak, asked about the Port Talbot announcement, said the government was “absolutely committed” to British steelmaking. TV Narendran, Tata Steel’s global chief executive and managing director, said: “The course we are putting forward is difficult, but we believe it is the right one. Having invested almost £5bn in the UK business since 2007, we must transform at pace to build a sustainable business in the UK for the long term. “Our ambitious plan includes the largest capital expenditure in UK steel production in more than a decade, guaranteeing long-term, high-quality steel production in the UK and transforming the Port Talbot facility into one of Europe’s premier centres for green steelmaking.” Tata estimates that converting Port Talbot to EAFs will reduce the UK’s carbon emissions by about 1.5%. The technology also requires far fewer workers than blast furnaces, meaning the plant is unlikely to increase staffing levels after the transition. The company has indicated that the plant could not have continued to operate without the transition, which would ultimately have threatened its entire UK operation, employing 8,000 people, which relies on supplies from Port Talbot. In theory, Tata Steel and the government could invest in direct reduced iron (DRI) steelmaking, as other countries in Europe have done, to produce iron for the steelmaking process. The technology uses gas at present but can be converted to run on zero-carbon hydrogen.",Tata; Steel industry; Business; UK news; Wales; Trade unions; Rishi Sunak; Job losses; Politics,Business
2023-10-04T10:14:55Z,Stop press: Sun and Daily Mail owners to combine printing operations,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/04/stop-press-sun-and-daily-mail-owners-to-combine-printing-operations,"The owners of the Times, Sun, Daily Mail and i newspapers are to combine their printing operations amid declining daily sales in a cost-cutting move that could affect hundreds of jobs. The move by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and Lord Rothermere’s Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), which will potentially lead to the closure of printing sites at Thurrock in Essex and Dinnington near Sheffield, will result in all national newspaper printing being handled by only two conglomerates. The new joint-venture will print titles including the Telegraph, Evening Standard and Financial Times, which shut its own presses last year, as well as Metro, titles for the regional publisher Newsquest, New Scientist and John Lewis. The plan will reduce the number of national newspaper printing operators to two – the other being the Mirror and Express owner, Reach, which also prints titles including the Guardian – and is expected to spark an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. News UK and DMGT said that consolidation was essential, with national newspaper sales declining by more than 60% over the last decade, amid soaring inflation in the cost of paper and labour. The companies hope to “establish a sustainable business model for the future of national newspaper printing in the UK”. Darren Barker, the managing director of Newsprinters UK, the News UK-owned printing operation that will take over all printing except DMGT’s remaining site in Northern Ireland, said: “The reality is that print readership has been in decline for some years now, and the sector has come under increasing pressure to better align capacity with demand.” After the launch of the joint-venture, titles will be printed at News UK-owned sites at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, Knowsley in Merseyside and Eurocentral near Glasgow. The two companies said the plan would be subject to consultation on jobs. Under employment contract law, the potential closure of the two DMGT sites is likely to involve the offer of roles at other sites, although given the geographic spread of the remaining sites, it is likely to be difficult for many staff to consider a move. “We are aware this will be an uncertain time for those potentially impacted and our priority is to provide staff with the support they need throughout this process,” said Julia Palmer-Poucher, the group production director at DMG Media Group, the media subsidiary of DMGT. “This proposed combination would provide a long-term solution for the Mail print titles. We must find ways to keep physical newspapers, which have an important future, commercially viable.” The two companies moved to allay concerns that the joint-venture might be a precursor to a wider merger of the two businesses, which would be blocked by the CMA given the scale News UK and DMGT have in the UK national newspaper market. “The [joint-venture] is limited to the parties’ printing operations and does not represent closer working between News UK and DMG Media on media, editorial or commercial activities,” the companies said. Last month, Rupert Murdoch announced he was standing down as chair of his media empire, with his eldest son, Lachlan, taking over day-to-day control. However, Murdoch still controls the family trust, which in turn controls the newspaper operation of News Corporation, and Fox, and will continue to call the shots on major decisions. The News UK and DMGT venture comes three months after the closure of one of the last two large-scale magazine printing plants in the UK, which has left all bar one of the UK’s top-selling magazines printed by one company.",Newspapers; News UK; Daily Mail & General Trust; Business; National newspapers; Daily Mail & General Trust; Daily Mail; Media; Newspapers & magazines; Media business; The Times,Media
2023-11-18T19:33:53Z,Everton pay price of leadership’s manic spending and blind eye to warnings | Will Unwin,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/18/everton-pay-price-of-leaderships-manic-spending-and-blind-eye-to-sense,"The severity of Everton’s punishment is up for debate but the club breaking their permitted financial fair play spend is not. For that there is plenty of blame to go round at Goodison Park after years of dysfunctional thinking has left the club in a perilous position. Some would argue that £19.5m is not much in the modern game, it barely buys a competent full-back these days, but Everton had received plenty of warnings about where they were heading. The Premier League’s independent commission was clear in its report: “The position that Everton finds itself in is of its own making.” Everton argue a disagreement over accountancy treatments surrounding their spend on the new stadium is the reason they surpassed their FFP limit, but flawed business in the transfer market is at the heart of the matter. Since Farhad Moshiri first invested in Everton in 2016, the direction of the club has swayed in the wind. Their managerial appointments have had little in common and Sean Dyche is their eighth permanent incumbent of the Moshiri era, which is set to end soon with 777 Partners waiting to complete their takeover with a backdrop of a 10-point deduction and a heightened threat of relegation. Moshiri joined the club’s board in June, more than seven years after his original investment. Key decisions were made without the man whose money was keeping the wheels turning. Bill Kenwright, whose stake dropped to 1.3%, maintained the moniker Mr Chairman and a hold over the club despite selling the majority of his shares. Kenwright was involved in player exits and in the commission’s report on its decision to punish Everton discussed the case of Player Y, whose proposed sale in the summer of 2020 was being handled by Kenwright rather than collectively by stakeholders on the board, a strategy that seems outdated. While styles jumped from Ronald Koeman to Sam Allardyce to Frank Lampard, recruitment had to adapt to each manager’s needs, players came and went, although many stayed on the books because their high wages and lengthy contracts meant suitors were hard to find. Allardyce spent just over six months in charge but still oversaw a January transfer window when almost £50m was spent to acquire Cenk Tosun and Theo Walcott. The Turkey striker signed a four-and-a-half year contract worth £120,000 per week, a deal he managed to see out, via two loan spells and 50 league appearances for Everton, before leaving on a free transfer to Besiktas. In Moshiri’s first year, the club finished seventh and eighth in the two seasons that followed – this brought belief they were on the right track. In 2019 then director of football Marcel Brands created the Sustainable Business Plan that based its theory on Everton regularly finishing in the top eight. It was suggested by advisors that accepting an average of 13th would make for a more sustainable concept but optimism defeated realism and the club ploughed on. Money was spent to achieve this ambition but since the plan was authored, Everton have failed to finish in the top eight, coming 16th and 17th in the past two seasons. The club still had assets to sell to potentially avoid this punishment. Their most valuable player in recent times was Richarlison, who the club thought could attract bids in the region of £80m but they sold him to Spurs for £60m in 2022. They had previously received a higher bid from Barcelona for the forward but the deal’s structure was a problem for Everton who tried to hold their nerve to get cash in immediately but it was a gamble that did not pay off. Risks were taken but few garnered reward. As the financial stress grew and the club looked set to struggle to comply with profit and sustainability rules, Everton were forced into an informal agreement that required every signing to be agreed with the Premier League, effectively imposing a salary cap on the club. In the independent commission’s report it stated: “The Premier League asserts that for Everton to have persisted in player purchases in the face of such plain warnings was recklessness that constitutes an aggravating factor.” It is a reminder that clubs require competent leadership who can direct a company for more than a season at a time. When clubs focus on the immediate future, it can create problems in the longer term and Everton have found this to their cost by throwing good money after bad. Others should see it as a caution that muddled planning cannot create a successful club in the Premier League. The 10-point deduction is unprecedented and, potentially disproportionate, for the breaches Everton have committed, but they can not claim they were not warned.",Everton; Football; Sport,Football
2023-08-07T10:00:38Z,Covert and confusing ‘service charges’ anger US diners,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/aug/07/restaurant-service-charges-us-los-angeles,"If you order the roasted chicken and Italian chopped salad at Marvin, a hip and Goop-approved French bistro in Los Angeles, it will cost you $56. But when your bill comes, you’ll be asked to pay $67. That’s part of a service charge, which the menu says goes to the front of house, kitchen staff and managers. But you’ll still be expected to tip your waitstaff and pay sales tax – meaning you could easily end up spending $86, $30 more than the sticker price . Diners say that confusing service fees are driving up the cost of meals – and they’re tired of it. Many restaurants implemented surcharges as a way to rebound from the pandemic. But at some establishments, these extra costs are sometimes only revealed after the diner gets an itemized receipt. Patrons say that’s dishonest. (Marvin spells out its service charge in fine print below the menu.) Diners may empathize with owners, understanding that it’s been a difficult few years for restaurants. But some customers feel like they’re being tricked into keeping a restaurant’s lights on through covert charges. Service fees have emerged as a confusing new facet of restaurant etiquette. Despite the name, a service fee is not the same as a tip and does not necessarily go to servers. Instead, the fee ends up in the hands of a restaurant owner, who will spend it however they see fit. Sometimes, it goes to waitstaff or employee benefit funds. It can also go toward the overall cost of running the business. In Los Angeles, an Italian restaurant was sued by servers, who said that the surcharge violated gratuity laws. Now, the owners put a disclosure on customer checks, saying the 18% fee “is not a tip or gratuity” but an “added fee controlled by the restaurant that helps facilitate a higher living base wage for all of our employees”. After a user shared the news to the r/LosAngeles subreddit, people began posting other service charges they had recently encountered. It led to one user compiling a list of all the offenders into one Google spreadsheet. More than 100 restaurants were added to the list. Some of the charges were unclear: one was itemized as “kitchen love”, and others were “wellness” or “adversity” fees. “As a patron, I don’t like being expected to pay X and then be confronted with paying X plus 5 to 20%, along with adding gratuity,” said the person who made the list, who did not want their name published. “Any establishment should charge what it costs to run a sustainable business – just don’t bamboozle me into it.” It may feel like surcharges are everywhere, but they’re still not the standard. A representative for the National Restaurant Association said that only about 15% of restaurants report adding fees or surcharges. “The typical restaurant business model is not set up to deal with the sustained and accelerated cost of food and labor, which is putting extraordinary pressure on operators,” Hudson Riehle, the group’s senior vice-president of research, said. Extra fees soften the pressure. Some customers argue that restaurants should raise prices to help shoulder new costs. Joe Pawlak, managing principal at the food service industry advisory firm Technomic, said he actually advises clients against that. “Prices have already gone up so much already that raising the prices on a menu even more would lead to sticker shock,” he said. Customers may not be happy about a service fee, but there are ways they can be more understanding. Pawlak advises that restaurants be open about their fees. “Customers tend to get angry when restaurants are not transparent,” he said. “People should be able to open a menu and read about a 5% surcharge before they order, and they should know where that money goes.” It helps if service fees relate to a mission that customers can sympathize with. “People like to know that it goes towards paying their employees a fair wage, or giving them extra benefits,” Pawlak said. While Pawlak has seen restaurants reverse their surcharge policy if enough customers complain, he believes the phenomenon is here to stay. “It’s a hot button issue for both consumers and restaurateurs,” he said. “The best way to add a service charge is to make it feel like it’s mission-driven, rather than self-serving for the restaurant.”",Restaurants; US news; Life and style; Food,Food
2023-07-14T02:27:39Z,Fran Drescher’s fiery speech against Hollywood studios goes viral as actors strike,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/14/fran-drescher-speech-actors-strike-writers-strike-sag-aftra-hollywood-ceos,"Fran Drescher has blasted Hollywood studios in a fiery speech after talks between the actors’ union and studios failed to avert a strike, calling them “disgusting” for claiming “they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs”. In a speech that was widely circulated on Thursday – particularly among many who did not know The Nanny star was heading up Sag-Aftra, Hollywood’s biggest union – Drescher said actors were being “marginalised, disrespected and dishonoured” by a business model that has been drastically changed by streaming and artificial intelligence. “What happens here is important because what’s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor, when employers make Wall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the essential contributors that make the machine run,” she said. “We are the victims here. We are being victimised by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us. “I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them. They stand on the wrong side of history.” On Thursday it was announced that 160,000 Sag-Aftra members – from big stars to background actors – will be joining the Writers Guild of America in a strike, marking the biggest shutdown of Hollywood since both unions last went on strike together in 1960. The unions are fighting for better terms with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery. Drescher, who became union president in 2021, has long expressed concerns about corporate greed, captioning photos with slogans like “STOP CAPITALIST GREED NOW” and tweeting sentiments including: “Capitalism has become another word for Ruling Class Elite!” In 2017 New York Magazine ran the headline: “Your New Favorite Anti-Capitalist Icon Is Fran Drescher.” Drescher also described herself as “anti-capitalist” in an interview with Vulture that year, saying: “I’m not anti-making-money, don’t get me wrong. I don’t think making money is a bad thing, per se. But it has to be calibrated within the spectrum of what’s a true value. “What I really tell people is, ‘you might be the first ones at a global-warming rally, but meanwhile, do you know what’s in your investment portfolio?’ We need to not be supporting these companies at all.” Drescher’s speech on Thursday was off-the-cuff, with the 65-year-old actor shaking her fists and sometimes blinking away tears. “Wake up and smell the coffee,” she told the studios. “We demand respect! You cannot exist without us!” Sag-Aftra members have been ordered to stop any work connected to productions, including red carpets and promoting their work on social media. The London premiere of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer was pulled forward one hour to avoid the start of the strike, with the cast leaving during the film as it was officially announced. On Twitter Bette Midler criticised tech companies in a thread listing the many industries that were being hurt, before focusing on Hollywood. “The actors are right to strike, as are the writers,” she wrote. “If you want to devalue and destroy an industry, it’s no longer a sustainable business model.” Cynthia Nixon tweeted that she is “proud to be standing tall” with the WGA and that studios that have been “reaping from our labor for far too long”. She added: “We will win this!” Jamie Lee Curtis shared an Instagram post that read: “It’s time to take down the MASKS and pick up the SIGNS”.",US actors' strike 2023; Culture; Film industry; Business; Film; US television; US news; Television & radio; Television,Culture
2023-05-03T12:15:42Z,Worcester complete sale to Atlas Group and assure a future for Warriors,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/03/worcester-complete-sale-to-atlas-group-and-assure-future-for-warriors-rugby-union,"The sale of Worcester Warriors to the Atlas Group, headed by Jim O’Toole, has been completed. The former Warriors chief executive and his consortium were confirmed as a preferred bidder last year, and it was announced on Wednesday that talks with the club’s administrators are complete, after a deadline set by Begbies Traynor passed on Tuesday. “We’ve concluded the transaction, and have taken control of the rugby club,” O’Toole said. The deal assures a future for the Warriors after they entered administration last September, with details of their existence still to be confirmed. Their playing squad has long since broken up and it is unclear at which level the club will compete. A statement read: “Atlas WWRFC are delighted to confirm they have completed on the transaction with the administrators and now look forward to delivering their vision for rugby, the business and the wider community at Sixways. “Atlas thank Begbies Traynor and their advisors for their collaborative approach, alongside the Warriors fans and wider rugby community for their patience and support … special thanks and recognition must also go to the staff at Sixways who have kept the venue management operation going successfully.” A merger with Stourbridge and a rebranding as Sixways Rugby were proposed by O’Toole’s consortium before the group withdrew their application to play in next season’s Championship in February. Last month, the Rugby Football Union stated that its regulations “are designed to prevent a club effectively ‘buying’ a league position”. A merger remains on the table, however. The Stourbridge chairman, Miles Edge, said: “We’ve been very patient waiting for this news … this is the first tick box, and there’s still a fair amount of work to do.

2023-09-01T15:00:20Z,Can an Asian Women’s Champions League help close the football gap with Europe? | Paul Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/02/asian-womens-champions-league,"On face value Asia’s performance at the Women’s World Cup was a good one, with Japan and Australia making deep runs, and the Philippines providing one of the fairytale stories of the tournament with their historic win over New Zealand. But dig a little deeper and the results reveal the chasm that has developed between Europe and Asia. If you remove Australia and Japan’s results, the ledger makes for worrying reading – just two wins, one draw and nine losses. More concerning is in those 12 games, Asian teams scored just three goals while conceding a whopping 31. Vietnam, the Philippines and China suffered some of the heaviest defeats of the tournament. Asia used to be a torchbearer for women’s football, with Japan, Australia, China and North Korea all inside the top 12 as recently as 2016, but the recent evidence suggests the balance of power has fully swung in Europe’s favour. Fifa’s latest rankings put just one team, Japan, inside the top 10. It makes the Asian Football Confederation’s (AFC) recent announcement of a Women’s Champions League all the more significant, as it tries to claw back lost ground and maintain the momentum from just the second Women’s World Cup hosted in Asia. Mongoljingoo Sodgerel, an AFC women’s football committee member, says the league would give clubs across the continent “new ambition and a new target to reach”. “Previously the local domestic women’s leagues [were the ceiling], but now we have more steps further ahead to reach with the Women’s Champions League,” she says. “It’s a very positive development for women’s football, because now is the time to step up more to make the amateur part more professional.” That last part is pertinent, because as it stands in Asia you can count on one hand the number of leagues that could be classed as professional; Australia’s is one, as are leagues in Japan and China, while those in South Korea, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have professional and semi-professional elements. Investing in and developing the ecosystem at club level is a key factor in raising the overall level of the game. Creating a professional environment for hundreds of players, rather than a select few within national teams, is ultimately what will raise standards, and Australia has an important role to play in leading that charge. With the Australian Professional Leagues targeting further growth in the coming years , A-League Women’s (ALW) teams should be the standard bearers of the new Asian competition. Winning could be a realistic target, but silverware or not, the competition’s existence would be a boost for the game. An obvious bonus would be more matches in a calendar year, something Adelaide United women’s coach Adrian Stenta says has been lacking. “It might also assist with attracting good quality players to our shores or with retaining top quality Australian players who wish to experience playing in a continental club football competition,” he says. “Obviously the competition is starting small, but the potential for growth is there and has the added benefit of exposing Australian players to a range of Asian opposition and environments.” But the global players’ union, FIFPro, has cautioned against putting the cart before the horse, saying more work needs to be done to ensure it’s sustainable and players are fairly rewarded for the extra workload. The FIFPro Asia chair, Takuya Yamazaki, says while there is demand for women’s international club competitions, it’s “imperative that we avoid repeating the same mistakes” made in the men’s game. “Under the current football governance system … players can be called up without incurring costs such as player salaries. Within this framework, the creation of new competitions could easily occur without a sustainable business plan, thereby imposing significant burdens on clubs and players.” While the Women’s Champions League stands to redefine women’s football in Asia, it could go even further, with Fifa announcing its intentions to launch a Women’s Club World Cup in the near future. It creates a possible scenario whereby Melbourne Victory, for example, win the Women’s Champions League and with it a spot at the Women’s Club World Cup. Suddenly, the world is their oyster. An ALW side taking on Sam Kerr’s Chelsea, Hayley Raso’s Real Madrid or Ellie Carpenter’s Olympique Lyon? It could happen. Fifa’s chief of women’s football, Sarai Bareman, has said it would be an important step forward: “We need to make sure that in between the World Cups every four years, the club game is retaining the interest that we see from the World Cups. A Club World Cup is a fantastic way to drive momentum in the leagues and the clubs.” Driving momentum is what the AFC wants for the Women’s Champions League. Will it bring about an immediate closing of the gap? That’s unlikely, given its initial small scale, especially as Europe continues to invest at far greater levels. But this is a long-term play aimed at raising standards across the board so the ledger at future World Cups makes for much more pleasant reading on more than just face value.",Women's football; A-League Women; Asian Champions League; Football; Sport; Women's World Cup 2023; Women's World Cup; Fifa; Australia sport,Football

2023-11-24T15:33:21Z,‘There isn’t a plan’: frustration and defiance in rugby’s Championship,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/24/there-isnt-a-plan-frustration-and-defiance-in-rugbys-championship,"Almost everyone in English club rugby is agreed on one thing. It cannot go on like this. The system, if that is the right word for the teetering pile of Jenga bricks supporting a cash-strapped 10-team Premiership, is broken and a scheduled eight-year agreement between the Rugby Football Union and the leading club owners is seen as the much-needed long-term answer. Which is fine – except for one fundamental detail. It does little, as things stand, for anybody else. Talk to people in the second-tier Championship and there is frustration, defiance and gallows humour in roughly equal parts after years of dwindling funds and central support. As Mark Lavery, director of rugby of second-placed Ampthill, puts it: “We’ve taken all the money out of the foundations, put it into the roof and now we’re wondering why the foundations are shaking.” Not far away in Bedford, the nation’s longest-serving director of rugby, Mike Rayer, also feels there is a lack of appreciation in certain quarters for the work the Championship clubs – and the national leagues beneath them – do to nurture young players, coaches, referees and communities across the land. “No one’s really grasped hold of the Championship since before Covid,” says Rayer. “It’s just been left in the corner to fight for itself. There’s some really good stuff going on and some really good players in the Championship.” As with local newspapers and county cricket, however, heritage and good intentions are not the safe shields they once were. Money is finite and there are multiplying mouths to feed. In the eyes of many including Lavery, the boss of a leading car retail group, the sport requires a whole game solution rather than one for only a protected few. “The RFU seem to have a fundamentally different view of the world based on a closed shop at the top level. For everything else below that, there doesn’t appear to be a plan. And yet we want to increase the amount of money paid to PRL? Talk me through that one. It’s the economics of the madhouse.” All this cuts to the heart of English rugby’s future. Rather than cosying up to a handful of debt-laden Premiership clubs, isn’t the RFU – checks notes – supposed to be a members’ organisation charged with sustaining the game at all levels? On Tuesday there were further collective talks but as yet no transformative central funding is on the horizon. In a statement last week the Championship had already formally rejected the idea of a “Premiership 2” franchise league, which it believes would not be meritocratic and would essentially reduce it to “farm” club status. It means the uncertainty rumbles on. “Premiership 2 indicates an umbilical cord which isn’t there because they’ve done a private transaction we’re not involved in,” said Simon Halliday, chairman of the Championship committee. “We’ve been told countless times ‘We haven’t got any money’. Let’s rephrase that. They don’t want to allocate it to us.” All this is in marked contrast to France where ProD2, the league below the Top 14, goes from strength to strength. Municipally owned stadiums and a more lucrative television deal clearly help but the difference is still stark. In England even the top Premiership clubs are seeking to renegotiate their Covid loans while the demise of last year’s Championship winners, Jersey, further underlined the precarious nature of rugby’s financial landscape. So what should the future look like? Part of the problem is there are more different visions than a busy branch of Specsavers. Some clubs are ambitious, others exist largely in survival mode. Ampthill are second in the league behind Ealing Trailfinders but without promotion or relegation, or a home ground that satisfies the minimum standards criteria, what else is there to aim for? “We set off 18 years ago and said we’d get into the Championship,” says Lavery. “At that point we were at level 7. We got five promotions in 12 years but now we’ve hit a glass ceiling.” Their central funding has also shrunk massively, from £680,000 in their first season down to £90,000 once medical expenses are settled. Ampthill have a tie-up with Saracens and several England players – Ben Earl, Alex Mitchell, Theo Dan and Freddie Steward – have worn the club’s jersey. What they really want, though, is the chance to become the best club Ampthill can possibly be. “It wasn’t that long ago that Saracens were playing on a park in north London,” says Lavery. “I know because I went down there and watched them.” A healthy player pathway, with set numbers of English-qualified academy players receiving more game time, has to be a key ingredient. In Bedford it has not escaped Rayer’s attention that the ex-Blues full-back Rich Lane scored three tries for Bristol against Exeter this month. “There are still aspirational players in and around the Championship who could master it in the Premiership,” said Rayer, who won 21 caps for Wales and has been in charge at Goldington Road for 18 years. “We’re also accessible. Players can rub shoulders with the supporters … you see the real human side of the game. That’s the beauty of us. But it can’t totally become a development league. We all needed to learn the game through playing with good and experienced players. You can’t lose sight of that.” On top of that, Championship sides are used to being resourceful. “We’re running a sustainable business … unlike the Premiership we’re not losing millions of pounds,” says Rayer, also adamant that promotion and relegation remains vital for the England senior team. “We’ve got to fight for promotion and relegation. International rugby is all about the result at the end of the day. How do you prepare for that if you lose 12 or 15 games a year and it doesn’t matter?” Lavery agrees. “When you consider the drop in attendances, the drop in participation and the risks involved in playing the sport, we seem to be fixated on something that makes the sport less entertaining because there’s no jeopardy.” Halliday, though, does not envisage a rethink. “The game, whether it likes it or not, needs to understand the barriers to entry are not coming down any time soon. The only way to close that gap is to help to bridge it from the bottom up.” Many still feel the rejected Championship blueprint put together by Edward Griffiths more than three years ago contained some good ideas but Halliday believes a viable structure can eventually emerge. “It’ll just take longer because of the hand we’ve been dealt. You can’t undo the past but you can learn from it. We all want to find a solution. We want to be the best possible pathway for the young players of tomorrow. We need to commercialise who we are, which we haven’t done for years. And we have to improve our standards. “I share the RFU’s vision that we can’t just carry on in the same way. It’s a huge challenge because of the years of underinvestment in this group of clubs. You reap what you sow … I think we will suffer for years to come because of some of the decisions that have been made. But I don’t run the RFU. All I’m trying to do is make sure our clubs can manage their own destiny. Their value should be recognised and I want that respect. Let no one turn round and say our clubs aren’t ambitious. They’re ambitious as hell.”",Rugby union; Sport,Sport
2023-08-30T15:00:18Z,"Australia Post reports $200m annual loss, its first since 2015, amid push to close city branches",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/31/australia-post-annual-financial-results-loss,"Australia Post has revealed a $200m loss this year, its first since 2015, renewing political debate about increasing the cost of stamps, cutting the frequency of letter delivery and closing post offices in metropolitan areas. In a statement on Thursday, Australia Post revealed that losses in its letter business had increased by more than 50% to $384m, warning that without regulatory changes its 2022-23 loss will be followed by “many more” and it will be “greatly devalued”. Australia Post said its community service obligations, which include deliveries five days a week to 98% of delivery points, cost it $442m, up 27% on the previous year. After recording a profit before tax of just $23.6m for the six months to 31 December, the chief executive, Paul Graham, had warned in February that Australia Post will report a loss this year for the first time since 2015. The $200m pre-tax loss is just Australia Post’s second loss since it became a self-funded government business enterprise in 1989. “Further losses are expected unless Australia Post can secure the necessary support required to modernise its business,” it said in a statement on Thursday. Without regulatory changes, the terminal decline in letters is eventually expected to trigger losses commensurate with Canada Post’s C$548m loss and the UK Royal Mail’s £1bn loss. On Thursday, Graham said “the headwinds Australia Post is facing into aren’t new and it’s my job along with the leadership team to transform and modernise Australia Post, so it can once again be a financially sustainable business”. “If we do everything in our power to run this business well and we get a favourable regulatory response towards modernisation, I’m confident that Australia Post will return to profit. “Without this support, the FY23 loss will be followed by many more. Inaction could result in a greatly devalued Australian asset.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia Post will press the federal government, which wholly owns it, for a political commitment this year on legal changes. These include reducing letter frequency and closing some full-service post offices in metro areas while allowing more self-service options such as parcel lockers. In a submission to the consultation on modernising the postal service launched by the Albanese government, Australia Post warned “without modernisation, our financial position will rapidly deteriorate, putting at risk the ongoing sustainability of the organisation and its services”. Australia Post called for “incremental increases” in stamp prices beyond inflation and “deregulating aspects” of the competition watchdog’s oversight of the price of priority letters. Despite 97% of letters coming from government and businesses, Australia Post is currently prevented from charging corporate customers more than households to deliver mail. It noted that globally demand for letters had declined since 2008, with volumes in Australia down by almost 67%. “It is predicted that by 2032, Australians will receive less than one letter a week.” Australia Post is required to maintain 4,000 post offices. In the 2022 financial year it had 4,310 post offices, with 2,513 in rural and remote areas, which it said “cost more than $1.3bn” to run. “Yet retail transactions (or purchasing goods and services) in post offices continues to decline, a trend also observed overseas,” it said, with retail transactions in post offices down by 39% in Australia since 2014. The submission noted that “some metropolitan areas are oversaturated with post offices”, citing that there are 73 outlets within 7.5km of Darlinghurst in inner Sydney and 79 outlets within 7.5km of Brunswick in inner Melbourne. “Australia Post is therefore seeking to remove both the minimum requirement of retail outlets within the performance standards and to also adjust proximity requirements.” Closing some post offices in high-density areas “is not expected to adversely impact customers” and would help remaining post offices “become more financially viable due to increased demand”. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said “Australia Post is a cherished national and publicly-owned institution” facing “significant structural headwinds”. “The Albanese government is committed to supporting Australia Post modernise so that it can continue delivering the essential services consumers and small businesses rely on to stay connected,” she said. “Change will be needed to ensure that a high quality and sustainable letters and parcels service is maintained.” While some politicians are open to discussing the frequency of letters, closing post offices even in metro areas would be contentious. The Liberal MP Keith Wolahan, who is campaigning against closures in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, warned that “Australia Post is about more than letters and parcels”. “People rely [on post offices] for a wide variety of services, from bills to passports,” he told Guardian Australia. “The recent closures in Blackburn, Mitcham and Box Hill are baffling given the significant expected growth in this booming corridor of Melbourne.” Labor MP Carina Garland expressed “deep concern” about the closures in May. The independent senator David Pocock agreed that post offices serve a “very important purpose”, including providing banking services and getting photos for ID. “When it comes to the five-day delivery, there’s maybe not as much demand for letters,” he said. “We know that their business is shifting towards packages and online shopping … But they are the national postal service and they play a really important role there.”",Australia Post; Australia news; Business; Australian politics,Business
2023-11-28T05:00:07Z,What impact does the Guardian have on the natural world?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/28/what-impact-does-the-guardian-have-on-the-natural-world,"Nature provides us with air to breathe, food to eat and water to drink. The metal in your laptop, the wood in your desk, the glass made from sand – they all come from nature. We depend upon these resources and yet, as we extract them, we are destroying places where wildlife lives. There are an estimated 1 million species at risk of extinction. As a result, the delicate balance between species that sustains life on Earth is at risk of collapse, with damaged ecosystems making the climate crisis worse, undermining our food supply and putting livelihoods at risk. Half of global GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature, according to the World Economic Forum. Carbon emissions are only part of the story when we think about destruction of the environment. The United Nations has told large businesses that by 2030 they should also be disclosing their impacts and dependencies on nature. But what does this mean in practice? At the Guardian, we’ve been working it out with researchers at the University of Oxford. It means examining all our daily activities: from the newspapers and website we produce to how our journalists get to work. In our carbon audit, greenhouse gases are the endpoint of our analysis (in common with most businesses, we report on our carbon footprint in terms of the equivalent amount of greenhouse gases emitted). But no such north star exists for nature – it cannot be boiled down to one thing. Impacts range from depletion of water resources to water pollution, air pollution and species loss driven by changes in land use, such as deforestation. Not even ecologists can agree on how it should be measured, yet they agree we need to act. We followed the same methodologies outlined in an analysis published in the journal Nature. There is a lot we still don’t know, but in the spirit of transparency and accountability, we want to share with readers how we carried out our first ever measurement of the Guardian’s impact on nature and what we found. * * * How did we measure our biodiversity footprint? A consultancy called Wild Business analysed the data we supplied for the year to March 2022. The research was performed by Dr Talitha Bromwich and supervised by the consultancy’s co-founder, Dr Joseph Bull, both of whom are at Oxford University. The key areas were production of the Guardian and Observer newspapers; digital products (how readers access news through our website and apps); operating the office (use of heating, lighting, water); our IT; business travel; and canteen refreshments. The researchers examined five biodiversity impacts of all these activities: greenhouse gas emissions, water use, water pollution, air pollution and land use. All are crucial resources for wildlife, and together, they rank among the main drivers of nature loss. Working out our impacts on air, water and land was only half the story, which is why they are called “mid-points”. They show our impact on nature, but to find out the effect this is having on biodiversity, we needed to estimate the number of species lost (for example, how water pollution affects species in a particular watercourse). The final metric we looked at is something called “species.year”, which quantifies the number of species that would probably be lost from a localised region because of the environmental pressures exerted by a given activity over the course of a year. This is useful as it gives a high-level overview of the size of impacts relative to other organisations. * * * What did we find? The main driver of biodiversity decline comes from production of the newspaper. This accounted for 68% of our impacts, similar to what we found in our carbon audit. Most of this came from greenhouse gas emissions (making paper involves a lot of energy). Other significant factors were water usage and water pollution from chemicals in the pulping process. We looked at the impact of inks and aluminium printing plates – both of which are necessary to get words on the page. Vehicles deliver the newspaper. We looked at how transportation by road can release nitrogen oxide, which contributes to ozone formation, and sulphur dioxide, which is a factor in acid rain. Some of our print products are made from sustainably sourced virgin paper. Growing trees to make paper in Scandinavian forests has an impact on land. The next driver is the website and app (10%), which relates to the impacts of people reading, watching and listening to the news on their computers or phones. Most of this is energy to power and transmit data to those devices, and this is linked to greenhouse gases. The figure is based on national averages for energy generation for our global readership, reflecting the mix of renewable and non-renewable energy sources in different countries. Offices accounted for 8% of impacts. This includes anything to do with electricity, water, waste and furniture. IT hardware accounted for 8%, and business travel was 4%. Our final impact was catering, which was 1%. It’s hard to understand the size of our impacts on nature without having a comparison with a similar organisation. We are not aware of any other newspaper publisher that has carried out such a comprehensive audit. A biodiversity audit of Oxford University found 79% of its impacts came from greenhouse gas emissions. The Guardian had similar results: 80% of our nature impacts were also driven by greenhouse gas emissions. In part, this is because of the nature of our business. Bromwich says: “The Guardian’s primary activities involve paper production, printing, the use of digital products and the distribution of papers, which are all energy-intensive activities that likely have genuinely considerable greenhouse gas emissions impacts.” Overall, the Guardian’s total biodiversity footprint was 10% of the size of Oxford University. “The size of the Guardian’s impact is relatively small compared with organisations in other sectors that we’ve looked at,” says Bull. “We’re not super-surprised that the impacts of some of the main commodities, like paper, were so dominant in the mix and such a big part of the biodiversity footprint – that makes perfect sense.” What do we still not know? It’s early days for this kind of audit. “All studies we’ve done like this for different organisations have data deficiencies,” says Bull. There are three key reasons for this: Our suppliers did not have all the data, because this is such a new field. In the future, we’ll be asking all large suppliers for information on water use, land use and air pollution when we request data on carbon emissions. The supporting research has not been done yet. The team at Oxford trawled through mounds of research to find the answers to such questions as: “What are the environmental impacts of ink used in newspaper printing?”, and sometimes they did not find anything because no studies exist. These cases we had to leave blank, or use estimates based on related industries. Supply chains are messy – we do not know the source of some materials. In the future, if supply chains are more traceable we could have more accurate data on our impacts. It would then be easier to choose more sustainable suppliers. * * * What are we doing about it? This project represents a shift in how we think about what it means to be a sustainable business. Because there is generally a strong correlation between our carbon footprint and biodiversity impact, the data shows that by reducing our emissions we will often also lower our impact on nature (although there is not always a direct correlation – for example, switching to renewables can have biodiversity impacts through the use of water in hydroelectric power plants). Having this information gives us more confidence that the path we are following to address our environmental impact is the right one. We are incorporating biodiversity considerations into our emissions-reduction plan. For example, we are working on ways to reduce waste within the newspaper supply chain, and have started asking for data relating to nature impacts as part of large purchasing contracts. We aim to get better data on the water and land use associated with paper supply, and the use of aluminium plates, chemicals and inks necessary for newspaper printing. For now, we are not yet in a position to set a hard target for reducing our impacts on nature. We expect measurements to evolve over the coming years, so a target we set today could be meaningless in a few years. Nor are we thinking about credits or offsets. Guardian reporting has shown that many carbon credit schemes have little or no measurable impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Alistair Purdie, a sustainable agriculture analyst from BloombergNEF, says: “There’s a quote floating around in this space quite a lot, which is ‘the perfect is the enemy of the good’. In the push to achieve an ideal solution, you throw away workable, yet imperfect solutions. The Guardian’s analysis of its footprint here is valuable. Whether it’s entirely accurate isn’t necessarily the most important thing. “The cost of inaction is far bigger. So you see and you try to quantify your impacts, and then make a push to improve your outcomes. That’s always going to be better than just ignoring it and doing nothing.” By expanding our understanding of environmental impacts to include biodiversity, we can start calculating our impacts more broadly. We believe this is the right thing to do and now is the time to start. We still have a lot to learn, and hope our transparency will be useful – and set a precedent – for others setting out on this path.",Carbon footprints; The Guardian; Environment; Biodiversity; Greenhouse gas emissions; Emissions trading; Travel and transport; Pollution; Endangered species; Endangered habitats; Water; Energy; Sustainable development,Environment
2023-01-30T16:53:40Z,Shares in 888 fall as it removes CEO and suspends Middle East VIP accounts ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/30/888s-middle-east-vip-gambling-accounts-suspended,"Online betting group 888 has removed its chief executive and suspended VIP customer accounts in the Middle East amid an internal investigation into a failure to follow anti-money laundering processes. Shares in the Gibraltar-headquartered group, which last year acquired William Hill’s operations outside the US in a £2.2bn deal, plunged by more than a quarter as investors fuelled 888’s biggest drop in share price since 2006. Its market value has slumped more than 70% over the last year. The company said certain “best practices have not been followed” in relation to “know your client” and anti-money laundering regulations. “While further internal investigations are under way, the board has taken the decision to suspend VIP customer accounts in the region, effective immediately,” the company said. “Based on the board’s current understanding, the process deficiencies identified are isolated to this region only.” The suspensions account for up to 3% of group revenues (about £50m) if they remain frozen, the company said. The company also announced the immediate departure of Itai Pazner, the chief executive of 888 for the past four years, who has worked at the company for more than two decades. “Gambling stocks are under enough regulatory scrutiny as it is without inviting reasons for further attention and yet that’s exactly what 888 has done,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell. “News it is suspending VIP accounts in the Middle East over best practices not being followed over money laundering is incredibly damaging.” In an effort to calm investors, 888 has asked the chief financial officer, Yariv Dafna, who was expected to leave at the end of March, to stay on until the end of the year. The company said its chair, Jonathan Mendelsohn, a Labour peer and former party lobbyist and fundraiser who is married to the European Meta executive Nicola Mendelsohn, would temporarily take on executive responsibilities while the board seeks a replacement for Pazner. “The board and I take the group’s compliance responsibilities incredibly seriously,” said Lord Mendelsohn. “When we were alerted to issues with some of 888’s VIP customers, the board took decisive actions. We will be uncompromising in our approach to compliance as we build a strong and sustainable business.” The Gambling Commission has fined 888 several times for compliance failures in recent years. Last year it was fined £9.4m, the third highest in the history of British gambling regulation, over multiple failings that led to customers racking up huge losses during the depths of the Covid pandemic. In 2017, the company paid £7.8m for “outrageous” failings, after more than 7,000 people who had voluntarily banned themselves from gambling were still able to access their accounts.",Gambling; Society; Business; UK news; Middle East and north Africa; World news,Society

The reason, in a mere two words: the internet. And he certainly proved right. With a few notable exceptions, newspapers – once the core of American journalism – have been dying right and left. Now, big digital media-news companies, once the great hope of post-print news, seem to be going in the same direction. Down, down, down. In recent weeks and months, digital newsrooms have taken huge hits. BuzzFeed News suddenly shuttered, leaving scores of extremely talented journalists without employment (and lest you think of BuzzFeed as strictly a place for viral videos about cats, recall that its news division did plenty of prize-winning journalism over the years). Vox Media recently laid off 7% of its staff and raised money based on a valuation about half of what it was worth in 2015. Then, on Monday, another major blow: Vice was filing for bankruptcy. A New York Times report was unsparing, calling Vice a “decayed digital colossus”, and noting that at one point it was thought to be worth a now-unfathomable $5.7bn. It’s just as Shirky predicted it more than a decade ago, as he compared the coming of the internet to the arrival of Gutenberg’s printing press. Communication was utterly upended. “This is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place,” Shirky wrote. And, amid the ensuing chaos, it’s extremely hard to see what’s going next: “The importance of any given experiment isn’t apparent at the moment it appears, big changes stall, small changes spread.” And so it is with the news media – journalism, let’s call it – in the digital age. Many of the biggest experiments are failing. The problem in digital news? The audience, in many cases, was there. But the profits didn’t follow, or at least not in a sustainable way. Digital advertising revenue, once thought to be based on audience size, was going instead to social-media platforms, particularly Facebook. Venture capitalists who had funded the news sites grew disenchanted and impatient. “Many, many things went wrong,” Ben Smith, the former top BuzzFeed News editor, told Jon Favreau on his Offline podcast, noting in something of an understatement that “social media wasn’t going to work out the way we thought it was”. (Disclosure: I was recruited to succeed Smith at BuzzFeed News; I dropped out of the running early on.) In fact, said Smith, whose new book, Traffic, traces the rise and decline of the digital-news dream, “the internet itself is kind of falling apart”. That may be overstating it, but Twitter users – and hundreds of laid-off journalists – would find it hard to disagree. So when it comes to news in the fully digital age, what will work? What will be successful, not only financially but in serving the public’s need for fact-based news and information? That’s a tricky question because we’re still fully in the grip of the digital revolution and the chaos that Shirky recognized. Some experiments are failing; others are taking hold. It’s heartening to see the success of quality digital-first news sites like ProPublica, which depend heavily – though not exclusively – on philanthropy. The New York Times is thriving in the digital age, due partly to initiatives that have nothing to do with news – addictive puzzles, a cooking app and the product-review site known as Wirecutter. The Wall Street Journal has an impenetrable paywall and a wealthy audience who find its business coverage indispensable. The small local-news site Mississippi Today – funded through membership, events and philanthropy – won a Pulitzer prize last month; it was founded only seven years ago. News companies that are owned by billionaires, such as the Washington Post, may have more stability than most, but still find themselves grappling with the loss of advertising revenue; even billionaires don’t want to sustain losses indefinitely. (That became clear to me as editor of the Buffalo News, once owned by Warren Buffett, who got out of the newspaper business entirely a few years ago after declaring in an interview that the industry had become nothing but “toast”.) The Guardian, owned by the Scott Trust and sustained by its endowment, is also supported by its readers, an essential component of its current financial health. The truth is there’s no single solution – and that’s not at all surprising this early in the digital revolution. “Diversified revenue,” is Smith’s best answer to a sustainable business model for journalism’s future. He’s right. Newspapers were far too dependent on print advertising and once that fell off a cliff in 2008, so did they. BuzzFeed and many others bet big on the distribution model of social media but without fully realizing that the platforms would siphon off the digital-ad dollars. My deepest hope is that news consumers – also known as citizens – and philanthropists alike recognize the importance of quality reporting and are willing to support it. In this time of uncertainty, the importance of good journalism is the one sure bet.

2023-04-26T03:36:53Z,BuzzFeed News’ business model turned to dust because they were always at the whim of mercurial tech titans | James Hennessy,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/26/buzzfeed-news-business-model-turned-to-dust-because-they-were-always-at-the-whim-of-mercurial-tech-titans,"The announcement of the demise of BuzzFeed News last week felt unlike the cavalcade of media closures and layoffs of the past decade. In a sense, it represented the death of an entire era. BuzzFeed News, launched in 2011, imagined a format which would marry the intense virality and relentless social media focus of digital native publications with the serious reporting of major mastheads. The bet was that the site’s endless fountain of Harry Potter quizzes, viral news stories, celebrity gossip and pop culture gifs could subsidise a serious news operation, which would in turn lend real credibility to BuzzFeed as a whole. The timing was perfect. Legacy media, already shaky after the financial crisis, was increasingly finding itself at the mercy of Facebook and Google, who had reshaped content distribution and the ad industry in their favour. Digital-only upstarts such as BuzzFeed, Mashable and Business Insider had built themselves to take advantage of those same trends and had secured a dominant share of millennial eyeballs as a result. Suddenly, BuzzFeed News and a legion of imitators – buoyed by venture capital investment and the seemingly bottomless Facebook audience spigot – were making significant plays into the world of real news reporting; breaking stories left and right and adroitly packaging them for an extremely online audience. In those heady days, you could even imagine I Can Haz Cheeseburger opening a national security desk. It’s difficult to understate the panic BuzzFeed’s foray into hard news inaugurated among the media old guard. In 2014, The New York Times distributed a “dire” internal report sounding the warning bell about the paper’s struggles to adapt to journalism’s digital revolution, which mentioned BuzzFeed two dozen times. (True to form, the existence of this report was first detailed by BuzzFeed.) Even the most storied news brands found themselves following the BuzzFeed playbook for distribution. Even the NYT was doing listicles! Over the years, the cracks in BuzzFeed’s model started to show. The grand vision of a serious news organisation precariously balanced on top of a viral content shop was always a challenging one, and the company found it increasingly difficult to build a sustainable business. The venture capital injections weren’t enough, and it didn’t help that BuzzFeed’s advertisers were much happier to see their content run alongside the fun quizzes than, say, the Kevin Spacey exposé. Another problem was talent. While BuzzFeed served as an incubator for some incandescently skilled young reporters with both a keen eye for the online world and classic reporting chops, it became clear to the old publications that they could simply… poach them. And so they did: the past few years has seen a generation of wunderkinds graduate from the BuzzFeed News universe into the old-school news businesses it once planned to topple. But the bigger story here is one largely outside BuzzFeed’s control. It, alongside the tranche of other digital media startups of its era, threw in its lot vigorously with Facebook. It heartily embraced the new distribution model which had so frightened old-school publishers, surfing the waves of traffic generated by Facebook and other social apps such as Snapchat – which at one point evinced similar ambitions towards being a news platform. This worked extremely well right up until it didn’t. While Mark Zuckerberg once saw news content as an excellent way to juice Facebook’s platform credibility and user engagement, escalating scandals eventually turned it into a serious political liability. The axe came down. As the Warren Buffet saying goes: only when the tide goes out do you learn who has been swimming naked. BuzzFeed needed Facebook far more than Facebook needed BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed News is ultimately a casualty of that lopsided relationship. It never built a subscriptions business to account for the decline in social media traffic, and its model made less and less sense in an industry that was turning away from social media advertising dollars towards paywalls and good-old-fashioned direct monetary relationships with readers. It’s quite likely we will remember BuzzFeed News and its ilk not as the revolutionary disrupters of the industry they were once thought to be, but as a decade-long intermission to the whim of the famously mercurial tech titans who briefly offered them patronage. But that’s the nature of the news business. What BuzzFeed News did very successfully was change the way news was reported for the digital age, and it quite successfully bridged the gap between what was happening in real life and what was happening online. It helped train a generation of journalists who innately understood how those two worlds could speak to one another, and the reverberations of that understanding will be felt through the media for some time to come. That will be BuzzFeed News’ ultimate legacy, even as its business model turns to dust.

2022-09-10T05:00:06Z,British Gas owner plans to cap profits to cut energy bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/10/british-gas-cap-profits-cut-energy-bills-centrica-electricity,"British Gas owner Centrica plans to voluntarily cap booming profits in an effort to cut household bills and defuse outrage over them, the Guardian can reveal. The chief executive, Chris O’Shea, said he is keen for Centrica to become the “first company” to sign up to new, renegotiated contracts with the government on its electricity generation, amid controversy over windfall gains. As part of Liz Truss’s £150bn energy bills freeze, renewable and nuclear power generators will be asked to supply electricity below current market rates – but the new prime minister has refused to impose a windfall tax on them. Ministers plan to “negotiate” with generators on older wind, solar and nuclear contracts, which have benefited from windfall gains as the price of gas has soared, to persuade them to switch to newer, less lucrative deals, which lock in lower prices in return for guaranteed long-term income. As well as being the UK’s biggest supplier of gas and electricity to households via British Gas, Centrica is also a big generator via its 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear power stations. O’Shea said Centrica is willing to switch the five nuclear plants to the new-style contracts. He said he was even prepared to draw up long-term contracts with the government for Centrica’s North Sea gas fields, which are not covered by the initiative and have already been subject to the windfall tax announced earlier this year by the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. North Sea oil and gas extraction does not currently receive subsidies. O’Shea said he had discussed the idea, backed by industry body Energy UK, with the government and talks are ongoing. “We are in this business for the long term. We’re not in this business to maximise our profit this year,” he said. Energy firms have supported the “contracts for difference” (CfD) proposals, which give investors certainty over the levels of returns they can receive, potentially years after the energy crisis has abated. However, the Resolution Foundation has warned that the policy risked “delaying but locking in” windfall gains. There are concerns that the government negotiating team, led by the former head of the vaccines taskforce, Madelaine McTernan, is in a weak position as it will need to convince generators to forgo high short-term prices. O’Shea declined to say what proportion of its profits he was prepared to relinquish or how much the company hopes to receive from government. He told the Guardian: “Sometimes if you go to the government and propose you take a lower price they look at you like there must be something else in it for you. “We are obviously in this business to create value for all of our stakeholders, customers, country [and] colleagues. But it’s not about maximising this year’s profits; it’s about having a long-term sustainable business. “We supply more than 8m homes and businesses in the UK with energy – if they can’t afford their energy, we don’t have a sustainable business. And so when you think about this holistically … if we put something like a CfD regime in place for existing assets then, God forbid, if this ever happens again and we see prices go where they go, there’s an automatic adjustment mechanism.” O’Shea said the “risky” nature of commodity markets can hang over investments. “If you put a floor on the price that can be achieved, you eliminate a huge amount of the risks,” he added. Centrica holds its 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear fleet through a joint venture with France’s EDF, which is also understood to be supportive of the proposals. The scale of the windfall from surging gas prices was underlined in July when Centrica reported first-half operating profits of £1.3bn and handed £59m to shareholders. The company said it had seen an 11% gain in volumes of nuclear power generated in the first half of 2022. It said the price achieved for nuclear power had risen from £46.5 a megawatt hour in 2021 to £110.4/MWh. The company posted a surge in half-year profits from the division containing its exploration and production, and nuclear operations – reaching £906m, up from £75m. O’Shea said that alternative suggestions to cap wholesale gas prices could “distort the market massively and have perverse consequences”. Asked if he was backing the CfD proposal to fend off a potential windfall tax, O’Shea responded: “A windfall tax by its nature is a one-off. It doesn’t fix the structure of the market. We’re trying to solve the same issue in a way that’s sustainable.” Last month British Gas announced it will donate 10% of its profits to help its poorer customers manage rising gas and electricity bills for the “duration of the energy crisis”.",Centrica; Energy industry; Utilities; UK cost of living crisis; Economics; Business; Politics; UK news; Oil; Commodities; Nuclear power; Environment; Energy,Business
2022-11-24T07:04:13Z,Menulog cuts jobs in Australia a week after rival Deliveroo shuts down,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/24/menulog-cuts-jobs-in-australia-a-week-after-rival-deliveroo-shuts-down,"Food delivery company Menulog has announced job cuts just a week after rival Deliveroo went into administration in Australia, and grocery delivery company Voly shut down. A spokesperson for Menulog said that, as part of a global restructure of parent company Just Eat Takeaway.com’s customer operations team, the company had made structural changes to “correct the ratio of managers and support roles to advisers. “Over time, due to factors like growth, natural attrition and technology improvements, there has been a gradual skew towards the number of management and support roles in the team,” the spokesperson said. “To ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible, we have taken the difficult decision to reduce the number of those management and support roles.” The spokesperson did not say how many were affected, but said it was a “small number of roles” locally. Those affected would be provided assistance with redeployment options, securing future employment and “generous redundancy provisions”, the spokesperson said. “We have the scale to continue to maintain a strong position in the market and to run a sustainable business.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Menulog was bought out by then UK-owned Just Eat in 2015, and is now part of the Dutch-owned Just Eat Takeaway.com. The parent company reported in October that a 10% decline in third-quarter growth for the Southern Europe and ANZ region could be attributed to “significant Covid-19 restrictions in Australia”. According to multiple surveys, Uber Eats dominates the delivery app market in Australia. A CBRE-commissioned report in 2020 suggested Uber Eats held up to 59.7% of the market share, followed by Deliveroo at 17.5% and Menulog at 12.1%. Menulog has marketed itself in Australia and abroad with “Did Somebody Say” jingles performed by Snoop Dogg and most recently Katy Perry. It comes just a week after Deliveroo went into voluntary administration in Australia, citing tough economic conditions. The company immediately shut down ordering in the app, shocking both riders and customers. Sydney-based grocery delivery company Voly last week announced it had shut down, also citing the current economic conditions. Menulog announced it would honour Deliveroo vouchers and set up a dedicated email address for Deliveroo riders to apply for work with the company. Menulog, along with Uber, has been at the forefront of pushing for regulation for working conditions for its delivery riders in Australia. Menulog announced in April last year it would make its delivery riders full employees, rather than contractors, which would entitle them to award wages and other protections that gig workers do not have. The company sought for the Fair Work Commission to create an “on demand” industry award specifically for its delivery riders, but the FWC commission ruled in January this year that the Road Transport Award – which applies to truck drivers – would apply to delivery riders. The decision was welcomed by the Transport Workers’ Union.",Business; Gig economy; Australia news; Deliveroo; Industrial relations,Australia news
2023-05-08T07:00:44Z,Manchester City’s history shows there never was a golden age of ownership | Nicholas Blincoe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/may/08/manchester-city-ownership-qatar-abu-dhabi,"It’s an exhilarating time to be a Manchester City fan, though I am muting my optimism with a selection of the most miserabilist chants ever heard in a football stadium. “We’re not really here”; “Empty seats at home”; and “Spent all my money on drugs and City”. City’s rise has been so rapid that the fans are still very Mancunian, and perhaps less familiar than followers of other big teams. Yet they resemble other fans in their obsessive scrutiny of every aspect of the team, from the pitch, to the training field, to the corporate decisions. The idea that City fans ignore the importance of the club’s ownership in our success – even an “elephant in the room” – is far from the mark. My own fan story sounds unusual, though I suspect it isn’t. I released a hip-hop 12-inch on Factory in the late 1980s, and became a City supporter under the infectious enthusiasm of A&amp;R man Mike Pickering and co‑founder Rob Gretton. I was in my 20s, which is late to adopt a team, but I was living close to Maine Road, and the team embodied ideals that I appreciated: fun in adversity, jangling nerves and comic timing. By 2002, I was living in the Middle East and feeling homesick. I began to follow City more obsessively, as a bizarre soap opera. This was the era when Stuart Pearce was manager, the owner was Thailand’s fugitive politician Thaksin Shinawatra, and the agent with the most formidable reputation was Richard Dunne’s wife, Helen. In 2003, Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea, followed in 2007 by Alisher Usmanov buying into Arsenal. The two men are political figures in Russia, sanctioned over their links to Vladimir Putin. It is essential to scrutinise powerful billionaires who are using their resources to change life in Britain. If we focus more keenly on Arab princes than we did on Russian oligarchs, at least we are now starting to ask questions. I only object when Gulf Arabs are bundled together as though their ownership model, their strategic aims, their countries, and even the people themselves are interchangeable. City are owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a key figure in Abu Dhabi, the leading principality in the seven-strong federation, the United Arab Emirates. Mansour is the fifth son of Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi, known as “Mother of the Sheikhs” since her six sons gained ascendancy over Abu Dhabi 20 years ago. Mansour is the chief adviser to his oldest brother, the UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, acting as both his vice-president and deputy prime minister (by convention, the UAE prime minister is the leader of Dubai). In common with other principalities, such as Monaco, Abu Dhabi is an autocracy. The larger UAE federation is a complex power negotiation between multiple aristocratic stakeholders, governed by both a constitution and by clannish conventions. In this highly politicised environment, Mansour has earned a formidable reputation as a politician and business strategist. Abu Dhabi has the third richest state fund in the world but, unlike Qatar’s ownership of Paris Saint-Germain or Saudi Arabia’s holdings in Newcastle, City are not owned by the state. Given Mansour’s profile in Abu Dhabi, it is reasonable to ask if he has used his leverage to reach sweetheart deals and supercharge City’s rise. Yet no one thinks the City project is about burning money with no regard to profitability: it is that most modern of business propositions, a disruptive start-up. If Manchester City is an example of sportswashing then the image is one of swaggering sports scientists and Harvard MBAs. However, to see evidence of a ruthless or cold business strategy in the football on the pitch is like a Victorian novelist reading a character’s psychology in the weather. It’s a projection. There is an aesthetic difference between, say, Alex Ferguson’s United and Pep Guardiola’s City, but it is style rather than politics, as when the oily sweat of the rockers gave way to the sleek cool of the mods. City’s management team has been open in their ambition to create a global entertainment product, and global ambitions require faith in a rules-based order. How else can one sell a highly codified sport in multiple markets? If City are found guilty of subverting the rules to supercharge the project, this is cynical – the “cake-and-eat-it” attitude of a corporation emboldened by an army of lawyers. The larger issue is whether you think Disney or Sony is the right model for football, and if the result will be the end of competition in the English leagues. If not, a clear-eyed analysis is the first step to tackling the issues. If the Premier League is turned into a heavily handicapped product like F1 to ensure competitiveness, would anyone bet against a well-run City continuing to win? Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia have significantly different histories, as well as different visions of their futures. Qatar has not yet shown any interest in football as a sustainable business, and adding value is not the key reason that Saudi Arabia has bought into Newcastle. Saudi Arabia’s embrace of the beautiful sport looks the closest to classic sportswashing, though not directly to disguise political violence at home and abroad. Since its creation, Saudi Arabia’s whole foreign policy has been to spread a dogmatic version of Islam, which has become a problem for the regime and its allies. Football signals a shift to modernisation, without actually liberalising much at all. Qatar has a different problem. It walks a line between two hostile and powerful states, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and has used football to raise its diplomatic profile. Football acts as an insurance policy for Qatar. Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani probably does love Manchester United. Because Qatar is already using football as a tool of foreign policy, it looks unlikely that Jassim could run United independently, not least because Jassim’s father was the architect of Qatar’s unique third way when he served as the country’s prime minister. With a fresh round of charges against City, the latest terrace chant, “We’ll cheat when we want to”, is fun to sing, if not big or mature. City might be sanctioned for dishonesty, but fans have seen the club fall faster and harder through poor management and bad football. City’s history shows there never was a golden age of ownership. Sanctions would be a judgment on the leadership team: let’s steer clear of the idea it’s a judgment on countries and their culture. • Nicholas Blincoe is the author of More Noble Than War: the Story of Football in Israel and Palestine.",Manchester City; United Arab Emirates; Sheikh Mansour; Football; Middle East and north Africa; Sport,Football
2023-04-29T06:00:28Z,Firm releases almost 800kg of ‘forever chemical’ a year into Lancashire river,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/29/pfas-forever-chemical-river-wyre-lancashire-environment-agency,"A chemicals company is releasing large quantities of a “forever chemical” described as being “very persistent, mobile and toxic” into the River Wyre in Lancashire each year, and is not breaking any rules. Earlier this year, the Guardian and Watershed Investigations revealed that effluent coming from the site of AGC Chemicals Europe in Thornton-Cleveleys could contain about 700 types of perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS is an umbrella term for thousands of human-made substances known as “forever chemicals” because they will not break down in the environment for thousands of years. Some are also known to be toxic and can accumulate in the human body. The Environment Agency has now released its evaluation of a PFAS known as EEA-NH4 that was found in the effluent, and said it was “very persistent” and “mobile” in the environment, as well as “toxic” because it was classified as “reprotoxic category 2”, meaning there was evidence to suggest it could disrupt sexual function, fertility and development in humans. Using data supplied by AGC Chemicals Europe, including monitoring data and effluent volumes released into the River Wyre, the agency estimated that an average of about 783kg of EEA-NH4 is discharged into the river each year. The report highlights multiple gaps in knowledge, including whether, as with many PFAS, the substance builds up in humans and animals. “It is not possible to draw a conclusion on the bioaccumulation potential of EEA-NH4 in air-breathing organisms in the absence of data on the human clearance time or better predictive methods,” it states. Prof Ian Cousins, an environmental chemist at Stockholm University, said: “EEA-NH4 is very persistent and mobile similar to GenX used by Chemours, which has been found in the Arctic, and it’s likely that EEA-NH4 will also be measured there as emissions continue. It will be transported by ocean currents, but even air emissions can result in long-range atmospheric transport.” Dr David Megson, a senior lecturer in chemistry and environmental forensics at Manchester Metropolitan University, said the case highlighted “how we desperately need improved regulation and management of PFAS. “Industry continues to innovate and develop new PFAS to replace those that have been banned. However, tougher regulations need to be put in place to ensure that these replacement chemicals are not also going to pose a risk to the environment and human health. “This should not be at the detriment to industry, but we should use it as an opportunity for collaboration to develop safer sustainable replacements for PFAS.” EEA-NH4 is just one of more than 10,000 chemicals classed as PFAS and currently there are only restrictions on the manufacture and use of two – perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – because they have been studied closely and linked with a range of diseases including cancers and thyroid problems. AGC Chemicals Europe, which produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), said it “has never used PFOS, and PFOA was voluntarily phased out over a decade ago”. In 2022, Watershed Investigations found discharges of 12,000 nanograms a litre of PFOA to the Wyre estuary coming from the site where AGC Chemicals is based. AGC said it did not use or manufacture PFOA, and that any PFOA in the effluent may have come from historical usage at the site. AGC’s discharge is not illegal. Studies have also shown that some PFAS can disrupt normal reproductive function in women through altering hormone secretion, the menstrual cycle, and fertility, but any effects of the emissions of thousands of other PFAS remain a mystery. Cousins said: “We know little about the consequences of the releases of the hundreds of other PFAS because we only understand the toxicities, and other properties, of a few PFAS.” A spokesperson for AGC Chemicals Europe said the company was in “full compliance with UK and EU regulations” and that it “sets the highest standards for itself as a responsible member of the local community and a sustainable business. We welcome recent assessments by the Environment Agency to protect and improve the environment and, as part of this, to address the uses of PFAS in the UK.” They said the “evaluations conducted by the Environment Agency do not indicate that the substances used in our manufacturing processes have caused environmental harm. Ecological monitoring of the River Wyre which has been conducted for over 40 years shows no significant impact of AGC Chemicals Europe emissions to the River Wyre estuary. “We take our responsibilities for the management of substances used in and emitted from our manufacturing process extremely seriously. We are actively developing and improving processes that save energy and further reduce emissions from our process. AGC Chemicals Europe has invested significantly in abatement equipment to minimise emissions and we have committed additional investment to further reduce emissions by the end of 2024.” The company said the “fluoropolymers manufactured by AGC Chemicals Europe have unique properties which cannot be replicated by other compounds, making them essential for applications across the UK, European and global markets that contribute to sustainability including use in renewable and alternative energies, electric vehicles and medical applications”. The spokesperson added that AGC Chemicals Europe “continues to work closely with the Environment Agency to ensure regular assessment of the substances we use”. A spokesperson for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency said: “Since the 2000s, we have increased monitoring and either banned or highly restricted a number of PFAS both domestically and internationally. We are continuing to work with regulators to further understand the risks of PFAS and implement measures to address them. The Environment Agency is working with AGC Chemicals to further understand potential concerns about the presence of EEA-NH4 in the environment so that appropriate action can be taken.” Earlier this month, the Health and Safety Executive recommended that PFAS emissions be cut by developing restrictions under the chemicals regulatory regime known as UK Reach, as well as setting legal limits for PFAS in drinking water. The government said it has accepted the findings. In the EU, the European Chemicals Agency is considering a proposal by Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden to restrict the manufacture and use of about 10,000 PFAS in an effort to regulate them as a class, reduce emissions and make products safer.",Pfas; Environment; Rivers; Pollution; Water; Lancashire; UK news,Environment
2022-10-03T23:01:19Z,John Lewis plans ‘buy back or take back’ schemes in all product categories by 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/04/john-lewis-plans-buy-back-or-take-back-schemes-in-all-product-categories-by-2025,"John Lewis has pledged to have “buy back or take back” schemes operating in every product category by 2025 and to develop more rental and resale options as it steps up efforts to be a more sustainable business. The group, which runs Waitrose supermarkets as well as a string of department stores, will also invest £2m over the next five years to restore and protect nature in Norfolk, a key source of meat, cereal and vegetable products, and in India’s Noyyal and Bhavani river basins, where it sources cotton, under a partnership with the wildlife charity WWF. The company will encourage regeneration of species such as water vole, grey partridge and lapwing at its own farm, Leckford in Hampshire, where it will also aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural processes to net zero by 2024. That effort is part of an aim to be net zero from all the UK farms in its supply base by 2035. The initiatives are part of a series of new pledges for the group, which says it wants to be “bolder in protecting and restoring nature”. Marija Rompani, the director of ethics and sustainability at John Lewis, said: “Delaying action is simply not an option. “We all know that we can’t exist without nature; it is essential for our survival and it will play a vital role in solving the problem of climate change. We can’t solve one without the other, the crises of nature loss and climate change are inextricably linked. “Whether it’s eliminating fossil fuel use across our transport operations, investing millions in conservation projects in regions where we source our products, or helping our farmers make the transition to net zero, we are acting where we can make the biggest impact.” David Edwards, the director of food strategy at WWF, said the UK was in the bottom 10% of countries globally for the abundance of nature and one of the main reasons for that was the way we produce food. “One of our ambitions with the John Lewis Partnership is to scale up regenerative, nature-friendly agricultural approaches in one of the UK’s most intensively farmed landscapes and use our learnings to inspire change across the food sector,” he said. John Lewis has already experimented with renting out furniture in partnership with the third party Fat Llama as well as renting out or buying back clothing and giving discounts to those who bring back beauty packaging.

2023-11-23T06:53:21Z,Thursday briefing: What the meltdown at OpenAI means for the future of artificial intelligence,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/23/first-edition-openai-sam-altman,"Good morning. Boardroom coups are always pretty absorbing; a boardroom coup at a company that has set itself the lofty goal of “building artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is safe and benefits all of humanity” is more absorbing still. The removal of chief executive Sam Altman from OpenAI, which made the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, has therefore been the subject of breathless attention since it was announced last Friday. Now Altman has got his job back, and there’s even more to get your head around. The OpenAI story is a classic boardroom drama – but it’s much more than that. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to technology journalist Chris Stokel-Walker, author of a forthcoming book, How AI Ate The World, about why Altman was forced out, why he came back, and what the saga tells us about who gets to shape the future. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Hamas war | Israeli officials have said a four-day Gaza truce and hostage release will not start until at least Friday, stalling a breakthrough deal to pause the bloody seven-week-old war and thwarting the hopes of families that some captives would be freed on Thursday. Autumn statement | Jeremy Hunt sought to blunt the impact of the highest levels of taxation since the second world war with a cut in workers’ national insurance contributions, fuelling speculation about a snap spring general election. The chancellor used a fresh squeeze on public spending to pay for a reduction in NICs worth £450 a year to the average employee. See the key points and what it means for you. Netherlands | Geert Wilders’ far-right, anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) is on course to be the largest party in the Dutch parliament, according to exit polls, in a major electoral upset whose reverberations will be felt around Europe. The PVV was predicted to win 35 seats in the 150-seat parliament, but may not be able to form a governing coalition. Covid inquiry | Prof Sir Jonathan Van-Tam and his family were advised by police to move out of their home during the pandemic because of a threat that they would have their throats cut, he has told the Covid inquiry. Van-Tam said that he feared the scale of such abuse would put people off taking up similar roles in the future. US and Canada | Four border crossings between the US and Canada were closed on Wednesday after a vehicle exploded at a checkpoint on a bridge near Niagara Falls, reportedly killing two people. Governor of New York Kathy Hochul said there was “no indication of a terrorist attack”. In depth: ‘OpenAI is essentially Sam Altman now, through the messianic following he’s engendered’ Here’s what just happened, sorry for the long paragraph: On Friday, Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the board of OpenAI because he had not been “consistently candid in his communications”, and chief technology officer Mira Murati was named as interim chief executive. On Sunday, amid widespread dismay among staff and investors, Altman and a group of allies held hours-long negotiations over his possible return, but by the end of the day, a new permanent chief executive, Emmett Shear, had been appointed. On Monday, Altman was hired to run a new AI unit at Microsoft – which owns 49% of OpenAI. Meanwhile, staff wrote an open letter to the OpenAI board saying that they would quit and join Altman at Microsoft unless he was reinstated; ultimately, about 750 of 770 staff signed. Late on Tuesday night US time, Altman was reinstated, his opponents on the board were replaced, and Microsoft said it was happy with the outcome. And yesterday, ousted board member Helen Toner said: “We all get some sleep.” Here’s what all that means, and whether or not you should be any more worried about being squished by a computer than you were a week ago. *** What made OpenAI different The exact nature of Altman’s alleged lack of candour has not been made public, but reporting in the days since he got the boot suggests that it came down to a fundamental feature of OpenAI’s corporate structure, almost unique among its peers: it has a nonprofit board – tasked with ensuring the company develops AI for the benefit of humanity above its investors – in charge of a for-profit company. (Those profits are still capped, though, at 100 times the initial stake for first-round investors; any excess goes back into the nonprofit.) Altman is one of those who designed the set-up that ousted him. In theory, it should have preserved the idealistic intentions of the company’s origins as a research lab while allowing the dizzying investment needed for any major AI player. Still, that balance is an expression of a fundamental tension in AI: how do you develop a world-changing technology at a competitive pace while mitigating the risks that the profit motive is bound to entail? In practice, though, Altman’s removal suggests the limits of that model. “Having a check and a balance on the for-profit side isn’t necessarily impossible, but it has been so dysfunctional that it just didn’t work,” said Chris Stokel-Walker. “If you want to compete, you have to go into the market for investment, and that is going to shape how you think about things. You might want to develop a slow-moving, carefully crafted company that is focused on safety, but if a massive investor says that it needs something from that, do you have the spine to say no?” *** The ‘great man’ problem However stupidly, tech companies are often reduced to the influence of a single wunderkind (Jobs, Zuckerberg, Musk, Alan Sugar). The problem for the board of OpenAI was that it failed to recognise something that seemed pretty obvious to everyone else: Altman was one of those guys, and the company was worthless without him. There are good reasons to question whether that should be true, or whether anyone should be treating OpenAI’s fate as a big deal anyway. As Max Read points out, it is “one of many A.I. companies working on fundamentally similar technologies” whose transformative potential is yet to be realised; Altman himself “has never demonstrated a particular talent or vision for running a sustainable business”. Even so, he comes out of the week far more powerful than he went into it. “It turns out that OpenAI is essentially Sam Altman now – we’ve seen that through the messianic following he’s managed to engender among his employees,” Chris said. “Silicon Valley is obsessed with troubled geniuses. The problem of a lot of the discussion of what happened is that it inevitably lionises this idea of a single, invariably male, godlike figure who can make the weather and dictate every big decision. And so you have the psychodrama of the interpersonal conflicts, but much more fundamental questions get overlooked.” *** The risks of AI and managing them You will be familiar with the darkest fear about artificial intelligence, the sort of thing you briefly contemplate over breakfast before choosing to focus on your muesli: the idea that it could ultimately be powerful and uncontrollable enough to pose an existential threat to humanity, and enslave or make mincemeat of us all. The most apocalyptic versions of that concern are, in truth, “a very niche belief within the industry”, Chris said – but there are many ways that the technology could cause harm that fall short of humanity’s extinction, from ubiquitous misinformation to the hollowing out of industries that employ millions. One urgent concern, Chris said, “is that AI is already trained on biased data – on the majority of the internet which is English language, middle class, male, from economically developed countries”. Altman himself has been cautious in the past about some of the risks – one of the reasons his company is set up the way it is. OpenAI now looks like evidence of how difficult it is to keep guardrails in place even at a company notionally devoted to their maintenance. Meanwhile, Meta just broke up its “Responsible AI” team. *** What OpenAI and the industry look like today It’s pretty hard to imagine a more bungled boardroom coup than the one that ultimately saw Altman back in his job, and more secure in it than ever. The composition of the new board suggests it is likely to be more focused on the company’s business interests, and less preoccupied with safety concerns, though its members are governed by the same nominal “humanity over investors” rules as their predecessors. “But the barrier to intervening again is very high,” Chris said. “I doubt we’re going to see another coup in a week.” AI will keep trucking on and keep freaking everyone out whether or not OpenAI succeeds. Even if the company’s fate is mostly a matter of significance to the people invested in it, though, there are wider implications. “OpenAI’s board got almost everything wrong,” Platformer’s Casey Newton notes, “but they were right to worry about the terms on which we build the future, and I suspect it will now be a long time before anyone else in this industry attempts anything other than the path of least resistance.” --- To keep up to date with all the latest developments in the AI apocalypse sign up here to our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.

The front pages “Hunt reveals £20bn in tax cuts as Tories move on to election footing” – so runs the Guardian front-page splash headline this morning. “We’ve delivered on triple lock to protect you” is the message to pensioners, says the Daily Express. “Hunt eases tax burden” says the Times. The Daily Telegraph hails the “Biggest tax cuts since the 1980s” and the Daily Mail uses the same words, thought it follows up thusly: “But with total burden still vast … Let’s hope it’s just the start!”. Others scratch the surface a bit harder. “Tax burden to hit record high despite 2p cut for millions” – that’s the i while the Financial Times has “Tax burden surges despite Hunt cuts”. The Daily Mirror is not at all entertained, calling it all “swizz”: “Do they take us all for fools?” It mounts the argument that millions will be worse off. The Sun bigs up the tax cut – “New year’s wahey!” – then adds in much finer print: “But taxes will still be highest since WW2”. “Happy NI year” –that’s the Metro, and the NI stands for national insurance, in case you wondered.

2023-06-18T13:00:43Z,Why no choice is a good choice: the return of the tasting menu,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/18/why-no-choice-is-a-good-choice-the-return-of-the-tasting-menu,"Few things divide opinion in the restaurant world like the tasting menu. Over the past 20 years, this extended format has both accumulated cachet as a signifier of culinary ambition and attracted relentless dyspeptic criticism. In 2012, the New York Times’s restaurant critic, Pete Wells, was feeling “trapped, helpless” in the face of “marathon” meals. Last year, Tim Hayward in the Financial Times was still bewailing this “exhausting to-do list of knackered cliches” – despite the tasting menu repeatedly being declared dead in the intervening years. Street food, small plates and casual dining had reportedly consigned it to the food recycling bin of history. But then Brexit happened, Covid hit and Russia invaded Ukraine. Buffeted by soaring energy, food and staff costs, chef-owners have begun to reexamine the financial stability that tasting menus offer. To the extent, reports dismayed Observer restaurant critic Jay Rayner, that they are now “ubiquitous in certain places. In Edinburgh, it seems the default for a restaurant of any ambition is a tasting menu.” “There’s some bad branding around the phrase ‘tasting menu’,” notes Chet Sharma, who pointedly serves a “chef’s selection” menu of seven core courses plus additional snacks and surprises at London’s BiBi. The tasting menu comes with baggage: notions of dictatorial, egomaniac chefs, pompous staff and conspicuous consumption in hushed dining rooms. The new wave is keen to distance itself from all that by being more relaxed, with no-choice menus often shorter and more affordable. The motivation is efficiency rather than exclusivity. In Cambridge, Alex Rushmer’s Vanderlyle operates with two chefs in the kitchen who create a meat-free £75 menu of about nine courses for 26 people. Diners pre-pay and, with dishes and guest numbers settled, Rushmer can order precisely the ingredients he needs, cutting prep time and the costly food waste associated with a la carte menus. Creating a sustainable business, says Rushmer, who opened Vanderlyle in 2019, is about removing variables: “Chiefly, not knowing how many people are coming and what they’re going to order.” In December, Edinburgh’s Eleanore moved from a small plates menu to a set £55 menu consisting of seven dishes served over five courses, with optional extras. Owner Roberta Hall-McCarron wouldn’t call it a tasting menu. That sounds too grand. Eleanore is small and casual. But “it was the best option to not waste money and time”. The menu requires one less chef per shift, and those chefs work fewer hours. “The hours are a big thing,” says Josh Overington, who later this month opens Myse in Hovingham, Yorkshire. “If you’re going to do four days a week, as I am, [a tasting menu] is easier to organise. It has a million benefits.” Arguably, it also benefits diners. Launched last September, BiBi’s £125 dinner menu is expensive. But crazy as it may sound, says Sharma, it was introduced to provide value. In London, he argues, you can easily spend £70 or £80 a head on fairly average food, whereas BiBi’s food (“complex enough to sit alongside the most complex dishes in the country”) aims to provide far greater bang for your buck. BiBi’s chefs are not wasting hours of costly labour “prepping ingredients that aren’t sold”. They are focused on perfecting a streamlined number of dishes. This helps Sharma keep tight control of his fluctuating food costs, and enables him to flexibly gild dishes: “Let’s add morels to this dish, for example”, when prices allow. Value for money in restaurants is always subjective. But if you can afford the initial outlay, it is notable how keenly priced many tasting menus are. Wimbledon’s Black Lamb serves a £48 menu of five courses plus snacks. It increases guaranteed spend, says co-owner Richard Gladwin, “but offers better value than ordering five à la carte courses. It’s win-win for guest and restaurant.” Historically, tasting menus were often offered on a take it or leave it, full menu basis. Shorter menus are now common, even in restaurants with established national reputations: five courses at Kent’s Michelin-starred Hide &amp; Fox, £75; the new six-course £60 menu at Leeds’s The Man Behind the Curtain; a bargain £35 five-course tasting lunch at Sheffield’s Jöro. In a sign of the less rigid times, New York’s three-Michelin-star Eleven Madison Park has introduced a six-course menu, albeit priced at $285. Interestingly, BiBi still runs a lunch à la carte menu to simultaneously “provide a more accessible experience to guests, especially regulars”, says Sharma. At Manchester’s Higher Ground, Joseph Otway serves an à la carte menu and a seven-course “chef’s choice” menu. Priced at £45, it usefully absorbs ingredients he has too much or too little of, short shelf-life produce, and parts of the whole animal carcasses he buys in, all of which assists him in managing costs. The tasting menu benefits Otway and diners, with half of his customers choosing it. “It’s the best value we can offer, and the best way to show a curated snippet of everything we’re about.” Rayner would probably still go à la carte. He fully understands the “logistical attractions” for restaurants. He knows it is ludicrous to complain about tasting menus. “But my heart falls at being told I have to spend £90, £110, to sit through a menu of varying quality. Dishes tend to be small and intense, and when something comes along you do like, you ain’t got much of it. I find them exhausting.” Not choosing your dinner, says Rayner, strips “a certain joy out of going for a meal”. Chefs see it differently. “Conducting the kitchen, if everybody is on the same menu, you’re more in control,” says Sharma. “Great for us but also for overall guest experience.” Rushmer is not “maniacally controlling”. He doesn’t want to deny diners their freedom. Instead, he is trying to eradicate unexpected problems that prevent chefs producing their best work, particularly in the white heat of service. Angelo Sato goes further, asking guests to really lean into the experience. This year, his Soho venue, Humble Chicken, switched from being a high-end yakitori grill to a “theatrical” £125 tasting menu during which “there’s not really a still moment”. Sato had always dreamed of creating “a start-to-finish experience for diners, where you can really dictate how you want them to feel, eat and everything in between”. The change had a financial rationale. “If you’re putting so much work into the food, you have to dictate a price-point. You can’t have people take up two seats on a Saturday night for two hours and spend 50 quid each.” But, primarily, this was about Sato fulfilling himself creatively. “If you’re not in love with it,” he says, “there’s no point.” Do chefs deserve to be happy in their work? For Rushmer, that was a “massive part” of opting for a tasting menu. It gives him more time and “creative energy” to do what he really enjoys, developing his vegetable-led cookery. These days, chefs have options. There are plenty of well-paid vacancies out there. They are in demand. Consequently, those who choose the more challenging path of working independently are prioritising their happiness. Were Overington to cook à la carte at Myse “the kitchen would go down so quickly it’d be an embarrassment”. Its £110 tasting menu will allow him to produce consistent food in a comfortable manner. He sold two successful York restaurants to launch this venture. “I believe, in a business sense, not just creatively, it’s going to work. If I then do things I don’t want to because I’m worried Mr and Mrs Smith might complain, it’s stupid. Life’s short. You need to do things you enjoy.” That cuts both ways. Diners need to enjoy tasting menus and, to facilitate that, the vibe (very much the correct word) in such restaurants is increasingly informal, chatty and overlaid with cool music. “We take our food seriously,” says Sharma. “But you can’t take us too seriously. How am I going to tell you this is a hallowed hall of dining when NWA’s Fuck tha Police is playing in the background?” The New York Times recently hailed US chefs likewise serving tasting menus “with lower price points and less attitude … finding fun in the once stuffy form”. Fine dining’s fussier habits – long expositions on the chef’s philosophy; constant interruptions to refold napkins or de-crumb tables; extravagant decanting of wines – are now deeply uncool. Rushmer will happily answer diners’ foodier questions but allows them to lead that conversation. Rather than “reverently list the provenance of every turnip”, descriptions of dishes are brief. There is a tension in balancing a relaxed atmosphere with the desire to communicate the detailed, often idealistic work undertaken in such restaurants. Myse will be a celebration of niche British produce. That story will be woven into the experience, says Overington, with, for example, some uncooked produce shown to tables first. “You need a bit of theatre to make it exciting,” he argues, in contrast to tasting menus that “last hours, just a boring list of different dishes. People sat in silence. Like an exam.” Overington wants Myse to be fun while acknowledging it will not be for everyone. “What we do isn’t sustenance, it’s experiential,” says Rushmer. “That’s not how people can, should or want to eat every meal.” No one is campaigning for compulsory tasting menus.

2023-10-21T08:00:41Z,"Shrinkflation: you’re right, from gin to butter, quantity and quality are taking a hit",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/21/shrinkflation-youre-right-from-gin-to-butter-quantity-and-quality-are-taking-a-hit,"You take the spreadable butter out of the fridge and put it on your bagel; you are sure it is more watery than it used to be. You pick up the bagel and some filling falls out – is the hole bigger? The coffee seems to have run out again, so you seriously consider a stiff drink but your gin seems to have less kick than it used to. After you’ve eaten, you wash your hands – the bar doesn’t seem as big and there’s less lather – and then you squeeze out the last toothpaste from a tube you’re sure used to last longer. You wonder: is everything a bit worse than it used to be? The answer, sadly, is yes. Shrinkflation and its sister skimpflation have hit many of the items in your shopping basket as rampant inflation in the cost of ingredients, energy and staff has forced manufacturers to take steps to keep prices down. Having already put up the shelf prices of the goods, they have started reformulating recipes and shaving pack sizes. If you took your shopping trolley from two years ago and compared it with today’s, you would find you are paying more for less. While many of us will have encountered this with the odd product, you may not have quite realised just how many of the things we buy have been shrunk, watered down or generally made not as good as before. Mark Jones, a partner and food and drink expert at the law firm Gordons, says shrinkflation is not a new phenomenon, and that between 2012 and 2017 the Office for National Statistics found 2,529 products had been reduced in size. “While we have not had updated shrinkflation data from the ONS since 2017, the trend has continued, with bread and cereals, personal care, meat and confectionery being the areas where the practice is most prevalent,” he says. But, he adds, recipe changes are a new trend and are “almost impossible to spot, unless you pore over the ingredient quantities in the products you purchase, which consumers just don’t do”. Guardian readers have noticed: when we asked you for examples, we were inundated with tales of products that don’t go as far as they used to, and packs that seem half-empty when you open them. From butter to dog food via the contents of your bathroom cabinet, it’s all changed. Manufacturers and retailers say the reductions are designed to help consumers by allowing them to sell them at the same price. But from our call-out, it is clear that two things particularly bother people: often they liked the original pack size, and it suited their purposes; and they feel that the changes are being made sneakily. This is not only happening in the UK. In France, the supermarket chain Carrefour made headlines when it put signs on shelves alerting customers to shrinkflation in 26 products from big brands Recently the French government announced that there would be new rules to force manufacturers to make changes more obvious to consumers. After campaigning by the European group Foodwatch, ministers in France said that from November, labels should highlight changes. The group is campaigning across Europe for more transparency around changes. In the UK, consumer law says pack sizes must be indicated accurately and ingredients lists must be correct but there are no rules saying retailers or manufacturers must highlight changes. Alex Lawrence, a senior strategic insight director at Circana, a consultancy that advises retailers and manufacturers on consumer behaviour, says that while shoppers may feel shrinkflation is “a bit underhand”, as long as they look at the unit price and compare, “they are not disadvantaged”. However, with skimpflation, he feels it is a different story and that manufacturers need to do more. “Shoppers have no way of knowing if the ingredients have changed without comparing old and new products, and, even then, they may have to go the product ingredients to work it out, which clearly isn’t fair on the shopper,” he says. “Where manufacturers make changes to product ingredients, they need to clearly call out the change as a new or reformulated product, with clear extra X% or less X% of ingredient Y.” Here are just some of the examples you sent in, and others we spotted. There were so many that we could have gone on … Alcoholic drinks A reader who compared two bottles of Tanqueray London Dry Gin spotted a difference in the alcohol level: “Present bottle almost empty, 43.1% ABV [alcohol by volume]. New bottle just bought, 41.3% – very sneaky!” The change, which happened in February, brought the alcohol volume in line with the rest of the Tanqueray range. By reducing the alcohol level, the maker, Diageo, also reduced the impact of new duties introduced on 1 August. Another reader is a regular purchaser of Co-op’s Fairtrade South African red wine. Last month he spotted that it had reduced in strength from 13% to 11%, with no change in price. “Except for that small detail, the label looks identical,” he said. Under the new rules, wines with between 11.5% and 14.5% ABV will temporarily be taxed as if they are 12.5% in strength, which would mean an extra 44p a bottle. A spokesperson for Co-op said the reduction was in response to the duty reforms. “We have lowered the ABV of this customer-favourited line to maintain the best possible value and price for our customers and members while ensuring quality wouldn’t be compromised,” they said. Bagels Pierre from London said: “I’ve noticed that the holes in the New York [Bakery Co] bagels are now consistently larger than before. The bagel diameter remains the same but the amount of bagel has gone down! Hazardous as lots of food now falls through the hole.” When Guardian Money looked into (or should that be through?) the hole, it found that while each bagel used to weigh approximately 90g, it is now 85g. However, the company denied the hole story. A spokesperson for New York Bakery Co said the weight had been reduced as a result of “ongoing inflationary costs”. They added: “This reduction has been done in a way that ensures there has been no compromise on quality or taste for our customers. The reduction of weight would not impact the size of the much-loved bagel hole.” Soap The Guardian reader Frazer spotted what has happened to bars of Simple soap: they used to be 125g each and have been reduced to 100g. Reviews on Tesco’s website show shoppers are cross about the cut, and a change in the formulation. One customer posted: “Not only has it been significantly reduced in size, but after a short period of time, it struggles to make a lather. It has gone from being one of the best soaps to one of the worst.” Close inspection of the ingredients shows that the second is now water, when previously that came third. Simple Soap said the change was made “to help manage increased expenses without compromising on quality”, and that it kept an eye on prices to make sure it remained competitive. It said the change in recipe was the result of move from tallow, an animal derived ingredient, to a vegetable-based soap suitable for vegans; with this change the order of the INCI altered slightly due to the chemistry involved. It is not the only bar that has shrunk. Wright’s coal tar soap has also dropped from 125g to 100g. Shoppers also report a reduction in the fragrance, although there is no evidence of any recipe change in the ingredients. Butter There are two changes that have particularly upset consumers: pack size reductions and reformulations of spreadable versions. Lurpak and Anchor used to be sold in 250g blocks but earlier this year they were cut to 200g. The 250g block was roughly equivalent to half a pound and was standard across the sector, so it is little wonder that shoppers have been caught out. Jane from Cambridge told us she had to shrink a birthday cake after she realised she had bought a smaller pack, while Peter Ryan from Wiltshire said he bought three packs of Anchor and “noticed nothing unusual until [I] opened one a couple of days later. Then [I] realised it was 200g rather than 250g. External appearance had seemed identical to its predecessors. But this was just ‘thinner’. No explanation accompanied it. No doubt a future version will be advertised as ‘new, bigger size’.” Fans of spreadable butter have been hit with shrinkage and, in some cases, reformulations. David Pritlove from the West Midlands buys Anchor spreadable and said he had recently bought “a 400g impostor masquerading as 500g. Crucially, and critically for this to work, the container is almost identical (except for an unnoticeable – unless compared side by side – small difference in tub height). The pack’s main facet, the lid, is identical to the 500g tub.” When Guardian Money looked at the small print, we realised that the ingredients had also changed, and that the volume of rapeseed oil has been reduced from 33% to 29%. Arla, which owns Lurpak and Anchor, told us the new pack sizes “were driven by research with over 2,500 shoppers. Our research showed that the 200g and 400g pack size and price points were the most appealing to a greater proportion of shoppers. This reduction in size allowed us to offer a better value pack to shoppers.” It said unit prices had fallen – this is true across the industry. The prices of feed, fertiliser and fuel have all edged downwards after huge increases after the coronavirus pandemic and around the start of the war in Ukraine. On recipe changes, the spokesperson said: “We are always looking for ways to improve our recipes and have developed a new recipe that delivers our great Anchor buttery taste in every bite, but has reduced our overall fat content, calories and saturated fat content, while maintaining our overall butter content.” Toothpaste Retailers who used to sell 100ml packs of some toothpastes are now offering 75ml packs at the same price. Helen York in East Lothian told us this was the case with the Colgate she bought at Aldi. She “only realised it had shrunk when I came to open it … I really hate getting proportionately more packaging, especially as the tube doesn’t recycle, and would rather pay more for the full size, but they are not to be found any more.” The same has happened at Tesco, where Colgate Triple Action toothpaste was 98p for 100ml but is now 98p for 75ml. Guardian Money found several examples of Colgate variants that have been changed, as well as some Oral B products. Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Oral B, declined to comment but said it does still make the larger pack sizes. Coffee Like butter, the standard size of a pack of ground coffee has a long history. It was sold by the pound, and the 227g pack was as close as you could get to half a pound. However, in recent years, new entrants to the supermarkets such as Costa launched 200g bags, and now the rest of the shelf seems to be following. A reader spotted some Co-op coffees have been reduced, and Guardian Money found the Fairtrade specialistCafédirect has started to sell smaller bags. The changes follow a rise in the price of coffee on the wholesale market and increases in labour costs. A spokesperson for Co-op said: “Like all retailers, we have seen high increases in the cost price of coffee this year. By very slightly reducing the weight of our ground coffee by a few grams and absorbing the remaining costs ourselves, we’ve managed to maintain the retail price and not pass this cost increase on to customers, and in fact, Co-op members benefit from an additional 30p member-only price reduction.” Cafédirect said it had been hit by higher operational costs but was not shrinkflating products – it said prices had been cut, too. “To make our price more accessible, we’ve reduced our pack size, passing all the savings back to the customer,” said its chief executive, John Steel. “These packs are more accessible at a lower price, so more people can enjoy our delicious coffee for an even bigger impact on farmers’ incomes.” Yoghurts If you buy big tubs of yoghurt, the chances are you are now getting smaller tubs than you did 18 months ago. Manufacturers and retailers have shrunk the amount in the packs, and it is typically impossible to tell when you pick up the tub – particularly the mid-sized versions that were 500g and are now 450g. Changes at Yeo Valley are typical: it did package natural yoghurt in 1kg, 500g, 150g and 4x120g packs but now only the 150g remains unchanged. The others are down to 950g, 450g and 4x110g respectively. A spokesperson said: “It’s well documented that there is an unprecedented rise in costs and inflation across the food and farming system. In order to protect our customers as much as possible from this cost rise, 12 months ago we reduced the weight on a limited number of our yoghurt products. We made this difficult decision to ensure we can continue to provide high-quality, organic products that remain affordable to our customers.” Pet food Whiskas cost-cutting caught out cat lovers in the spring when smaller packs and new recipes left their furry friends yowling for more, but dog owners have not been immune to shrinkflation. A reader who works in a supermarket alerted us to changes in Harringtons dog food. Those catering for canines could previously choose between packs weighing 15kg, 5kg and 2kg – but now the options are 12kg, 4kg and 1.7kg. A spokesperson for Harringtons explained the changes: “We have done our utmost to absorb costs in the face of spiralling inflation, and ultimately had to consider how to continue delivering this, while maintaining a sustainable business. Faced with having to pass very significant price increases to our loyal customers … we chose to reorganise our range and maintain our recommended retail price to ensure shoppers could still access quality pet nutrition within their weekly budget.”",Consumer affairs; Shopping; Money; Inflation; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Food & drink industry; Business; UK news; Economics,Money
2023-08-26T15:00:41Z,Bumpy ride for billionaire brothers who banked on Asda’s success,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/26/bumpy-ride-for-billionaire-brothers-who-banked-on-asdas-success,"When the billionaire Issa brothers parked up outside Asda’s Leeds headquarters in February 2021, they had just secured the keys to a business that seemed to present an incredible opportunity: a 600-stores-plus cash machine. The brothers from Blackburn were set on leapfrogging slightly bigger rival Sainsbury’s to make Asda the UK’s second-largest supermarket group. They promised £1bn of investment to fly the brand’s bright green banner above hundreds more convenience stores, many of which would be based on their own EG Group’s petrol forecourts, and to fill unwanted supermarket space with takeaways from their string of franchise partners, from KFC to Subway. Asda’s previous owner, the US retail group Walmart, had spent some time trying to exit Asda – including an abortive 2018 merger with Sainsbury’s. After that deal was scuppered by competition concerns, the Issa brothers provided the perfect opportunity for Walmart’s owners, the billionaire Walton family, to offload the chain near the top of the market. The deal was inked in October 2020 and a finalised the following February. The road since then has been increasingly bumpy, as the pandemic grocery boom (remember pasta and toilet roll stockpiling?) gave way to surging inflation, rising interest rates and a cost of living crisis. The boys from Blackburn Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who share a £5bn fortune, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list, grew up in a terrace house in Blackburn and started their empire with one petrol station in nearby Bury after working in their father’s garage. They made their fortune through buying up forecourts across the UK, and then globally, to build a business with more than 6,600 outlets funded largely by debt. Today, the brothers live in a complex of five newly built mansions that can only be glimpsed from their leafy Blackburn street as they are nestled behind high walls and security gates, with views of the nearby countryside and access to a pool, cinema and private prayer rooms. Just down the road, the brothers, whose parents came to the UK from India in the 1960s to work in the textile industry, are financing the building of a new mosque. They also reportedly own a £25m London mansion and used interest-free loans from EG Group to buy two Bombardier private jets. Having weathered a pandemic and a cost of living crisis since announcing their triumphant Asda deal, acquired with the help of their private equity partner TDR Capital, the brothers may be wondering about the state of their fortune. Asda’s sales flatlined last year at £20bn, while underlying profits fell to £886m from £1.2bn the previous year – and debts continue to mount. Debt millstone As Asda battles high cost inflation on wages, energy and wholesale food prices, rocketing interest rates have added to the pressure. With debt markets tight, the Issas and TDR Capital are being forced to plough £450m more cash into Asda to fund a takeover of their EG Group’s UK and Irish forecourts as they battle with the climbing cost of servicing a £7.4bn debt pile, including leaseholds, at Asda, according to credit rating agency Moody’s, and even bigger borrowings at EG. It is the supermarket escalator they don’t want to be on. Having already built a reputation as masters of debt-fuelled deals at EG, the Issas put just £100m of cash into the initial Asda deal, matched by £100m more from TDR Capital. The rest of the buyout was funded with the largest sterling corporate bond sale on record, according to Bloomberg, as well as a loan from the parent company of EG Group. The £1.7bn sale and leaseback of Asda’s warehouse network in 2021 was another key part of the financing. Finally, Walmart has kept a £500m stake in the Jersey-based business, which it had the right to hold for seven years along with a seat on Asda’s board. The Issa takeover doubled Asda’s debts, according to the Fitch rating agency. Structured right at the end of the low-interest era that began after the 2008 global financial crisis, the business has come under increasing strain, as its debts and the cost of servicing them has risen. By last year, Asda’s annual interest bill, including lease liabilities, had shot up to £300m from £90m in 2021, according to Amarveer Singh, an analyst at CreditSights. It is likely to be more than £400m this year. Next year, Asda’s total interest bill will probably rise again, by up to £90m, according to Singh, after the group added almost £800m of new debt to its balance sheet to fund the EG forecourts acquisition, all at a high interest rate of about 12% or more, according to CreditSights. One industry insider believes that almost £2m a week of extra payments will be like “a noose around the neck of the business”. However, while the group’s total debts will rise as a result of the EG forecourts deal, Asda’s debt-to-profit ratio is expected to improve with the acquisition. Accounts for Bellis Finco, the Asda holding company, show gross cash generation from operations of £1.6bn in 2022. The hope is that the acquisition of more than 120 Co-op petrol forecourt stores, agreed last year, and the addition of 350 stores that make up EG’s UK and Irish forecourts operation will bring additional profits and property assets into the business and boost its position in the faster-growing convenience store sector, where Asda to date has little presence. The retailer says comparison of debt holdings now with the days of Walmart’s ownership is not appropriate and it has a “sustainable capital structure, strong cash generation and clear strategy to grow [underlying profits], which, all combined, will enable the supermarket to reduce its debt over time”. In the background is a long-running legal battle in which mainly female shop workers say they are underpaid compared with their largely male equivalents in warehouses, which could result in more than £1bn in compensation payments for workers. Walmart has said it will pick up at least part of the tab. Asda says it will continue to defend against the claims “as retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and rates of pay”. An Asda spokesperson said the costs were “theoretical” as the case was still continuing. With Asda’s debt burden now significantly more onerous than its two bigger competitors – Tesco and Sainsbury’s – Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, says the Issas appear to be “having to take decisions they didn’t want to”. Financial engineering The Issas have sought a variety of ways to raise cash to support Asda and reduce its debts, including selling core property assets. A £650m deal to sell – and lease back – about 25 supermarkets to US-based company Realty Income Corporation was finalised in late July. Analysts at CreditSights estimate the group will have to pay an extra £67m in rent as a result, although it will have extra cash flow from the EG forecourts. Next up at the checkout is the sale of ground leases on as many as 30 Asda stores to raise at least £300m. The transaction would reduce its rent on those stores to well below market rates, but mean they are subject to much longer than usual leases – more than 50 years – making it hard to move out of or sell the property without huge financial penalties. The Issas also expect to find £100m of savings from bashing together EG’s petrol forecourts and the Asda chain – much of which is likely to come from ensuring each business’s suppliers give their best deals to the combined group. Some head office job cuts may be on the way, but insiders do not believe the two groups’ HQs – in Leeds and Blackburn – will be merged in the short term, as the trip over the Pennines would prompt hundreds of experienced staff to exit. The group has ambitions to expand, searching for at least six new supermarkets of between 25,000 sq ft and 60,000 sq ft and hundreds more convenience stores, according to property sources. However, Black claims Asda’s projections on spending during these tough times indicate it is “not backing up [that ambition] with investment”. An Asda spokesperson said: “Asda’s owners are committed to the long-term growth of the business and are investing in both supporting customers and colleagues during the immediate cost of living crisis as well as growing a strong sustainable business with clear strategy for the long term.” Less competitive Back at the tills, shoppers complain of higher prices – especially on petrol – fewer staff and reduced choice on the shelves. Outside Asda’s flagship outlet in Pudsey, Leeds, one customer points to what he calls “extreme rises” and says: “You can’t stick 40p on an 85p pack of biscuits!” Others say they regularly visit the discounters or Morrisons in search of a better deal. Consumer group Which? puts inflation at Asda ahead of all the traditional supermarkets, with price rises of 27% between June 2021 and this June compared with an average of 22% at Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Waitrose. Of the main chains, only Aldi and Lidl increased prices faster, hitting 35% over the period. As its price position has weakened, Asda, which made its name as the cut-price champion, where shoppers could pick up everything from bananas to babygrows, is losing market share. Its slice has slipped to 14.2%, from 15% in October 2020 when the takeover was announced. During the same period, bigger rival Tesco has gained share and Sainsbury’s held steady, with only Morrisons performing worse. The chain is also under fire from MPs for taking bigger profits from petrol after a competition watchdog found it had put the brakes on price cuts when wholesale oil prices fell. Asda was handed £60,000 in fines from the competition watchdog for failing to provide requested information to the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) fuel inquiry in a timely manner, though the company did later provide the CMA with the information. The company says its fuel strategy is unchanged in that it intends to be the “price leader” in the market but it is understood to have increased its profit margins on fuel between 2021 and 2022 to invest more in its grocery offer. “Despite record inflation, we have carefully managed our business to ensure Asda was the cheapest traditional supermarket for both groceries and fuel throughout the period reviewed by the CMA and this position is unchanged,” an Asda spokesperson said. Meanwhile, a number of senior executives have left Asda House in Leeds after losing out on regular share bonuses offered by Walmart and balking at the entrepreneurial style of Mohsin Issa, who likes to personally handle supplier negotiations in some cases. Asda said it has also brought new people in. One former staffer describes the new regime as “pretty brutal”, claiming that staff in some head office departments have been “cleared out”. “When Asda was owned by Walmart, it was very process-driven. Things could be really tedious with lots of paperwork and forms to fill in, committee after committee. The brothers came in and dismantled the process and really sped things up. Either you take to it or you don’t,” the former staffer claims. Another recalls the 1990s before Asda’s rescue from near bankruptcy by Archie Norman, now chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer. “A load of people love the entrepreneurial spirit of the Issas, but plenty of people really see it was debt that nearly got Asda in the early 90s.” He says those people are nervous about what they see as errors in rapid dealmaking after “a lot of years of not taking any risks”. Some industry insiders praise the Issas’ quick thinking, for example, in bringing in the cut-price essentials range as Asda’s shoppers struggled with the cost of living crisis. Critics, however, say Asda’s market share stability is largely thanks to the greater struggles of smaller rival Morrisons. The brothers have brought in some strong retail nous with Chris Comerford, the new commercial director, who joined from Tesco. But Mohsin Issa has been running the chain himself since the departure of chief executive Roger Burnley in August 2021 as a long search for a replacement continues. With no experience in running a big supermarket chain the Issas have fared reasonably well so far. But one industry insider warns: “When you have wafer-thin margins it can start getting wrong quickly”.",Business; Asda; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Petrol prices; Money; UK cost of living crisis; Competition and Markets Authority; Regulators; J Sainsbury; Walmart; Mergers and acquisitions,Business
2022-07-11T16:32:33Z,Klarna sees its value slashed by 85% in latest round of fundraising,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/11/klarna-sees-its-value-slashed-by-85-in-latest-round-of-fundraising,"Klarna, the “buy now, pay later” fintech darling that was once Europe’s most valuable private tech company, has seen its value slashed by 85% to less than $7bn in its latest round of fundraising. The company, which enjoyed stellar growth while also being criticised for potentially leading shoppers into unsustainable debt, announced the valuation after the conclusion of a difficult $800m funding round as investors continued to question the true worth of many tech businesses. Just over a year ago, Klarna, founded in Sweden in 2005, hit a peak valuation of $46bn after a $639m funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank. “The shift in Klarna’s valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years,” said Michael Moritz, chair of Klarna and a partner at investor Sequoia. “Eventually, after investors emerge from their bunkers, the stocks of Klarna and other first-rate companies will receive the attention they deserve.” Klarna, which in May announced its first ever large-scale job cuts, shedding 10% of its more than 7,000 staff, said that its popularity was continuing to surge and that with more than 150 million customers globally, it is bigger than American Express. Klarna has more than 16 million UK customers. It blamed the difficult fundraising for coming amid “possibly the worst set of circumstances to afflict stock markets since World War II”. “It’s a testament to the strength of Klarna’s business that, during the steepest drop in global stock markets in over 50 years, investors recognised our strong position and continued progress in revolutionising the retail banking industry,” said Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the company’s chief executive. “Now more than ever businesses need a strong consumer base, a superior product, and a sustainable business model.” Investor enthusiasm for fintech companies, especially buy now, pay later firms, has waned as consumers struggle to cope with the cost of living crisis and the risk of defaults on payments rise. Meanwhile, deep-pocketed Silicon Valley rivals such as Apple have moved into the market with products like Apple Pay Later. Last year, the Treasury announced that the Financial Conduct Authority was to be given powers to regulate firms such as Klarna and Clearpay, amid fears that a surge in their popularity during the pandemic could leave consumers with high levels of debt. Klarna’s latest fundraising round, which attracted new investors including Mubadala, the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates, and the Canada pension plan investment board, has given the company its lowest valuation since August 2019, when it was worth $5.5bn.","Buy now, pay later; Technology; Fintech; Europe; Money; Business; Sweden",Business
2023-07-25T18:06:44Z,‘It’s unsustainable’: can Hollywood survive without transformation?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/hollywood-strikes-ai-barbie-oppenheimer,"It was a pink mushroom cloud that even enveloped the White House. “Did you see Barbie or Oppenheimer this weekend?” a reporter asked the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. She replied: “I knew I was going to get that question. I did not. But heard that it did very well.” Both films did very well: Barbie collected $162m in ticket sales while Oppenheimer, about the father of the atom bomb, earned $82.4m. It was comfortably the best weekend at the domestic box office since the coronavirus pandemic. But when future historians come to study the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, they may still have a question: was this the dawn of a Hollywood renaissance or glorious last stand of an industry in decline? Even with the weekend’s sugar rush, the box office is still down 20% from pre-pandemic levels. Actors and writers are on strike simultaneously for the first time in more than 60 years. Online streaming services and artificial intelligence, or AI, are upending the business model and exposing the wealth gap between studio bosses and anyone who is not a household name. Barry Diller, former chief executive of Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, told CBS’s Face the Nation programme: “You have almost a perfect storm here, which is, you had Covid, which sent people home to watch streaming and television, and killed theaters. You’ve had the results of huge investments in streaming, which have produced all these losses for all these companies.” Urging a settlement to the strike by September, Diller added: “The truth is this is a huge business, both domestically and for world export. These conditions will potentially produce an absolute collapse of an entire industry.” The celebrated Hollywood sign, which turned 100 this month, has witnessed a great depression and world war, various strikes (Ronald Reagan led the actors in 1960), technological disruptions and, in March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic that made cinemas go dark, emptied TV studios and shut down all production. The recovery is still in progress. There have been hits such as last year’s Top Gun: Maverick, which prompted Steven Spielberg to tell Tom Cruise: “You saved Hollywood’s ass and you might have saved theatrical distribution.” Another Cruise vehicle, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, one of the first major productions shut down by the pandemic, was just released and performed solidly but not spectacularly. Other recent films such as Big George Foreman, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Disney and Pixar’s Elemental, The Flash, 65 have proved disappointing at the box office (by one estimate, Disney has lost nearly $900m following its last eight studio releases). Barbie and Oppenheimer, benefiting from smart marketing and memes, could be exceptions that prove the rule. David Scarpa, who is on the picket line daily, says: “The movie business has been moving more towards something that resembles the amusement park business; people turn out to go on rides. They don’t necessarily come out to see what a movie would have been in 1940. They go to have experiences and so everything is weighted more towards what is called the tentpole business, the big $300m movie to the exclusion of almost everything else. “That’s a process that’s been going on for at least 20 years but the big accelerant in all of this was Covid. There was a point at which it wasn’t clear that the movies would ever come back, that people would come back to the theatres at all. You had a lot of distressed companies and there’s a sort of Darwinian phase and so now basically the feature business is almost entirely these juggernauts.” The pandemic may have got some people out of the cinema-going habit. With wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, some may feel that money is tight or better spent elsewhere. Some may have become hooked on streaming and decide to wait for cinema releases to turn up there a few months later. Scarpa adds: “Netflix is part of a larger technological shift towards increasing competition for people’s attention, be it video games, be it apps, be it YouTube, et cetera. There’s just a much greater competition for people’s attention and so for what it takes to get people to show up and pay $15 to go to a movie, the threshold has been raised.” Pandemic lockdowns accelerated a headlong rush to streaming as studios tried to compete with Netflix and made subscriber growth their top priority. The result was content saturation and a seemingly futile quest to find a sustainable business model. Disney’s flagship streaming service lost 4 million subscribers in the first three months of the year and made a loss of $659m. Phil Alden Robinson, a writer and director whose credits include Field of Dreams, says: “The legacy companies panicked and imitated the tech companies who truly don’t understand this industry. They pride themselves on entering new industries and disrupting. They’re doing it here to the point where young writers who are not from well-to-do families can’t afford a career. Writers are no longer on the set learning how to become a showrunner. It’s unsustainable.” Even streaming could be dwarfed by another tech threat: AI. It has already been deployed in films such as Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny to “de-age” its star Harrison Ford. Some fear that, while it may never be able to match a script by Aaron Sorkin for psychological insights, AI could replace an entire “commodity tier” of writers – including on relatively formulaic superhero movies. As these issues converge, some 11,000 Writers Guild of America screenwriters, who went on strike in May, have now been joined by tens of thousands of members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra). One of their biggest concerns is residuals, the payments that performers receive for repeat showings of films or TV shows – often crucial money to get them through lean times. Sag-Aftra negotiators want residuals partly based on viewership levels on streaming services but the studios keep such information secret. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of the studios, says the studios have offered actors “historic pay and residual increases”, along with pension contributions and other protections. But Robinson adds: “Unregulated, the companies will do away with residuals. Under their formula, a big-budget flop will generate more residuals than a low-budget hit because it has nothing to do with the success or failure of the series; it just has to do with the budget and the size of the streaming service’s subscription base. So it’s not really a residual; it’s just a payoff.” Some observers draw parallels with Silicon Valley’s disruption of other sectors such as music and newspapers, both of which had to rapidly reinvent their business models with varying degrees of success. But this time the “move fast and break things” tech companies are running into the wall of strong unions. Laura Sydell, a screenwriter and longtime public radio journalist who studies the intersection of culture and technology, says: “This may be one of the most important strikes in decades. These companies devastated musicians. Yes, we have big stars, but if you look what they’re making through Spotify and talk to people about the money they’re making, it kind of devastated the middle class of musicians. “You have your upper class, your Adeles, your Beyoncés, and then you’ve got some younger people maybe who figured that they can make money if they’re also selling T-shirts and going on tour a lot. But there were a lot of musicians who were doing well off of a combination of royalties and performance and they were devastated and still are.” Sydell continues: “Let’s go look at what happened with newspapers. Now, I’m not going to begin to argue that local news wasn’t struggling already but I think the tech companies pretty much put the nail in the coffin. We can also look at what happened with taxis and argue about why it happened. But this is the first time that I know of that these tech companies had come up against a real union.” There is much at stake. The actors’ and writers’ unions are determined to avoid the mistakes seen in other sectors and draw lines that stop the tech giants trampling other parts of the economy. Joe Biden has voiced support for their efforts. Jared Butler, a screenwriter and voice actor, says: “It starts with giving creative people a way to create well. A lot of the great content that people celebrate now, whether it’s from the 70s or 80s or 90s, those things that people go back to, those things that built libraries on streaming, that spawned all the sequels, was created when people could earn a living doing it. “There was a financial incentive to do great work and, if you take all that away, I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t think I’m going to pay $25 to go see on a big screen content that was AI-generated or generated by someone who doesn’t make any money and is just a hobbyist. I also don’t want to go back to a Renaissance system where we had to have wealthy patrons of the arts to keep anything going.” He adds: “The great entertainment that we’ve made over the last hundred years was made by people who could make an honest living doing it as a career. You had people who did really well but you had people that were basically blue-collar, punch-the-clock workers, and I don’t just mean below the line crew, I mean also writers and actors.” Tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix have muscled their way into the film production business. Netflix alone has earned 132 Oscar nominations and 22 Oscar wins over the past decade, including 16 nominations and six wins this year. This is a sore point for some because Netflix has not fully embraced cinema releases. Combined with vast quantities of dramas and documentaries, viewers have never had it so good. But there is also a danger that gluttony will kill the golden goose. Rahul Telang, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and co-author of the book Streaming, Sharing, Stealing: Big Data and the Future of Entertainment, says: “There’s just too much content being produced. A lot doesn’t actually get watched by a whole lot of people so there’s this whole question of what is the optimum content library and what should be in there, what should not be in there.” He adds: “That goes back to a bigger question, which I think a lot of people are trying to answer, including myself: what exactly is the value of the content? How do you decide that the content you’re producing is actually generating value? That goes back to the question that we have about how to get the residual because if you can’t figure out what the value is going be, then how do you decide how to distribute the value downstream?” Some still view Hollywood through candy-coloured spectacles, however. They point to the way it has survived past technological revolutions, such as the invention of television and home video. They suggest that the big weekend of Barbie and Oppenheimer represents a new beginning, not a cue for closing credits. Greg Marcus, chief executive of the Marcus Corporation, which owns the fourth-biggest cinema chain in the country, says: “Weren’t we just sitting around two years ago talking that nobody ever is going to go to the movie theatre again, that they’re all just going to sit at home and bolt their rear ends to a couch and watch everything on a streaming service? “I remember saying then, no, people want to be together, they want to be entertained, they want to laugh together. And today we’re sitting here talking about Barbenheimer. It’s the only thing anybody can talk about and it’s expressing the value of the theatrical piece of the ecosystem many times over.” The strikers and studios will “get through it and figure it out”, Marcus believes. “Mom and Dad are fighting. But they have no choice but to live in the same house.”",Film industry; US writers' strike 2023; US actors' strike 2023; Business; Culture; Film; US television; US television industry; Media; Television; Television & radio,Film
2022-07-20T19:01:57Z,PhD students told to consider selling Avon products to make ends meet,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/20/phd-students-told-to-consider-selling-avon-products-to-make-ends-meet,"Postgraduates chosen for their “excellent potential” to become future leaders in environmental science and sustainable business should consider selling Avon products, pet-sitting and joining clinical trials to cope with the cost of living crisis. The advice – issued on Wednesday by the prestigious Aries Doctoral Training Partnership funded by the Natural Environment Research Council at the University of East Anglia – provoked outrage among researchers who described the letter as “appalling”, “ridiculous” and “unbelievable”. An email to PhD students on the programme recognised that many were finding it “increasingly challenging” to live on their stipends, £15,600 a year at present, and attached a three-page document from the UEA careers office setting out options to make ends meet. Before making specific recommendations, the document warns that many students are not allowed to do more than six hours of paid work a week, because to do so would interfere with them completing their course on time. The letter describes how PhD students can boost their finances with university level teaching and training, tutoring, and exam work, and goes on to suggest dog-walking, pet-sitting, paid-for clinical trials and selling Avon products as alternative sources of income. Adriana Lowe, who was awarded a PhD from the University of Kent in 2019, said she was “outraged” at the suggestions. Natalie Starkey at the Open University called the advice “unbelievable”, while Jess Wade at Imperial College London called it “appalling”. Prof Thibaud Gruber at the University of Geneva said it was “freaking ridiculous”. “This is just another example of how PhD students are completely let down by the system. While they’re called students, they’re producing vital research which in many cases has a direct and meaningful effect on wider society,” said Lowe. “These are people who are advising government on policy, advancing medical research, tackling the climate crisis and so on, and we’re expecting them to live like teenagers despite the fact they’re often adults with kids of their own.” A spokesperson for UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the major UK science funding programme, said the letter did not reflect their position, adding: “We do recognise the effect the increased cost of living is having on students and we are looking to see if we can provide further financial support.” Prof Jenni Barclay, director of the doctoral training programme, said: “Firstly, and unequivocally we are sorry for any offence caused. The primary concern here is the cost of living crisis and its disproportionate impact on our research students. Action is needed soon – many students are reporting extreme financial difficulties now. “UKRI is reviewing this and following discussions at our Aries summer school we undertook to gather evidence for how best to lobby UKRI around this. But we also undertook to offer some practical advice. The intention here was to provide support as an interim measure as we try to improve global response to this problem for students.”",Science; UK cost of living crisis; PhDs; University of East Anglia; Research; Student finance; Education; Higher education; Students; Money; Science,Science
2022-08-04T13:20:58Z,Rolls-Royce blames supply chain woes and Covid hit to aviation for £111m loss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/rolls-royce-blames-pandemic-supply-chain-woes-and-hit-to-aviation-for-111m-loss,"Rolls-Royce’s chief executive, Warren East, has warned of supply chain problems and inflation in his final results announcement at the helm of the jet-engine maker, saying the company is suffering “post-Covid indigestion”. The share price of the FTSE 100 manufacturer slumped by 10% on Thursday morning to near its low point earlier this year after it missed analysts’ forecasts for profitability. Rolls-Royce said it made an underlying loss of £111m in the first half of 2022, compared with a profit for the same period in 2021. East’s stint at the top of one of Britain’s most prominent industrial names has been dominated by crisis-fighting, first with engine problems and then with the pandemic. He is due to be replaced by the former BP executive Tufan Erginbilgic in January. Coronavirus is still making its mark on the company, which East said had been affected by delays in the supply of semiconductors (computer chips) used to control its engines. It has also been forced to find alternative sources of titanium used in strong but lightweight aircraft parts after it pledged to cut ties with Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. However, Rolls-Royce is still sourcing some titanium from Russia. Concentrating orders with fewer, larger suppliers, has allowed the company to cut costs, East said. Rolls-Royce has been particularly hard hit during the pandemic because its revenues are closely tied to the number of hours its engines are airborne. It provides engines for aircraft such as Airbus’s A350 that are used primarily for long-haul travel, which has not recovered as quickly as shorter journeys. East said that in the first half of 2022 Rolls-Royce engines flew about 60% of the hours they flew in 2019, before the pandemic, and were now at about 65% of that level. He expects that to pick up to 70% during the course of this year, and to recover to pre-pandemic levels by 2024 at the earliest. East said he recognised a “theoretical risk” of a widely expected recession in several large economies, including the US and UK. However, aviation traffic has reduced so much because of the pandemic that he does not expect a recession to have a major impact on the gradual recovery of long-haul travel – although short-haul could be worse affected, he conceded. “It might affect exactly which month in 2024-25 we get back to 100%,” East said. Rolls-Royce has gradually improved the rate at which it is burning through cash, with a £68m outflow during the half year, compared with £1.2bn in 2021. East insisted he would bow out, with Rolls-Royce finally generating cash over the course of 2022. He said he was “very pleased with the progress” the company had made and that he would leave Rolls-Royce “a leaner, agile organisation with a more modern culture”. He said Rolls-Royce was “a more sustainable business in both senses of the word”, in reference to its financial stability but also its ambitions to produce lower-emission power – even though the company still derived most of its revenues from products that burn polluting fossil fuels. Rolls-Royce has changed to a “not switch, but tilt” approach towards net zero technologies, East added.",Rolls-Royce; Business; Air transport; Coronavirus; Supply chain crisis,Business
2023-01-06T15:58:20Z,Football Daily | Gianluca Vialli: football has lost some of the twinkle in its eye,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/06/football-daily-newsletter-gianluca-vialli,"CIAO, LUCA Look, there will be no laughter in this edition of Football Daily. Two reasons: a) it’s a weekday; and b) Gianluca Vialli has died at the sickeningly young age of 58. Vialli was – was, FFS – a relentless, deceptively skilful centre-forward for Cremonese, Sampdoria, Juventus, Chelsea and Italy, and a fine, ambitious manager who made Chelsea serious contenders at home and abroad for the first time in almost 30 years. His time at Watford wasn’t so successful; nor was his playing career without some serious lows. Vialli is the only player to be on the winning and losing sides in the final of all three European club competitions. But one way or another, he usually made up for the failures. At Wembley in 1992, he missed a number of chances in his last game for Sampdoria, the painful Big Cup final defeat to Barcelona. Four years later, in his final game for Juventus, he captained them to Big Cup glory against Ajax. Vialli was a football great – not as a player or manager, though he was very good at both, but as a character. He faced every challenge with a little charm and a lot of style, and his magnetism is reflected in how many of today’s tributes refer to the person before the footballer. Modern society always says nice things about the newly deceased – unless, well, you know – but almost all of the comments about Vialli have a different feel: more heartfelt, less scripted. Football has lost some of the twinkle in its eye. Vialli loved a practical joke – he was one of the few people who could get away with putting shaving foam in Graeme Souness’s shoes – and rarely took himself, or life, too seriously. “If you were in his company for 10 or 15 minutes, even once, I think you’d remember him for the rest of your life,” said Souness. “He was just a special person.” When Vialli inspired Sampdoria to their only scudetto in 1990-91, one of football’s great fairytales and a glorious redemption after his desperately disappointing Italia 90, he cavorted round the Luigi Ferraris Stadium wearing nothing but a broad smile and a pair of formidably slender white undercrackers. Oh, and white socks and football boots. And he still pulled off the look. OK, he almost pulled it off. A few days later, he and a number of Sampdoria teammates even appeared on stage in full garb to mime Europe’s The Final Countdown. Vialli is indelibly associated with his terrible twin, Roberto Mancini. At Samp they made up one of the great strike partnerships, and scored two of the greatest volleys we’ve ever seen in the same game against Napoli in 1990. Thirty-one years later, they hugged tearfully on the Wembley pitch after Mancini’s Italy won the European Championship. You probably shouldn’t click on this video of that embrace unless you’re ready for it to rain all over your face. Vialli was, officially, Italy’s “head of delegation” at the Euros, but really he was there to make everyone feel a little lighter, a little happier, a little more alive. His lust for life was such that – and this is a cliche, but for once it’s true – he packed more into 58 years than most of us would into 158. His father was a self-made millionaire, putting Vialli on a pretty short list of upper-middle-class footballers, yet he had a mischief and an approachability that belied his roots. He was at home in any company, a social chameleon who wasn’t masking, just being. Vialli came closer than most to working out the meaning of life, and combined qualities that are often mutually exclusive: the laid-back winner and the privileged everyman. More than anything, we’ll remember him for his personality. A few people have it and the rest never will. Charisma, Vialli be thy name. QUOTE OF THE DAY “We won’t forget your 141 goals, your overhead kicks, your cashmere shirts, your earring, your platinum blonde hair, your Ultras bomber jacket. You gave us so much, we gave you so much: yes, it was love, reciprocal, infinite. A love that will not die today with you. We will continue to love and adore you” – Sampdoria find the right, beautiful words for Gianluca Vialli. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS “Thank you for your excellent précis of Nathan Jones’s start at St Mary’s (yesterday’s Football Daily) and, for me as a Saints fan for over 40-plus years, it is an appointment which has just puzzled me utterly. Why him? Not sure what the thinking is except that he was Championship manager of the year last season. Ralph Hasenhüttl had some top-flight experience in Germany, his enthusiasm was infectious and the players grew to like him. I just wish he hadn’t told them he was planning on leaving as this started the tailing off of form. Jones has inherited Hasenhüttl’s team and they all feel let down – Jones does not deserve that (and could probably end up being a good fit) but I don’t think we don’t have time for his Premier League development. I remember 2005 and 2010 so things have been worse, but this all seems totally self-inflicted to me. I don’t blame Jones but he is showing little to encourage us lot yet. The Sports Republic takeover did feel really positive when it happened, now I’m not so sure” – Mick Spicer. “I have to disagree with Football Daily on this. You wrote: ‘If they can be bothered to wait, Southampton could have an extremely good manager on their hands.’ I don’t know if you watched the whole game against Forest but it was truly terrible, loads of long balls pumped forward to players like Che Adams, who is only 5ft 9in. It was noticeable in the highlights which showed all of Saints’ eight attempts on goal (none on target) that none of those attacks were the result of long balls; it was only when players like Kyle Walker-Peters or Roméo Lavia produced a neat bit of individual skill that we created anything. Saints have lost all four Premier League matches under Jones. In the previous three, he started with three at the back, changed to four shortly after half-time and the performance improved. Against Forest we were three at the back all game and it was the worst yet. Rubbish results, rubbish football to watch – why pay through the nose to endure such misery?” – Matty Stiles. “Re: the current plight of Crawley Town. I’m staggered to learn that people who made their name with a business based on imaginary money might not have a clue about football or operating a sustainable business in the real world, and that they are also encountering ‘sensitive legal issues’. Hopefully, they don’t end up giving the whole fake money industry a bad name” – Noble Francis. “Re: P45s (yesterday’s Football Daily). Surprisingly Football Daily seems not to have received one lately – judging by the suggestion that they are printed quickly nowadays. Since 2020, the three P45s that I have received were all sent electronically” – Andrew Long. “Connecting the Supremes (OK, probably Bananarama) to Blackpink is a solid flex (yesterday’s first and last lines).

2023-05-10T05:00:07Z,"‘Oh my God, Obama’s stopping by for pasta’: can New York’s Carbone survive its own success?",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/09/carbone-restaurant-new-york-city-interview,"The restaurateur and Queens native Mario Carbone grew up enamored with the atmosphere of old-school Italian American restaurants. From crisp white tablecloths to plates overflowing with red sauce, romantic paintings of Italian cities, and waiters rushing table to table clad in tuxedos while Frank Sinatra standards played in the background, Carbone was fascinated: “I thought it was magic.” When he decided to open his own restaurant, he wanted to replicate that atmosphere, a place where generations could mark milestones together or escape from their daily lives. It was a decade ago this spring that his restaurant Carbone opened its doors and since then, the New York City eatery has become one of the toughest reservations in the world. “The list of people I’ve gotten a chance to cook for has been pretty remarkable,” says Carbone’s business partner, Chef Rich Torrisi, with wide-eyed enthusiasm. “But when President Obama was still president and he came to Carbone, that was like, ‘Oh my God, the leader of the free world is stopping by for pasta.’” (The 44th president sat at table 45 and ordered a dirty martini.) Snagging a seat at Carbone’s flagship New York location has become a power move that not even the A-listers Justin and Hailey Bieber can always finagle. As was breathlessly reported by the tabloids at the time, they were (gasp!) turned away last summer after arriving without a reservation. (They eventually scored a seat in January when the pop star sold his $200m music catalog.) Ten years, ago Mario Carbone and Torrisi joined with business brain Jeff Zalaznick to launch Major Food Group. The name was meant to be tongue-in-cheek since it was originally a bare-bones operation, starting with the launch of a sandwich shop in 2009 (according to Mario, the sentiment was “let’s be major”.) But the moniker was a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the company grew into a globe-trotting juggernaut of restaurants, hotels and private clubs. In addition to Carbone locations everywhere from Las Vegas to Hong Kong, Major Food Group’s empire encompasses 50 restaurants with a range of cuisine. But its success was built on Carbone, with its old-school Italian restaurant pastina, along with an inherent exclusivity in a relatively small space that regularly lures high-powered diners. Zalaznick, who energetically answers questions like a macho football coach giving his team a pep talk, isn’t ashamed of the glitzy reputation the brand has cultivated. “We created that culture,” he says of a see-and-be-seen atmosphere, seemingly looking at the operation as less like a restaurant and more like a club. “We understand how to take care of people and create an environment people want to be in. The byproduct of that is a very high-quality clientele.” Selena Gomez took Brooklyn Beckham and his wife for a night out; Rosalía celebrated her birthday there. Bad Bunny went the weekend of his historic residency at Yankee Stadium, later visiting the night before the Met Gala with Kendall Jenner; two days later Rihanna and A$AP Rocky stopped in. Tony Bennett dined there (that one was a highlight for Mario), and so have Adele and Drake. “When Derek Jeter played his last game as a Yankee, he flew back from Boston that night so he could have dinner at Carbone, too,” Mario recalls. “We had his whole family in and everyone wore Yankees hats and they tipped them to the captain.” Though Carbone is haunted by the rich and famous now, it wasn’t an immediate success. Italian New Yorkers and food critics were initially skeptical. After all, the trio was relatively young and inexperienced while their prices were eyebrow-raisingly expensive. Think $50 for veal parmesan, long before inflation had taken hold in the US. “It was somewhat spotty in the beginning,” Mario remembers. “The early buzz was, ‘Who do these kids think they are, charging these prices and wearing tuxedos?’ There was a community taking offense that we were trying to act like an older, more established group. But in reality, we were just three native New Yorkers trying to do right by what we were trying to create.” According to Ian MacAllen, the author of the recent book Red Sauce: How Italian Food Became American, Carbone signified a gentrification of red sauce. “They raised prices and raised the bar, making what had been casual food into something fancy,” he says. The acclaim for its cuisine popped up in major press right away, most notably from the New York Times food critic Pete Wells. His enthusiastic review (headline: “A red sauce joint steals the show”) put Carbone on the proverbial map with New York trend-chasers and the culinary elite, building a foundation for a fervent following. “We no doubt knew we had something special on our hands,” remembers Zalaznick. According to MacAllen, before Carbone, old-school Italian joints had been slowly disappearing due to food trends and gentrification. As classic spots like New York’s 40s-era Forlini’s close, modern replicas thrive as mini-chains (Carmine’s and Serafina among them). “Carbone entered the restaurant scene at the perfect time to capitalize on the nostalgia of red sauce, the stale copycat ‘authentic’ Italian restaurants, and the shrinking enclaves of old-style Italian restaurants,” MacAllen said. The space Carbone inhabits was originally Rocco Restaurant, a 90-year-old eatery that closed in 2012 because of a rent hike. Rocco’s was exactly the kind of place the team wanted to emulate, right down to its ageing exterior. (They even kept Rocco’s original sign and affixed a neon CARBONE on top of it, which has since become their trademark; a painstaking duplicate hangs outside their outpost in the shiny hallway of the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.) Mimicking that Goodfellas-era style, the restaurant spins a period doo-wop soundtrack, as well as the obligatory Sinatra tune. Carbone critics bristle over the fact that a truly old-school restaurant where actual mobsters and Marilyn Monroe used to hang out was replaced with a high-priced replica that woos the Kardashians. On the other hand, it’s part of a changing landscape in the cutthroat New York culinary world at large. “Restaurants need to be a sustainable business,” says MacAllen. “If Carbone uses high-quality ingredients and pays their staff fair wages, the price of the food will have to reflect that.” The mood in Carbone has an undeniable lure. Once guests are seated, an assortment of bread is whisked to their table as they peruse the large, face-obscuring menus. Popular dishes include the spicy rigatoni (a tangy spin on a vodka sauce), as well as meatballs (a mixture of beef, pork and veal, along with the unique addition of onions). It’s comforting, it’s warm – “like going to grandma’s house”, says Mario. They try to re-create that atmosphere everywhere. Now a decade in, Mario is unfazed by celebrities and press. “It’s what we do at this point,” he says. “We don’t have the celebratory dance at the end zone any more. We’ve been there.” But with that success also comes the danger of becoming stale, and any hot trend has the ability to cool down like a plate of spicy rigatoni that has been out of the kitchen too long. While Carbone in New York is still a draw, the Major trio has two distinct approaches to fortify the strength of their empire. On one end, they created an even more exclusive experience in Miami: Carbone Beach, a limited run of special dinners in partnership with American Express, which cost $3,000 per person during the Miami Grand Prix. “There is definitely some mythologizing that happens when a restaurant becomes too popular,” says MacAllen, noting the enduring popularity of Rao’s, located uptown in Harlem. Open since 1896, it’s still the toughest seat in town thanks to a process that eschews reservations; a loyal gaggle of high-profile clientele “rent out” tables certain nights of the week. “The exclusion makes it desirable,” MacAllen says. Carbone took another page out of Rao’s book for us plebes who can’t land a reservation by releasing a line of jarred tomato sauces available in supermarkets across the US (flavors include marinara, arrabiata and mushroom), all emblazoned with a depiction of Carbone’s signature sign. “We have a brand name bigger than the seats we have, so the sauces came from that amazing problem,” says Mario. In reality, its location in New York serves increasingly as an emblem for a wider operation. “Great food alone is never a guarantee of success,” says MacAllen. Zalaznick is his typical cheerleading, macho self when describing Carbone’s endurance in a fickle scene. “When things come and go, it’s because the underlying product wasn’t that great to begin with,” he says. ”There’s a difference between being great and being hot. You can be both at the same time, but there’s a difference.” With any food operation, there’s also a risk of a reduction in quality when once small culinary operations overextend themselves. Zalaznick is also acutely aware of that and insists that he nixes most opportunities that come across his desk. “It’s easy to say no when you have a clear understanding of your brand standards and criteria.” But with Rao’s as a blueprint, Carbone’s cultural cachet could be viable long after the celebrities who frequent it lose theirs. ••• The most recent high-profile addition to the sprawling empire is Torrisi Bar and Restaurant, located near New York’s Little Italy in a huge ground-floor space located in the 19th-century Puck Building. It’s the eponymous brainchild of Rich and is an offshoot of the trio’s very first shop, which was much smaller. Here, aside from the main dining room, a secondary large space, presumably for VIPs, lies beyond wooden double doors. Whereas Carbone is an hommage to old-school Italian, Torrisi’s menu is experimental and elevated. Tonight’s specials include sweet and sour sardines, while long, homemade penne with ramps is a regular offering. It opened in December to immediate buzz. The New York Times, which first elevated Carbone, has already ranked Torrisi’s 33 in its list of the best restaurants in New York City. (The review said “it looks like a set for the hottest restaurant in New York in a movie made by people who don’t live in New York”.) If Carbone is a homestyle Italian joint (or is cosplaying as one), Torrisi is more Copacabana, with well-dressed patrons and an air of class. Despite its success, Torrisi says helming Major’s latest high-profile concept wasn’t an easy task, especially with the eyes of the culinary world fixed on what the trio would do next. “Doing Torrisi was perhaps the most daunting task of my career, even more than the first time,” he says. It’s a risk that’s so far paying off, and if Carbone is any indication, 10 years in, celebrities and foodies alike will still arrive en masse.",Restaurants; New York; Food; US news,Food
2022-06-26T23:01:00Z,"University College London generates £10bn a year for UK, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jun/27/university-college-london-generates-10bn-a-year-for-uk-says-report,"University College London has boasted its financial contribution to the British economy is the equivalent of hosting the Olympics every year – in part because of how it encourages graduates to create jobs and investment around the country. An independent report commissioned by UCL estimates that the university generates close to £10bn a year in economic activity from its spending of £1.67bn. According to the consultancy London Economics, that figure “is comparable to the boost in international trade and inward investment delivered by the 2012 London Olympics”. While much of the £10bn is generated by the spread of UCL’s research and knowledge, some comes from nurturing company spinoffs and startups such as that cofounded by Rachael Twumasi-Corson, whose company Afrocenchix is now selling its haircare products in Superdrug and Whole Foods as well as exporting to more than 50 countries. Afrocenchix’s 14 employees are dwarfed by the 19,000 full-time jobs the report estimates are supported by UCL’s activities, but Twumasi-Corson credits UCL for crucial funding and support to help get Afrocenchix off the ground – thanks to a lecture she attended while studying medical anthropology. Twumasi-Corson attended a lecture run by UCL’s enterprise operation – which aims to help students with “entrepreneurial activities” including businesses with their roots outside UCL – and decided to put Afrocenchix in for a “bright ideas” competition run by UCL. “I didn’t think we would end up winning, but we did. So it was great to win and to have that validation from UCL; it went a long way to helping us get the business properly established,” she said. The prize was £5,000 in funding, along with office space in central London and business advice from UCL’s enterprise unit, which Twumasi-Corson said was just as important. “There was a really cool person working at UCL … from a Caribbean background and it was actually the first time I had ever interacted with a university entrepreneurship department that had a black woman there,” she said. “She understood a lot of the issues with my hair that had led to making the product range, which was really great.” UCL returned the favour by employing Twumasi-Corson on its business advisory team: “I worked three days a week helping students with their businesses, and then the rest of the week I was working on mine,” she said. “It put me on the trajectory to be able to have a sustainable business with employees. I have been full time now for about three years. And I have got a team of 12 people, 14 including contractors. That UCL support really helped, I learned a huge amount.” Afrocenchix was just one of the 234 graduate startups that were launched or operating in one year, 2018-19, along with 83 spinout companies, generating £110m in turnover, attracting £639m external investment and employing 2,950 staff. The London Economics report found that UCL’s research and knowledge exchange activities were worth more than £4bn in 2018-19, and estimated that “productivity spillovers” meant that every £1m invested in research at UCL results in an extra £6m economic output across the UK. While the university does most of its spending and employment in the London area, the report found the total impact of its own spending generates £3bn for the UK economy – with just over a third of that taking place outside the capital. Of the 19,000 jobs supported by UCL’s spending, more than 7,000 are located outside London. The report comes as the government is highly critical about the value of degrees taught at English universities, including its complaints about “low value” qualifications. Michael Spence, UCL’s provost, said: “This study demonstrates for the first time the far-reaching extent to which UCL in particular is improving health and prosperity right across the UK, through its work to expand knowledge, translate that into new technologies, techniques, activities and therapies, and nurture the talent of future generations to do the same.”",Universities; University funding; UCL (University College London); Higher education; Students; Economics; Anthropology; Education; UK news,Education
2022-08-27T11:00:27Z,Okan Buruk’s Galatasaray reboot fired up by rivals Fenerbahce’s stars wars ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/27/trabzonspors-stars-wars-fire-up-okan-buruks-galatasaray-reboot,"After their worst Super Lig finish of 13th, Turkey’s most successful club are trying to reignite the flame. The season could not have gone much worse for Galatasaray and they have returned to their tried and tested method of hiring a club legend as head coach and bringing in veteran foreign players. Such was the failing in the league that they sacked Fatih Terim after a disastrous start to the season. His replacement, Domènec Torrent, lasted six unpopular months in Istanbul. The Spaniard halted the slide, secured a draw in Camp Nou against Barcelona and the players enjoyed his methods but that was not enough to keep his job. Club legend Okan Buruk has arrived as head coach, Dursun Ozbek is back to serve a second term as president and this summer’s signings of Haris Seferovic, Dries Mertens and Lucas Torreira have whet the fans’ appetite. The club now has romantic hopes of pushing for a 23rd title in the centenary year of the Turkish republic. They have started the campaign in underwhelming fashion with a home defeat to Giresunspor sandwiched between two 1-0 away victories thanks to late goals from the 37-year-old Bafétimbi Gomis. On Sunday they face the champions, Trabzonspor, who finished 29 points above them last season, with the aim of showing progress is being made. Although the household name signings are intriguing, many are aged 30 or over, their best days behind them and earning high wages. It is a risky strategy considering the low value of the Turkish lira – currently at 21.45 to the pound – and with the club €410m in debt. Last summer Galatasaray planned to bring in younger players with potential to increase their value and create a sustainable business model. Four foreigners under the age of 24 were acquired, including Victor Nelsson who had been linked with a move to La Liga and the Premier League, but due to the underwhelming season, this has been abandoned. In the past, Galatasaray have signed numerous big names, including Didier Drogba and Wesley Sneijder, and the 35-year-old Mertens is the latest example. Understandably, by splashing out on foreign stars there are fears that domestic players are being neglected, leaving the squad unbalanced. Having to no more than 14 foreign players in a match day squad with only eight permitted to play at a time, there is a pressing need for quality Turkish players. Kerem Akturkoglu is their standout native, and he looks destined for a move to one of the top five leagues in Europe, but his compatriots at Galatasaray are not at the same level. Galatasaray’s 2000 Uefa Cup triumph was built on a strong Turkish contingent of Hakan Sukur, Umit Davala and the current coach, Buruk, but those days are long gone. Galatasaray are confident of making two to three more signings before the window closes. One key target is Cengiz Under, a talented winger who has struggled to settle in recent years, including a forgettable spell on loan at Leicester during the 2020-21 season. Brentford’s Halil Dervisoglu, who has spent 18 months on loan at Galatasaray, is another who offers quality to the home contingent. The good news is that Buruk has recent experience of winning the Super Lig, lifting the trophy with Istanbul Basaksehir in 2020. His other spells as a manager, however, have lasted no longer than a season and he was sacked by Basaksehir nine months after their triumph, after a tricky second campaign. The rivalry between the Istanbul clubs is infamous. Who can forget Graeme Souness planting the Galatasaray flag in the middle of the pitch at Fenerbahce after a particularly feisty derby? Their latest feud is more administrative, with Galatasaray irked by their rivals putting five stars on their shirts to symbolise winning the domestic title on 28 occasions – clubs are permitted one star per five titles. However, nine of those championships were won before the creation of the Super Lig in 1959 and are not acknowledged. Galatasaray, Turkey’s most successful club, with four official stars above the crest, have not taken the added decagons well. It is a matter of prestige. This has added spice to a season that has Fenerbahce installed as favourites to secure the title. They have made some shrewd signings, including Joshua King and Bruma, and have found their feet, winning their past two games 6-0 and 4-2 after an entertaining opening day 3-3 draw against Umraniyespor. Enner Valencia, the former West Ham striker, has scored six goals in three league games to lay down a marker. Elsewhere in Istanbul, Besiktas’s transfer strategy is based on reigniting stalling careers. Gedson Fernandes, Wout Weghorst, Cenk Tosun and, most notably, the former England international Dele Alli have all landed at Vodafone Park this summer to become part of Valérien Ismaël’s band of forgotten former Premier League stars. They will all be trying to catch Trabzonspor who missed out on Champions League group stage football this week after their loss to Copenhagen, meaning there will be no Turkish representatives, a sign of the country’s decline on the European stage. Israel, Scotland and Czech Republic can all boast of teams in Europe’s elite competition. Besiktas did make it to the group stage last year, losing all six matches by an aggregate score of 19-3.Galatasaray will be hoping they can live up to their historic expectation because another woeful season would be a most unwelcome hell.",Galatasaray; Trabzonspor; Football; Sport,Football
2022-11-28T16:44:03Z,How the lights went out on Bulb – and the wrangle over its future,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/28/how-the-lights-went-out-on-bulb-and-the-wrangle-over-its-future-energy-octopus,"In the quiet confines of a courtroom in the City of London, the future of the government’s biggest bailout since the financial crisis could be determined on Tuesday. A decision on rubber stamping Octopus’s takeover of the collapsed energy supplier Bulb takes place in the Rolls Building, where commercial disputes are settled. A judge will decide on timing of the energy transfer scheme, effectively deciding how and when Bulb’s 1.5 million customers will find a new home. The deal has been at the centre of a wrangle in which rivals claimed a lack of transparency from Octopus and the government. If the deal is approved, rivals may attempt a judicial review. If it is kiboshed, champions of the takeover argue Bulb’s value could fall and costs to taxpayers could rise even further. A dispute over the true cost of Bulb to the government is well under way, after it was revealed that the bill has hit £6.5bn. The government’s spending watchdog is also scrutinising the deal. Bulb flickers into life To rewind: Bulb was the brainchild of co-founders Amit Gudka and Hayden Wood. Before its collapse last year, the latter was a regular fixture on the public circuit, evangelising about how Bulb would shake up the lumbering energy supply market with slick tech and renewable energy. Wood, a privately educated Tottenham Hotspur fan and self-confessed “music geek”, began his education in the energy sector by advising some of the Big Six power firms, including npower, when working as a management consultant for Bain. He met up after work with fellow music fan Gudka, a gas and electricity trader at Barclays and DJ, who ran the Man Make Music record label and club night. In their evening sessions, the pair would rant about how they believed large energy companies were ripping off consumers and offering poor service. The timing of Bulb’s launch, in 2015, was impeccable: energy regulator Ofgem had launched a shake-up to encourage competition, which was later followed by a price cap pushed by the former prime minister Theresa May. Wood and Gudka’s fledgling venture took off, quickly attracting customers with lucrative referral payments and green energy boasts that would later be questioned. Investors, including the US hedge fund Magnetar Capital, bought into their vision and, in 2018, Wood and Gudka were able to cash out £4m of shares each as part of a fundraise. Their stakes would later be valued at more than £100m as Bulb grew to become a £350m entity, but much of their fortune was ultimately wiped out by its collapse. Bulb became Britain’s fastest-growing energy company, gaining 1.5 million customers and considerable political attention. In the summer of 2021, it even hosted Boris Johnson at its central London Bishopsgate headquarters, where the then prime minister sported a white mask with Bulb scrawled in pink upon it. As a member of the government’s Council for Sustainable Business, Wood advised the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on making companies greener. He is understood to have used the role to brief against rivals. He has since left the position. Bulb’s connections to Westminster were aided by Hanbury Strategy, a lobbying and public relations firm set up by David Cameron’s former director of strategy Ameet Gill. The founders built a team of “Bulberinos”, as the firm called its employees, a youthful workforce with a mission to lower bills and carbon emissions. However, Wood later admitted the company’s breakneck growth led some employees to become unhappy, amid claims of a “toxic” culture and long hours. Ultimately, Bulb’s demise echoed that of many of the 28 other energy suppliers to have collapsed, with those other failures costing billpayers £2.7bn. A sharp rise in wholesale gas prices in 2021 left suppliers desperate to pass on costs to consumers; however Ofgem’s price cap largely prevented this, pushing companies to the wall. For Bulb, its ineffective hedging policy resulted in it becoming the largest supplier failure to date. So large, in fact, that the government effectively nationalised it – appointing the advisory firm Teneo to run an administration process and enlisting investment bank Lazard to find a buyer. Wood was condemned for retaining his £250,000 salary during the administration. The process dragged on for a year, with six players – including France’s EDF – initially interested. British Gas owner Centrica and Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s clean energy company, submitted bids before later dropping out. After months of negotiations, Octopus confirmed the acquisition late last month, fending off a last ditch tilt by Ovo. The Octopus founder, Greg Jackson, has said it represents a “fair deal” for taxpayers, and is subject to a profit-share agreement. But questions are mounting over the price, structure and terms. “We’re concerned there has been some form of sweetheart deal with the government,” says one rival. Bulb is rumoured to have cost Octopus £100m to £200m and will make it the third-largest UK energy supplier behind British Gas and E.ON, with 4.9 million customers. The lengthy sale process appears to have cost Bulb – and the taxpayer – dear. The Office for Budget Responsibility this month estimated the cost of running Bulb had increased by £4.6bn since March to £6.5bn, exceeding the gloomiest forecasts of around £4bn. It threatens to add £200 each to household bills, on top of £94 for other supplier failures. The government disputes the OBR figure. Ironically, given hedging appears to have been Bulb’s original downfall, the then business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng deemed the strategy of trying to lock in its energy needs in advance “very risky”. However, as Russia’s weaponisation of gas pushed up wholesale prices, the risk of not hedging appears to have weighed heavy. The decision not to hedge has since been criticised. However, one former insider at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy defended the move: “Companies hedge to protect themselves in case they are unable to repay the cost. The government does not have this issue. The market has been so volatile and gas prices have come down, so Bulb may have been making a profit recently. It’s much more nuanced than has been portrayed.” Bulb’s Trustpilot page indicates its reputation for strong customer service has been difficult to maintain during the administration, with a string of recent reviews from consumers venting their frustration on the review site. Sources close to the Octopus takeover still expect it to be approved. Even if it is given the green light, the dust has not settled on the administration process. A high court judge is scrutinising the £25m of fees charged by Teneo, the company appointed by Ofgem to run the process. Running simultaneously to Bulb’s administration, restructuring experts from Interpath were appointed to its parent company, Simple Energy, by Sequoia Economic Infrastructure Income Fund, Simple’s sole secured creditor. Sequoia was owed £55m, and £10m had been paid back by June. Work in recent months has focused on carving out Bulb’s IT arm, Simple Energy Technology (SET), which employs about 70 people in London. Bulb’s tech was seen as slick, but Octopus has its own platform, Kraken. The hope is now that Bulb’s tech can be licensed. SET’s chief executive, John Marshall, said it would “now focus on bringing our technology to energy companies and consumers in the UK and around the world”. Interpath said it expect a dividend to be paid to unsecured creditors “although the return may be modest”. As shareholders, Wood and Gudka would only receive any returns after unsecured creditors had been paid in full. Simple also held a minority stake in Virmati, the battery storage venture Gudka set up after leaving Bulb. It was later rebranded Field, and Gudka told the Guardian he planned to expand the fledgling business overseas. Wood has remained largely away from the limelight, becoming a partner at London-based venture capital fund Giant Ventures, which counts the former BP boss Lord Browne and the former foreign secretary David Miliband as advisory board members. Giant has invested in Field, as well as healthcare and financial services businesses. Wood has also signed up to the Founders Pledge, a commitment to donate “a meaningful percentage of your personal proceeds at the point of liquidity to the non-profits of your choice”. There will be plenty who argue if this comes to pass, the government should top the list. Gudka, Bulb and Giant declined to comment. In a rare public comment, Wood told the Guardian: “I’m very sorry for the way things turned out. I’m disappointed in the outcome, and did everything I could to avoid it, and protect consumers and taxpayers. While I was still at Bulb, I worked extremely hard with my team to minimise costs to the taxpayer, protect jobs and continue serving our customers.”",Energy industry; UK news; Business,Business
2021-11-22T18:43:52Z,‘Too good to be true’: the rapid rise and costly fall of Bulb Energy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/22/greenwashing-bulb-energy-critics-collapse-coming,"Bulb Energy was once the fastest-growing supplier in Britain’s energy market, and one of the UK’s most celebrated startups. But the company may be best remembered as the biggest casualty of the energy market crisis after it handed the responsibility for supplying gas and electricity to 1.7m homes to a special administrator on Monday. Its collapse marks a catastrophic fall from grace for a company that in the space of six years won the approval of government ministers and catapulted its chief executive, Hayden Wood, to leading positions in a string of business initiatives including the government’s Council for Sustainable Business. The company was founded in east London in 2015 by early-thirtysomething entrepreneurs Amit Gudka and Wood with the intention of challenging the remaining dominance of the energy industry’s legacy supply giants. Gudka had eight years’ experience trading electricity and gas at Barclays, and Wood had 10 years as a management consultant, first at Monitor Group and then at Bain &amp; Company. Within six years the company claimed 6% of the energy market, and helped to pioneer a number of tech startup campaigns including the government’s kickstart scheme for unemployed young people, and the Tech Zero climate taskforce in June this year. Wood, 38, gravitated towards the limelight, appearing at events alongside ministers such as the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and hosting Boris Johnson at his London headquarters in July. As one of a handful of executives on the Council for Sustainable Business, he advised the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on making companies greener. Bulb’s rapid ascent was powered by early backing from investment fund DST Global, owned by the Israeli-Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner, and Magnetar Capital, and it hoped to grow its business beyond Britain’s borders to reach more than 100 million “members”, its preferred term for customers, by the end of the decade. Instead the company burned through its cash while posting successive financial losses, as fresh concerns over its funding, “toxic work culture” and rising customers complaints began to emerge. By February this year, Gudka left the company to start a new battery firm. And, by June, Bulb was forced to seek a reprieve on its loan repayments by lenders, including Milner. The company’s collapse came as little surprise to anyone in the energy industry. “Sadly, today’s news has been a long time coming,” said Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower. “If we are to learn anything from this crisis, it is that we need a sustainable and responsible supplier market in which companies are able to withstand market shocks. The government now has a vested interest in working the industry and the regulator to ensure this happens.” Bulb’s major strength was its marketing: it excelled at attracting new customers through lucrative referral payments and green energy claims, and managed to secure willing investors by talking up its credentials as a tech startup. But Bulb’s rivals have long claimed that the company’s business model, green credentials and fundraising were all unsustainable because it relied on greenwashing, and “too good to be true” energy prices to help fuel its rapid growth. Government officials and ministers were also taken in by Bulb’s seemingly unstoppable success, and as one senior industry source said, and “loved them” because “they came in to challenge the incumbent suppliers and grew at scale”. “As an energy challenger, having something which fundamentally differentiates you in the market is really important. I don’t think Bulb ever did,” the source said. “They were always greenwashing. They never had a tech proposition on a par with Octopus Energy or Ovo Energy.” The stellar growth was useful in distracting investors from its limited success in developing its own technology, the source said. But as energy prices began to rise, and investor interest began to wane, Bulb’s ready supply of financial support began to run out. “It was always a struggle to see how this company would be viable over the long term,” the source added. • This article was amended on 23 November 2021 to more accurately describe Milner as Israeli-Russian, rather than “Russian”.",Energy industry; Business; Renewable energy; Energy; UK news; Household bills,Business
2022-04-24T05:00:14Z,Meta investors brace for a difficult quarter after stocks nosedive,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/23/meta-earnings-report-preview-facebook,"Meta experienced a historic nosedive in value earlier this year amid a major rebrand and shake-ups to its business model – and investors are bracing for another difficult quarter. Meta lost a record $230bn in market value after a disappointing earnings report in February, in which it revealed Facebook had recorded its first-ever drop in daily user numbers. While investors will be eagerly watching Meta’s first quarter report on Wednesday for signs of recovery, a “full turnaround is not expected”, said Debra Williamson, principal analyst at market research firm Insider Intelligence. “It is going to be slow progress for Meta after its massive stock decline last quarter,” she said. “But we – and advertisers in particular – are hoping to see some progress.” Meta’s struggle was not completely unexpected: chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg had warned that new privacy rules from Apple could cost the company $10bn in lost sales this year. The regulations prevent Meta from collecting certain user data and have prompted the company to shift some of its core advertising business models. One such shift is placing substantial emphasis on Reels, its shortform video content that it has yet struggled to monetize. The company warned in last quarter’s report that year-over-year growth could continue to be affected in the first quarter of 2022 by these issues. “We expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people’s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories,” said the CFO, David Wehner, in a guidance statement. Meta’s pivot to video represents an effort to retain young users – a key advertising demographic that has been leaving Facebook and Instagram in droves. Advertising makes up 97% of Meta’s revenue, documents leaked by the company whistleblower Frances Haugen have shown. Meta has a “formidable competitor in TikTok”, said Williamson, and has yet to create a sustainable business model in response. “They said last quarter they were going to figure out how to better monetize Reels,” she said. “This quarter, we are looking for signs that is actually happening.” Meanwhile, the company’s proprietary virtual reality platform, the Metaverse, is sucking away large amounts of funding from core businesses such as Facebook and Instagram. Meta funneled $10bn in funding into the platform in 2021 alone – more than 10 times what it paid to acquire Instagram in 2012. The Metaverse faces a long road to profitability, said Raj Shah, an analyst at consultancy firm Publicis Sapient. Successful monetization often requires a critical mass of users – Facebook, for example, has nearly 3 billion. But its Metaverse brand Horizon Worlds currently has just 300,000 and is only available in the US and Canada. “We see no reason to believe that this quarter for Meta will be significantly different than last,” he said. “Meta has announced new monetization schemes for its Metaverse investments, but adoption is still low.” User numbers are critical to Meta’s success – and a historic loss in users on its Facebook platform was one of the most impactful takeaways from its 2021 fourth quarter report. That loss underscored that Meta’s biggest short-term challenge is to stem the decline in usage, Williamson said. “This was a wake-up call to the market and also to the advertising community that this is a platform that is flattening – it is not the sexy, bright shiny object any more,” she said. User numbers will probably be further hit by bans of Meta products in Russia – where it hosted millions of users – amid its ongoing war with Ukraine, said Martin Garner, COO at market research firm CCS Insight. The country blocked Facebook and Instagram in March, citing Meta as an “extremist organization”. “With next week’s results we expect Meta to continue its run of challenging quarters,” he said. • This article was amended on 25 April 2022. An earlier version said that Horizon Worlds currently has 30,000 users worldwide, when it has 300,000 users and is currently only available in the US and Canada. It was also amended to reflect that 97% of Meta’s revenue comes from all advertising, not from young users specifically.",Meta; Facebook; Technology; Social media; Business; Stock markets; US news,Technology
2022-07-05T11:00:07Z,I led the US lawsuit against big tobacco for its harmful lies. Big oil is next | Sharon Y Eubanks,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/05/us-lawsuit-big-tobacco-big-oil-fossil-fuel-companies,"In 2005, I was the lead counsel on behalf of the US in one of the biggest corporate accountability legal actions ever filed. That trial proved that the tobacco industry knew it was selling and marketing a harmful product, that it had funded denial of public health science, and had used deceptive advertising and PR to protect assets instead of protecting consumers. Today, the fossil fuel industry finds itself in the same precarious legal position as the tobacco industry did in the late 1990s. The behaviour and goals of the tobacco and petroleum industries are pretty similar – and there are many similarities in their liabilities. Both industries lied to the public and regulators about what they knew about the harms of their products. Both lied about when they knew it. And like the tobacco industry while I was in public service, the deceptive advertising and PR of the fossil fuel industry is now under intense legal scrutiny. And the tide is beginning to turn. More than 1,800 lawsuits have been filed over climate liability worldwide. Many of these concern the misleading fake science that the industry purposely distributed to the public for decades, denying that its product was the leading cause of global climate change. Exxon knew the reality of climate change in the late 1970s and then later invested in telling the public it was not happening. The French giant Total knew and similarly funded efforts to mislead the public at around the same time. You can see echoes of the tobacco strategy in each of the memos from corporate scientists studying the climate at fossil fuel companies. Since the 1950s, tobacco companies have been certain of the health impacts of their products. Still, they spent the next 40 years developing public affairs strategies that downplayed the problem and sought to make their products more habit-forming. They did it through additives and marketing to children. At the same time, fossil fuel companies strive to keep us hooked by fighting regulations to move us towards low-carbon transportation and fearmongering about the climate transition. They also both funnelled money into promoting fake science. The American Petroleum Institute and Exxon injected large grants into the climate denial research of astrophysicist Willie Soon, in the same way that tobacco companies propped up misleading health research from well-compensated friendly scientists. The full extent of this work may never be known, as both industries often ran their grants through nonprofit intermediaries that hid the source of their cash – and in some cases, as with the Heartland Institute, both industries used the same intermediaries. The most significant legal cases facing fossil fuel companies today focus on ongoing deceptive marketing in the form of “greenwashing”. This is different from green marketing – companies that have genuinely sustainable products are, and should remain, free to market them accurately. But the oil industry is not a sustainable business – on average, less than 1% of its capital expenditures goes into low carbon projects – and free speech laws do not stop corporations making false statements. The oil and gas industry is now touting the promise of carbon capture and storage projects as a way to avoid reducing emissions. But not a single existing CCS project is viable, and no company is investing at a rate likely to make future ones viable. It’s an old bait-and-switch, as it mirrors how tobacco companies promoted various smokeless alternatives for decades. At the core of the liability issues for the fossil fuel industry is that no company has acknowledged – just as the tobacco companies refused to acknowledge – that its product is the problem. A new report from the PR and advertising advocacy campaign Clean Creatives shows how this legal and reputational risk continues to grow as the true economic and social costs of climate breakdown become ever-more real. As more communities reckon with the damages of misleading communication, more are asking for the companies responsible to be held accountable. Ultimately, the tobacco industry was brought to heel because the number of legal threats became too great to manage with single settlements or isolated legal strategies. The weight of evidence became so great that the legal risks became systemic, requiring comprehensive action from governments. The cases against fossil fuel companies are approaching a similar critical mass today. In France, Total (now TotalEnergies) has been sued for misrepresenting its climate ambition. It claimed in a marketing campaign that it could reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 while still producing more fossil fuels. Total has defended its advertisements, saying that they do not amount to greenwashing. For the first time, two US lawsuits over damages for deceptive advertising by fossil fuels companies are entering the trial phase, in Honolulu and Massachusetts. In both cases, the discussion will centre on how the industry still works with its agencies to deny, delay and downplay climate action. In the Netherlands, Shell has been the subject of numerous suits and regulatory cases, so many that its greenwashing ads now carry a humiliating disclaimer: “Shell’s operating plans and budget do not reflect Shell’s net-zero ambition.” A legal tipping point may be soon approaching for fossil fuel companies and the spin masters that work for them. As with our case against tobacco, too many lives will be lost before these cases are resolved. But accountability is coming soon, and the implications will be vast.

2022-05-28T09:00:27Z,"Rewilding, or just a greenwashed land grab? It all depends on who benefits | Eleanor Salter",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/28/rewilding-greenwash-land-schemes,"Few environmental ventures have captured the popular imagination quite like rewilding. For decades, campaigners have been clamouring for the restoration of natural ecosystems as an urgent response to climate breakdown, and as a good in itself. And now it counts more than just environmentalists among its advocates – big business and the wealthy are getting involved too. Across the UK, hundreds of thousands of acres are being snapped up for the purpose of rewilding by businesses, billionaires and asset managers. Asos billionaire Anders Povlsen and his wife, Anne, are now Scotland’s largest landowners. In a manifesto of sorts, addressed to the people of Scotland, the couple wrote that their intention was to “restore our parts of the Highlands to their former magnificent natural state and repair the harm that man has inflicted on them”. The investment companies Aviva and Standard Life have also bought land to plant forests and restore peatland. The brewery and pub chain Brewdog is planting “the biggest ever forest” in Scotland; while pop star Ed Sheeran is “trying to rewild as much of the UK as [he] can”. Whatever the virtues of these particular schemes, the practice of environmentally motivated private land purchases has attracted controversy, having been dubbed another form of “greenwashing”. In many cases, land is bought and trees are planted to “offset” the owner’s carbon emissions from elsewhere. It’s easy to see the appeal from the point of view of corporations and the wealthy. But what are the consequences for the rest of us? The race for land to use for this kind of offsetting has been supercharged by a combination of government green subsidies such as environmental land management schemes, which pay farmers and landowners to rewild, and a global appetite for carbon markets. As the researchers Laurie Macfarlane and Miriam Brett point out, land markets in the UK are lightly regulated, and tax breaks encourage investment in both land and property. This system fast-tracks sales of large areas of the UK with little scrutiny. In the UK, Scotland is the most affected: the average price of land, according to research by the estate agent Strutt &amp; Parker, jumped by 87% in the last year. Some estates have seen a 333% price increase since 2018. Many of the landowners are colloquially and pejoratively titled “green lairds”, echoing the Highland clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries. The new Somerset-based venture Real Wild Estates recently said its business model was “making nature pay, by delivering sustainable business returns” for investors. Part of the issue lies in offsets themselves. Many activists demand the UK reaches negative, not net zero, emissions – which will require significant domestic rewilding as well as huge financial flows to the global south. Offsets should be a last resort for residual emissions, reserved only to offset so-called hard to decarbonise sectors such as the steel industry. The current system provides impunity to corporations and the super-rich who can emit as much as they like so long as they plant enough trees later. This race for land will only accelerate and exacerbate the existing rural housing crisis, where prices soared in the pandemic as urban dwellers sought an escape to the country. This is compounded by the Airbnb effect – where homes are being snapped up for tourists to rent. The land bought for offsetting is often framed as derelict – an empty wilderness devoid of community. Rarely does corporate rewilding consider the displacement of communities living and working on the land. It is also having impacts on agriculture: threatening crofting in Scotland, farming in Wales and perpetuating struggles to continue farming in England. Rather than empower a generation of green lairds or eco-aristocrats, we should push for the democratisation of land ownership, using mechanisms such as community buyouts and restoring council or country farms, which are run and owned by local authorities and help new farmers get into the industry. Real land reform would root rewilding projects in people, securing good rural jobs in agro-ecology and conservation, producing sustainable food, livelihoods and a common connection to nature. There are some models for this already. The famous Langholm Moor community buyout bought 5,300 acres of land to put back under communal ownership. Another inspiring initiative can be found on the Isle of Ulva, which was brought back into community ownership in 2018. In 2015, the population had fallen to just five people. Now they’re seeing the “repeopling” of the island, and conservation projects are under way to restore habitats and biodiversity. The benefits of climate, nature and community are far from zero sum. Rewilding should not be about profit and offsets, remote and alien from rural communities. The value of a real, democratic rewilding is that it doesn’t just secure a home for beavers and sequestered carbon dioxide – but for people too.

2021-11-12T16:17:15Z,Five UK suppliers given warning over payments to renewable energy scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/12/uk-suppliers-renewable-energy-scheme-ofgem,"The energy regulator has threatened to strip five suppliers of their licences after they failed to hand over more than £500,000 collected from customers’ bills to help pay for a renewable energy support scheme. Ofgem warned Orbit Energy, Simply Your Energy, Delta Gas and Power, Social Energy Supply and Whoop Energy to pay a total of £575,000 into the pot used to support small-scale renewable energy projects such as rooftop solar panels “immediately” or face enforcement action. The suppliers all missed a payment deadline of 10 November and if they fail to comply with the latest order from Ofgem “they could end up having their licences revoked or face a financial penalty”, the regulator said. A struggle to meet industry payment obligations is often viewed by industry experts as an early sign of financial distress, which could ultimately lead a company to collapsing out of the market. The UK’s energy market faces an unprecedented spate of company collapses this winter after a global surge in gas market prices that has caused the wholesale cost of gas and electricity to climb to record highs in recent months. Since the beginning of September, 19 energy suppliers have gone bust, leaving more than 2m households in need of a new supplier. The bulk of the outstanding cash earmarked to support the government’s renewable energy feed-in tariff scheme, more than £450,000, is owed by Orbit. The company was told last week by the electricity system administrator, Elexon, that it had defaulted and would not be allowed to register new customers on the system’s IT infrastructure. Delta Gas and Power and Whoop Energy owe the energy regulator £46,701 and £19,013 respectively towards the feed-in tariff scheme. The pair were also late paying the regulator to support the government’s support scheme for large-scale renewable energy projects such as offshore wind and solar farms. They were given until the end of last month to pay their outstanding balances, plus interest, or face the possibility that the regulator may choose to revoke their supply licenses. The final warnings come less than a fortnight after Ofgem promised to reform the energy market, and begin “raising the bar” on its standards for supplier finances to ensure they offer “a sustainable business model” that minimises risks to consumers. Simply Your Energy and Social Energy Supply owe the regulator £28,353 and £28,735 respectively under the feed-in tariff.",Energy industry; Ofgem; Business; Energy bills; Consumer affairs; Money; Environment; UK news,Business

He inherited troublesome Trent 1000 engines, issued two profits warnings in his first six months in 2015 and had to cope with a thumping fine from the Serious Fraud Office for events before his time. Just when the clouds cleared, and £1bn of annual cashflow could be glimpsed, the pandemic struck, obliterating income that depended on aircraft with Rolls engines recording hours in the air. By the autumn of 2020, the company’s survival was in doubt. The painful remedy was a £7bn package comprising a hefty rights issue, extra borrowing, asset disposals and a heavy round of job losses. Against that backdrop, the direct fresh uncertainty for Rolls created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could almost be viewed as modest. Annual revenues from Russian airlines may dwindle towards zero with sanctions, but the current figure (£170m) is tiny in a group context. A more serious problem may be sourcing titanium for engines since Rolls buys 20% of its supply from Russia but, in the end, that headache ought to be manageable. The effect of indirect uncertainties, though, is hard to assess. Further delay to the recovery in the long-haul civil aviation market is now the way to bet, especially if oil prices stay above $100 a barrel, but the degree is anyone’s guess. In the circumstances, an underwhelming forecast of “positive free cashflow” and “broadly unchanged” operating profit margins of 3.8% in 2022 wasn’t much comfort for investors who crave medium-term predictability. The shares fell 13%. The shame is that East has done an excellent job. The boast that Rolls is now “a more balanced and more sustainable business” is basically correct, especially the second part thanks to net zero efforts in electric power systems, clean jet fuel, small modular reactors and the like. East has 10 months left, which probably won’t be long enough for him to prove his point in terms of the share price. Keep going, though. Chris O’Shea plays it savvy Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, is displaying more savvy than his predecessor. Outrage over boardroom bonuses was almost an annual occurrence during Iain Conn’s ill-starred reign of credit downgrades, dividend cuts and a crumbling share price. By contrast, O’Shea is forfeiting a £1.1m bonus in sympathy with customers facing rocketing energy bills. Sensible. It remains to be seen whether the move, plus a return of £27m of furlough money, will count for anything amid continuing talk of windfall taxes, where Centrica is theoretically exposed thanks to its remaining North Sea oil and gas fields that were the biggest driver of the group’s doubled operating profits of £948m for 2021. But one has to concede that O’Shea has a point about regular taxes looking windfall-ish from the point of view of the Treasury: Centrica’s bill was £480m, versus virtually nothing a year ago. Whatever happens on that front, O’Shea is definitely correct in his call for banking-style “prudential regulation” for retail energy suppliers given that failed companies invariably impose costs on everybody’s customers. He means “fit and proper” tests and, crucially, ring-fencing of customers’ deposits. Centrica has recently adopted the latter policy voluntarily but all firms should be made to fall into line sharpish. Critics may spy a plot to favour large suppliers. Actually, it’s a matter of treating punters fairly. Lloyds have been this way before The entire UK financial industry seems obsessed with the idea of catering for the needs of the “mass affluent”, by which they mean people with investable savings of more than £75,000, and here comes Charlie Nunn, new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group with his version. One sees the appeal. We’re told that, on average, Lloyds customers hold 2.4 financial products with the bank but have seven overall. So use all those data insights to grab a bit more business from a semi-captive audience. That’s the theory, but banks (including Lloyds) have been round this cross-selling track in the past and have found that specialist providers tend to defend their territory fiercely. To be fair, Lloyds, by virtue of its sheer size, probably stands a fair chance of success. And Nunn set a few hard targets for extra revenues from a £4bn investment plan that, it should be said, is wider than just wealth management. After almost a decade of no growth at Lloyds during its recovery phase, he had to try something new. But one can’t call it a bold new direction.

2021-11-24T18:41:35Z,The Guardian view on the energy crisis: a Bulb goes out | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-energy-crisis-a-bulb-goes-out,"The crisis in the UK’s energy market has been growing in scale and seriousness for months. This week it claimed its latest corporate victim – and reached a tipping point. Bulb is the 23rd energy supplier to fail since August, but, unlike minnows such as Igloo and Neon Reef, it cannot easily be taken over by a rival. With turnover of £1.5bn, it is simply too big. Bulb will instead enter “special administration” and be run on behalf of the government until it can be broken up or sold off. Meanwhile, its 1.7 million customers will remain with the company and get the same corporate branding on their bills, even while taxpayers stump up for any immediate costs. Any final losses will be passed on to households through their fuel bills. Like the other corporate failures before it, Bulb has been quick to blame the government-imposed cap on fuel bills, which limited how far it could pass on the soaring costs it faced in the wholesale market. But Bulb’s directors and investors have their own case to face. Founded in 2015, the startup posed as less of an energy company and more of a tech firm – the Deliveroo or Uber of the fuel market that would challenge the old logic of the sector. Like any Silicon Valley wannabe, it was more bothered about market share than profit – which was handy, as it never made one. Instead, it took on households and business customers at below cost and sported groovy advertising. A triumph of marketing, it brought no real innovation to the industry. For government ministers, this was the hungry young competitor from central casting. Its east London offices were visited this July by Boris Johnson who, with his customary restraint and financial acumen, declared it a “wonderful company”. Its chief executive, 38-year-old Hayden Wood, was placed on the government’s Sustainable Business Council. Sadly, his own business has proved wholly unsustainable. There is about this whole sorry affair a strong whiff of Northern Rock. In the 2000s, that was a challenger bank offering cheap mortgages, indulged by a dopey regulator and all the while relying on a precarious business model. Just like the old Newcastle bank, Bulb’s collapse raises some serious questions about the true purpose of competition in what is a utility sector. If a taxi app collapses, it ultimately does not matter as much as the failure of a supplier of finance or fuel. In the short term, one obvious solution is for the watchdog Ofgem to pay far more attention to the financial viability of businesses in its sector. That will frankly make it harder for smaller players without ready access to a cash fountain. So over the long run there is a big question about how the sector can deliver lower prices and energy security while helping the UK move towards a lower carbon future. The answer to that will probably not lie wholly through a market solution. It may involve a much larger role for the state, either through further regulation and funding, or even a public sector entity. Someone should tell Sid. • This article was amended on 25 November 2021.

2022-08-18T06:36:38Z,Are indoor vertical farms really ‘future-proofing agriculture’?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/indoor-vertical-farms-agriculture,"At a hyper-controlled indoor farm in industrial South San Francisco, four robots named John, Paul, George and Ringo carefully transfer seedlings from barcoded trays into 15-plus foot towers that are then hung vertically inside a 4,800 sq ft grow room. Inside the hygienic space, which is operated by the indoor farming company Plenty, there’s no soil, sunlight or tractors, but rows of hanging crops illuminated by colorful LED lights and carefully monitored by cameras, sensors and artificial intelligence. Once a tower is ready to be harvested, a balletic automated process reminiscent of a dry cleaner’s conveyor belt begins. A robot named Garfunkel (a nearby counterpart is called Simon) gently grabs and turns the tower on its side before setting it down to be trimmed by a machine. Workers in navy branded jumpsuits inspect the greens for any defects, but there are almost none. Then the pesticide-free product is packaged and put on a truck to be delivered to a local market where the customer becomes the first person to touch it. Welcome to the world of indoor vertical farming, which, depending on who you ask, will revolutionize the future of agriculture in a warming world, or is a problematic climate solution due to its high energy costs. “We’re moving into an age where climate change is changing what we grow and how we grow it,” said Nate Storey, Plenty’s co-founder and chief science officer. “Ultimately, I think we’re future-proofing agriculture for our species.” With the world’s population expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050, most of whom will be living in cities, experts say it will require a 70% increase from current levels of global food production. But with agricultural land in short supply thanks to climate crisis and urbanization, it’s clear today’s food systems are not ready. It’s estimated there are more than 2,000 vertical farms in the US growing produce such as lettuce, herbs and berries. Market leaders such as Plenty, Bowery, Kalera and AeroFarms – which can operate 365 days a year regardless of weather conditions – and sprawling greenhouses from companies like AppHarvest and Gotham Greens, see themselves as part of the solution. And investors clearly agree. Indoor farming raised over $1bn in 2021, exceeding the combined funding generated in 2018 and 2019, and the industry is expected to grow to $9.7bn worldwide by 2026. Earlier this year, Walmart announced an investment in Plenty as part of its $400m Series E funding round. The retail giant will source leafy greens for all of its California stores from Plenty’s new 95,000 sq ft flagship farm in Compton, California, which will open early next year. Plenty will also be growing Driscoll’s strawberries indoors at their Laramie, Wyoming, research and development farm as part of a new agreement. But critics say the massive energy costs needed to run vertical farms and greenhouses make the practice far less eco-friendly than their branding suggests and question how they can truly feed a world that relies on calories from grains such as soy, corn and wheat. Designed to produce yields hundreds of times larger than traditional outdoor farming, vertical farms occupy spaces such as buildings or shipping containers while using 70 to 95% less water since they can recapture and recycle water rather than waste it due to poor irrigation or evaporation. Products are fully traceable from seed to shelf, stay fresher longer and there’s little risk of bacteria like E coli, which led to large recalls of romaine lettuce in 2019 and 2020, since there’s no contamination from runoff water, infected animal feces or having to travel long distances in trucks and cargo planes. Large-scale vertical farms are typically built near cities where greens can be bred for flavor rather than storage. With futuristic farming there’s no need for lettuce to sit inside a truck for days losing its quality and nutritional value. California’s ongoing drought, the demand for locally grown food and the recent failures of the supply chain during the pandemic has made the practice, which is already popular in parts of Asia, Europe and the Middle East, especially attractive. “What’s clear to me is that we’re living in an increasingly unreliable and uncertain world,” said Irving Fain, CEO and founder of Manhattan-based Bowery Farming. “We need to find certainty and reliability – and we need to act now.” Bowery’s smart farms in the north-east collect billions of real-time data points via sensors and cameras that feed into machine-learning algorithms to provide their produce to more than 1,100 grocery stores, including Whole Foods, Albertsons, Safeway and Amazon. In the process of trying to find solutions to vulnerabilities in the food system, entrepreneurs like Fain say they’re gathering the kind of knowledge about plant growth and agronomy that would take a traditional farmer outdoors hundreds of years to accumulate. “We’re reimagining farming and reinventing the fresh food supply chain and rebuilding one that’s a lot simpler, safer, has much more surety of supply and ultimately it’s much more sustainable as well,” said Fain. But not everyone is as optimistic about indoor farming’s prospects. Washington Post columnist and co-host of the Climavores podcast Tamar Haspel calls vertical farming “lettuce for rich people”. During a recent episode on vertical farms, Haspel and co-host Mike Grunwald highlighted the ways growing upwards indoors can bypass so many of the problems related to traditional farming, but say that the huge energy costs required to power vertical farms make them a “deal-breaker”. While Plenty, Bowery and other vertical farms don’t release data on how much energy they use, the 2021 Global CEA Census Report found that greenhouse growers used 15-20 times as much energy, on average, and vertical farms used a little over 100 times as much energy as outdoor lettuce growers in Arizona. The same report noted that smaller facilities had significantly higher energy use relative to larger counterparts. Other experts aren’t so sure. Gail Taylor, the department chair of plant sciences at the University of California, Davis, said that while vertical farming is energy intensive in its current form, so is traditional outdoor farming. “Sometimes we forget all the consequential effects like how many times you drive a tractor over a field or how many trucks you use to bring lettuce from the west coast to the east coast and fly food all around the world,” Taylor said. Agriculture is already responsible for about 30% of total global emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other planet-warming gasses. Researchers say cutting emissions from food is crucial in the fight to slow climate crisis. Greenhouses have helped turn the Netherlands into the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter by value, sending over $10bn in tomatoes, cucumbers and bell peppers to neighboring countries such as Germany, Belgium and France in 2020. But some Dutch greenhouses recently had to go dark or scale back production due to soaring power prices. About 8.2% of the country’s overall consumption of fuel is attributed to the glass structures, which require heating and artificial light to supplement sunlight. While growing in controlled environments has been around since the 1970s, what made indoor vertical farming a reality in recent years was the significant drop in price of LED lights, which plummeted as much as 94% between 2008 and 2015. The industry is counting on the grid continuing to get greener, which would drive power pricing down. “New energy sources will come online,” said Storey, of Plenty. “We’re going to see a massive and rapid evolution in the space that I think is going to shock people.” Farms like Plenty and Bowery are already powered entirely by renewables, but Kale Harbick, a research agricultural engineer at the USDA who works on the optimization of controlled-environment agriculture, said it was important to understand the scale of the problem. He said if you put a vertical farm in a skyscraper like the World Trade Center to grow lettuce and wanted to power it with renewable energy like solar, you would have to bulldoze the rest of the island of Manhattan to make room for panels to generate enough power just for the lights of that building. “There are certainly benefits for renewables, but I wouldn’t call them a silver bullet,” he said. Industry watchers say indoor farms have made big strides in recent years, and that it’s important to remember that we’re only at the start of the vertical farming journey. “I believe that over the next 10 years, we will see the industry expand as vertical farms adopt more sustainable business models and the costs of vertical farming decrease,” said technology analyst Brandon Beh, co-author of a recent report by the technology company IDTechEx on vertical farming. “Vertical farms do address a key consumer demand for fresh, organic produce,” Beh said. “However, I wouldn’t go so far as to say the industry will replace, or even overtake, conventional agriculture.” While some ag-tech entrepreneurs believe they can grow almost anything indoors, others admit it’s not feasible to produce grain crops such as wheat or corn due to basic economics. “Field crops are always going to be the best way to do calorie grains,” Harbick said. Researchers are redesigning plants to grow in these new systems, so stone fruits, mushrooms, eggplants, peppers and cacao plants may be growing indoors in the near future. About one-third of tomatoes are currently grown in greenhouses, but Harbick doesn’t see them being the right fit for vertical farms since they require 60% more electricity to grow than lettuce. He said a diverse food supply system where some foods are grown in the field, some in greenhouses and some in vertical farms would be more resilient and robust. Taylor said people need to start reimagining indoor farms as part of the circular economy, noting that other forms of renewable energy, like anaerobic digestion – a process through which bacteria break down organic matter like food waste – can be used to help power indoor farms. Another solution would be to build vertical farms and greenhouses near decarbonizing industrial hubs that are trying to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, so farms could capture their heat and carbon dioxide to save electricity costs. And while some farmers and scientists are critical about the influx of capital into the vertical and greenhouse farming space, saying indoor-grown food isn’t necessarily better for people or the environment, Taylor said it doesn’t need to be an either/or proposition. “[Indoor farms] are never going to replace outdoor agriculture,” she said, “they’re only going to enhance it and make food supply systems better for the world.”",US news; Environment; Agriculture; Farming,Environment
2022-02-24T19:20:06Z,"‘Milestone year’: in its 150th year, the Co-op Bank can see a brighter future",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/milestone-year-hedge-funds-mull-future-of-revived-co-op-bank,"Nearly every UK bank has struggled over the past decade managing the fallout of multibillion pound taxpayer bailouts, business scams or devastating IT meltdowns. But few have faced quite as many scandals, near-failures and turnaround efforts as the Co-operative Bank. During that period the mid-size lender has teetered on collapse, its former chief executive was charged for drug possession, it has been bailed out by a group of hedge funds and it has changed its boss six times in nine years. But the bank, which has its roots in the ethical co-operative movements and was formed in 1872, has survived the fallout of the so-called Crystal Methodist scandal and is now enjoying relative stability under its hedge fund owners, who have seen it to its first profit in a decade. Its newest chief executive, Nick Slape, is insistent that the bank’s 150th anniversary this year will be a turning point. He says it is an opportunity to look beyond recent scandals and spark new excitement over the UK’s “original ethical bank”, which reported on Thursday a £31m profit for 2021 – its first since 2011. The Co-op Bank also more than tripled its bonus pot for bankers to £13.3m after what it described as a “milestone year”. Slape’s team have been rifling through archives to prepare for November’s anniversary. The bank traces its origins to the 1872 establishment of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the body that would become the Co-operative Group. It was meant to provide financial services to the wider co-operative movement in Britain, in which member-owned businesses worked for the common good. While the bank has since separated from the group, having been taken over by its hedge fund investors as part of a £700m rescue deal in 2017, and no longer counts itself as a member-owned organisation, it has tried to maintain its ethical roots. Although hedge funds and private equity investors are often slated for their focus on maximising profits and short-term gains, Slape is quick to emphasise that the bank’s ethical policies are enshrined in its articles of association, which its shareholders have in effect signed up to. “We take it seriously: with real policies that are approved by the board, and a values and ethics committee that monitors it all, and we report it to the Co-operatives UK,” Slape said, referring to the national industry body that monitors and coordinates on behalf of co-operatives across the country. In 2019, the bank agreed to formally recognise a customer “union” aimed at protecting its ethical policies, which was formed out of the Save Our Bank campaign after the Co-operative Bank’s near collapse in 2013, the year the lender’s financial troubles first came to light. That year, a £1.5bn hole was discovered in its accounts after the disastrous 2009 takeover of the Britannia building society. “That led to its own kind of crisis over the next few years,” Slape said, resulting in the first rescue deal that started the bank’s disentanglement from the larger Co-operative Group. Its troubles were compounded when the bank’s former chair, the ex-Labour councillor and Methodist church minister Paul Flowers, nicknamed the Crystal Methodist, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. Slape said Flowers’ charges drove away more customers than the bank’s balance sheet woes ever did. “The only time that they ever really moved away was with the news of the previous chairman that was in the tabloids,” he said. “That clearly played very much on the ethics and the values of the bank. So that’s when my predecessors saw [customer] attrition. Other than that, we’ve got really loyal customers that have stuck with us.” That loyalty was maintained even after the hedge funds took full control nearly five years ago. The group, which includes Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital and Cyrus Capital and the fund manager Invesco, now collectively owns 85% of the bank, with the remainder held by a range of undisclosed institutional investors. Every Co-operative Bank chief executive since has been dogged by questions about when its hedge fund owners will plot an exit. They came close in November 2020, when the New York-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management offered about £270m to buy the lender. However, those talks broke down a month later. No further offers have been made and Slape, a former Lloyds, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch banker, is setting his sights on future growth. Having already built up more capital – the financial cushion banks must hold to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets – the Co-operative Bank has an opportunity finally to return some cash to its shareholders, or, as Slape puts it, “invest in something”. That could mean buying a loan portfolio or buying another bank to merge with the lender, which on its own has 3.2 million personal customers, 95,000 business clients and 50 branches across the UK. Slape’s team in October tabled a tentative offer, which has since been rejected, for the takeover of the banking rival TSB. But with the Co-operative Bank’s credit rating on the rise – Moody’s upgraded the bank’s unsecured debt rating by two notches last month – Slape says it has further opportunities on the horizon. “We’ve got some big enablers that have been put in place that are allowing us to sort of think about things that we couldn’t think about before, when we weren’t profitable. So all of these things are positive,” he said. Moody’s credited the bank’s upgrade on its “continued progress towards a more sustainable business model” and its improving profitability, but added that the latter could remain “very weak” during the next 12-18 months and that a further downgrade could be possible if profitability proved unsustainable beyond 2021. However, those risks seem unlikely to phase Slape, who is toying with the idea of a stock market flotation that would allow the Co-operative Bank’s longstanding hedge fund investors to exit by 2023. “We’ve got a strong board, we do all our reporting completely consistent of what you do as a public company. So it’s not a big step-change for us,” Slape said. “This is clearly an option.”",Banking; Business; Hedge funds,Business
2021-11-27T08:00:52Z,Bulb chief used government advisory role to ‘brief against’ rivals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/27/bulb-chief-used-government-advisory-role-to-brief-against-rivals,"Collapsed energy supplier Bulb Energy appears to have used its role advising ministers on green business to exaggerate its own environmental credentials, while playing down rivals’ progress. Bulb’s chief executive, Hayden Wood, used a meeting of the Council for Sustainable Business (CSB), attended by key government officials and MPs, to highlight its green progress ahead of the Cop26 climate talks and boast about £4.5m it has donated to organisations fighting climate change. Bulb this week became the biggest energy supplier casualty of the gas price spike, when it was taken over by the British government via a so-called “special administration”. That means the effective nationalisation of the company, which has 1.7m customers, and could cost the taxpayer more than £1.7bn over the winter, as the government underwrites its power purchases. Wood, 38, who co-founded Bulb in 2015, is still running the company during the administration on a salary believed to be £113,000 – something that has stoked further controversy given that he was the architect of Bulb’s meteoric but heavily loss-making growth. The briefing paper, seen by the Guardian and dated January 2021, has infuriated rival energy companies which claim that Bulb Energy was effectively able to use its privileged role at the CSB to gain special access to ministers and “brief against” its rivals. The CSB is made up of senior business figures and led by Severn Trent’s boss, Liv Garfield. It reports to Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It is understood that Bulb, which played a key role in a number of government-led business initiatives and hosted Boris Johnson at its headquarters in July, presented directly via video link to a number of key policymakers within the government’s environment department, including Zac Goldsmith, Rebecca Pow and George Eustice. Other energy companies were invited to give their views on progress towards the UK’s climate goals to the CSB at a later date, in a process moderated by the industry trade body Energy UK. Bulb briefed the MPs on the plans of nine of its rivals, including Scottish Power and Octopus Energy – but failed to mention their multibillion-pound investments in renewable energy projects vital to meeting the UK’s net zero projects and appeared to criticise the absence of net zero targets. One senior energy industry source, who asked not to be named, said: “It’s a bit rich for a company which presented itself as a ‘disruptor’, acting for the benefit of their customers, to be taking shots at rivals which invest billions in clean energy while it spends its money on expanding overseas and leaving UK taxpayers in the lurch when the gamble doesn’t pay off.” Bulb has been accused of greenwashing because it does not invest directly in renewable energy projects such as wind turbines, and relies on controversial green energy certificates and carbon offsetting to market its energy as clean. The source added: “It’s not the case that you need to be a big supplier to invest in the renewable energy projects which supply your customers. Good Energy has been a great example of a small company which plays its part. But Bulb has not spent a penny on building new renewable energy capacity so why has the government handed it a platform to run down the companies which do?” Bulb Energy said the company was asked to present information about initiatives “to encourage more businesses to set net zero targets in the energy and technology sectors”. “The information in the presentation looked specifically at companies’ net zero strategies, based on information publicly available on their websites at the time,” said the statement. Bulb used the briefing paper to issue Scottish Power, one of the UK’s biggest renewable energy investors, a red mark against its name for not setting a target to reach net zero and said it had “published blogposts sharing their intention to increase ambition by 2030” and “eventually set milestones for 2040 and 2045”. A spokesman for Scottish Powersaid the company “is proud to invest £6m every day in the UK’s green energy infrastructure to help the government meet its goal to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050”. Bulb issued another red mark against Octopus Energy, which has developed bespoke software to make using renewable energy easier for consumers, because it had not yet set a net zero target. Bulb appeared to criticise Octopus for publishing a “blogpost about ‘meaningful ways’ it’s ‘supporting a green future’”. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus, said: “We’re pushing system-wide change to end all reliance on fossil fuels in energy through investment in heat pumps, electric vehicles, green hydrogen and smart tariffs.” The company also generates 2.8GW of renewable energy across Europe via Octopus Renewables which was set up in March this year. A Defra statement said the CSB’s role was “to advise government on how businesses can help achieve the 25-year environment plan goals and be mobilised to take further action in a positive and immediate way”. “This involves collaborating with fellow business leaders and scrutinising and comparing their own plans, to ensure that UK business are on the way to achieving net zero by 2050 or earlier,” the department said. • This article was amended on 27 November 2021 to remove content which had been wrongly included due to a misunderstanding.",Energy industry; Energy; Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Gas; Business; ScottishPower; Climate crisis; Carbon offsetting; UK news,Business
2020-11-04T12:30:17Z,"John Lewis to cut 1,500 head office jobs as part of £300m cost savings",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/04/john-lewis-to-cut-1500-head-office-jobs-as-part-of-300m-cost-savings,"John Lewis is cutting 1,500 head office jobs as part of efforts to make £300m in annual cost savings and return to profitability. Its finance director, Patrick Lewis, the great grandson of John Lewis’s founder and the only family member still working for the business, is to exit the department store and Waitrose group after 26 years as part of the changes. Lewis will be replaced by Bérangère Michel, the director of customer service. Her duties will switch to Pippa Wicks, the head of the John Lewis department stores, and James Bailey, the boss of Waitrose, as the group trims down its executive team. The John Lewis Partnership, which employs 78,000 people, paved the way for further job cuts last month when it said it wanted to save an additional £200m in annual costs. The business, which is owned by its staff who are known as partners, had already announced £100m of savings, to be achieved by making its head office and other operations more efficient over the next two years. The company said the latest cuts would save £50m a year and would involve the loss of jobs in its strategy, commercial development and operations teams. The group said it wanted to create a simpler and more “agile and flexible head office” that was “even closer to customers and frontline partners”. It aims to complete the job reductions by April next year. Sharon White, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said: “Our partnership plan sets a course to create a thriving and sustainable business for the future. To achieve this we must be agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing needs of our customers. “Losing partners is incredibly hard as an employee-owned business. Wherever possible, we will seek to find new roles in the partnership and we’ll provide the best support and retraining opportunities for partners who leave us.” White described Lewis, who she said was leaving to “seek new opportunities”, as “the best of the partnership”. She said: “His determined drive to build the financial strength of the business has granted us the opportunity to emerge stronger from the Covid crisis.” The latest job losses come on top of 1,300 jobs cut when John Lewis closed eight of its 50 department stores this year while it cut one in three senior head office management posts – 75 out of 225 – as part of a reorganisation announced last year. The company said it hoped to find alternative jobs within the business for some and would offer those being made redundant after at least two years’ service a leaving package including up to £3,000 towards retraining.",John Lewis; Retail industry; Business; Sharon White; UK news; Waitrose; Job losses,Business
2021-10-29T15:37:38Z,Doubts over rescue deal for Bulb Energy raise fears of imminent collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/29/uk-energy-regulator-to-take-bold-action-over-price-cap-as-crisis-deepens-ofgem,"Growing doubts over a rescue deal for Bulb Energy have raised fears that the UK is on the brink of its biggest supplier collapse yet, even as the regulator promises “bold action” to protect millions of households from the deepening energy crisis. Bulb, the UK’s seventh largest energy supplier, is locked in talks with multiple companies to secure a bailout so it can continue serving its 1.7 million household customers amid record wholesale prices for gas and electricity this winter. But sources have told the Guardian that the cost of rescuing Bulb, which is understood to be carrying between £600m and £1bn of debt, could be too steep for most companies to shoulder without government help, meaning the number of households that have been forced to find a new energy supplier since the start of September could almost double from its current level of about 2.1 million. Previously when energy firms have exited the market, their existing customers have been allocated to a rival under the government’s supplier of last resort scheme. However, a collapse as large as Bulb would probably require the regulator to use a special administrator to keep the company running over winter before prices normalise and potential buyers come forward to snap up the supplier, one source said. Other sources confirmed reports that Ovo Energy, Octopus Energy and Shell Energy have shown an interest in buying Bulb. Centrica is also understood to be interested in Bulb and may opt to preserve the brand and business as a sister company to British Gas, which it owns. A Bulb spokesperson said the company was in discussions “with multiple parties to secure additional funding” and the talks continued to make good progress. In the past two months 13 energy suppliers have gone bust because they were unable to afford rocketing energy market costs, which have outpaced the rise of the regulator’s cap on standard energy bills. Three others collapsed earlier in the year. In an open letter to the industry on Friday, the regulator Ofgem promised to begin a consultation on how the energy price cap is calculated as soon as next month to make sure it allows suppliers to recover their costs. Ofgem did not suggest any specific changes but the industry is expected to take the opportunity to call for the price cap, which changes only twice a year, to be more responsive to swings in the market by changing as often as once every quarter. “These are challenging times, requiring bold action,” Jonathan Brearley, the regulator’s chief executive, wrote. This would be the first major change to the price cap since it was introduced in early 2019 to protect households from unfair energy bills by imposing a maximum based on the costs of buying and supplying gas and electricity. However, any shake-up would come too late for many struggling energy suppliers that are expected to go bust this winter. The regulator plans to consult on changes in November and expects to bring them in as soon as February before the next energy price rise predicted for April. A spokesperson for Ofgem said that in the event of further suppliers going bust it and government had “robust processes in place” to ensure customers’ electricity and gas supply continues and that their credit balances are protected. Ofgem is also promising to begin “raising the bar” on its standards for energy supplier finances to ensure they offer “a sustainable business model” that minimises risks to consumers. The regulator also plans to underline its expectations on how suppliers must help households that are struggling to pay their bills by offering debt payment plans or other financial support “to their most vulnerable consumers”. Ofgem named and shamed a string of seven suppliers on Friday that are likely to miss a late payment deadline for a total of £17.9m in renewable energy subsidies collected from their customers’ energy bills by 31 October. The regulator has ordered Ampower, Whoop Energy, Delta Gas and Power, Entice Energy, MA Energy, Neon Reef and Together Energy to meet the deadline or they risk losing their supplier licences. Typically, suppliers that struggle to meet their financial obligations often run a higher risk of going bust. Brearley said the “unprecedented and unexpected rise in gas and electricity prices over recent months has put energy markets under severe strain”. Up to 15 million households faced one of the steepest bill increases on record this month after Ofgem lifted the cap on standard tariffs by about 12.5%. Fuel poverty charities have warned that the altering the price cap to react more often through the year would create a “desperate situation for consumers” if “unmanageable price increases” emerged every quarter. Peter Smith, a director at the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said: “Ofgem need to remember millions of energy consumers will have faced a very bleak winter and the prospect of further, more regular rises will be unthinkable.”",Energy industry; Ofgem; Business; Energy bills; Money; UK news; Regulators; Household bills; Consumer affairs,Business
2021-10-20T08:00:09Z,"Steel will be vital to the green revolution, but our industry needs help to change | Jacqueline Thomas",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/20/steel-green-revolution-industry-government-investment-technology-jobs-turbines-electric-cars,"When I say to people that steel is a vital part of the solution to the climate crisis, I get a lot of confused looks. The global steel market is currently worth an estimated $2.5tn (£1.8tn) and produces 9% of global emissions. Decarbonisation is coming to us all, that’s simply a reality. What is in question is how we as an industry choose to adapt. Do we want to see wholesale disruption and the subsequent loss of thousands of good, union jobs, or a just transition where jobs are retained, and workers are supported to retrain for the new green economy? As a steelworker, it’s my job on the line if we don’t get this right. Past experience illustrates the value of a just transition. Take, for example, the way that unions reacted to plant closures in the early 2000s, providing training to literally thousands of steelworkers to help them move into other industries, in everything from horse dentistry to self-employed roles. Mass retraining was the correct response to a declining industry, but this time round UK steel will need to grow to support decarbonisation since steel is a key part of the green economy. Wind turbines, electric cars and all other products of a green future will require steel. To get it imported from overseas is simply shifting the carbon burden on to others; steel transported within the UK produces 50% less CO2. . So, instead of jobs being lost, jobs will change. Some are likely to move downstream, and some may be created in facilitative industries such as hydrogen, but many will remain central to the steel industry. The key is that members are fully supported to take on these new challenges. The steel industry supports thousands of high-quality jobs in some of our most disadvantaged communities. Steel jobs are good union jobs. They are jobs that pay well, above the national average, and they support families and communities as they do so. We don’t want to see these jobs go under any circumstances. But of course, future-proofing the steel industry requires thinking about how we make our steel. Neither employers nor the government can abdicate responsibility on this – they need to come to the table ready to make the investment that the steel industry needs. There are some really positive steps being made at Tata, for example, bringing in a CO2 surcharge on every net tonne of material sold, money that is then invested in helping the sector to decarbonise. And at a local level we’re making small changes that add up, like switching to more energy efficient lightbulbs. That doesn’t seem like a big change, but the cumulative impact is significant. Today, high energy costs are making it hard for the industry and are counterproductive as all of the viable low carbon solutions to steelmaking require more electricity than we use today. Therefore, the government also needs to do something about electricity prices, to ensure that in circumstances where it’s the right move to use electric arc technology or any other technology, it is a sustainable business model. Looking ahead, a lot of people think that hydrogen steelmaking will be the future. But for that to become a reality requires government investment to ensure that the infrastructure is there. It seems to be a question of who will make the first move. Will companies commit to a hydrogen transition, or will the government commit to delivering the infrastructure that they can plug into? The steel industry does not stand still. To keep up with changing technology and react to new developments means constantly adapting and reacting – and the climate crisis demands a new wave of innovation, investment and inventive thinking. The government needs to work with unions and employers to deliver the investment that’s needed to keep steel going and support net zero. The cost if we don’t get this right is incalculable. We know that our window for limiting the damage to our planet is closing fast. On a more personal level, we saw what happened to the steelworkers in Redcar when industrial change is not managed properly. Thousands of jobs gone, entire communities without work, knock-on effects felt by generations. I’ve seen first-hand the impact of industries lost. Communities like Aberfan, Merthyr Vale or Ebbw Vale, just three miles from where I lived, were destroyed by crude industrial policies, and left ill-equipped to handle the transition away from coal. As a child I remember going with my mother to collect food for the striking miners. I did it once, I don’t want to do it again. We need a greener steel industry, a just transition, and we’ve no time to waste. Jacqueline Thomas has been a full-time member of the steel industry since 2005. She lives just outside Ebbw Vale, whose steelworks closed in 2002.",Steel industry; Green economy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate science; Business; UK news; Politics,Opinion
2022-07-15T18:15:31Z,‘Embrace the chaos’: a history of Uber’s rapid expansion and fall from favour,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/15/embrace-the-chaos-a-history-of-ubers-rapid-expansion-and-fall-from-favour,"As Uber expanded around the world at breakneck speed under the leadership of Travis Kalanick, an executive in its fledgling Indian business sent a message to colleagues that captured the company’s rogue spirit. “Embrace the chaos. It means you’re doing something meaningful.” It was August 2014. Uber had been operating in India for only a year and was already in 10 cities. But the rapid expansion and a cavalier attitude towards taxi laws had collided with opposition from competitors and regulators – each grappling with Uber’s insistence that it didn’t need to play by the same rules as the incumbent taxi industry. To Uber, the fight was justified – righteous, even. Above all, it was necessary. “We will likely have both local and national issues in almost every city in India for the rest of your tenure at Uber … so get used to this as the status quo,” continued the email from Uber’s top executive in India. Four months later, an Uber driver was accused of raping a customer, leading to the service being temporarily banned in Delhi. He was later given a life sentence. In the days after the assault, the executive emailed staff saying the team was making changes to improve customer safety and checks on drivers, but was in good spirits: “We know that Uber is a force for good in India, and around the world. Of course, we have much to improve on.” Nearly three years later, as Kalanick’s leadership unravelled, it was reported that while the company publicly promised to improve safety, another executive obtained the medical files of the rape survivor in a failed attempt to discredit her evidence. Uber fired the executive after journalists began asking questions about the incident. Uber’s behaviour during its years of explosive growth returned to the spotlight this week with the publication of the Uber files, a Guardian-led investigation based on 124,000 internal documents that illustrated how the company flouted laws, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion. The cache of files, which span the years 2013 to 2017, laid bare a catalogue of ethically questionable practices as the company chased an increasingly bullish valuation, one which increased from just $60m (£50m) in 2011 to $82bn when it joined the stock market in 2019. Today, the firm led by Kalanick’s successor, Dara Khosrowshahi, is still atoning for the sins of its past as it struggles to achieve the profits its investors spent billions betting it would attain. ‘Move fast and break things’ In the beginning, Uber was a typical Silicon Valley upstart. The company was founded by Kalanick and Canadian entrepreneur Garrett Camp in 2009. They conceived the idea after unsuccessfully trying to hail a cab in Paris the previous year. Uber was among a class of supposed disruptors that embraced Mark Zuckerberg’s “move fast and break things” approach. In Uber’s case, investor cash subsidised users’ fares in cities the company had muscled its way into with an app that connected passengers with cab drivers. The price of their ride fluctuated depending on supply and demand. Uber was among the pioneers of the gig economy business model, using a vast pool of freelance labour and initially, avoiding the costs – such as holiday pay and pensions – associated with contracted employees. To the pugnacious Kalanick, who was 32 when Uber launched, “move fast and break things” appeared to apply as much to laws as anything else. In an early investor slide deck from 2008, Kalanick and Camp proposed a members-only service called UberCab that combined the “convenience of a cab in NYC” with the “experience of a professional chauffeur”. The company they launched in San Francisco in 2010 quickly evolved from a limo-hailing service to one that relied primarily on pseudo-professional drivers with their own cars, fuelling its break-neck expansion. By 2012, Uber was operating across the US and in three cities in Europe. Just a year later, Uber was in 74 cities around the world and worth about $3.5bn. Uber pitched itself as an innovator with a service too novel to play by the antiquated rules the entrenched taxi industry abided by. Taxi companies were archaic enemies of innovation – and expensive – according to Kalanick. Internal emails and text messages from a critical period of growth imply that Uber’s true innovation was not necessarily the platform, but the lower cost, lower barrier relationship it had with its drivers who, typically, were not commercially licensed. However, cities around the world had long-established laws that intended, mostly, to ensure the safety of taxi passengers and, according to those laws, in many places Uber’s business was illegal. Missing from Uber’s retelling of its own history is that it not only launched a service it knew was illegal in many cities, but that running an unlicensed business was critical to the company’s bottom line. In emails and text messages reviewed by the Guardian, executives acknowledged that fighting enforcement was necessary and, in one instance, described it as “extremely strategic” to the company’s “ability to scale the business” in Europe. By 2016, Uber was in 400 cities in 68 countries, with a valuation of about $66bn that it struggled to justify. And on any given day, the company was fighting regulators in a dozen cities worldwide. Externally, Uber presented itself as a champion of the free market and a righteous disruptor, with dreams of revolutionising transportation despite being dragged down by a system designed to uphold and preserve the status quo. But one question continued to stalk the company: did Uber have a sustainable business if it played by the rules? In a 2014 email to a senior member of the policy team, the then head of global communications Nairi Hourdajian said “sometimes we have problems because, well, we’re just fucking illegal”. Contacted by the Guardian, Hourdajian declined to comment. Evading regulators The Uber files shed new light on Uber’s tactics to evade regulators, of which only the contours were previously publicly known. They also raise serious questions about whether the company told investors enough about the myriad flaws in its business, and the lengths to which executives went to ensure Uber was able to operate outside the law. “The new revelations could raise issues about whether Uber disclosed enough information to investors about the risks,” said Carl Tobias, a professor in law at the University of Richmond, Virginia. Uber, for its part, is confident in the accuracy and completeness of its disclosures to investors. and lists more than 50 pages of risk factors in the prospectus for its 2019 stock market float, including a reference to the rape in Delhi. To preserve its business model, Uber developed a sophisticated strategy that ranged from evading regulators with technology to widespread lobbying to win over politicians, media and the public. Emails show that executives established and discussed practices to thwart regulators across Europe, including in Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. When law enforcement officials would attempt to hail a car, hoping to catch Uber operating without permission, company employees tried to present them with a “fake view” of the app using a tool called Greyball. To the officials, it would appear that no cars were in the area, or there would be phantom cars not linked to an actual driver. And when law enforcement raided offices, the company would often be one step ahead, deploying a “kill switch” to shut down all computers. The use of the kill switch was discussed by Uber executives in at least six countries, and in a statement, Uber said it stopped using it and Greyball in 2017. Then there was the lobbying, using a handful of well-connected political consultants and the company’s policy team. David Plouffe, former campaign manager to Barack Obama, was appointed in 2014 to lead Uber’s policy and communications teams, and used his personal connections and political sway to open doors for the company. A little more than a year later, Uber replaced Plouffe with Google’s PR boss Rachel Whetstone, and moved him into a chief adviser role. Meanwhile, Uber continued to battle regulators and well-funded competitors around the world, claiming victories in many places while being forced to pull out or rethink its operations in major markets like China in 2016. But a new era of reckoning came in early 2017: a massive #DeleteUber campaign sparked by a blog post by Susan Fowler, an engineer who wrote about the sexism and discrimination she encountered at the company. It set into motion a series of events that culminated in the forcing out of many of the top brass. A change at the top Uber’s reputation was in a critical state in 2017 and Kalanick was at the centre of the criticism. He resigned in June after the company released a report on its workplace culture led by the former US attorney general Eric Holder. Amid internal chaos, Uber turned to an understated but talented external figure as Kalanick’s successor: Iranian-born Khosrowshahi, then CEO of online travel company Expedia. Speaking after his appointment in a New Yorker profile, Khosrowshahi said: “We were probably trading off doing the right thing for growth, and thinking about competition maybe a bit too aggressively, and some of those things were mistakes.” Khosrowshahi had to prove that Uber – which posted a net loss of $4.5bn in 2017 – could achieve profitability by playing nice. But a change at the top has not lessened the regulatory and political pressure on Uber. The UK has been at the forefront of battles over its business model and its drivers’ employment status. Last year the supreme court dismissed Uber’s appeal against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers with access to the minimum wage and paid holidays. After that ruling, Uber said its 70,000 UK drivers would be guaranteed a minimum wage of £8.72 an hour, holiday pay and pensions. In 2020, voters in California approved a law that gave gig workers some employment benefits but classed them as independent contractors. In June, Massachusetts’ top court rejected an Uber-backed bid to ask voters whether app-based cab-share and delivery drivers should be treated as independent contractors rather than employees. From Switzerland to the Netherlands, courts in Europe have also increasingly ruled in favour of drivers’ rights. Uber now employs 29,300 people and operates in 72 countries and 10,500 cities. It has the scale, but the business under Khosrowshahi has yet to yield a consistent profit. Since it was founded, Uber has wracked up a cumulative loss of $23.6bn. Uber floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 with a valuation of $82.4bn, but stumbled on its first day as a public company, ending with a valuation of $69.7bn after investors pushed shares down 7.6%. Khosrowshahi has been forced to take radical action, selling Uber’s autonomous driving division for a reported $4bn and offloaded its loss-making flying taxi division. The company has also resorted to working with an unlikely partner in major cities around the US: the taxi industry. In New York City and San Francisco – where Uber faced some of the most aggressive opposition from taxi regulators and companies in the US – the company has partnered with yellow cab companies and is now allowing riders to hail taxis on the platform. Uber is now a slimmer business, with its cab-hailing arm vying neck-and-neck with its takeaway and grocery delivery unit in revenue terms. In its most recent quarterly results, Uber posted another loss – of $5.9bn – after writing down its stakes in other companies. It has also been battling a backdrop of dampened investor faith in tech stocks, which has resulted in Uber’s share price declining 50% this year. Having floated at $45 a share, it is now worth around $21 a share. In a statement to the Guardian about the Uber Files, a spokesperson for Kalanick said: “Travis Kalanick never authorised any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country.” The spokesperson added: “The reality was that Uber’s expansion initiatives were led by over a hundred leaders in dozens of countries around the world and at all times under the direct oversight and with the full approval of Uber’s robust legal, policy, and compliance groups.” Jill Hazelbaker, Uber’s senior vice-president of public affairs, said: “We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values. Instead, we ask the public to judge us by what we’ve done over the last five years and what we will do in the years to come.” Even if profit follows for Uber, how it got there will be remembered in corporate history as a tainted path.",Uber; Lobbying; Transport; Transport policy; Road transport; Travis Kalanick; Technology sector; Technology startups; World news; Business,News
2021-11-06T16:15:37Z,Mounting concern over environmental cost of fake snow for Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/06/mounting-concern-over-environmental-cost-of-fake-snow-for-olympics,"The mountains that will be the setting of the Alpine events for the forthcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing boast spectacular scenery and breathtaking runs, but lack just one vital ingredient: real snow. Between January and March this year, the National Alpine Ski Centre in Yanqing, about 55 miles north-west of Beijing, had just 2cm of snow. London, Paris and Madrid all recorded greater snowfalls, according to data compiled by the website worldweatheronline.com. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) now faces mounting questions about the environmental cost of the Games, which open on 4 February, including claims the alpine runs were constructed in a protected nature reserve. It has been calculated that Beijing 2022 will need about 49 million gallons of water to create the required artificial snow. “These could be the most unsustainable Winter Olympics ever held,” said Professor Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the University of Strasbourg. “These mountains have virtually no natural snow.” She said artificial snow was water- and energy-intensive, damaging soil health and causing erosion. IOC officials warned in the bid evaluation report in June 2015 that Yanqing, the venue for downhill skiing and slalom, and Zhangjiakou, the venue for cross-country skiing, ski jumping and snowboarding events, had meagre annual snowfalls. “[They] have minimal annual snowfall and for the Games would rely completely on artificial snow,” they said. Stockholm, Oslo and Munich withdrew bids because of the costs, or failing to win public support. About 200 snow cannons will create ribbons of artificial snow across the mountainside in Yanqing. A network of pipes and trenches will supply water from a reservoir to the snow-making machine. While real snow is formed in clouds from clusters of tiny ice crystals, artificial snow is made from water droplets freezing into beads of ice. It typically means a harder piste and is often favoured by professional skiers for being fast and “hyper-grippy”. It is not the first time the IOC has chosen an Alpine events venue with more rock than snow. It chose Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the last Winter Olympics, where the cold but similarly arid climate also required vast quantities of artificial snow. Beijing has scarce water resources, but said in its bid there would be adequate supplies from stored run-off and existing reservoirs. Justin Francis,a member of the UK government’s Council for Sustainable Business and chief executive of holiday firm Responsible Travel, said: “This is the world’s showcase of winter sport and it’s extraordinary to host it in a place dependent on artificial snow. The Olympics inspires us about sport, but also about doing our bit to sustain the planet. This is the ideal platform and it’s the wrong message.” There are also concerns about the ecological impacts. The IOC evaluation report said the site would be adjacent to the 4,600 hectare Songshan National Nature Reserve, but in August 2015 the science journal Nature reported scientists’ concerns that the ski area fell within the park. The journal highlighted an internet post by the scientist Wang Xi, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which included a map showing the start and end of the alpine runs within the protected reserve. The post was reportedly clicked 240,000 times and forwarded more than 1,000 times before it no longer appeared online. A local mayor in Yanqing later said the park’s boundaries had been redrawn and none of the Olympic runs were in the extended nature reserve. Beijing published its sustainability report for the Games last year, pledging to meet the goals set out in the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It said it would use renewable energy for the venues and recycle water resources. “We shall give priority to ecological and resource conservation, environmental friendliness, and contribute to a beautiful environment,” it said. Richard Butler, emeritus professor in tourism at Strathclyde University, said: “The 2022 Olympics shows clearly how misused and now useless the term sustainable really is. It is used for whatever anyone wants and has become meaningless. “Clearly money, power, influence and politics came together to award the games to an area without sufficient snow.” Climate change means that ski resorts increasingly rely on artificial snow. According to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2007, global warming could jeopardise as many as two-thirds of all ski areas in the Alps. It warned of the impact on water supplies and local ecology in trying to use snow cannons to halt the retreating snowline. Martin Bell, an Alpine skier who competed in four Olympics, said modern innovations helped ensure artificial snow was more environmentally friendly. “Snow-making is now part of the sport and you just have to make sure it’s done in a careful way,” he said. “As competitors, we would always love to race in the Alps with beautiful villages and the church bells ringing, but we understand the sport needs to spread and become a truly worldwide sport. And going to China will help.” The IOC said: “Locations for Winter Games depend on a number of considerations, not just snowfall. A series of water-conserving and recycling designs have been put into place to optimise water usage for snowmaking, human consumption, and other purposes. Yanqing is rich in water resources in comparison with neighbouring areas. “Beijing 2022’s mission is being green, open, inclusive and clean. Beijing 2022 will use renewable energy for all competition venues.” The Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games did not respond to a request for comment.",China; Winter Olympics; Asia Pacific; World news; Skiing; Snow; Sport; Environment,World news
2021-06-24T13:52:20Z,Top insurers join Prince Charles to fight climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/24/top-insurers-join-prince-charles-to-fight-climate-crisis,"Chief executives from the UK’s largest insurers have joined forces with the Prince of Wales to launch a sector-wide taskforce aimed at tackling the climate crisis. The Sustainable Market Initiative Insurance Taskforce – comprising bosses from 17 firms including Legal &amp; General, Allianz, Hiscox and Axa – has pledged to support the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy by expanding insurance coverage for projects such as offshore windfarms, and partnering with governments to provide better disaster protection cover in countries facing serious risks like extreme weather caused by global heating. “Climate change is already having an impact – you see this in wildfires in California and you see it in persistent droughts in Australia,” Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of insurance market Lloyd’s of London, which is chairing the taskforce, said. “So there is now increasing demand by customers for these kinds of protections and we need to respond to them.” He said a number of individual companies had started offering more climate-friendly insurance policies, but had failed to coordinate across the sector. “What the prince is really doing is helping us convene and galvanise a whole of industry response,” he added. “Instead of people going off and doing their own thing they’re actually bringing some of their intellectual property, and some of their capability reporting on some of their existing findings and research, on what is having the most impact.” The launch of the taskforce was marked by a visit by Charles to Lloyd’s of London’s underwriting room in the Grade I-listed building at One Lime Street, where the group gathered for their second meeting on Thursday. The group, which the prince first brought together in February, is pushing ahead with plans to expand insurance coverage for hydrogen and nuclear power, and adding clauses to home insurance policies that will encourage customers who lose their home to fire or flood to rebuild with more sustainable materials. Carnegie-Brown warned that if the insurance industry did not act quickly, it would be forced to take more drastic action to help meet global targets for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. That could mean pulling cover for carbon-intensive companies that fail to transition to more sustainable business models. US and European insurers – which are the second largest group of institutional investors after pension funds with approximately $30tn (£21.5tn) in assets – have invested close to $600bn in fossil fuels, according to the Unfriend Coal campaign. “As an industry we need to support our customers doing that [transition] but we will also need to make tough decisions if we don’t think our customers can transition,” the Lloyd’s chairman said. Lloyd’s of London has already pledged to stop new insurance cover for coal, oil sands and Arctic energy projects by January 2022, and to pull out of the business altogether by 2030. “We’re just one industry among many, but we all need to play our part to protect the planet for what I think is an extraordinary systemic risk,” Carnegie-Brown said.",Insurance industry; Climate crisis; King Charles III; Energy industry; Business; Environment; UK news; World news; Monarchy,Business
2021-09-30T17:30:09Z, ‘They’re territorial’: can birds and drones coexist?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/01/theyre-territorial-can-birds-and-drones-coexist,"Drone delivery company Wing has temporarily suspended deliveries to the Canberra suburb of Harrison after a nesting raven swooped a drone delivering coffee. It has ignited an interesting dichotomy: if such deliveries are the carbon-friendly future, can birds and drones coexist, or should action be taken to mitigate any ill-effects of drones on wildlife? Drones delivering hot coffee? Yes. Wing delivers hot coffee, groceries, medicine and hardware to locked-down homes in Canberra and non-locked-down ones in Logan, Queensland. It plans to expand post-lockdown, marketing itself as a zero-emission, low energy, environmentally-friendly, fast and safe method of delivery, which will take cars off the road. “Hot food and coffee are popular because we fly so fast,” Jesse Suskin, head of public policy at Wing, says. He talks up their pro-environmental, low energy credentials. “If you order pasta via our app, it takes more energy to cook the pasta than deliver it.” But now Wing, which started three years ago and is doing a delivery every minute in Canberra and one every 30 seconds in Logan, has now hit hot water itself. Raven attack Wing hires an ornithological expert who has advised them to pause deliveries in that area while mating / swooping season occurs. “It’s rare we see birds attack drones, but this year that behaviour seemed slightly more aggressive than we’d seen previously” Suskin says. But Mike Weston says ravens pursue birds of prey as a threat year-round. It’s possible that’s what triggered this raven. The associate professor of wildlife conservation at Deakin University says birds attacking drones is also not rare. “Deakin is about to release a study of 275 drone pilots showing that almost 20% reported physical contact between their drone and a bird. So it’s a problem” he says. Birdlife Australia’s Sean Dooley says it’s hard to be sure if birds such as this raven mistake drones for other birds, or simply recognise them as a threat: “They’re territorial” he says. And they’re not averse to attacking larger birds: “I’ve seen poor old pelicans or herons being hammered by ravens or magpies. This behaviour is far more pronounced in nesting season, but does happen outside of it too,” he says. Dooley says he hasn’t seen ravens attack drones before, but has seen such behaviour in wedge tailed eagles, Australia’s largest bird of prey. In Holland, eagles have been trained to take down illegal drones. It’s not just about conserving wildlife; it’s also about drone delivery companies having a sustainable business model without losing too many drones. “Whenever a bird attacks a drone, the drone mostly comes off second best,” Dooley says. This is certainly corroborated by Guardian Australia’s photographer Mike Bowers, whose photographic drones have been attacked three times. “It was an expensive exercise – drones zero, birds three!” Bowers says, adding he’s relieved the birds weren’t injured. “The raptors seem very determined – and they’re fast” he says. “They use their talons to strike and break the propellers, and the drone falls out of the sky and breaks into a million pieces,” he says. Drones are great for environmentalists Birdlife expert Sean Dooley is keen to stress what a boon drones are for conservationists. “When properly used, they’re great to accurately count colonies of endangered birds in inaccessible areas,” he says. He says more research is being undertaken to ascertain the safest distance without spooking off nests of endangered seabirds – the results of which will prove instructive for drone delivery services. “It’s roosting coastal birds we need to be mindful of,” Dooley says. “Drones can spook them, causing them to fly off from the safe roost, expend lots of energy and expose chicks to predators like gulls,” he says, calling for more regulation around such areas. Prof Weston says the effects of drones go beyond territorial attacks and disturbing those nesting: “Their less dramatic but still significant effects could cause birds to stop foraging and disrupt their breeding patterns,” he says, adding further research will highlight the extent of such impacts. He says a centralised recording of all wildlife and drone interactions will help inform solutions: “We currently mainly rely on videos on the internet,” he says. While waiting for more comprehensive research, RSPCA Australia suggests drone use should be minimised, citing potential stress induced by the sound/visual stimulus of the drone. “Codes of practice until then could include: low noise production and size drones, launching and landing at least 100m from animals and avoiding moving directly towards animals as it may mimic a predator’s behaviour,” says Dr Di Evans, senior scientific officer, RSPCA Australia. Weston calls for standardised protocols, agreed no-fly zones and better training for drone operators on what to do when an aggressive encounter happens. “There might also be technological solutions such as automatic modification of flight paths and flights using sensors,” he says. Photographer Mike Bowers says this is all part of living in Australia. “You live alongside a variety of wildlife – you have to accept raptors live in our skies just like surfers have to accept there are sharks in our seas.”",Australian bird of the year (2021); Birds; Wildlife; News photography; Animals; Drones (non-military),Environment
2021-03-26T17:15:01Z,Camera retailer Jessops calls in administrators for a second time,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/26/jessops-calls-in-administrators-for-second-time-in-just-over-year,"Camera retailer Jessops is to appoint administrators for the second time in little more than a year, in a move that puts 120 jobs at risk. The business, controlled by Dragons’ Den panellist Peter Jones, said it had filed a notice to appoint administrators after being hit hard by lockdown restrictions. The filing temporarily shields Jessops from creditors and gives it breathing space to find a way for the business to carry on, the company said. The chain, which Jones’s PJ Investment Group bought out of administration in 2013, has been whittled down to just 17 shops. More than half its stores closed after it hit trouble in 2019. Jessops is considering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – an insolvency process that would enable it to cut its rents. It is also in talks with suppliers and partners. PJ Investment Group is offering to provide additional financial support if management can come up with a sustainable business plan. A spokesperson for PJ Investment Group said it had worked hard to support Jessops, which had returned to profit in recent years, following a restructuring and multimillion-pound investment. However, they said, the retail business was changing fast “and this process has been accelerated by the impact of the pandemic”. The company is working with restructuring firm FRP on a rescue plan. However, its stores, including flagships on London’s Oxford Street and in Birmingham, will reopen when government restrictions are lifted next month and the website will continue to trade as normal.",Jessops; Business; Retail industry; Job losses,Business
2021-06-17T11:26:46Z,"Woman in south Wales saw husband and son killed by buffalo, inquest hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/woman-in-south-wales-saw-husband-and-son-killed-by-buffalo-inquest-hears,"A woman watched helplessly as her husband and son were killed by a water buffalo on their family farm in south Wales, an inquest heard on Thursday. Ralph Jump, 57, and his son Peter, 19, were fatally injured by the bull, named Yolo, on the farm, which the family rented for their sustainable business making luxury soap from buffalo milk. Ralph Jump, known as John, who was also the managing director of a heating company firm, had returned home after a work morning out with his wife, Josephine, on 5 May last year. She was preparing food in the kitchen when their daughter Isabelle, 22, ran in screaming: “Yolo is pushing Dad down the field.” The two women ran out to try to distract the animal. Josephine Jump said: “I could see John being rolled by the bull down the field. I screamed at Isabelle to phone an ambulance and I could hear that he was groaning.” She said Peter grabbed an iron bar; she did not want him to go into the field but he tried to help his father. Josephine Jump said: “All of a sudden the bull started going for Peter and got him.” The bull also injured Isabelle. Armed police officers later arrived and shot the animal. Josephine Jump said her husband had died at the scene, near Usk, and Peter had died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. The Jump family had hand-reared the buffalo at their three-acre farm. A police firearms unit arrived at the scene but none of their three weapons was powerful enough to kill the animal, the inquest was told. Firearms officer Robert Gunney told the hearing: “We called for a specialist rifle from a police station 15 minutes away. While waiting I instructed two PCs with lightweight weapons to shoot at the bull, which was standing over Mr Jump staring at his body. We shot the bull in the head knowing it would not have much of an effect.” The bull was later shot dead after a helicopter was used to flush it back into the field. Gunney said: “It was a very unique incident. We have had previous incidents dealing with cattle but nothing with a beast as big as a water buffalo.” The inquest heard Ralph Jump had entered the field alone when he was attacked by Yolo. His wife and daughter took sticks into the field in an attempt to move and direct the bull. A health and safety report found the measures “fell far below the standards of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) guidelines”. Sara Lumley, an HSE inspector, said Jump should not have entered the field alone, with no handling equipment and without a place for refuge – such as a tractor or a barrier. Giving evidence, she said: “You can never assume that a bull is safe and this bull had shown previous signs of aggression. “As a minimum there should have been two people and some sort of separation or refuge present and handling equipment.” Lumley said she could not comment on whether the Jump family had become complacent over safety because they had reared Yolo from a calf.

2021-10-26T14:30:04Z,Facebook cannot moderate itself - its problems have only just begun | Chris Stokel-Walker,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/26/facebook-moderate-problems-whistleblower,"This week will be a long, difficult one for Facebook. Yesterday whistleblower Frances Haugen answered questions about its business practices before MPs in a parliamentary hearing, which comes after another whistleblower revealed further issues to American authorities about the company. Haugen’s testimony has clearly rattled Facebook, prompting pushback from the company, including direct attacks from an outspoken PR executive. Haugen’s comments at hearings here and in the US, and the documents revealed in the last week by whistleblowers, have painted the platform in a less than favourable light. Haugen’s testimony isn’t news to those who have monitored independent research into Facebook, but it becomes all the more shocking when it’s there in black and white, based on the company’s own research, and in its own words. Haugen told the Observer that the Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is “unaccountable”, “has no oversight” and “has not demonstrated that he is willing to govern the company at the level that is necessary for public safety”. In front of politicians yesterday, she warned about the risks that Facebook is undermining democracy. “I came forward now because now is a critical time to act,” she said. She also warned that “anger and hate is the easiest way to grow on Facebook”, while she said Instagram is nearly impossible to make safe for teenagers, let alone 10-year-olds. Among the claims she made are that internal tests conducted by Facebook show conservative accounts being channelled down an extremist rabbit hole. The site was also a haven for the conspiratorially minded, who believed that the last year’s US presidential election was “stolen” – without evidence. At one point, one in 10 views of all political content in the US, and one in every 50 views on Facebook, alleged election fraud. It has also allegedly poisoned the well around discourse in India, struggling to contain hate speech, misinformation and celebrations of violence. The reason, reports claim, is that Facebook expanded into the country without understanding its culture. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs, has said in a memo to Facebook staff that these are all understandable results from the social media revolution, that “turns traditional top-down control of information on its head”. People’s ability to decide for themselves what to read, see and digest is empowering, Clegg claims. However, it’s “disruptive to those who hanker after the top-down controls of the past”. Facebook also claims that it’s madness to say that it’s willing to put profit before people: without the latter, it can’t make the former, and if Facebook was as pernicious a platform as the whistleblowers and politicians allege, then it wouldn’t be a sustainable business. Plenty disagree. The reckoning Facebook now faces is the result of a typical tech problem: that companies prioritised growth at all costs, without thinking about the ramifications it would have on society. It’s something I’ve seen in my work on other platforms, including YouTube: in their early days, platforms that have become our de facto public forums didn’t grapple with the difficulties of moderating public discourse. Now it is too late – and we are seeing the inevitable result of decades of under-regulation, or no oversight at all on big tech. The challenge for Facebook is that, after years of trying to ignore the problem, politicians and the public alike no longer believe it when it professes to be part of the solution. What is happening now is that regulation is beginning to be forced on the company, rather than arrived at through consensual engagement. Hence the swift attempts to bring in regulation via the government’s online safety bill; the joint committee’s scrutiny of its contents was the ostensible reason for Haugen’s appearance yesterday. The bill has been given greater urgency by the killing of Sir David Amess earlier this month. This despite the fact that there has been no suggestion that the MP’s death had anything to do with social media. What we’re likely to see now is reactionary regulation, drawn up by those who believe the worst of Facebook, and can’t conceive of the best of it. Politicians, fed up with being thrown to the lions of the social media commentariat on a regular basis, have decided they want to hit the company hard. Much of the public, roiled by the algorithms that run wild and push our buttons, are baying for blood too. And both are being guided by former employees who, whether because of genuine concern about what they saw or because they have an axe to grind with their former bosses, want to cut big tech down to size. It’s hard to feel pity for a platform that has been complicit in all this. Regulation is needed, as Haugen’s testimony showed. If even half her claims are true, they demonstrate the problems we face when living in a world drawn up by Silicon Valley billionaires who see dollar signs from our data, and view people as profit. The probable remedy, however, isn’t a perfect fix. After years of no regulation whatsoever, an overcorrection now seems likely, with regulation being drawn up from a position of anger, rather than rational thought. Radical transparency has already been mooted as the necessary next step by Damian Collins, chair of the online safety bill joint committee. That would be an important intervention – though it’s one that Facebook seems not to favour, given its attempts to quell Haugen and other whistleblowers’ attempts to foist transparency on them. It is necessary, though, because social media platforms have shown themselves so far to be incapable of marking their own homework. They are not willing to responsibly disclose the impact their platforms have on all of us. Facebook’s recent difficulty is just the start. The big tech backlash is entering a new era.

2021-09-18T10:00:04Z,Garment workers in America’s fashion capital may make just $6 an hour. A new law could change that,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/18/california-garment-worker-protection-act-wages-pay,"Los Angeles is considered the center of garment manufacturing in America, employing over 40,000 people to make clothing for fashion brands including Reformation, Forever 21, Charlotte Russe and Wet Seal. But for decades those workers have functioned under a system that sees them paid per piece they construct, meaning they often earn less than $6 per hour, according to a University of California, Los Angeles, study – less than half of California’s minimum wage. Now, a new law could change that. California lawmakers recently approved the Garment Worker Protection Act, which would eliminate the piece rate system and ensure workers are paid an hourly minimum wage. The bill would also expand who is liable for stolen wages – meaning a brand like Charlotte Russe, for example, would share responsibility for paying out wage theft claims filed by workers who make their clothing in factories such as the ones in downtown LA. Right now, those claims are filed against the factories themselves but can languish for years before being paid out, if they ever are. Marissa Nuncio, the director of the Garment Worker Center and a co-sponsor of the bill, says this latter part is key, because brands have long been able to shield themselves by shifting the blame on to the factories that make their clothing. “Through subcontracting, they’re really able to buffer themselves and evade any kind of legal liability for improper wages,” Nuncio says. Garment workers and advocates say the current system has been designed to incentivize rapid production while exploiting workers – most of whom are immigrants and women of color. Workers such as Santiago Puac, an immigrant from Guatemala who has been in the garment industry for 17 years. Pauc works on a single-needle sewing machine, attaching zippers and labels to dresses and other small finishing details. It’s a job he says has taken a lot of skill to learn, since such details can be complicated. But the work pays him just 15 cents or less per piece, meaning even on highly productive days he’s only taking home $75 a day. “It would be such a big change in my life,” Puac told the Guardian in Spanish of the proposed law. “Knowing I could have a secure income, a set number of work hours, and earn a just wage.” The Garment Worker Protection Act has already cleared the state legislature and is now awaiting the signature of Governor Gavin Newsom, who has until October to approve it. The bill, which garment workers helped craft, would add heft to an existing law, passed in 1999, that also sought to address wage theft in the industry by setting up a restitution fund for wage theft claims that fashion companies pay into. But advocates say fashion brands have spent 20 years circumventing it by hiring contractors and claiming that they do not fall under its definition of “garment manufacturer”. The new bill seeks to sharpen that definition by making brands share joint liability with their contractors for unpaid wages, other compensation, interest, and penalties. The author of the bill, the state senator María Elena Durazo, says it originally intended to make brands fully liable for lost wages, but was later amended. “Although personally I think they should be liable for everything, it gives recognition that the immediate employer would face the penalties and the brands would face the lost wages,” says Durazo. While the California Chamber of Commerce, a business lobbying organization, has labeled the bill a “jobs killer”, many fashion brands have come out in support of it, saying the bill will not only help workers but level the playing field between companies that pay a living wage and those that don’t. In July, a coalition of at least 70 fashion businesses wrote an open letter to the Chamber of Commerce saying: “The sustainable business community wants a level playing field, enabled by strong labor laws, because we believe it is crucial for California fashion to flourish well into the 21st century.” Senator Durazo says these business owners are often women whose brand relies on their image of environmental sustainability and caring about their employees. Nuncio put it more bluntly: “They don’t want to compete with sweatshop users.” The Covid-19 pandemic has also added urgency to the issue. Thousands continued to work throughout California’s lockdowns, with many shifting to making masks. Poor working conditions caused many garment workers to contract the virus. “The pandemic exposed the inequities in our economy and rather than turn our backs on those workers, now’s the time to fix it,” says Durazo. “If we want to bring real meaning to the word ‘essential workers’, then let’s do that by helping them support their families.” Puac says the financial boost would help him better support his six children, most of whom still live in Guatemala. “I could be with my family more, eat nutritious food,” he said, adding that fashion brands should be excited for workers to have more money in their pockets; they might even spend it on new clothes. “I think the brand selling the clothing also benefits, because having a minimum wage would mean more of us buying their products. All of us that will have money because we make the wage we deserve, we too will have money to spend.”",California; US news; Los Angeles; Fashion; Fashion industry,US news
2021-12-05T14:07:22Z,‘Back to the bad old days’: swingeing rail cuts set alarm bells ringing,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/05/back-bad-old-days-swingeing-rail-cuts-alarm-bells-ringing,"Train operators have been told to find ways to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from the railway’s operating costs next year, in a move that is likely to result in fewer services and worse stations for passengers. The Department for Transport seeks to cut spending by 10% after the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s autumn budget. With the Treasury anxious to limit spending on rail, which increased massively during the pandemic, letters from the DfT’s managing director of passenger services, Peter Wilkinson, have been sent to individual operators setting out the swingeing cuts needed across the industry. While train operators expected cuts – the Williams-Shapps plan for rail, which was published in May, set out a target of saving £1.5bn over the next five years – the immediacy and scale of the financial demands has come as a surprise. Government sources said there were no finalised decisions, and denied that individual operators were being asked to deliver cuts of 10% or more to expenditure. Operators have been under direct government contract since the abolition of franchising at the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Under the emergency recovery contracts, they are paid a fixed fee to deliver services with the revenue and cost risk taken by the government. Even if, as DfT sources suggest, the latest call for savings are a “routine business planning process” to maintain efficiency and reduce the cost to taxpayers, alarm bells are ringing through the industry. While the effects of the pandemic on rail travel patterns and revenue are clear to all, a division has grown between those who believe it is essential to maintain services and lower fares to attract passengers and those who favour cutting costs and maximising current income. According to figures released by the Office of Rail and Road on Wednesday, the Treasury spent an additional £6.5bn on running the railway in 2020-21, to cover lost revenues as passenger numbers dropped 78% overall. The shortfall will be substantially less this financial year, with weekly rail demand having risen steadily to about 70% of pre-Covid levels by November – although the discovery of the Omicron variant and the reintroduction of mandatory mask wearing is expected to depress numbers. Provisional DfT figures showed a 10% drop in train travel last Monday, although the impact of storms would have played a part. In October, train operators announced a voluntary severance programme to try to reduce staff costs. However, further budget constraints could mean mandatory job cuts, with many of the fixed costs in rail, such as rolling stock and track access charges, impossible to reduce quickly. Operators fear the reputational damage, and financial hit, of managing decline and likely industrial action. Under the new contracts, at least 20% of the potential profit will be linked to performance measures including customer satisfaction. One insider said: “If you’re setting the budget at a point where customers and staff are going to be unhappy, it looks pretty hard to get those fees.” Forced redundancies would spell certain strike action, with even the scale of voluntary departures – many thousands applying at Network Rail alone – yet to be agreed after months of talks with the unions. The unions have in the interim geared up for battle over proposed cuts to services that operators had already prepared before the latest DfT costcutting demands. South Western Railway, which has been badly affected by a drop in daily commuters to London from the stockbroker belt, has consulted on long-term timetable cuts to be introduced next December. A SWR spokesperson said it would still have 93% of pre-Covid capacity, adding that it was “appropriate and responsible that we right-size our services to match demand in the new normal”. Meanwhile, LNER, which is run by the government’s own operator of last resort since the collapse of Virgin, has been consulting on cutting ticket offices; protests against the cuts are due on Monday in stations in the north-east. Demands for savings have been compounding industry gloom after the HS2’s northeastern leg and the new Leeds-Manchester line were scrapped last month in the government’s integrated rail plan. Enthusiasm in some parts of government for building new rail infrastructure and improving services – a key tool for both “levelling up” the regions and decarbonising transport – has come up against Treasury unwillingness to spend more now. It’s back to the old days of British Rail when they squeezed services and then said no one is using trains because the service is rubbish Christian Wolmar, the author of the forthcoming History of British Railways, argued that the £96bn plan was actually “a vote of confidence in the long-term future of the railways, however mis-sold”. But, he said: “In the short-term, they are being completely squeezed. It’s incoherent. And it’s going to have a real impacts.” Timetables are likely to be thinned out and late-night services withdrawn to cut costs, he predicted: “It’s back to the old days of British Rail when they squeezed services and then said no one is using trains because the service is rubbish. “In a rational world they would just cut the branch lines – but they can’t do that politically because ministers have said they are reversing Beeching.” Meanwhile, the depth of Treasury control is also raising questions about the future plans for Great British Railways, the arms-length “guiding mind” supposedly taking charge under the Williams-Shapps plan to improve the railways. Six months after publication, progress has been slow, with legislation now unlikely to bring any new body into effect before 2024 or 2025. Its designate leaders – Network Rail’s chief executive, Andrew Haines, and its chair, Peter Hendy – were kept at bay as government departments tussled over the cuts to the integrated rail plan. As one industry veteran put it: “Network Rail can’t paint a station fence without asking the Treasury now.” Industry leaders and unions alike believe that the Treasury wants to target working conditions. According to one senior rail figure: “The single biggest thing is workplace reform, they believe productivity is low.” Mick Lynch, the RMT general secretary, sees it as “cynically exploiting the Covid crisis”, at a time when the government has talked up the value of rail as a green mode of transport and a way to level up. “What they really want to do is cut back on the existing workforce and start rehiring on inferior terms and conditions when demand returns,” he said. A DfT spokesperson said it was “demonstrably false” to suggest the government was delivering cuts to the railway, given the current levels of investment, the £96bn rail plan and the restoration of lines such as Okehampton. They added: “With passenger numbers significantly down, it would be reckless and irresponsible not to ensure that the railway is more efficient and reducing its costs to the taxpayer. “As taxpayers would expect, we have asked operators to provide credible and sustainable business plans which ensure taxpayer money is used efficiently, to deliver exceptional services, promote recovery to reset the balance in financial support and ensure the railway has a bright future.” • This article was amended on 6 December 2021 to remove a picture of a Scotrail train as that service is not covered by the Department for Transport.",Rail industry; Rail transport; Business; Transport; UK news; Transport policy; Politics,Business
2022-03-15T10:05:48Z,Covid exposed the cracks in the US food system – meet the people trying to fix them ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/covid-coronavirus-us-food-system-pandemic-cracks,"In April 2020, while Covid-19 spread around the country, and millions of people were sheltering at home, Shay Meyers, the CEO of Owyhee Produce, one of the largest onion growers in the US, asked his workers to bury thousands of pounds of onions. The restaurants, school dining halls, and event centers that normally bought his onions were all shuttered. His cold storage was full. Even though the demand for onions in American kitchens remained as high as – or even higher than – before the pandemic, there simply wasn’t a way to get the food into the hands of those who needed it. In April alone, Owyhee Produce buried four million onions. “I was extremely worried about going out of business,” Myers said. Long before most of the emergency rooms were overloaded, it was the food system that showed the first signs of the enormous impact the pandemic would have. Empty shelves at the supermarket. Closed restaurants. Farmers dumping milk out into their fields or euthanizing animals as meat processing plants became overwhelmed or shut down. And it wasn’t just farmers or the restaurant owners or the agricultural industry that suffered: hunger spiked across the country. Food insecurity in the US increased from 11% to 15% during the pandemic, with at least 60 million Americans visiting a food bank during 2020, an increase of 50% from the year before. “The pandemic shifted everyone’s understanding of food as something we buy and sell,” said Michael Fakhri, UN special rapporteur on the right to food. People are finally realizing that food is more than just a commodity, he said. “Food is how we take care of each other, and most importantly, it’s how we take care of the land and water.” Covid’s upturning of the US food system gave those in the industry a preview of a future where pandemics, global conflict and extreme weather events exacerbated by the climate crisis will wreak havoc on our ability to provide food reliably and equitably (the latest IPCC report on the climate crisis warns about exactly this). Fast forward two years and many of the bottlenecks have been resolved. Restaurants are opening back up. Schools are full. Supermarket shelves are stocked. But as the food system begins to return to normal, voices throughout the industry are pushing for change. Monopolies, bottlenecks – and new approaches “The biggest problem is power – and power being concentrated in the hands of a few.” said Fakhri. A Guardian analysis found nearly 80% of dozens of everyday grocery items are supplied by just a handful of companies. Only four firms control half the market in chicken processing, almost 70% of pork and more than 80% of beef, while four biotech seed companies control half the world’s seed supply. Consolidation of power plays out even when looking at food insecurity, said Andy Fisher, the author of Big Hunger. Food banks and food stamps programs “are all tied into corporations”, he said, adding that the vast majority of food stamps goes to superstores and supermarkets, such as Walmart, Target, and Costco. “Food banks are the same thing,” Fisher said. “You see huge ties between food banks and industrial agriculture, whether it’s board members, volunteers, cash, or food donations. It’s all about propping up our agricultural markets.” The pandemic laid bare the problems with consolidation. Four large conglomerates control approximately 55-85% of the market for pork, beef, and poultry, according to an analysis cited by the White House as part of its recent efforts to boost competitiveness, particularly in meat processing. When just a few of slaughterhouse shut down due to Covid outbreaks, it left farmers with no way of getting their livestock processed and ready for distribution. For Liz and Nate Brownlee of Nightfall Farms, the shortage of meat processors is not a new challenge. The Brownlees raise pigs, chickens and lambs and sell their meat locally in southern Indiana. “Back in 2018, farmers [in Indiana] were saying, ‘There’s not enough butcher shops, this is a bottleneck,’” said Liz Brownlee. This already tenuous situation became worse during the pandemic. When big meat suppliers such as Tyson and Perdue had to shut down their processing plants due to Covid outbreaks and grocery stores ran out of meat, demand for local products exploded. Farmers started raising more livestock, worsening the bottleneck. “All of a sudden, the butcher shops that we normally work with went from scheduling out three months to scheduling out a year,” Liz Brownlee said. For the Brownlees, this meant ending up with a product that’s harder to sell. “If the pigs grew slow because it was really cold, we get less meat back so we have smaller pork chops to sell. And the same thing is true on the other side. If they’re growing too fast, it’s just as hard to sell pork chops the size of dinner plates.” Two years after the pandemic began, small farmers in the US face the same mountain of challenges as before: high land costs, a system that favors corporate players, distribution built for scale and a labor supply at the mercy of changing immigration policy. They all just intensified. Until policies and systems adapt to support them, small farmers are left to their own devices to overcome systemic barriers. The Brownlees, who currently work part-time outside the farm to supplement their income, are hopeful they can find creative ways to turn their farm into a sustainable business. In 2017, they looked into starting their own small butcher shop. They ultimately decided not to move forward but shared their analysis with another local farm, which is opening the shop themselves. Another solution the Brownlees have discovered is running their own CSA (community supported agriculture), selling chicken, pork, lamb and eggs directly to customers through monthly membership boxes. “That reliability during the start of Covid was incredibly important to us. Our members stayed with us the entire time and we actually picked up more,” said Nate Brownlee. One of the things that makes our food system fragile, Fakhri said, is the lack of redundancy. When supermarkets run out of a type of food, there’s nowhere else for most people to get it from. “We have this mentality coming out of the ’80s and ’90s of ‘just in time’ delivery and of things being extremely streamlined. Things not sitting in warehouses, no storage, no backup,” Fakhri said. “Treating the supply of food by using the same model they use for the production of cars is part of the problem.” Solutions such as CSAs are the kind of redundancies that will help our food system prepare for the future, Fakhri said. “We need to create multiple supply chains.” Going local can create resilience Mandela Grocers, a small employee-owned cooperative grocery store in Oakland, California, was prepared for the particular problems of the pandemic. It gets its produce and meat from local producers. “We didn’t face those [supply chain] challenges because our supply chain is a lot shorter. There aren’t a lot of hands between our producers and our customers,” said Adrionna Fike, who works at the grocery store and like all seven workers, is a co-owner. “You won’t see Tyson meat here. We only sell one brand of chicken, that’s Mary’s chicken, because we trust Mary,” said Fike. The only things the store ran out of were gloves and paper bags, neither of which it sourced locally. Mandela offers steep discounts for people on food stamp programs or those who live in low income housing. Its workers earn $18 to $24 an hour, have benefits and participate in a profit-sharing model. It’s a stark contrast to some of the bigger grocery chains which have made huge profits during the pandemic, while their workers struggle. A recent report found that more than 75% of Kroger’s employees experience food insecurity. “At the height of the pandemic, we were having the biggest profits of our lives,” Fike said but Mandela’s took precautions to prevent burnout, including deciding against extending working hours to meet demand and closing on Sundays to give people an extra day of rest. Those decisions paid off – the store made it through the pandemic without a Covid outbreak or having to close due to staffing shortages. They raised wages in 2021 and employees earned the same even with closing on Sundays. Fike says that even if the wages aren’t grossly more than a chain grocery, their total compensation package is unmatchable by a chain grocery store. “No chain grocery store can do what we do.” Creating resilience in the face of global upheaval means focusing on the wider system, not just one aspect, said Fakhri. “You can have a shorter supply chain that will then reproduce the same problem of power and [lack of] accountability.” He believes the answer lies in transparency and accountability: knowing who is producing food and under what conditions, using government subsidies to support better farming and ensuring legal repercussions for worker exploitation, animal mistreatment and environmentally-harmful farm practices. As much as changes within the industry have an impact, experts warn that the most significant changes needed are policy changes. More robust anti-trust laws, something the Biden administration has indicated interest in, would be one of the most powerful ways to hold businesses accountable and limit the power being concentrated in just a few hands, Fakhri said. “Make markets work for people as opposed to the other way around. Right now, we’re all at the mercy of the markets.” When it comes to solving food insecurity, Fisher said that we need to stop looking at food banks and free food as solutions, and instead look at things like universal basic income, higher minimum wages, affordable housing, universal health care, and affordable childcare. “What we’ve developed is a system where we won’t give you money, but we’ll give you food, which has its roots in agricultural support programs.” “The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted what we have known for decades,” Fakhri wrote last year, “hunger, malnutrition and famine are not caused by inadequate amounts of food. They are caused by the political failures that restrict people’s access to adequate food.”",Coronavirus; Food & drink industry; Food banks; US news; Supply chain crisis; Business; Society; World news; Environment,Environment
2022-06-21T19:15:14Z,Skiing on a sacred mountain: Indigenous Americans stand against a resort’s expansion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/indigenous-native-american-ski-resort-sewage-water-arizona,"Hopi farmer Bucky Preston talks to the clouds that form atop Arizona’s tallest mountain. And they talk back. For 2,000 years, communication with the sky has been an important traditional farming method of the Hopi and their Puebloan ancestors. The clouds drift with Hopi prayers from the mountain they call Nuva’tukya’ovi – “place of snow on the very top” – to the tribe’s villages, providing life-giving rain and spiritual sustenance to the oldest continuously inhabited community in North America. But last fall, the sacred conversation fell silent. “I did not have a harvest,” says Preston, 72. “It was the first time in my life that happened.” He says other farmers, who grow without chemical fertilizer or irrigation, experienced the same. While the climate crisis and historic drought in the south-west may be factors, Preston blames another, human-made force for the disruptions: a ski resort carved into Nuva’tukya’ovi. The Arizona Snowbowl resort, which occupies 777 acres (314 hectares) on the mountain’s slope, has attracted skiers during the winter and spring for nearly a century. But its popularity has boomed in recent years thanks to growing populations in Phoenix, a three hour’s drive away, and neighbouring Flagstaff. During peak ski season, the resort draws upwards of 3,000 visitors a day. More than a dozen Indigenous nations who hold the mountain sacred have fought Snowbowl’s existence since the 1930s. These include the Pueblo of Acoma, Fort McDowell Yavapai; Havasupai; Hopi; Hualapai; Navajo; San Carlos Apache; San Juan Southern Paiute; Tonto Apache; White Mountain Apache; Yavapai Apache, Yavapai Prescott, and Pueblo of Zuni. They say the resort’s presence has disrupted the environment and their spiritual connection to the mountain, and that its use of treated sewage effluent to make snow is akin to baptizing a baby with wastewater. Now, a proposed $60m expansion of Snowbowl’s facilities has brought simmering tensions to a boil. The US Forest Service, the agency that manages the national forest land on which Snowbowl is built, is weighing a 15-year expansion proposal that would bulk up operations, increase visitation and add new summer recreational facilities such as mountain biking trails, a zip line and outdoor concerts. A coalition of tribes, meanwhile, is resisting in unprecedented ways. The battle is emblematic of a vast cultural divide in the American west over public lands and how they should be managed. On one side are mostly financially well-off white people who recreate in national forests and parks; on the other are Indigenous Americans dispossessed from those lands who are struggling to protect their sacred sites. “Nuva’tukya’ovi is our Mount Sinai. Why can’t the forest service understand that?,” asks Preston. ‘A fight with no middle ground’ At the center of the Snowbowl controversy is the resort’s snowmaking operations, an increasingly necessary tool as climate breakdown causes snowfall to be less predictable. Snowbowl manufactures its artificial snow with reclaimed water from Flagstaff’s sewage system, a method approved by the forest service as part of an earlier resort expansion plan in 2005. It was the first resort in the country to use reclaimed water for snowmaking; since then a ski area in Montana and one in California have also adopted the practice. Despite years of lawsuits brought by tribes and environmental groups, the use of reclaimed water has continued unencumbered. Over the last decade, Snowbowl has sprayed up to 1.5m gallons a year of treated sewage effluent on its groomed slopes. US regulators say the operation is safe and the resort views it as a way to outsmart the climate crisis. “We are using Grade A reclaimed water on the mountain for recreation and that is a positive thing,” says Rob Linde, Snowbowl’s general manager. “It is providing dependable snow for our guests and helps people enjoy the outdoors.” But tribes say the practice is contaminating sacred ground. The San Francisco Peaks, as Nuva’tukya’ovi is more commonly known, is a lone, extinct volcano with a collapsed caldera surrounded by six summits. The mountain is the site of Indigenous origin stories, ancient shrines and a place where ceremonial and medicinal plants are gathered. It’s considered so holy that, before the arrival of colonizers, Indigenous Americans avoided living there. There is no middle ground in this fight. Snowbowl executives insist the resort is not a sustainable business without the use of reclaimed water. The tribes say the existence of the ski area and use of treated sewage effluent is threatening their spiritual survival. “Our whole way of life depends on the mountain and praying for moisture,” says Preston, adding that many Hopi feel they can no longer be “sincere” in their prayers because they know humans have taken over the sacred act of creating snow, making the Hopi’s ancient rituals seem pointless. Snowfall on the San Francisco Peaks is highly erratic and, before snowmaking, Snowbowl struggled to stay afloat financially. But the 2005 decision opened a new era of profitability. The resort is owned by James Coleman, an investor called “the ski king of the south-west” who bought it in 2014 for Mountain Capital Partners, a private equity and development firm that owns a growing portfolio of small south-west ski areas in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. According to the company’s website, Snowbowl contributed $53m to the Flagstaff economy in 2019 and employed 700 people. During the 2021/2022 season, Snowbowl opened in time for Thanksgiving and kept the slopes running until early May, despite below average precipitation. (Guardian requests for an interview with Coleman were redirected to Linde.) The use of reclaimed water has also raised environmental concerns. While the water meets Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s highest standards, testing as part of the environmental review process for the 2005 expansion showed it contained trace amounts of hormones, antibiotics, antidepressants and other pharmaceuticals. The forest service still approved its use on the basis that these substances are not regulated and their presence did not violate any existing federal guidelines, and no further tests have been conducted since. For Navajo tribal member Cora Maxx-Phillips, who serves on the Navajo Nation’s human rights commission, the snowmaking is a continuation of cultural genocide against Indigenous Americans. “So they get to have their fun,” she says of the skiers, “but it comes at the expense of our spirituality and the environment.” The forest service is not monitoring the long-term effects at Snowbowl, but separate USGS studies of agricultural fields irrigated with reclaimed water have shown hormones and pharmaceuticals remain in the soils, although their impact is unknown. Maxx-Phillips, 66, and other tribal members are worried about how the ski area is changing the ecosystem. “In our culture, upsetting the balance of the natural world is the greatest crime a human can commit.” A new finding halts development During the week of spring break, Snowbowl’s slopes were bustling with skiers and snowboarders. Rainy Oliver and her daughter Missy, who recently re-located from Colorado to Williams, Arizona, were among those enjoying their vacation. “We were leery when we moved to Arizona because we were worried we wouldn’t be able to ski,” Oliver said as she and her daughter waited at the bottom of a busy run. “We are thankful for Snowbowl.” Oliver had heard that the San Francisco Peaks were sacred to Indigenous Americans but wasn’t familiar with details about the controversy. Chad and Ron, two firefighters from western Arizona, sat at a picnic table drinking a beer and enjoying the cool alpine climate of the Peaks. The pair, who asked to withhold their last names for privacy reasons, were not aware that snow was being made from reclaimed water, nor that the area was sacred to Indigenous nations. “I don’t have an emotional attachment to this land like Native Americans do,” said Ron. “But just to play devil’s advocate, we are in a drought and putting moisture back into the ground seems like a good use of reclaimed water.” Snowbowl’s popularity is only rising, and many of its facilities were built in the 1980s and are ill equipped to handle the growing demand. Visitation has increased 12% annually and resort managers say the proposed developments will help ease overcrowding and improve customer care. Snowbowl’s growth seemed all but certain until spring 2021, when a misstep by the forest service stopped development in its tracks – and offered hope that Indigenous people’s input might be taken more seriously. The historic preservation staff for the Hualapai Nation, discovered that a memorandum of agreement that the forest service signed with the Hualapai and other nations as a stipulation of Snowbowl’s 2005 development plan had expired six years earlier, and the nations were never notified. This put the forest service out of compliance with section 106 of the federal National Historic Preservation Act, a provision of the law that deals with sites of cultural or religious significance to Indigenous peoples. Section 106 requires the federal government to consult tribes before carrying out any development in these places and, if there are negative impacts, to develop a memorandum of agreement with tribes outlining mitigations. To the dismay of Mountain Capital Partners, that discovery prompted Laura Jo West, the forest supervisor for Coconino national forest, which contains Snowbowl, to halt ski area development projects until a new memorandum of agreement could be reached. Construction slated for summer 2021 to build out snowmaking infrastructure – a project approved with the 2005 expansion plan – was cancelled. West’s decision also put the brakes on the environmental review process for the new master development plan. Environmental groups and tribal governments question the validity of Snowbowl developments that occurred after the memorandum had expired and were allowed to proceed without proper tribal consultation. The Sierra Club, an environmental non-profit that advocates for the tribes, claims the forest service has frequently bent policy rules to accommodate the business interests of the ski area. The group submitted a detailed complaint to the agency in 2020 listing various violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) that included allowing the number of daily Snowbowl visitors to grow beyond what was approved in the ski area’s 2005 master plan. The agency also failed to conduct an environmental review when the resort changed ownership, as stipulated under the terms of Snowbowl’s special use permit for operating on forest service land. The forest service disputes allegations that policies were violated. “The forest service does not care what the tribes need or want, nor does it care what the rules are,” says Alicyn Gitlin, program manager for the Sierra Club’s Grand Canyon chapter. For her part, supervisor West saw the pause as an opportunity to reset how the agency consults Indigenous peoples. “We need to heal our relationship,” says West. While she could not change the bad blood that developed as a result of the agency’s approval of Snowbowl’s 2005 expansion, West wanted to have “meaningful conversations with the tribes” before the agency began formal review of the ski area’s new master development plan. “It’s important that we move beyond what’s minimally required by law,” says West of the forest service’s obligation for tribal consultation. “Only from a position of respect for what sacred sites like the San Francisco Peaks represent to the tribes can we start the conversation about how we manage these places into the future.” This sentiment is echoed by the Biden administration, which issued a joint secretarial order last November requiring tribal consultation for decisions by agencies such as the forest service and encouraging the use of traditional ecological knowledge in land management practices as well as co-management with tribes. An unprecedented act of resistance Based on past history, tribes are skeptical about whether Biden’s lofty initiatives will actually trickle down to regional situations such as Snowbowl. They also wonder why West’s supervisor removed her from Snowbowl-related activities this spring and replaced her with a supervisor in New Mexico, although she remains in charge of all other Coconino national forest matters. While the future remains uncertain, the stakes are high. If a fight over Snowbowl’s new master plan was to go to court, there is no law to protect Indigenous sacred sites such as the San Francisco Peaks. Past lawsuits arguing that a nation’s religious rights were being infringed upon by the resort have always, ultimately, been unsuccessful because judges disagreed with the basic premise of their argument: all living things are intrinsically interconnected. Many Indigenous Americans insist that even though Snowbowl occupies just 1% of the mountain, the resort is spiritually and environmentally affecting the other 99% . But western laws and federal land management policies don’t see it that way. Maxx-Phillips is a survivor of Native American boarding schools, where she was taught to forsake Navajo culture. It took years to recover her traditions and heal from that experience. “Having to fight against these laws that are designed to protect corporations and the federal government brings up a lot of generational trauma,” she says. “It is very triggering.” The battle has had one hopeful outcome: encouraging tribes to band together for the first time, using their collective power to resist in ways that haven’t been tested before. After learning earlier this year that Mountain Capital Partners was holding private meetings with higher level forest service officials, Martina Dawley, a preservation officer who helped discover the memorandum error, rallied the 13 nations to organize as a single unit. Such a move is unprecedented in the south-west, where economically stressed reservations with poorly resourced tribal governments have not had the emotional or financial capacity to independently take on the US government. But acting as one makes it hard for the forest service to “divide and conquer”, as Dawley puts it, by consulting each tribe separately. So far this spring, the forest service has held two virtual meetings with the 13-tribe coalition, whose demands include an independent environmental review of Snowbowl’s operations – before they will agree to a new memorandum – as well as involvement in defining what constitutes “tribal consultation”. The coalition is also resisting pressure to meet the agency’s timeline to restart ski area projects until tribal governments feel assured that their concerns are truly considered. Regional Forest Service officials declined a Guardian interview request but Shayne Martin, the agency’s south-west region communication director, responded to questions via email. “We are currently working with tribal members toward a new [memorandum of] agreement,” said Martin. “We would like to emphasize that tribal consultation is our next needed step before any additional construction activities are authorized at Snowbowl.” When asked how the forest service would deal with the inherent conflict between Snowbowl’s business demands and the Biden administration’s mandates to honor Indigenous spiritual values, Martin responded: “While the forest service has legal obligations under many laws and executive orders which require balancing multiple uses, the forest service also has great respect for the tribes, their desired outcomes, the sacred nature of the San Francisco Peaks, and the government-to-government consultation process as a means to work together on these issues.” Meanwhile, undaunted by the failed harvest last year, Bucky Preston is working in his fields for the next few months to plant traditional Hopi corn, beans, squash and melons. He does it all by hand, kneeling on the ground and covering each seed with soil. “I put my whole body into it,” he says. “I need to feel what the plants feel.” Preston says he is going to keep fighting in his own “Hopi way” to protect the peaks. “I am not familiar with how to fight with laws but I sure can depend on my prayer to stand up for the mountain,” he says. “That is my weapon.”",Indigenous peoples; Arizona; Climate crisis,World news
2021-03-29T09:15:54Z,Deliveroo dampens IPO expectations as investors raise workers' rights concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/29/deliveroo-ipo-investors-workers-rights,"Deliveroo has cut the upper valuation of its landmark flotation on Wednesday by £1bn, saying it will price its shares at the bottom of its guided range because of “volatile” market conditions. The London stock market listing will now value the takeaway delivery firm at £7.6bn-£7.85bn, instead of a potential £8.8bn, after a week in which leading fund managers said they would shun Deliveroo amid concerns over workers’ rights. Although the listing is still expected to be London’s biggest float for a decade, Legal &amp; General and other investors highlighted the potential for state intervention in the gig economy to affect Deliveroo’s business model. A strike and protest by Deliveroo riders on Sunday underlined recent disclosures that the firm was effectively paying some as little as £2 per hour. The firm is set to announce its final share pricing on Wednesday morning but has narrowed the range to between £3.90 and £4.10 a share, instead of up to £4.60. A number of US tech stocks have also fallen below their issue prices after initial public offerings in recent weeks. After the regulatory concerns highlighted by L&amp;G and others including Aviva, the sustainable investment manager EdenTree indicated on Monday that it would boycott the IPO, saying Deliveroo’s model was “best characterised as a race to the bottom with employees in the main treated as disposable assets – which is the very antithesis of a sustainable business model”. Despite these concerns, Deliveroo said on Monday that investor demand exceeded the number of shares on offer. A spokesperson said: “Deliveroo has received very significant demand from institutions across the globe. The deal is covered multiple times throughout the range, led by three highly respected anchor investors. “Given volatile global market conditions for IPOs, Deliveroo is choosing to price responsibly within the initial range and at an entry point that maximises long-term value for our new institutional and retail investors.” Firms have also raised concerns over the Deliveroo share structure, which will result in the founder and chief executive, Will Shu, having 20 votes a share, compared with one a share for other investors, giving him a majority position at shareholder votes. The company has benefited from the closure of restaurants for anything other than takeaways during the Covid-19 crisis and revenues have soared. The listing is set to be London’s biggest IPO since Glencore in May 2011 and it will be the biggest tech IPO on the London Stock Exchange, dwarfing the Hut Group last year and the 2015 listing of Worldpay Group, which has since delisted. While investors expressed concerns about Deliveroo, another big company in the gig economy, Hermes, reached an agreement with unions to increase rates. The GMB union said about 20,000 couriers were getting the right to paid holiday and guaranteed minimum pay under the “self-employed plus” deal struck with the delivery firm in 2019. Mick Rix, a GMB national officer, said: “Hermes is continuing to show other companies that looking after those who work for you is not just the right thing to do, it’s good for business. “Couriers now have a real voice in their workplace.” Martijn de Lange, chief executive of Hermes UK, said: “Independent research shows that over three-quarters of our SE+self-employed-plus couriers believe that their health and wellbeing has improved as a result of having paid holidays.”",Deliveroo; IPOs; Business; Stock markets; UK news; Gig economy; US news; London Stock Exchange; Couriers/delivery industry; Hermes,Business
2021-05-26T22:01:09Z,"Tax soaring private jet use to fund green flying, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/26/climate-ticket-tax-private-jet-users,"Climate-heating emissions from private jet flights have soared in Europe since 2005, according to a report. It calls for wealthy fliers to pay ticket taxes of €325m a year to fund the acceleration of zero-carbon aviation technology. Carbon emissions from private flights rose by 31% from 2005-19, the report says, and private aviation had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels by August 2020, when 60% of public flights were grounded. Travelling by private jet is the most polluting activity an individual can undertake, the report says, with four hours of flying equivalent to the total annual emissions of the average European citizen. The study, by the campaign group Transport &amp; Environment), found that private jets were five to 14 times more polluting per passenger than commercial planes, depending on the jet used. It also found that almost half of private jet flights within Europe were short – less than 500km – compared with the quarter of commercial flights that travel under this distance. The T&amp;E report argues that with the average private jet owner being a billionaire and flights being little taxed at present, these travellers can afford to pay to fund the development of electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft and low-carbon aviation fuels. The first zero-emission aircraft will carry only a small number of passengers over short distances, perfect for the world of private jets, the report adds. Andrew Murphy, an aviation director at T&amp;E, said: “Super-rich super-polluters are flying around like there’s no climate crisis. The sector falls outside of the regulatory reach of many governments, despite the enormous climate impact that these flights have, and despite the growth of their usage. “But the upside is that the private jet market is ideally suited to help bring about aviation’s Tesla moment, making hydrogen and electric planes a reality.” In January, the Guardian reported that wealthy UK flyers were opting for private jets to evade Covid-19 and beat lockdowns. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, was recently criticised for taking short private jet and helicopter flights, and his predecessor, David Cameron, used a private jet to visit his holiday home in Cornwall. The report says the UK and France dominate private flights in Europe, responsible for almost 40% of all emissions. The French Riviera resort of Nice is one the most popular destinations, which T&amp;E said showed that many private flights were for holidays and business. The report recommends that by 2030, regulators should only allow the use of electric or green hydrogen aircraft for private jet flights under 1,000km within Europe. Until 2030, taxes on flights and fuel should be imposed on fossil-fuel private jets, it said, to account for their disproportionate climate impact. The report calculates that a ticket tax on private flights would raise €325m a year if based on a system already approved in Switzerland, where short flights are charged €360 and long ones €1,200. The Swiss government will use the revenue to fund the development of sustainable aviation fuels, invest in the country’s rail network and pay a carbon dividend to every Swiss citizen. Unlike vehicle fuels, there is little or no tax on jet fuel, but if implemented this could raise millions more in revenues, the report adds. Market researchers estimate the private jet market will increase by 50% between 2020 and 2030, with “increasing number of high net worth individuals one of the significant factors”. One private jet operator, GlobeAir, reported a 11% increase in sales in July 2020 compared with 2019, with fear of Covid-19 contagion and lack of available commercial flights likely reasons. “Everything is primed for it to grow,” Murphy said, noting that struggling commercial airlines may provide flights to fewer destinations in future and fewer business class seats, as home working continues. Athar Husain Khan, the secretary general of the European Business Aviation Association, which represents the private jet sector, said: “Our track record shows we welcome a greater push towards a sustainable business aviation sector, but it’s important we do not misrepresent the true economic value, business benefit and societal impact the sector makes. “We appreciate our sector has a different emissions profile [but we are] actively working towards decoupling its CO2 emissions from the growth of the sector. Over the last 15 years, emissions per hour, per flight, per business aircraft have decreased by 36%,. The sector is, in principle, not against environmentally motivated taxation as long as those funds are used directly to finance the research and development required to help meet emissions goals.”",Airline industry; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Business; Environment,Business
2021-06-07T14:46:56Z,Graça Machel: global solidarity on Covid disappeared once vaccines arrived,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/07/graca-machel-global-solidarity-on-covid-disappeared-once-vaccines-arrived,"The global solidarity inspired by the Covid pandemic disappeared as soon as vaccines came along, the Mozambican politician Graça Machel has said before the G7 summit, as she called on richer countries to share vaccines and for progress on tackling the climate crisis. Machel, a member of the Africa Progress Panel and a prominent politician, served as first lady in Mozambique and South Africa, as the wife of first Samora Machel and then Nelson Mandela. She said: “Without everyone on Earth being vaccinated, there is no safety. It’s a question of survival, even for the developed world. We have to take the necessary steps. To make sure everyone all of us get the vaccine – that is common sense. “At the beginning of Covid, we all embraced one another, saying it is a threat to everyone. But as soon as there was a vaccine that solidarity completely disappeared. People don’t like to say this but it’s also a moral issue. How can you say other lives can be left to die?” She contrasted the situation of G7 countries with the developing world: “Rich nations are stockpiling vaccines while only 2% of Africa is vaccinated.” She said the G7 must deliver a deal on vaccines and on the climate. Like the Covid crisis, the climate emergency could spell disaster for the developed world too, even if developing countries appear to be more vulnerable at first, and the situation has worsened in the past decade. “The impact of climate change has increased tremendously. Investment in the developing world is diminishing. “We have to be in solidarity; the impact of climate change will be in the developed world as well. We are all safe or no one is safe.” Her comments came as Paul Polman and Andrew Liveris spoke out on their concerns about the UK’s decision to cut aid. Polman, a former chief of Unilever who is now the chair of the International Chamber of Commerce, and Liveris, a former chief executive of Dow Chemical and a prominent Australian businessman who is also part of the B Team group of sustainable business leaders, said the UK foreign aid cuts sent the wrong signal to other countries and would damage the prospects for the Cop26 climate summit. Polman and Liveris urged Boris Johnson to reverse the UK’s cuts to overseas aid. “[The cut] is a terrible, terrible idea,” said Liveris. “Countries have to look after their own, but to send this signal as host nation is a real weakness.” Polman said: “It is sending strongly the wrong signal. Climate finance [for poor nations] is an integral part of the success of Cop26.” The leaders of the G7 countries – the UK, the US, Japan, Canada, France, Germany and Italy – and the EU will meet in Cornwall on Friday to discuss the global economy, Covid-19 vaccines, taxes on business, and the climate crisis. Boris Johnson will call on the world’s wealthiest nations to help vaccinate the entire global population by the end of 2022. He has previously pledged to donate most of the UK’s surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries, but this process has yet to be quantified or to start. This week’s G7 leaders’ meeting is seen as an important milestone on the way to the Cop26 summit this November in Glasgow, with the UK hosting both. Machel said it was vital for the G7 and Cop26 to address the issue of climate finance, the assistance provided to poorer countries to help cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown. Developing countries were supposed to receive at least $100bn (£70bn) a year in climate finance from 2020, under a pledge made in 2009, but this target has been missed. Experts said developing countries needed to see that the pledge would be met, in order to build trust for a deal at Cop26, and commitments from the G7 would be essential to that. However, they said the UK had “lost credibility” in urging other developed countries to come up with the financial commitments necessary, because of the decision to slash overseas aid. Peter Betts, a former UK chief climate negotiator, said: “This does reduce the UK’s credibility in pushing other donors to do more. This is eroding and undermining UK credibility.” Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher school at Tufts University in the US and a former World Bank climate official, said the G7 meeting was vital in gaining new commitments in climate finance. “If not the G7, then who? And if not now, when?” She said the US needed to make greater commitments on climate finance, and that other G7 countries – including Germany, Japan and Italy – had been notably silent on the issue. “It’s extremely difficult to go further faster if there is this question in UK politics [over overseas aid]. I don’t think for many Brits this is how they would like to be portrayed in their diplomacy.”",G7; Vaccines and immunisation; Climate crisis; Coronavirus; Health; Society; Inequality; Environment; Africa; Cop26,World news
2022-07-22T03:30:01Z,The rise and fall of Deadspin: how ‘jerks in Brooklyn’ changed sports journalism,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/21/the-rise-and-fall-of-deadspin-how-jerks-in-brooklyn-changed-sports-journalism,"Will Leitch was sitting on a panel when he was confronted by an exasperated ESPN executive. Roughly six months earlier, Leitch, then the editor-in-chief of Deadspin, had published a leaked internal memo from the network – a massive 50-page intra-office Q&amp;A about some programming items as well as tree planting, parking issues, and sleeping security guards at ESPN’s headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut. “It was just a reminder that ESPN – the most powerful force in all of sports then and now, but certainly even a larger percentage of it then – was just as banal and stupid and pedantic as your paper company in Omaha, Nebraska,” Leitch said. What Leitch remembers most about the exchange, though, was the executive demanding to know how Deadspin had obtained the document. The executive seemed to assume that ESPN had been hacked – and not that disgruntled employees might have leaked something to a website whose entire raison d’être was to cut against the boring, staid, corporate establishment. To Leitch, that was a crystallizing moment for Deadspin’s place in the sports world: a blog that not only would continue to evolve with and reflect the broader culture within which it was immersed but also would always hold true to its values of reporting on sports without access, favor, or discretion. “They were just threatened and scared, because they thought they knew how things worked,” Leitch said. “And this new thing came up and terrified them.” ‘Just kind of do whatever you want’ Leitch was covering the financial services industry (“poorly”, he says) in New York when he started a site called The Black Table with Eric Gillin (now the chief budget officer at Condé Nast), Aileen Gallagher (now a journalism professor at Syracuse University) and AJ Daulerio. That landed Leitch an offer from Gawker head Nick Denton to run a gambling-oriented site. While Leitch declined, he also wrote up a proposal for a sports site based on the Hollywood site Defamer. Gawker was interested, but because Leitch was a no-name at the time, Gawker offered the gig to several other candidates. “Finally, they came to me and said, ‘Fine, you’re cheap,’” Leitch said. “‘Just kind of do whatever you want, it’s all yours.’” Leitch took the reins in the late summer of 2005 – a time before Twitter but when a new wave of prestige television was rising on HBO and other cable networks. His editorial vision mirrored that of TV, with time slots allocated each day for different types of content. As for the programming, Leitch was fortunate to have two big and growing sources at his disposal: a growing commenter community and peers in other newsrooms who had stories their bosses wouldn’t let them print. “That’s how I got a bunch of scoops early on,” he said. “There were a bunch of journalists who wanted to write things and couldn’t, so they would send them to me.” In a modern society where every aspect of life is branded as a “community” – your apartment complex, your exercise bike, your workplace – that give-and-take allowed Deadspin to create an actual, organic community of fierce and loyal readers and commenters. In turn, that created a dynamic almost unfathomable today: users who would go online and actually type in the site’s URL, sometimes multiple times a day, to see what had been posted. “I liked the idea of doing a site that really tried to connect the people who worked in the world of sports – whether they were a player, the media, whatever – and the people who pay for all of this,” Leitch said. As Leitch passed the torch to Daulerio in 2008 and Tommy Craggs came on board in 2009, an anti-establishment ethos reigned. “We were consciously fashioning an alternative to ESPN,” said Craggs. “The fun of Deadspin’s evolution was figuring out all the ways we could not be ESPN.” That meant the site took chances others weren’t willing to take, for better and for worse. In retrospect, some of Deadspin’s biggest early stories – on baseball player Josh Hamilton’s alcohol relapse and quarterback Brett Favre’s sexual harassment – are remembered by editors as missteps. “If I’m being candid, for a long time, I wasn’t super fond of it,” former Deadspin editor Tim Marchman said of the Hamilton story, which was published before he worked at the site. Hamilton, a recovering addict, was claiming to be sober but had gotten drunk at a bar during spring training that year – news that Deadspin broke, replete with embarrassing photos. “As I remember it, it’s a story that would probably be handled with some more nuance today, as far as the struggles of people with addiction,” Marchman said. Craggs has a similar take on the Favre story, which involved a string of team-hired masseuses who accused Favre of sexual harassment. The narrative focused on the fact that Deadspin had received – and published – photos of Favre’s penis, which he had texted to a reporter. But that pushed the more serious and serial allegations to the back burner. “I think we misplayed that story in a lot of ways that are obvious now,” Craggs said. But where other outlets would often get defensive when challenged on their mistakes, Deadspin examined its own processes to hold itself to account. That dual demand of accountability – both for the industry and itself – reflected a site maturing as it evolved. It also helped distinguish Deadspin from another fledgling, anti-establishment sports blog, one that built its own irreverent reputation on the idea that it could say and do whatever it wanted without reproach. “Barstool became Barstool when Deadspin stopped being Barstool,” Craggs said. ‘Your day just took a turn’ From inside professional sports front offices, Deadspin appeared at first as a curiosity. “We started to read it and pay attention to it because it was irreverent and funny,” said Patrick Wixted, who worked in public relations with the now-Washington Commanders from 2000 to 2008. “But then it definitely became clear that if Deadspin was doing a story about you, your players or your team, or someone was reaching out to you in a PR capacity, it wasn’t going to be a good thing. Your day just took a turn.” Wixted had moved on before some of the Washington franchise’s more egregious, latter-day scandals made headlines. But he recalls the sea change in the team’s boardroom when executives began to realize that the old ways of operating weren’t going to cut it anymore. “Deadspin was a wake-up call to the evolution of sports media from traditional to non-traditional,” said Wixted. “It kind of signaled that time and era, that you need to be ready for it, deal with it, have a plan for it.” Some of that shift was due to the new editorial direction at Deadspin. Both Craggs and Marchman had cut their teeth at local alternative weekly magazines, which certainly informed both the tone and the content of that era of the site. And while that background may have informed their approach, as internet culture evolved and twisted in the social media era, the daily content took on a novel form: It mirrored the way people consumed the internet. Consecutive posts could include a wild highlight from a game the prior night; an underexplored, ranked list; a 4,000-word investigative story; and a Bear (yes, a literal bear) of the Week. Writers wrote about what they wanted to write about or found interesting rather than being siloed into beats, and they had no firewall between who was allowed to write news or editorials. “It was the purest expression of what I wanted to do in journalism and what I think can be done in journalism,” Craggs said. “It was a model for what journalism should be.” That flexibility has certainly tested the rigors of more rigid, existing newsroom models in recent years. “The pace at which cultural deterioration is happening writ large, legacy media is still kind of in a sort of denial about that,” said David Roth, a former Deadspin writer and editor. “They’re still fighting the last war of how this stuff is talked about and written about.” But it also meant a place like Deadspin could be more responsive to the seemingly never-ending churn of modern news cycles. Being able to respond immediately, then build a well-woven narrative, piece by piece, made it more nimble and agile than legacy outlets. Dave McKenna’s extensive, ongoing reporting on then-Sacramento mayor and former NBA star Kevin Johnson’s political power plays, misuse of public money, corruption, sexual assault, and cover-up eventually led to ESPN pulling its 30 for 30 documentary on Johnson and grounded his once-promising political career. “That way of being on top of the story to me seems way more useful in this moment than the big newspaper model of waiting until you’ve got some awards-winning package,” Roth said. “Then you drop 8,500 words on Donald Trump’s tax returns and no one finishes [reading] it.” While some of Deadspin’s evolution happened slowly, it took one very obvious and memorable leap. On the afternoon of 16 January 2013, Leitch, Craggs and Daulerio sat down in an old boxing gym with journalist Charlie Warzel, then with Ad Week, for a multi-hour interview, which would be turned into an oral history of the site. They had turned their phones off for the interview; when they turned them back on, they saw the story that would forever change not just their site, but digital sports media. “Oh, I’m sorry,” Leitch recalls telling Warzel. “Every single thing I told you is now pointless. The entire history of what Deadspin is and what it will be known for has changed during this conversation.” The Manti Te’o saga Manti Te’o had become a household name beyond just college football. The Notre Dame linebacker’s inspirational performance following the deaths of both his grandmother and his girlfriend was written up in a Sports Illustrated feature story, which was quickly aggregated across the web. There was just one problem: Lennay Kekua, his girlfriend, did not exist. Te’o had been the victim of an elaborate hoax, one that only unraveled when Deadspin did the digging that no other outlet had bothered to do. “Lennay Kekua is, I honestly think, the most important story in sports internet history,” said Nate Scott, former managing editor at USA Today’s For The Win. It wasn’t just that it was an eminently shareable and salacious story. It wasn’t just that it showed Deadspin could put out real investigative journalism. “It was the fact that they had done better reporting than the gods of sports media at that time, and they had embarrassed them,” Scott said. “And it wasn’t just Sports Illustrated. Everyone bought it.” In the USA Today (FTW’s parent company) offices, there were frantic meetings, trying to figure out how the USA Today staff had been out-reported by “these jerks in Brooklyn”. The Manti Te’o story changed the way FTW was looked at and treated by its own newsroom. “It was almost like our superpowers had been revealed to us, in a way, because we didn’t have the access that predecessors had,” Scott said. Scott’s own site was one of the many already emulating what Deadspin was doing, taking more of an outsider approach to publishing the stories that readers wanted in the moment. But the Te’o story broke the dam that more traditional newsrooms had built against the rising tide of outsider digital media outfits. “The dirty secret is, after being stubborn for so long, all the other journalism outlets just started ripping them off,” Scott said. In the aftermath, Sports Illustrated’s Pete Thamel revisited what had gone wrong in his original reporting of the story, revealing the weaknesses of a shrinking industry that was bleeding advertising revenue to Google and Facebook. He was on a tight turnaround. While the story went through a fact-checker, the only adjustments were to remove details that couldn’t be confirmed. The old-school print deadline loomed. In the end, they took it on faith and ran it without confirming a central aspect of the story – that its protagonist’s dead girlfriend never existed. “You could totally understand in a human way why it happened, and that was a structural problem for the industry,” Leitch said. “And that’s one of the things Deadspin was put on this Earth to do – to call out that shit.” In addition to the attention and reputation it garnered the site, the Te’o story also set the tone for one of Deadspin’s great balancing acts over the years – the ability to both report and conduct media criticism within the same story. “That was so dead center in our sweet spot, for that very reason,” Craggs said. “What I loved so much about it was that it exposed a whole sort of approach to sportswriting, a whole genre of story, a whole machinery of mythmaking, and did it in this kind of hilarious, wild way.” The need within sports journalism for this kind of reflexive skepticism – an ethos of questioning power and competitive success instead of celebrating it – has been highlighted by dozens of stories over the past decade, including systematic sexual abuse perpetrated by former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, allegations of physical and sexual violence against pitcher Trevor Bauer, and dozens of sexual assault allegations against quarterback Deshaun Watson. Spin it out further, away from the sports world, and we’ve seen how following through on vetting official statements can lead to the unraveling of an entire official narrative, as in the aftermath of the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting this spring. “That’s one of the things I love about it: It scales up so much to more important things,” Marchman said. “In the grand scheme of things, did it really matter if Manti Te’o had a dead girlfriend? Not really. [But] it matters a lot when people forward, ‘Well, the cops said this.’” ‘You knew it was never going to work’ If the Manti Te’o story best epitomized Deadspin’s ascent, Kyle Wagner’s story about Gamergate may well have presaged what came next, both for the site and for American culture more broadly. Picking apart how the flimsy, nebulous ideal of “ethics in gaming journalism” had been used as pretext to launch a pressure campaign against Intel to pull its advertising from a website critical of what Gamergate really was, Wagner’s article exposed how power could be wielded dishonestly, with bad actors weaponizing bad faith to bend institutions to their will. Those themes arguably resurfaced when wrestler Hulk Hogan sued Gawker over Deadspin publishing a portion of a sex tape involving Hogan and a married woman. A jury awarded Hogan $140m in damages, bankrupting Gawker. Ostensibly about privacy, the lawsuit had been quietly backed by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who previously had been the subject of Gawker reporting about his sexual preferences. Gawker and its family of sites, including Deadspin, were bought by Univision in 2016, becoming part of the media consolidation trend that has swallowed so many American newsrooms. But it was the entity’s next sale that presaged our current moment, when the then-renamed Gizmodo Media Group (or G/O Media) was purchased by private equity firm Great Hill Partners in April 2019. What followed was a series of conflicts between staff and management. Implementation of auto-play advertising and pop-up ads made a once-easy-to-read site a nightmare to navigate (the same thing later happened to Sports Illustrated’s site after its own private equity takeover). The tipping point came with a misguided insistence that Deadspin’s writers and editors “stick to sports”, cutting against the very sensibility that had made the site successful and unique. Highly regarded editor-in-chief Megan Greenwell quit, and when deputy editor Barry Petchesky was fired in November of that year, the fed-up staff quit en masse. “The minute those dipshits bought Deadspin, you knew it was never going to work,” Leitch said of Great Hill. “Because Deadspin has always done whatever the hell it wants.” A majority of the staffers who quit went on to form Defector in 2020, a worker-owned, subscription-based version of, basically, what they had done at Deadspin. The structure seems to be working well enough for them, providing freedom from corporate edicts and, at least so far, a sustainable business model. In addition to its initial staff, Defector has added former Sports Illustrated reporter Kalyn Kahler and brought former Deadspin writer Laura Wagner back into the fold. Kahler’s stories about NFL players using fake Covid vaccine cards and nepotism in the league’s coach hirings are the kinds of pieces that once defined Deadspin, while Wagner’s fearless work as media reporter, critic and watchdog epitomizes the ongoing evolution of why Deadspin was created in the first place. Wagner grew up reading Deadspin in high school and college, and you can draw a through line from some of the site’s early reporting to what she’s doing now, especially on other sports media companies and their efforts to unionize. “The way they wrote about [college sports] amateurism, specifically – that radicalized me,” Wagner said. “It was a totally new way of thinking about power and how it worked, and nobody else was writing about that. It changed how I conceived sports journalism could work.” That goes for not just the areas of coverage, but the way the newsroom itself operated. “These places generated and created incredible solidarity,” said Craggs. “There’s a reason Gawker Media was the first digital shop to organize.” In recent years, the extent to which journalists should be allowed to have a personal voice or express their opinions about politics, culture and morality has become a topic of heated debate inside and outside newsrooms. The argument is largely generational, with older journalists defending the kind of performative objectivity that has long been standard industry practice, and younger journalists countering that this “view from nowhere” is both dishonest and biased. On 24 June, the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, the New York Times and USA Today released edicts reminding staffers to not take public positions on the topic or other matters that could be political – in essence, Stick to News. By contrast, Defector staffers, who own and control their own company, were free to speak their minds. Deadspin changed sports journalism by doing what other outlets wouldn’t, right until they did. As Defector continues to evolve and grow, there’s a chance it may do the same, providing a working model for the industry’s future. “The thing that gives me hope, beyond the community of people invested in growing the number of sites like ours, is that people still want to read good posts,” Roth said. “I’m paraphrasing a friend here, but if you don’t take [private equity] money, they can’t tell you what to do. And I’d much rather be accountable to our readers than to anyone else that’s ever been my boss.” This article was originally published by Global Sport Matters, a project of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University.

2021-02-02T14:37:52Z,Google Stadia closes in-house game development studio,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/feb/02/google-stadia-closes-in-house-game-development-studio,"Google has shuttered its internet game development studio, the company has announced, and is all but abandoning the idea that Stadia, its groundbreaking streaming service, could be a top-tier competitor to traditional games consoles. In a blogpost from Phil Harrison, the former Microsoft and Sony exec who was hired to mastermind Google’s push into console gaming, the Stadia general manager confirmed it was scaling back its ambitions, but insisted that the company’s core vision, of “having games streamed to any screen”, was still achievable. “In 2021, we’re expanding our efforts to help game developers and publishers take advantage of our platform technology and deliver games directly to their players,” Harrison said. “We see an important opportunity to work with partners seeking a gaming solution all built on Stadia’s advanced technical infrastructure and platform tools. We believe this is the best path to building Stadia into a long-term, sustainable business that helps grow the industry.” But the “new focus” of Stadia also sees Google abandoning its attempts to build exclusive games for the platform. The company’s internal development team, SG&amp;E, is being disbanded, resulting in the loss of an estimated 150 jobs, and only “near-term planned games” are expected to see release. SG&amp;E has yet to finish a single game, and its high-profile lead, former Ubisoft producer Jade Raymond, will also be leaving Google, Harrison confirmed. Stadia will continue to work as a consumer offering, the company confirmed, with third-party games being brought to the platform. “Our goal remains focused on creating the best possible platform for gamers and technology for our partners, bringing these experiences to life for people everywhere,” Harrison wrote. In practice, however, there are few meaningful partners for Stadia to work with. Of the major console manufacturers, Nintendo has historically valued control of hardware, while Microsoft and Sony each own and operate a substantial mature cloud gaming service of their own. Stadia’s 2019 launch was an underwhelming affair. The service was only available to those who paid more than a hundred pounds for the Founder’s Edition, which included a standalone controller and a Chromecast to stream to a TV, as well as three months of the Stadia Pro subscription service. But for their money, early adopters could only play a handful of titles, including just one Stadia exclusive, and with most of the games requiring a further payment of the full RRP before they were available. Promised features, such as the ability to join a game direct from a YouTube live stream, or to share a URL that would let players jump into a saved game with a single click, were not present, and some still have yet to launch. But Stadia received praise for achieving the difficult task of actually building a streaming games service that worked: with low latency and high resolutions, at least on fast connections, Google’s technical prowess was on display.",Google Stadia; Games; Google; Culture; UK news; Technology,Games
2021-02-18T07:01:27Z,River Action targets agri-businesses in campaign to stop pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/18/river-action-targets-agri-businesses-in-campaign-to-stop-pollution,"The heads of some of the biggest agricultural suppliers are being targeted in a campaign to stop their activities polluting rivers. River Action, a new group focusing on the state of UK rivers, is launching its first campaign by writing to the chief executive of Noble Foods, one of the biggest egg producers operating around the River Wye, where pollution from increasing numbers of free range poultry farms is said to be seriously damaging the river. The Guardian reported last week that there have been no prosecutions or fines issued to farms by the Environment Agency (EA) despite 243 violations of legislation designed to curb the agricultural pollution of waterways in England. River Action’s founder and chairman, Charles Watson, said: “It is in this absence of effective regulation that we have launched River Action. Specifically, we believe that the time has come for the large agri-businesses that procure product from our farmers and supply our retailers to assume their fair share of the responsibility for cleaning up agricultural pollution. These are often large profitable businesses – who without exception proclaim publicly their commitment to responsible and sustainable business practices. River Action intends to hold them to account.” The scale of pollution in English rivers from the agricultural runoff of chemicals and sewage pollution was exposed last year when just 14 % of them were rated as being in a healthy condition. In 2020, for the first time, no river achieved good chemical status, suggesting that pollution from chemicals and agriculture is having a huge impact on river quality. Sewage wastewater discharges by water companies into rivers account for damage to 36% of waterways, and runoff from agricultural industries is responsible for 40% of the damage, according to the EA. The Wye is feared to be one of the worst-affected rivers. A report by the Campaign for Rural England in 2019 said there were 500 farms with a total of 1,420 intensive poultry sheds, containing over 44 million birds around the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire and Radnorshire, raising concerns about pollution of water systems. Natural Resources Wales has published data that states that 60% of the Wye is in ecological crisis. Noble Foods supplies eggs to leading supermarkets under the brand name Happy Egg Co. In a letter to Duncan Everett, CEO of Noble Foods, River Action is asking for details of the mitigation the company takes to prevent “highly damaging nutrient runoffs” into the river and the amount spent on such programmes. Former Conservative environment minister Richard Benyon, who is on the advisory board of River Action, along with Guardian writer George Monbiot and Feargal Sharkey, said:“Urgent action is needed to reduce the impacts of agriculture and food production on our rivers before it is too late. As consumers and investors become increasingly environmentally aware, food companies need to step up and take responsibility for the practices of those in their supply chain.” A spokesperson for Noble Foods said: “We take our responsibility to protect the environment extremely seriously and we have been working in close collaboration with the Wye-Agri Food Partnership and the Usk and Wye Rivers Trust soil erosion group to develop long-term solutions to this complex situation that affects the entire agriculture industry. It is our aim to deliver a plan that can be successfully implemented across the farming sector.”",Rivers; Environment; Pollution; Agriculture and forestry; Food; UK news,Environment
2020-11-23T11:00:01Z,Extinction Rebellion launches campaign of financial disobedience,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/23/extinction-rebellion-launch-campaign-of-financial-disobedience,"Extinction Rebellion is launching a campaign of financial civil disobedience aimed at exposing the “political economy’s complicity” in the unfolding ecological crisis. The group – which has staged some of the UK’s biggest civil disobedience protests over the past two years – is turning its attention to what it says will be a sustained campaign of debt and tax strikes. It is also asking people to “redirect” loans from banks that finance fossil fuel projects to frontline organisations fighting for climate justice. Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of XR, which was set up two years ago, said: “It’s time to tell the politicians who prop up this way of living: no more. We want an economy that grows health and wellbeing, not debt and carbon emissions. An economy that prepares and protects us from shocks to come, rather than making them worse. An economy that shares resources to meet all our needs, regardless of background. An economy that lets us live.” Organisers hope that in the coming months the “Money Rebellion” will involve thousands of people in the “redistributing debt” scheme and the debt strikes. XR says it also has a growing number of small businesses that are planning to divert a portion of their taxes to help fund investment into green, sustainable business models and initiatives rather than pay them to the government. Bradbrook said: “We need a grownup conversation about why our political economy is killing life on Earth.” XR says the Money Rebellion is the latest stage of its campaign centred around three demands – that the UK government tells the truth about the scale of the climate and ecological emergency, that if commits to zero carbon emissions by 2025 and that it agrees to a binding citizens’ assembly to devise policies to address the crisis. The group has held three major events since its launch, bringing motor traffic in parts of central London to a standstill. Organisers say that despite its success in raising awareness of the escalating climate crisis, the government has failed to respond appropriately.",Extinction Rebellion; Environment; Business; Tax; Money; UK news,Environment
2021-01-26T00:01:47Z,Facebook News launches in UK following deals with publishers,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/26/facebook-news-launches-in-uk-following-deals-with-news-outlets,"Stories from news outlets including the Guardian, the Daily Mail and the Financial Times will appear in a dedicated Facebook feed from today. The UK launch of the Facebook News service is the first outside the US. In addition to already-inked deals involving the Guardian, the Economist and hundreds of local sites, Facebook on Tuesday announced new partnerships with Channel 4 News, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky News and Telegraph Media Group. The deal, which will earn leading publishers millions, will be a financial boost as they face a bleak economic landscape, in part because such a large proportion of the ad market is now controlled by the social network. Facebook said the investment was intended to “support the industry in building sustainable business models”. However, it will also be seen as a strategic play by the company aimed at discouraging wider international regulation of the news media market – by showing that it is prepared to support local publishers without government intervention. It comes as Australia moves ahead with a proposed “news media bargaining code”, which would force tech companies to enter into negotiations for payment for content or face third party arbitration if they cannot reach a deal. Meanwhile, the EU copyright directive threatens a similar scenario across Europe. Last week Google agreed a deal to pay news publishers for online content in France, the first such deal on the continent. Facebook said that the deal in the UK, where the EU copyright directive does not apply, was “the beginning of a series of international investments in news” that “puts original journalism in front of new audiences as well as providing publishers with more advertising and subscription opportunities to build sustainable businesses for the future”. Contracted news editors – working for news aggregator Upday but overseen by Facebook’s curation team – will select stories of the day, while other stories algorithmically selected according to a user’s interests will also appear. Facebook said that the product would provide curated “news digests” covering the most important reporting on the stories of the day, giving an example of a collection of coronavirus-related stories to coincide with the launch. Although some publishers have signed seven-figure deals, others are not paid upfront and will rely on a boost to referral traffic or views of ads on Facebook’s Instant Articles format. Besides its regulatory concerns, Facebook will also hope that by giving news a separate feed it can bolster its reputation as a responsible platform in an era of unreliable sources. It may also hope that by giving news a feed of its own it can eventually separate highly controversial stories from the more palatable pets-and-family content which remains the most powerful draw for most users – although a post by Jesper Doub, director of news partnerships in Europe, said that “news articles shared by people and pages will continue to appear in News Feed [Facebook’s main feed], just as they do today”. Of the UK’s national news publishers, News UK – which publishes the Times, the Sunday Times, and the Sun – is the most significant holdout. It already has a deal with Apple News.",Media; Facebook; The Guardian; Daily Mail; Financial Times; DC Thomson; Sky News; Telegraph Media Group; Newspapers; News UK,Media
2019-07-25T17:47:42Z,Unilever warns it will sell off brands that hurt the planet or society,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/unilever-warns-it-will-sell-off-brands-that-hurt-the-planet-or-society,"Unilever has warned it will sell off brands that do not contribute positively to society, with British favourite Marmite and Magnum ice-cream among the big names thought to be vulnerable to a cull linked to the company’s sustainable business agenda. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, said it was no longer enough for consumer goods companies to sell washing powders that make shirts whiter or shampoos that make hair shinier because consumers wanted to buy brands that have a “purpose” too. Unilever has tasked its marketers with devising sustainable business plans for its portfolio of more than 400 brands, with Marmite, Magnum and Pot Noodle thought to be among the businesses that will need to find a raison d’être if they are to remain part of the group in the long term. “Can these brands figure out how to make society or the planet better in a way that lasts for decades?” said Jope, outlining the company’s thinking. Unilever is not working to a set timetable but Jope, who took over from Paul Polman in January, said it was possible that a brand or even whole product category “is not going to be able to find its purpose”. His comments raised the possibility of the company selling off profitable brands, potentially hurting the bottom line, but Jope said: “Principles are only principles if they cost you something.” Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of the business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals, which include increasing the positive impact it has on communities. Unilever is also looking at ways to respond to shoppers’ concerns about single-use plastic, with the launch of Cif refills (so spray bottles can be reused) and wrapper-less multipacks for its Solero ice-cream lollies. Jope said its sales data had not detected a change in shopper behaviour yet but there was evidence of attitudes changing amid a heightened debate about the environment. Jope’s comments came as Unilever updated investors on its performance in the first six months of 2019. Operating profits were up slightly at €4.6bn (£4.1bn) that fell short of analyst expectations of €5bn. The 3.5% increase in underlying sales for the second quarter was slightly weaker than expected. Although many parts of Europe are experiencing record temperatures, the company said the cool start to the summer season had hit demand for its ice-cream brands, which also include Cornetto. The shares closed down 2% at £48.96. Steve Clayton, the manager of HL Select funds which holds a position in Unilever, said: “Unilever themselves describe their markets as mixed, and most investors will look at these numbers as something of a curate’s egg.”",Unilever; Ice-cream and sorbet; Food; Food & drink industry; Business; Climate crisis; Plastics,Business
2020-09-28T23:01:01Z,Tesco sets 300% sales target for plant-based alternatives to meat,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/29/tesco-sets-300-per-cent-sales-target-for-plant-based-alternatives-to-meat,"Tesco is to become the first UK retailer to set a sales target for plant-based alternatives to meat as it steps up efforts to offer shoppers more sustainable options. The UK’s largest supermarket will on Tuesday commit to boosting sales of meat alternatives by 300% within five years, by 2025. Over the past year, demand for chilled meat-free foods – the most popular line including burger, sausage and mince substitutes – has increased by almost 50%, the retailer said. As a result, it is expanding into more categories and creating larger “centrepiece” dishes for two people as well as family-sized portions. The target is part of a wider package of sustainability measures developed with its charity partner the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to try to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket. Dave Lewis, who steps down as Tesco chief executive on Wednesday, said: “We know from tackling food waste that transparency and ambitious targets are the first steps towards becoming a more sustainable business.” The trend reflects people paying closer attention to their diet during the Covid-19 lockdown and increasingly adopting “flexitarian” diets – cutting down on meat and dairy while eating more plant-based foods. Global demand for plant-based protein – dominated by the US giants Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat – is predicted to be £4.1bn this year, from £2.9bn in 2015. In January 2018, Tesco was the first UK retailer to launch an own-label plant-based range, Wicked Kitchen, initially showcasing 20 plant-based meals, sandwiches and salads. It will now expand meat alternatives in all its stores, across 20 different categories including ready meals, party and frozen food. Among 11 new plant-based foods going on sale at Tesco this week are centrepiece dishes using the wheat protein favourite seitan as a meat substitute, including a beef-free joint and hunter’s chicken-free traybake. Turkey-free crowns and vegan mince pies are launching in time for Christmas. Meanwhile, the Leeds-based meat-free brand Meatless Farm has raised £24m to support expansion plans in the UK, Europe, US and Asia as global markets emerge from lockdown. Its founder, Morten Toft Bech, said: “We are seeing strong demand for our plant-based burgers, sausages and mince and see opportunities to grow the brand rapidly as people look to eat more healthily and sustainably.”",Tesco; Business; Food & drink industry; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Vegan food and drink; Vegetarian food and drink; Vegetarianism; Veganism; Dave Lewis; UK news; Food; WWF; Environment; Life and style,Business
2020-10-19T06:12:33Z,"Make climate risk reports mandatory for 480 FTSE firms, say investors",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/19/call-climate-risk-reports-mandatory-ftse-listed-firms,"An influential group of investors is urging UK regulators to make climate risk reporting mandatory for nearly 500 FTSE-listed firms. The Investment Association (IA), which represents 250 members with £8.5tn in assets, has thrown its weight behind calls for compulsory environmental disclosures, amid concerns that listed companies are not being transparent about how climate risks are influencing the way they invest and spend. While the number of FTSE 100 companies claiming they have implemented the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework has more than doubled in the past year, to 77, the IA said just 53% had published reports covering all four of the key categories – climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The IA is calling on the Financial Conduct Authority to make TCFD reporting mandatory for all 480 premium-listed FTSE companies. It made its views known in a recent consultation on the issue which closed on 1 October. The call goes beyond current plans put forward by the FCA that would ask those premium-listed companies to release climate disclosures or explain why they have failed to do so, starting with reports released in 2022. The IA said a “comply or explain” requirement should be introduced for all UK listed firms outside of the premium listings. There are about 1,140 firms listed on the UK stock exchange, according to the FCA. Sarah Woodfield, the IA’s senior policy adviser for stewardship and corporate governance, said: “Significant progress has been made by the FTSE 100 in reporting the impact climate change will have on their businesses. But the UK’s largest companies must now go further and set out in detail how they are managing their resources to respond to these risks.” Woodfield said savers and investors would suffer if company valuations plunged due to poor climate risk management. “That’s why the investment management industry is now calling on the UK regulator to make TCFD disclosure mandatory for all commercial companies with a premium listing. This disclosure will enable investors to price climate risk effectively into their investment decisions and as long-term stewards to provide support and challenge to companies to transition to more sustainable business models.” Even before the regulator takes action, the IA expects firms to improve reporting in the interim. The industry body will be setting out shareholders’ priorities for the 2021 annual shareholder meeting season this autumn, and is likely to urge companies to further detail their climate crisis strategies and spending decisions. The FCA said: “We welcome the Investment Association’s response and will give careful consideration to their views, alongside those of other respondents. We will consider these views as we look to finalise our policy position this winter.” Members of the UN-backed Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance – which includes Aviva, the Church of England and the $400bn (£310bn) US fund CalPERS – plan to set decarbonisation targets for 2025 as part of wider efforts to align their portfolios with the Paris climate goals and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.",Climate crisis; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate governance; Financial Conduct Authority; FTSE; Green economy; Business; Environment; UK news,Environment
2021-04-24T20:00:48Z,"A hassle-free alpine crossing: ‘Barely 1km in, I see wild brumbies in the distance’",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/apr/25/a-hassle-free-alpine-crossing-barely-1km-in-i-see-wild-brumbies-in-the-distance,"Jean-Francois Rupp has been living in the Alpine region of Victoria for only five years but already he has seen the climate and environment change significantly. Rupp, who grew up in the snowy the French Alps, noticed Australia’s snow seasons becoming shorter each year. As the founder of a tourism company, Alpine Nature Experience, watching the region’s biggest drawcard dwindle was very worrying. “Already I can see specific types of birds coming back earlier and earlier each season because the snow doesn’t last as long,” Rupp says. “I can already see dramatic changes in that short period of time. It’s pretty scary.” It’s an issue tourism operators who rely on the snow season alone for an income can no longer afford to ignore. A 2017 report from the CSIRO on climate change impacts on snow in Victoria warned that across four ski resorts (Falls Creek, Mt Hotham, Mt Buller and Mt Buffalo) the average snow season may be up to 80 days shorter under the worst-case scenario. Rupp established Alpine Nature Experience as a fully sustainable business, which has helped him to adapt to the challenges presented by short snow seasons. He started with environmentally friendly experiences, such as evening snowshoe hikes through Mt Hotham, leading to a hidden eco-village with a heated tipi, hand-built from reclaimed timber. In winter he also offers overnight stays in heated eco-domes and igloos, built on platforms so that vegetation beneath is undisturbed. The experiences were perfect for those keen to see snow but not interested in skiing. His off-grid eco-village operates on solar power and all equipment is walked in and out so vehicles don’t disturb the environment. Rupp realised, however, that he would need to offer nature experiences year round, given the shortening snow seasons and unreliable snowfalls. He also knew the high country’s mountains, valleys, bush, wildlife and creeks had more to offer than just snow. The result is a multi-day hike from Falls Creek to Hotham in the warmer months, an approximately 40km trek over two days. The concept is simple: provide travellers with a sustainable, multi-day hiking experience without the logistical stress. Sometimes Rupp will accompany walkers, but the hike can also be self-guided. All that’s required is a small day pack with enough space to carry the essentials, like water, lunch and wet weather gear. Everything else, from accomodation to transport, is arranged. I opted to do the self-guided option, and after parking my car in Bright I’m met by Rupp the evening before the hike. He drove me and four other hikers through winding mountain roads to the Diana Alpine Lodge at Falls Creek, about an hour away. Here lodge manager and chef Lisa Logan provided a three-course Japanese-inspired dinner to fuel us before the morning’s efforts. Logan also prepares all the food travellers take in their day-packs – freshly made salads, muffins, and frittata – to eat on each day’s walk. After breakfast I am armed with maps, snacks and an extensive briefing from Rupp, who drops me about 10km away at the Wallace Hut heritage trail car park where the trek begins. Just 500m down the track is the oldest cattlemen’s hut in the region, the heritage-listed Wallace Hut. The hike takes me along the aqueduct trail and past Rover chalet to Cope Hut, a ski refuge built in 1929 and an idyllic picnic spot for my lunch. The next stretch is an easy walk through grassy alpine meadows on the Australian Alps walking track. That track is one of the country’s best known and for good reason – there are stunning views across seas of wildflowers. Heavy rains overnight made hiking across the high plains’ alpine wetlands an adventure in dodging deep puddles and traversing slippery mud, proving good waterproof hiking boots are a must, no matter the time of year. Eventually I reach Pole 333, the junction of four walking tracks, and begin the steep descent into the West Kiewa valley towards Weston Hut, which stands amid snow gums and lush green meadows and with Mt Feathertop in view along the way. The other hikers and I assemble at the hut, where Rupp is waiting with drinks and a campfire over which vegetables and beef are grilling. There is even a shower for those who want it, but for most of the hikers the warmth of the campfire (and the gin and tonics) are enough to shake off any aches. Like Rupp’s igloos, our tents are suspended above the ground to avoid disturbing the earth beneath. Though the original plan had been to stay at the Blair Hut campsite, we changed course slightly due to the wild weather the night before. Rain made accessing that site, and lugging all the gear in, too risky for Rupp. He is constantly monitoring the weather and any warnings, and speaks regularly to local rangers to make sure the routes are safe so he can update the itinerary if necessary. After a night sleeping in a tent strung up between trees, I embark on day two of the hike. Barely 1km in I see wild brumbies in the distance. Day two is more challenging, and includes the option to hike along Razorback Ridge, one of the most popular hikes in Victoria, though Rupp recommends against this owing to the weather. I fill my drink bottle and wash my face in the stream near Dibbins Hut before embarking on a steep climb up Swindlers Spur. The climb and subsequent views of Mt Feathertop, across the Bogong high plains and Basalt Temple is my favourite part of the trek. Heading towards Derrick Hut, a charming weatherboard structure, I’m surrounded by masses of white, tangled snow gums. The beauty of visiting the region off season is that there are few people around, providing plenty of time and space to stop and take in the scenery. By this point, the finish line at Mt Loch car park is in reach, where Rupp meets me and the other hikers with watermelon and an esky full of drinks. He drives us to our accommodation for the night, The General resort, where we get a pub feed and enjoy a spa before Rupp drives us back to Bright the next morning. Throughout the experience, Rupp talks about all of the ways the hike is low impact, and the importance of protecting the local environment. Nothing is ever left behind. Even the lunch bags we are given are reusable, and waste is disposed of in compostable bags and processed by the local Mount Hotham composting facilities. The experience costs $1,490 a person, which covers all meals, gear, and accommodation, and 1% of annual sales is donated to an environmental organisation. “A big part of what we aim to do is have have people come away from the experience richer than when they arrived,” Rupp says. “Yes, the state of the climate is such a mess and what we are doing won’t make the ski season longer. But … if we can help educate people, the impact of what we are doing extends beyond just our business. “Sustainability is a mindset.” The guest travelled courtesy of Tourism Victoria and Alpine Nature Experience.

2021-05-21T20:00:41Z,"Scott Morrison is pulling a Jedi mind trick, rebadging disasters into triumphs – and getting away with it | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/22/scott-morrison-is-pulling-a-jedi-mind-trick-rebadging-disasters-into-triumphs-and-getting-away-with-it,"My Insiders colleague Niki Savva is a droll woman. She noted in her column this week that our prime minister possesses many talents. Sewing. Hammering. Squinting at things in test tubes. Flipping a breezy thumbs up in the cockpit of a plane. Anyone who watches the television news regularly will have glimpsed these gifts. I’d add another to the list. Morrison can spin straw into gold. What I mean by this is our prime minister possesses some sweet rebranding skills. Various disasters are rebadged as triumphs. Morrison pulls this Jedi mind trick reasonably often, and it’s hard to know what is more irritating: the unapologetic prime ministerial chutzpah, or the fact he gets away with it far more often than he should. Let’s illustrate with a couple of examples. They are trying to fix it, but let’s be honest, thus far, the government has made a hash of its most important job this year: the Covid-19 vaccination rollout. Some of the botch-up was bad luck, but a lot of it was bad judgments. The government was sluggish chasing supply at the start, and then politics rather than efficiency determined the rollout strategy. Because of the bungles, Australia is pulling up the drawbridge when we should be on a path to opening up. To mask the government’s errors, Morrison has read the zeitgeist and switched roles. Only a few months ago, he was the opening up evangelist. Now, the same prime minister who lectured the premiers about lockdowns being no substitute for a public health strategy has morphed into Mr Lockdown. Morrison can flip, the opposite can also be true, because he knows hard borders work in the current political climate. The political potency of fortress Australia, to some extent, shields the government from a penetrating critique of what has led us to this point. While the politics feel manageable for the government, policy failure has real world consequences. Because we can exist comfortably in our Covid-safe bubble, many Australians apparently feel little pressure to get vaccinated, which pushes back the border reopening. Bizarrely, the health minister, Greg Hunt, this week appeared to reinforce hesitancy that has built up in the community about the risks of rare and severe clotting associated with the AstraZeneca jab by noting “there will be enough mRNA vaccines for every Australian” by the end of the year. Presumably this was just a ham-fisted attempt to be all things to all people – but really, who would know? So rather than being pinged, or subjected to much sustained discomfort, Morrison sets his jaw, and sails on relentlessly. Right at the moment, he’s fully intent on piloting past the increasing vexation of premiers who feel they’ve saved Canberra from itself since the pandemic began, past the increasing frustrations of businesses that don’t have a sustainable business model until the border reopens, past universities staggering because of the prolonged absence of foreign students, and past any irritating questions from journalists. Pesky questions can be safely ignored given the vituperative clamour of national affairs muffles any discordant sound. Morrison presents right now as a prime minister sailing into the sunshine of the permanent campaign where the incumbents write the rules – which is his sweet spot. He has an extraordinary fluidity that enables his constant, no-regrets repositioning (which is generally considered the hardest trick to master in politics). But Morrison’s fluidity flows from the fixed point of his professional identity, which is political operative first, second and third. Pump out the budget. How will any unfunded spending be paid for? Wrong question – even though that’s the central question the Coalition has been skewering its opponents with for decades. Zip up to Gladstone. Down to Bass. Sewing. Hammering. Squinting at things in test tubes. Giving a breezy thumbs up in the cockpit of a plane. Morrison is the self-styled star of the faux campaign that will rumble on until the precise moment he is confident he’s got the viable path to victory, and then we’ll be thrust into the real one, ears pinned back in the slipstream. The operating tempo will pick up, but also deaden as the campaigns assail disengaged voters with slogans tested for salience, and negative advertising. Weaponised fake news will roll through Facebook. I hope this doesn’t sound cynical, because I’m not even close to cynical, and even if I was, cynicism is no use to anyone. My purpose here is diagnostic. I’m charting the topography of Morrison’s politics, and trying to position a prime ministerial oeuvre in the strange, slippery, age of bombardment and bewilderment we all inhabit. My purpose here is light, not heat. We need to grasp that our prime minister governs by constant calculations and recalibration, which is certainly an art, and fascinating in its way. But it can make a person – well, this one, anyway – crave substance with a gnawing hunger. A political world that’s heavy on stagecraft and light on substance delivers us now to the Hunter Valley, and a power plant no one with expertise asked for. After dropping hints for many months, Morrison and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, confirmed this week (conveniently in time for a state byelection in the Hunter) that a gas peaking plant will be built at Kurri Kurri. Please understand the following. Some of the government’s most senior energy policy advisers privately characterise this project as absolutely “bonkers”. But the government has zipped bonkers into an “aren’t we marvellous” onesie, hoping you won’t notice. This week, Morrison and Taylor told us the planned gas peaker (which will actually run on diesel initially if you check the fine print) will deliver cheaper and more reliable power. But it is hard to work out how, given the people who run Australia’s energy market say gas is likely to be more expensive than other options, like batteries, pumped hydro and demand management. Let’s puncture the routine obfuscation with some plain words explaining why this is happening. Australia’s energy market is in the middle of an inexorable transition. The Coalition federally has done everything in its power to suppress this transition, telling voters for more than a decade that things can remain as they were. This has never been true, and we’ve reached the point now where the fiction isn’t holding. Things are moving so rapidly that the coal generators that have propped up the system for decades could leave Australia’s energy market significantly earlier than anticipated. If these anchor fossil fuel assets stagger out the door in chaotic fashion because they’ve been priced out of the market by cheaper, low emissions alternatives, the lights could go off. Voters might even blame the agents of chaos: the Coalition. So what the government is purchasing with Kurri Kurri isn’t cheaper reliable power. It is gold-plated insurance at your expense: a brand new, taxpayer-funded power plant that might never operate, or operate only very intermittently to firm renewables. Again, let’s be clear about culpability. When it repealed the carbon price, the Coalition removed the policy mechanism that would have driven this market transition in orderly fashion, and replaced it with an impenetrable, arbitrary, Soviet-style, picking winners and propping up fossil fuels program. When it did that, it transferred the cost of the transition from the polluters, to taxpayers. The botch-up is now so epic it is possible that we might need some expensive, more polluting, back-up dispatchability to stabilise the grid over the next few years while various technologies mature. Those are actually the facts, but you might struggle to locate them in all the moustache twirling, as various pundits in Canberra pontificate about how the Coalition lobbing this gas plant is actually super clever, because it delivers an atomic wedgie to Labor. I mean seriously. On this match report crap goes. Unfortunately, this isn’t sport, and it’s past time to be crystal clear about the consequences of all the various shenanigans. Here are the consequences. The joke is on you, good voters of Australia. When your government buggers it up, it sends you the bill.",Scott Morrison; Coalition; Energy; Coronavirus; Australian politics; Australia news,Australia news
2020-09-27T23:01:01Z,M&S brings back its 'shwopping' clothes recycling scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/28/shwopping-returns-as-marks-and-spencer-brings-back-clothes-recycling-scheme,"Marks &amp; Spencer will this week bring back its popular UK “shwopping” scheme which is aimed at keeping clothing out of landfill, six months after it was mothballed because of coronavirus. Customers can from Thursday donate their unwanted clothes, shoes, bras and accessories of any brand or condition in 287 stores with clothing sections. The scheme, launched in 2012, is part of the retailer’s Plan A programme and an expansion of a partnership with Oxfam, which began in January 2008 and has led to more than 35m items being donated, worth a total of £23m. It started on a modest scale when the retailer encouraged shoppers to donate their unwanted M&amp;S clothing to Oxfam to receive a £5 voucher. It later morphed into “shwopping” , with the aim of encouraging shoppers to donate clothing routinely when they buy something in store. All clothing items that customers donate in stores – via large cardboard bins – are sent to Oxfam to be resold in one of its shops or online, to be reused via its social enterprise in Senegal or to be recycled into new materials, which include being used to make the filling in M&amp;S mattresses. “At M&amp;S, our goal is to source all our products with care and ensure nothing we make goes to waste”, said Carmel McQuaid, head of M&amp;S sustainable business. She said shwopping was “a programme that many of our customers rely on as they shop with us for new staples – and now more than ever it’s perfect for those who have been decluttering”. In line with government guidelines, M&amp;S will quarantine all items for 48 hours before sending them on to Oxfam. The retailer is also starting to include details of the sustainable raw materials it uses for its clothing products online, with information available for more than 4,000 items so far. Despite high charity-shop donation rates before the pandemic, 300,000 tonnes of clothing ends up in household bins every year – 20% of which goes to landfill and 80% is incinerated – according to a recent report from the environmental audit committee. The rise in the popularity of “fast fashion” led to clothing worth an estimated £140m being sent to landfill every year in the UK. Charity shops were forced to close at the start of lockdown and while most have been reopening since the end of June, many have been restricting donations, and have had their work curtailed by a shortage of volunteers. The government was this month urged by the all-party parliamentary group for ethics and sustainability in fashion to take urgent steps to fix fast fashion by boosting clothing recycling facilities and supporting the development of fabrics with a lower environmental impact. Other recycling schemes include TK Maxx Give Up Clothes for Good campaign, which has been running for 16 years.",Marks & Spencer; Corporate social responsibility; Retail industry; Fashion industry; Business; UK news; Charities; Society; Recycling; Environment; Waste,Business
2020-11-27T13:41:33Z,Digital Markets Unit: what powers will new UK tech regulator have?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/27/digital-markets-unit-powers-new-uk-tech-regulator,"The government has unveiled its first tentative steps towards the regulation of digital monopolies, following an investigation by the competition watchdog into the digital advertising industry. A new body, the Digital Markets Unit, will be established to lead the effort. But what it will do, what powers it will have, and who it will cover, are still unclear. Which companies are being regulated? Officially, the answer isn’t settled. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recommended in its review that the new regulations only cover platforms funded by digital advertising, and designated as having “strategic market status”. It is “highly likely” that Google and Facebook will be given that status, the CMA has said, but which other companies will get drawn into the regulator’s purview is uncertain. The government has yet to decide on what would qualify a company as having strategic market status beyond requiring that it has “substantial and enduring market power”. But the focus on digital advertising could narrow the field to just those two companies. According to eMarketer, Google and Facebook combined receiveabout two-thirds of the UK’s digital ad spending, with every other company in Britain that uses digital advertising sharing the remaining third. What are the harms the government is trying to prevent? As well as the potential damage to news media, the CMA’s review found other problems that it blamed on the duopoly at the top of online advertising. The lack of genuine competition “results in reduced innovation” and a “lack of consumer control” over data use, the CMA found. It also argued that both Google and Facebook had been free to greatly increase the number of ads shown to consumers because of the lack of competition, while also “consistently earning profits well above what is required to reward investors with a fair return”. What will the regulation cover? The core of the regulation will be a new code of conduct to which tech monopolies will be required to adhere. The contents of that code have yet to be drawn up but the government’s intention is to “protect competition in digital markets funded by online advertising”. Particular attention is being paid to the relationship between digital advertising and news publishing, based on last year’s Cairncross review into the future of British media. That report argued that “the behaviour of online platforms on whom news publishers rely is a key barrier to publishers developing sustainable business models online”. What could be required? Though the specific requirements have not yet been set, they could be very granular. The CMA, for instance, has suggested that Google might be required to share detailed information with competitors such as Bing about what users search for and which results they click on. Otherwise, it warned, the company’s monopoly might prove unassailable: Google gets more search data, which allows it to improve its searches, which means that users are less likely to switch to competitors, which means yet more data for the company. The government has also suggested it wants this to be significantly tougher than other attempts to regulate the technology industry. It pointed to Australia’s attempt to create voluntary agreement between news publishers and big tech as evidence that the regulator needs to have the ability to force compliance. How will online news be affected? That depends on what the Digital Markets Unit recommends. The proposals it will examine run the gamut from broad-brush financial penalties to fine-grained tweaks at the edge of the industry. It may, for instance, look to France and Australia and impose a requirement on Facebook and Google to pay licence fees for content such as preview images, headlines or excerpts. Alternatively, the unit might address the problem from the other end. If Facebook and Google have their access to user data curtailed, for example, then their ability to personalise advertising will take a hit. That could mean a corresponding increase in the value of advertising elsewhere, including alongside news, which would be a boost to publishers’ bottom lines.",Digital media; Technology; Regulators; Advertising; Media; Business; Google; Facebook; UK news; Politics,Media
2020-09-14T10:57:40Z,Colin Leventhal obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/14/colin-leventhal-obituary,"Behind the creative chaos that was the start of Channel 4 television, there stood from the very first days one elegant, quizzical, unobtrusive figure making order and a sustainable business where there was none before. Colin Leventhal, who has died of cancer aged 73, was a solicitor who was mad about film, had been head of copyright at the BBC and came to Channel 4 in 1981 to set up the first business relationships with the independent programme-makers who were springing up all round the country. His intellectual brilliance, fair-mindedness and deep sympathy for creative artists made as important a contribution as any to the success of the new channel. He rose to become director of acquisition and a board member, and in 1993 set up Channel Four International Limited and Film Four Distributors. Colin was born in Nottingham, the son of Morris, a manufacturer of ladies’ coats and costumes, and Olga (nee Weber). He went to Carmel College in Wallingford, then in Berkshire, and read philosophy at King’s College London before training as a solicitor and joining the BBC in 1974. Feature films were his love. He played a central role in C4’s innovative film financing policy, which boosted the whole industry and produced a string of hits for Film on Four including My Beautiful Laundrette (Stephen Frears), The Crying Game (Neil Jordan), The Madness of King George (Nick Hytner), and Trainspotting (Danny Boyle). His contribution to the wider film industry continued after he left Channel 4 in 1997, founding Miramax HAL Films with his wife, Trea Hoving, and David Aukin, a partnership with Miramax that lasted until 2000. When I was C4’s director of programmes I made many headaches for Colin. These were heady years of challenging the staid rules of broadcasting to transmit contentious material from Northern Ireland and highly polemical programmes from all points of the compass – which produced a stream of letters from libel lawyers, angry politicians and exasperated regulators. I have no idea what Colin’s politics were but he saw his job as serving the channel’s duty to break new ground while keeping us out of jail or from losing our licence. All I ever got was sound legal advice, the occasional raised eyebrow and the best specialist defence counsel we could find. We lived to tell many tales, thanks to him. He was a lovely colleague, a huge enthusiast for programmes and programme-makers, and a great professional. It was a pleasure to see how joyfully he took to late fatherhood, patiently waiting to pick up his little girls from their dance class, looking after their dog Belle and carting them all off to the Hamptons for summers with their American family. He is survived by Trea, whom he married in 1995, his daughters, Amelia, Kate and Matilda, and his sister Patricia.",Channel 4; BBC,Media
2020-07-19T16:55:45Z,Ted Baker to cut 500 jobs as pandemic losses add to financial woe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/19/ted-baker-to-cut-500-jobs-as-pandemic-losses-add-to-financial-woe,"The fashion retailer Ted Baker is to axe at least 500 jobs – more than a quarter of its UK workforce – as the pandemic continues to batter the high street. It is understood that about 200 of the roles will go at the retailer’s London headquarters, the Ugly Brown Building, with the remainder from its shops – it has 46 in the UK and Europe – and store concessions. A spokesman for the retailer said it could confirm that “as part of our continuing transformation plan, we have been assessing the appropriate level of staffing across our business and are in consultation with affected colleagues”. Both part-time and full-time roles are affected. The move, first reported by the Sunday Times, caps a difficult few months for the business. At the start of June it revealed that the coronavirus pandemic had caused revenues to slump by 36% between 26 January 2020 and 2 May, with department stores and branches closed by a government order. These latest job losses are on top of 160 already announced in February. Those reductions, predominantly affecting office workers, were described as the first stage of a restructuring designed to put the business back on track. In January this year, the company had a UK workforce of 2,025. Ted Baker reported a loss before tax of £79.9m in the year to 25 January, before the pandemic started to affect sales, and a 1.4% fall in revenues. That compares to a £30.7m profit a year before. The turnaround plan for the business, launched in June, included broadening the brand’s offering to make its clothing “more relevant to all day/week occasions” and selling more accessories and shoes. The company also said it would invest more in updating its website, which had offered a bright spot during the lockdown. Commenting on the latest cuts, the spokesman said: “We have not taken this decision lightly and would like to thank all our colleagues for their hard work and commitment. However, we believe this is necessary in order to transform Ted Baker and create a more sustainable business in the future.”",Ted Baker; Job losses; Retail industry; Fashion industry; Fashion; Coronavirus; UK news; Business,Business
2020-09-16T17:41:54Z,"Media failing to promote black staff, says Gal-Dem founder",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/16/media-failing-to-promote-black-staff-says-gal-dem-founder,"The founder of gal-dem has said mainstream media outlets are failing to promote black staff into management positions, as she steps down five years after founding the website aimed at women and non-binary people of colour. Liv Little, who has overseen the site’s growth from a small blog platform to an increasingly influential media company, said outlets were getting better at hiring young staff from diverse backgrounds. However, many of these individuals were drifting away after being overlooked for promotions. “For any of these major players, you need that talent to come in but you also need to make sure that talent stays on and is able to reach leadership positions,” she said. She also said the wider media industry needed to stop treating all people of colour as a homogeneous group and represent diversity of opinion: “My experience as a black woman is going to be different to the black woman next to me. That is honestly one of the key things. Not all women of colour think the same.” On Tuesday the BBC’s annual report showed that it had missed its own target of having 15% of leadership positions held by staff from a minority ethnic background, amid wider concerns within the organisation about promotion opportunities for people of colour. Little’s first break in the media was working for a Channel 4 production trainee scheme but she said she found herself feeling uncomfortable after being “labelled as the diversity trainee”. “A lot of these organisations have legacy and resources that we don’t have,” she said. “They have capacity to change, to not just have people of colour on freelance contracts, and to listen.” She decided to quit television production to run gal-dem full-time after the site began to take off: “I was running around making cups of tea on the set of Horrible Histories, having these Gal-Dem clients call and pretending I was too busy to talk.” Little also said mainstream outlets should stop asking people of colour to continuously write about their experience of trauma: “There is so much trauma that we consume as people of colour. It’s important to have space for black joy as much as the pain.” The dire state of the online advertising market means gal-dem, which has about a dozen staff and substantially lower readership figures than mainstream news outlets, is heavily reliant on brand partnerships with corporate clients and events for income. The company has attracted a small amount of outside investment, including from the black-led venture capital firm Blackstone Capital. There have also been tie-ups with traditional media organisations such as the BBC and the Guardian. In March the site, which is said to be profitable, launched its own membership scheme, attracting around 3,000 paying customers paying between £5 and £15 a month, now bringing in around a third of its revenue. However, a planned expansion into the US this year was scuppered by the Covid outbreak. Little, who is stepping back from the site to return to academia, said she had tried to avoid the pitfalls of other media startups which over-expanded and burned through venture capital money hiring too many staff without a sustainable business model. She said securing the site’s financial future was important to ensure women of colour had a platform for their output: “We owe it to the community.”",Media; Digital media; Society; Race; UK news,Media
2021-02-17T16:41:43Z,The Fiver | Big Cup and the newly-minted Round of Barcelona,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/17/big-cup-and-the-newly-minted-round-of-barcelona,"NOT-SO-SWEET SIXTEEN Older readers may remember the Woolwich Arsenal as a going Big Cup concern. So much so that they once had a round named after them. The Round of Arsenal. The last 16, which they would grace with distinction every year, playing their part in 12-goal aggregate thrillers in which they would routinely contribute at least one or two. But times change, nothing ever stays the same, even hoary old Fiver riffs get retooled ever-so-slightly for a new generation, and so Arsenal were usurped, their once-eponymous Round instead becoming synonymous with Paris Saint-Germain, whose laundry bill would spike dramatically every February at the mere thought of getting through to the quarters. Ah, it seemed like the mild amusement would never end. Last year, however, PSG totally ruined all that by reaching the final, and so Uefa were left looking for a new band of losers, patsies, chancers and grifters to lend their name to the You Might As Well Not Have Bothered phase of their flagship competition. Ah look, here come Barcelona, a team managed by a guy who couldn’t cut it at Everton and built around an ageing good-time squillionaire. Exactly what should be realistically expected from the modern-day Mike Walker and football’s answer to Jay Gatsby is a moot point, but even so, that it’s come to this for the once-mighty Barcelona. To be scrupulously fair to Lionel Messi, who is paid €555m a minute [subs please check], he did do a penalty in the newly-minted Round of Barcelona on Tuesday night, before Kylian Mbappé went on to thoroughly upstage him with a sensational hat-trick. Messi responded by wandering around with a face on, much like he did against Roma that time, and against Liverpool, and against Bayern Munich, which suggests the Catalan giants aren’t getting too much bang for their buck these days. They’re also not getting through to the last eight, unless PSG break all manner of unwanted records in three weeks’ time.

2020-09-19T11:00:14Z,Chris Boyd sees signs in Northampton that promise a new song for Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/19/chris-boyd-sees-signs-in-saints-that-promise-a-new-song-for-europe,"Chris Boyd described last weekend’s east Midlands derby at Welford Road as the dance of the desperate, one of the English game’s traditional big fixtures, featuring two clubs more used to challenging for the title than lurking in the Premiership’s basement reduced to little relevance beyond local bragging rights. Northampton and Leicester on Sunday swap their league labours for Europe. The Saints face the last waltz at Exeter in the Champions Cup quarter-final while the Tigers will be looking to emulate their Premier League neighbours on the other side of Aylestone Road and foxtrot their way to victory over Castres in the last eight of the Challenge Cup at Welford Road. Northampton have defied form at this stage of the European Cup before. In 2007, the year they were relegated from the Premiership, they defeated Biarritz 7-6 in San Sebastián having been doubled by the Basque club in the group stage. But not even their most sanguine supporter would back them to beat the Chiefs, who emerged from their pool undefeated. “Results have not been good, but the effort, intent, desire and will, apart from Leicester where the performance was unacceptable, I cannot fault,” says Boyd, who is in his second season as Northampton’s director of rugby. Boyd guided them to the Premiership play-offs in his first, inciting a programmed side to revel in the unstructured, winning six of their first eight league fixtures this season before a run of 10 defeats in 12. “The season has been disappointing,” he admits. “We have not come out of the lockdown well and we have to find out why. I cannot put my finger on the difference between this season and last: there is no one thing. If I was going to look back, I would now challenge myself on whether the enthusiasm and confidence we developed last year to play was built on a solid foundation. We got on a bit of a roll and maybe the group got ahead of itself. We have talked about the need to go back and put some concrete into the basement.” For all their problems at loosehead prop, Northampton have a core of internationals, including Owen Franks, Dan Biggar, Courtney Lawes, Teimana Harrison and Lewis Ludlam. “We have to back ourselves,” says Ludlam, the England back-rower. “Crazier things have happened than us going to Sandy Park and getting a result. We know the task we face, but anything can happen in sport and we have to back ourselves.” Leicester are spending their first season out of the Champions Cup, highlighting a decline that started when they missed out first on what had become an annual trip to Twickenham for the Premiership final and then the play-offs. They have spent the last two campaigns fighting off relegation, pipping Newcastle in 2019 and reprieved this year by Saracens’ disgrace. Their captain, Tom Youngs, has tasted success and adversity. He regards the club’s presence in the Challenge Cup as an opportunity rather than a stigma. Northampton were beaten convincingly twice by Leicester in the Champions Cup this season and in their past two years in the tournament, the Tigers won only two matches in 12, including a 54-29 victory at home to Castres. Neither club is yet equipped to jive with the surest of foot. “I have not thought about being in the Challenge Cup rather than the Champions Cup too much,” says Youngs. “It is what it is and what is the point in getting hung up on it? We are in a quarter-final and will enjoy it. I am not one for looking back. We are on a road, looking to get back into the Champions Cup and I am confident we will get there. There is a real sense of direction here under Steve Borthwick and results will come. Europe gives us the chance of a trophy and it is very important to us.” Northampton and Leicester have won the Champions Cup three times between them, in successive years from 2000, and appeared in seven finals, but two clubs who aim to be a sustainable business rather than rely on the backing of an owner have found themselves dancing on thinner ice. Neither will crack.",Northampton; Leicester; Rugby union; Sport; European Challenge Cup; Champions Cup,Sport
2020-10-05T06:00:13Z,How the Guardian plans to reach net zero emissions by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/05/guardian-net-zero-emissions-carbon-neutral-2030,"Last year was the easy bit – we made a lot of promises to reduce our carbon footprint and become a more sustainable business. Since then we have been trying to figure out how to make good on these commitments. While Guardian journalism remains our best tool for confronting the climate emergency, we are doing everything we can in our business too to ensure that we practise what we preach. We said we would undertake a full audit of our carbon emissions, and have now been through this exercise twice, starting with our 2018-19 financial year and then trying to improve our understanding and the accuracy of our data for our 2019-20 figures. The experience has taught us a lot: we know that our print newspaper business still accounts for the majority of our emissions, but that business travel and our digital operations are also significant contributors. We also know that the vast majority of our emissions are caused within our supply chain, rather than by the activities we control directly, such as the energy we use in our offices. This adds to the complexity of measuring our footprint and taking action. We have to gather lots of detailed information from many different suppliers and work out how much of it is attributable to us. We are grateful that so many of them have been forthcoming with the information we need, particularly when the last few months have been challenging for many in the newspaper industry. As well as measuring our emissions, we have been looking at different areas of our business to consider how our sustainability commitments should inform what we do. That led to our announcement earlier this year that we were refusing any advertising from fossil fuel companies. More recently, our Guardian Jobs team has made it easier for employers to advertise sustainability jobs to our audience of environmentally-conscious readers. We have now set a goal of eliminating at least two-thirds of all emissions from our own operations and our supply chain by 2030. That feels like a daunting challenge but we wanted to set ourselves an ambitious goal that would force us to think creatively about how to achieve it. There are a few big areas that we are focusing on initially. We need to do everything we can to reduce unnecessary energy use or materials in our own operations. That includes everything from making the lighting in our offices as efficient as possible to reducing the amount of packaging we use for our newspapers. The way we work has a big impact. Like almost everyone, we’ve been forced to find new ways of doing things this year in response to the coronavirus pandemic - increased use of technology is likely to help us reduce our environmental impact over the long term. We also need to make our supply chain as sustainable as possible. That means making sure that environmental considerations are consistently a key part of our purchasing decisions, and working with our suppliers to see how we can help them to reduce emissions within their own operations. We are clear that reducing our emissions as much as possible is the priority, but for the emissions that we cannot eliminate, we are looking at ways to remove the equivalent carbon from the atmosphere. While emissions are an important part of our sustainability performance, they are not the only thing we should address. For example, we can also look at things such as the amount of recycled or recyclable materials we use. While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we know that there are many areas that we have not fully considered yet and we expect our sustainability plans to evolve a lot as we learn more. Our readers are always a great source of ideas and challenging questions that force us to think harder about what we do. Since certifying as a socially aware B Corporation last year we have gained lots of new ideas and inspiration from fellow B Corps, and of course our journalism is a constant source of information about new developments and technologies that can help us improve. These measures are intended to demonstrate that we must back up words with action. The Guardian wants to lead the world with authoritative, compelling, revelatory journalism about the climate crisis. We can only credibly do so if we ourselves face up to the challenges that confront policymakers, businesses and households in these troubling times. • Julie Richards is delivery portfolio director and leads GNM’s initiative to achieve net zero emissions",Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis,Environment
2020-10-19T16:01:01Z,What are green jobs – and why are they important?,https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/what-are-green-jobs-and-why-are-they-important,"Jobs that have a direct, positive impact on the planet traditionally involve renewable energy, electric transport, energy efficiency or nature conservation. But right now, as more sectors transition to low-carbon models, every job has the potential to become “green”. With unemployment rising due to the pandemic, there’s now a chance to reconfigure the jobs landscape while putting the environment centre stage. The government’s £160m Build Back Greener investment scheme aims to create 2,000 new construction jobs to manufacture offshore wind turbines and upgrade ports. How and where will demand increase as the UK transitions to a net-zero economy? By 2030, there could be 694,000 green jobs in the low-carbon and renewable energy sector across England, rising to more than 1.18m by 2050. There’s enormous potential for green growth. Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that more than 200,000 jobs could be created in energy efficiency by 2030, and 70,000 jobs in offshore wind alone as soon as 2023, while Thrive Renewables estimates that onshore renewables could deliver 45,000 new jobs by 2035. Regionally, opportunities vary. In north-west England, new jobs focus on increasing wind capacity, while London’s green jobs will mostly be in the financial, IT or legal industries. Why do we need a decarbonised future? Economist Kate Raworth, from the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, believes that we need a decarbonised economy far sooner than 2050. According to Raworth, the economy should urgently be redesigned so that resources aren’t wasted. That, she says, requires serious innovation: “Our future economy will thrive on reusing, repairing, refurbishing, remaking and repurposing – this transformation will create new kinds of creative and purposeful jobs.” Reimagining the economy In 2018, the UK government projected that the low-carbon economy could grow by 11% per year up to 2030. That’s much higher than the projected growth rate for the overall economy. Globally, emergency Covid-19 economic rescue packages already total more than £6tn in G20 nations. In fact, the transition to net-zero emissions and investment in low-carbon sectors can aid recovery from Covid-19. “Green jobs help us realise environmental goals and contribute to livelihoods – it’s not new, but it is an idea we are now paying more attention to,” says Jennifer Allan, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University, who describes climate action as an “economic multiplier”, because creating green jobs helps mitigate the ecological crisis. In June 2020, Boris Johnson earmarked several billion pounds to upgrade the energy efficiency of public buildings and homes, and for carbon capture technology to remove harmful carbon emissions from the air. As a result, UK industry will also receive £350m investment to cut carbon emissions in sectors such as transport and construction. By comparison, France is planning to invest one third of its €100bn (£90bn) post-Covid economic stimulus on greening the economy – more than any other big EU country – but critics insist that even this falls short of what is necessary for a step change. Germany’s €130bn recovery budget focuses on climate-friendly industries and aims to support green infrastructure and technologies with at least €40bn spending in this area. Energy efficiency: a win-win scenario A report by the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group suggests that decarbonising the UK’s housing stock will create 100,000 jobs annually over the next decade. Homeowners in England can now apply for vouchers worth up to £5,000 to make their homes more energy efficient under the new government scheme for green home grants. Retrofitting homes could not only result in more efficient energy consumption but also create green jobs for those installing double glazing, insulation or air-source heat pumps. So home retrofits are a major win-win. “It’s about a systemic shift, not isolated innovations,” explains Eliot Whittington, director of policy at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL). A future fuelled by renewables? By 2035, new diesel, petrol or hybrid cars will no longer be sold in the UK, but cost remains a barrier to switching to electric vehicle (EV) production because big upfront investment is required. As industries evolve, upskilling of the workforce is essential, too – individuals will need retraining and financial support to make that viable. For clients of Nick Daniel, head of energy and climate change at the recruitment firm Acre, the climate emergency has become a board-level priority with many new sustainability roles being classified as “business critical”, despite other hiring having been frozen. Daniel believes that unless organisations invest in sustainability credentials, they’ll get “left behind in the race against climate change”. Is the future green? A green recovery can boost the economy, protect the environment and invigorate the workforce. Demand for sustainable business is rapidly increasing according to Paula McGinnell, from Cyan Finance, which provides finance to businesses and projects in the green, sustainable and socially positive economy. “Green jobs build resilience, and the economic opportunity they provide is the largest we’ll see in our lifetime,” she says. Alethea Warrington, a campaigner at the climate action charity Possible, says that considered, long-term investment by the UK government in clean energy, green transport and warm homes would be “the best medicine for the ailing UK economy right now”.

2020-06-29T05:01:24Z,"Match Covid-19 economic stimulus with climate fight ambition, urge MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/29/match-covid-19-economic-stimulus-with-climate-fight-ambition-urge-mps,"MPs have joined growing calls from business leaders and environmentalists for the government to use its post-coronavirus economic recovery plan to accelerate investments aimed at tackling the climate crisis. The chairs of two influential cross-party select committees have warned the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that time is running out to “avert an even greater future global crisis caused by climate change”. In a joint letter, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, and the chair of the environmental audit (EAC) committee, said the government must align plans to boost the economy with its climate ambitions. Darren Jones, the chair of the BEIS committee, said the post-pandemic world offers an “opportunity for the UK to step up our efforts to tackle climate change, to foster a green recovery and accelerate the transition to net zero”. Jones is due to lead an inquiry into the government’s climate progress at a hearing on Thursday following a report from the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official climate advisers, which warned last week that the UK is falling behind on its climate targets. “I hope the chancellor will be bold in his investment in infrastructure and people, demonstrating the government’s commitment to tackling climate change, boosting the prospects of a green recovery, creating net-zero related jobs, and bolstering the UK’s credibility as a net zero leader in the run up to COP26 [climate talks],” he said. The EAC has also opened a new investigation into how the government can use the opportunities created by the post-Covid recovery plans to further the UK’s green agenda. Philip Dunne, the chair of the EAC committee, said that “if there is anything positive to come out of the pandemic, it is that we wake up to the warnings that we are hearing from scientists about the urgency of acting on climate change”. Dunne added: “Many of the actions we need to make our net-zero ambition a reality can be used to revive our economy, creating green jobs and generating long term cost savings. It would be a historic mistake to miss this opportunity.” The combined calls for a green economic recovery from within the government echoes rising calls from green groups, industry leaders and the Prince of Wales to support firms that can help to spur the UK’s low-carbon ambitions and help create jobs in the “green economy”. More than 200 business leaders – including chief executives and chairs from nearly half of FTSE 100 companies – are due on Monday to attend a virtual meeting with the business secretary, Alok Sharma, and the environment secretary, George Eustice, to plot a route towards the UN climate talks, which have been delayed by a year to November 2021. Ahead of the meeting, Liv Garfield, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 water firm Severn Trent, said the UK had a “once in a lifetime opportunity to recover and grow in the right way – a cleaner and greener way” and that “every business in the UK has a role to play in delivering this”. The event, organised by the Council for Sustainable Business (CSB) in tandem with the government, will focus on the climate action that the UK can take within the next 10 years.",Economic recovery; Greenhouse gas emissions; Green economy; Climate crisis; Environment; Infrastructure; Business; Job losses; Coronavirus; Economics; Economic policy; UK news; Politics,Business
2020-10-09T09:00:24Z,Yes the climate crisis is big but the world can correct its course,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/yes-climate-crisis-big-but-world-can-correct-course-society-upside,"These past few weeks, I have been working with colleagues to establish what the Guardian can do to confront the climate emergency. I know, I know: we are very small, and it is very big. But we have to do something. I do believe, personally, that of all the crises in this crisis-laden era, this is the most threatening, the most alarming of all. But I also believe that the cynical, “we’re all doomed” narrative is unhelpful – a self-fulfilling prophecy if ever there was one. The Guardian enjoys both a privilege and a responsibility: it can set both the agenda and an example. So we’ve spelled out in quite some detail how we are going to get to net zero carbon by 2030. We’ve itemised six things we are going to do to help the world correct its course. And of course, we’ve published a slew of Upsidey pieces that show what is possible when society pulls the right levers, be that government policy, market forces, or simply concerted civic action. For example: • Carbon capture: is the “moonshot” closer than ever? Three-minute read • The great renewables jobs boom, as workers quit oil and gas in droves. Four-minute read • How to get to net zero, in nine steps. Four-minute read • Dramatic plunge in London air pollution. Two minute read • What China’s net zero plans mean for the climate. Two-minute read Meanwhile, in other Upside news this week, we also enjoyed: • Does Sweden have the answer to living with Covid-19? 30-minute podcast • The care home seniors chasing global cycling glory. Three-minute read • The political opponents who became friends. Five-minute read • The generosity of a forgotten footballer. One-minute read Lucky numbers More than 3m ballots have already been mailed in ahead of the 3 November US presidential election. This chart from Statista, meanwhile, shows that the shift from petrol and diesel to electric and hybrids is well advanced in the UK. What we liked Sticking with the climate theme, we were quite taken with the idea of issuing a green sovereign bond to help governments pay for the Covid-19 recovery. This from the sustainable business news site Edie. And we quite like the idea of a “digital twin” for planet Earth being built, so we can understand complex climate science better. What we heard Jane McIntosh got in touch from Tenbury Wells in western England. Our town has an extremely efficient annual flu vaccination programme in which people are called up to attend the clinic in a local hall on a single October day in a time slot determined alphabetically. It works incredibly fast and well. This year, of course, the face-to-face contact was impossible, so this Saturday the surgery (specifically the lead nurse, Jayne Williams) organised a mammoth vaccination day in the local car park, through which people passed in their cars during their time slot. There was a certain amount of disruption to local traffic, but this was minimised by the employment of marshals (working, poor things, under day-long drizzle), who efficiently directed and managed both the flu traffic, coming from both directions down Tenbury’s single main street, into and through the car park, and the through traffic. The exercise was executed with military precision and was hugely successful, vaccinating 1,700 patients. As a patient taking part in it, I was proud to be British and even prouder to be a Tenbury resident. Perhaps a lesson for other towns here? Meanwhile, Richard Lewis had a suggestion for how to deal with the campus pandemic problem. I had a wonderful experience at Reading University in the mid-60s, a time of freedom, optimism and generous funding. I feel so sorry for today’s students. Could this be better than the current miserable situation? Students would be given a choice of three options: • Study from home or other remote location, entirely online, so they can protect themselves or vulnerable family members. Pay one third or one quarter fees. • Study in class at university, with social distancing in class but otherwise freedom to mix normally within their student accommodation, but not outside of that accommodation. A local lockdown where students largely set their own rules. If Covid spreads, they will have to isolate within halls, cared for by other students, and take lessons online. Groceries and other supplies from a shop set up within the hall manned by students. Also a bar for socialising. All students tested before leaving university for holidays etc. Full fees apply. • A kind of hybrid option for those living off-campus in private accommodation or at home, maybe needing part-time work to support themselves. Depending on numbers choosing this option they would have more or less teaching in class or online to allow for social distancing. Some reduction in fees to reflect the level of online teaching. I definitely think students will like the idea of setting their own rules. Finally, after reading our hugely popular (but quite ancient) repair cafe story, Anya Hart Dyke in Scotland had a further tip. Given current restrictions, it would be good to mention the amazing Fixit Clinic team who help with repairs via Zoom. I did a session with them for my hand-held blender last weekend and they were amazing. It’s all free, of course. We’ll be expecting great things from that blender, Anya. Whisk like the wind.

2020-07-29T05:01:22Z,UK's biggest pension fund begins fossil fuels divestment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/29/national-employment-savings-trust-uks-biggest-pension-fund-divests-from-fossil-fuels,"The UK’s biggest pension fund, the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) scheme with nine million members, is to begin divesting from fossil fuels in what climate campaigners have hailed as a landmark move for the industry. The fund will ban investments in any companies involved in coal mining, oil from tar sands and arctic drilling. But the move puts Nest – a public corporation of the Department for Work and Pensions – potentially at odds with the current pensions minister, Guy Opperman, who earlier this month condemned divestment as “counter productive”. Nest, which handles much of the pensions of workers saving under the government’s “auto enrolment” scheme, will shift £5.5bn into “climate aware” investments as it anticipates a green economic recovery from coronavirus. The ban will mean that some of the world’s biggest mining companies, such as BHP, can never be part of Nest’s share holdings, as long they derive profits from digging coal. It said it will sell its final holdings in BHP by 3 August. Nest will also seek to reduce its carbon-intensive holdings, such as with the traditional oil giants, while investing more money in renewable energy infrastructure. The fund’s chief investment officer, Mark Fawcett, said Nest was sending a strong and clear message about the seriousness of climate change. “Just like coronavirus, climate change poses serious risks to both our savers and their investments,” Fawcett said. “It has the potential to cause catastrophic damage and completely disrupt our way of life. No one wants to save throughout their life to retire into a world devastated by climate change. “As the world’s economy slowly recovers from coronavirus, we want to ensure this recovery is a green one. We have a unique opportunity to support sustainable growth and transition towards a low-carbon economy.” Nest still has relatively little money under management – around £12.2bn – but it is expected to become a mammoth player in the industry as the savings from millions of workers pour into its coffers in the coming decades. Other pension funds have gone further than Nest – in 2016 Waltham Forest’s local government pension scheme was the first to commit to full divestment – selling out of coal, tar sands and oil and gas, and last year Cardiff councillors made a similar commitment. Nest is hesitant about describing its new policy as a full divestment programme. It said it remained interested in oil companies that were transitioning from carbon-based fuels to green energy and renewable technology and that it would use its muscle to challenge them and push for stricter targets. Oil and gas companies remain the biggest hurdle for “keep it in the ground” campaigners, with most pension funds reluctant to fully divest. In June, the £68bn Universities Superannuation Scheme said it would divest from coal investments after years of intensive lobbying, but retain oil and gas investments. Campaigners welcomed Nest’s new climate policy and said it was likely to prompt better behaviour at other funds. Lauren Peacock of ShareAction said: “We hope it will encourage other pension schemes to up their ambition … Nest is setting clear expectations for those most responsible for the climate emergency and demonstrating the power of pensions to move them along a more sustainable path.” Polling for Nest found that 65% of pension savers believed their pension should be invested in a way that reduced the impact of climate change. Just 4% strongly disagreed. But its decision to divest from the dirtiest polluters and reduce holdings elsewhere is in contrast to arguments set out by Opperman. The minister publicly called on pension trustees to keep hold of fossil fuel assets in order to “nudge, cajole or vote” polluting companies towards sustainable business practises. In a blogpost, first published by the Daily Telegraph, he said that holding fossil fuel assets could be a “spring board to real change” and that simply selling them to others would be counterproductive. Opperman’s position provoked an open letter from more than 60 MPs, NGO bosses and faith leaders who criticised the minister’s “anti-divestment stance” and warned that urging companies to remain invested in polluting companies contradicted government guidance set in April this year.",Fossil fuel divestment; Pensions industry; Fossil fuels; Oil and gas companies; Investing; Arctic; Tar sands; Mining; World news; Business; Financial sector; Environment; Investment funds; Money; Investments; UK news; BHP; Oil; Energy; Energy industry; Commodities,Environment
2021-02-04T18:14:42Z,Free ports – or sleaze ports? Rishi Sunak's dream of tax-free zones about to become reality,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/04/free-ports-or-sleaze-ports-rishi-sunaks-dream-of-tax-free-zones-about-to-become-reality,"Five years ago a young, unknown MP wrote a pamphlet for a Thatcherite thinktank extolling the benefits of free ports. Now that Rishi Sunak is chancellor, his dream for Britain is – for good or ill – fast becoming reality. This week, alliances of port owners, businesses and local authorities must submit their bids to establish free ports, competing to set up zones exempt from normal tax and regulation. Proponents say free ports can attract investment to areas that have been left woefully short, bringing jobs and prosperity to deprived regions as part of the “levelling up” agenda, helping prioritise greener industry, and breathing new life into, say, the former Redcar steelworks site, or the Grimsby docks. But others fear the move signals the creation of “mini-tax havens” and a race to the bottom on regulation, keeping revenues from councils and the Treasury to line the pockets of business and landowners, with profits sent offshore rather than reinvested in the UK. Support is found predominantly among those who voted – and campaigned – to leave the EU; backers call it a Brexit dividend enabled by the final deal. The EU has started to clamp down on the 80-odd free zones within its jurisdiction, over tax evasion, corruption and crime concerns. Most of the big coastal ports, as well as some inland airports and accompanying industrial zones, are throwing their hats into the ring. In the north-east, the Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley combined authority, Ben Houchen, has championed a policy he says could create thousands of jobs in the region. Deprived areas will be given priority, and bids are expected from around England by Friday’s deadline – from Humberside to Liverpool and London to Bristol. The devolved governments in Wales and Scotland are expected to follow – with caveats – and invite bids at a later date. Within designated zones, stretching up to 45km from ports, the government’s free ports prospectus describes how usual customs, planning and tax measures will not apply. Goods and components will, in effect, remain offshore, allowing, say, a new factory to be built, processing raw materials and components without customs paperwork or tariffs, to re-export as more valuable goods. For the first five to 10 years of that factory’s life, the government proposes, it would pay no stamp duty on its land or property purchase and enhanced tax breaks would be given for construction or machinery costs. Behind the zone’s fences – physical and virtual – business rates would be waived, and employers would not pay national insurance contributions for up to three years for staff members earning less than £25,000. The government says it will “ensure it has the power” to prevent access to national insurance relief for employers who abuse it, for example by dismissing staff after three years. Modelling by the consultancy Vivid Economics for a Teesside free port said the kind of package proposed could create up to 32,000 jobs and boost the regional economy by £2bn over the next 25 years, although “deadweight and displacement” – firms relocating rather than reinvesting – could cut those benefits in half. It projected that the Treasury would lose about 40% of £960m in tax and revenues due in Teesside if free port firms were subject to usual rules, although it argued that the zones would create enough investment to produce a net positive for the exchequer. However, the projection suggested that to be competitive with the likes of Singapore, the UK would need complete exemption from business rates and other taxes. Unsurprisingly, many people are alarmed. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark scheme, says: “These ‘sleaze ports’ are very much mini-tax havens domiciled within the UK. It’s going to leak out into the wider economy – it will result in a massively reduced contribution from business to the Treasury. Businesses which are rooted in communities wish to stay and play a part in society and pay fair tax – why should they be undercut by hot capital and flighty businesses that can exploit these zones?” A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government is committed to combating abusive tax practices, such as avoidance and evasion – these have been a consideration throughout the design of the free ports tax offer.” Monaghan says the zones have proved magnets for illicit financial flows and criminal activity, adding: “One of the reasons for them existing is the absence of regulations and checks – it’s a consequence of what they are.” One of the world’s biggest free zones, Dubai’s Jebel Ali, has been identified by tobacco companies as a major source of contraband cigarettes, while the US last year blacklisted two aviation businesses in the zone for trading with Iranian airlines designated as supporting terrorism or as a threat to US national security. Its operator, DP World, which runs the London Gateway and 70 other ports worldwide, is hoping to transform it into a free port. A spokesperson for DP World said customs officers in Dubai were “praised” by HMRC for helping to stop cigarettes entering the UK black market, adding: “DP World has operations on every continent and moves 10% of the world’s container trade. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards illicit activity anywhere in the world and work closely with the customs and taxation authorities.” Labour has attacked the principles of the scheme, although some MPs in affected constituencies have broken ranks. The SNP is no longer in outright opposition, with Scotland suggesting a middle way – “green ports”, linking tax incentives to sustainable business. Britain’s main maritime union, the RMT, says it supports green job creation but fears free ports could result in workers in some of the poorest communities signing away their rights. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, says: “Without strong employment rights, automatic trade union recognition and tax laws that make sure international owners of UK ports contribute, free ports are doomed to fail the communities they are designed to help.” Ports have moved to allay fears, with a joint declaration by the biggest owning groups – including Associated British Ports, DP World, Hutchison, PD Ports and Peel Ports – that the free ports would be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable and pledging that they “are not seeking to diminish or dilute employment rights”. The Treasury said “no part of the freeport policy would explicitly or implicitly affect” workers’ rights. The contenders The government has said it will name the chosen free ports in England, likely a maximum of eight, in the spring. These ports are expected to bid: Thames A free zone that would cover London Gateway, opened in 2013 by DP World, and the older and smaller Tilbury, owned by Forth Ports. Backers say it could create 25,000 jobs along the deprived Thames Estuary region, with green investment at Ford Dagenham and in Thurrock. DP World is owned by the state of Dubai. Its chair, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, wields extraordinary power as commercial chief and regulator. He is chair of the Ports, Customs &amp; Free Zone Corporation, a government department that includes the Dubai customs workforce, and leader of the Jebel Ali free zone authority, where companies can incorporate and operate untaxed. DP says the chair’s roles are “regularly audited” by the UAE government. Felixstowe-Harwich The Freeport East bid joins local authorities in Essex and Suffolk with two Hutchison-owned ports: Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, and Harwich. As well as taking in major road and rail freight hubs, the free port would link to offshore wind and Cambridge University research programmes. Hutchison Ports Europe, part of the telecoms and infrastructure empire built by the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, made headlines last year by hiring the former transport secretary Chris Grayling on £100,000 a year for seven hours’ work a week. Grayling has assured parliamentary standards committees he will not be advising on “post-Brexit opportunities” and is being kept away from the bid. Liverpool Liverpool city region combined authority has been leading a bid that would combine Peel Port’s Liverpool hub and its operations Manchester and Heysham in one big free zone. Peel says it is considering bids with regional stakeholders across all of its port locations, which include Great Yarmouth and Clydeport in Scotland. Peel Group, the parent company established and part-owned by an Isle of Man resident, John Whittaker, also has a large land and property division in the north-west. The increase in land value alone could produce a huge windfall for one of Britain’s biggest landowners. Bristol The bid is being led by the West of England combined authority. Boris Johnson visited Bristol in the autumn and declared the port a “strong contender”. A number of proposed inland “free port zones” are linked by road and or rail to Bristol port. The Bristol Port company is owned by Terence Mordaunt and David Ord, who bought the port from the city council in 1991. Between them, they have donated £1.9m to the Conservatives, £25,000 to Johnson’s leadership campaign and £50,000 to Vote Leave. Mordaunt chairs the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Forum, whose trustees include the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore.",Economic policy; Economics; Business; Politics; Economic growth (GDP); Rishi Sunak; Trade policy; Tax and spending; Industrial policy; Social exclusion; England; Shipping industry,Politics
2020-06-23T23:01:02Z,"Tackle UK carbon emissions by working with nature, government urged",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/24/tackle-uk-carbon-emissions-by-working-with-nature-government-urged,"Restoring the natural environment could absorb as much as a third of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions, making the government’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 much easier to meet, according to green campaigners. Returning degraded peatland and bog to its natural state, cultivating marine meadows of seagrass, restoring salt marshes and wetlands, and taking some grasslands out of cultivation, as well as planting more trees, all contribute to creating carbon sinks, which absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. New findings by the Wildlife Trusts suggest that these methods could store enough carbon to outweigh a substantial proportion of the UK’s existing greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so would also help to protect wildlife populations struggling on degraded land and amid intensive agriculture, and threatened at sea with a loss of habitat owing to overfishing. Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, urged the government to restore degraded areas in order to tackle both the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife populations and habitats around the UK. “Nature in the UK is in a sorry state and important habitats are damaged and declining,” he said. “Efforts to cut our emissions must be matched with determined action to fix our broken ecosystems so they can help stabilise our climate. Restoring nature in the UK needs to be given top priority.” The government’s pledge to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 is under close scrutiny this week, as the first anniversary approaches of the pledge being signed into law. The government’s statutory climate advisers, the committee on climate change, will publish a progress report on Thursday on the government’s efforts to reach net zero, and call for a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis. On Wednesday, the Institute for Public Policy Research will call for a Royal Commission on preparations for environmental breakdown. The thinktank will warn that climate breakdown, the poor state of the natural environment around the UK, pollution and our unsustainable use of natural resources – both from the UK and in the goods and services we import from abroad – were all contributing to a growing crisis that could overtake the country. In its report, based on a year of research, the IPPR concluded that the UK stood on the brink of environmental breakdown. The authors drew parallels with the coronavirus pandemic and called for new legislation in the form of a sustainable economy act, which would set targets for cutting environmental damage. A minister should also be appointed to oversee the effort, the thinktank said. Laurie Laybourn-Langton, associate fellow at IPPR, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the UK was not adequately prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. The threats posed by the environmental crisis could also emerge quickly and could overwhelm our capacity to respond.” The UK’s environment could also come under threat from post-Brexit trade agreements, warned the Aldersgate Group of sustainable business leaders in a new report. New trade deals must take into account the imperatives of the net zero target, as well as the government’s pledges not to dilute the UK’s environmental protections after Brexit, and the need for British businesses to avoid being undermined by foreign competitors that do not uphold such high standards, according to the report. Farmers face particular concerns over trade deals with the US, as the government’s pledges that no chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef will be allowed into the UK do not extend to other animal welfare and food safety standards.

2020-05-26T12:09:25Z,"Formula One carmaker McLaren cuts 1,200 jobs amid Covid-19 crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/formula-one-mclaren-cuts-job-covid-19-racing-season-supercar,"McLaren Group, the Formula One team owner and maker of supercars, is cutting 1,200 jobs as it seeks to weather the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the automotive industry. The job losses amount to more than a quarter of the Surrey-based company’s 4,000 workforce and will be spread across the company’s Formula One, road-car and applied technologies operations. The group blamed the cuts on the cancellation of motorsport events, the suspension of manufacturing and car sales, reduced demand for its technology solutions, as well as the new Formula One cost cap due to be introduced next season. McLaren has already furloughed a significant number of its employees as the Formula One season and sales of supercars ground to a halt amid the spread ofCovid-19. “We deeply regret the impact that this restructure will have on all our people, but especially those whose jobs may be affected,” said Paul Walsh, the executive chairman of McLaren Group. “It is a course of action we have worked hard to avoid, having already undertaken dramatic cost-saving measures across all areas of the business. But we now have no other choice but to reduce the size of our workforce.” The cuts, first reported by Sky News, come as the group seeks to raise £275m from investors, backed against the value of its classic car collection and its state-of-the-art Norman Foster-designed headquarters building in Woking. McLaren has burned through £257m in the year to 20 April, with production at its Woking plant suspended since March. The group’s existing shareholders pledged £300m of equity investment in March as McLaren sought to shore up its finances as the pandemic hammered its balance sheet. The carmaker reportedly failed in its request for a £150m emergency loan from the government. “This is undoubtedly a challenging time for our company, and particularly our people,” Walsh said. “But we plan to emerge as an efficient, sustainable business with a clear course for returning to growth.” McLaren is tentatively hoping for the restart of the Formula One season . The race series accounts for about 12% of the group’s revenues through prize money and advertising deals. “McLaren Racing has been a proponent of the introduction in 2021 of the new Formula One budget cap which will create a sustainable financial basis for the teams and lead to a more competitive sport,” Walsh said. “While this will have a significant impact on the shape and size of our F1 team, we will now begin to take the necessary measures to be ready to run at the cap from 2021 onwards, in order to challenge again for race wins and championships in the future.” McLaren is due to start the first deliveries to customers of the 765LT supercar in October, which comes with a recommended price tag of $358,000. Towards the end of the year they company will also start deliveries of the Elva, an ultra-exclusive open-top speedster, which will cost a reported £1.4m, before options such as a 24-carat gold engine heat shield are included. “We have already invested in developing a new lightweight, hybrid vehicle architecture that will commence series production at the end of this year with the first deliveries to customers now sure in early 2021,” he said. The Japanese carmaker Nissan is also expected to announce job cuts in the coming days, with as many as 20,000 jobs globally at risk.",Automotive industry; Business; Job losses; Formula One; Motor sport; Sport; UK news; Coronavirus,Business
2020-06-07T10:00:49Z,The Cares Act's best-kept secret is a boon not just for survival but for growth | Gene Marks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/07/the-cares-acts-best-kept-secret-is-a-boon-not-just-for-survival-but-for-growth,"When Congress passed the Cares coronavirus recovery act in late March, most of the attention was given to the billions in funding made available to small businesses for the paycheck protection program and economic injury disaster loans provided by the Small Business Administration. Those loan programs were designed specifically for firms affected by the coronavirus pandemic and since then millions of small businesses have taken advantage of the relief. But there’s another part of the Cares Act that also provides a big benefit to small businesses that some see as an “opportunity of a lifetime” and yet it hasn’t received as much attention. That part is related to the SBA’s Section 7(a) loans. What’s a Section 7(a) loan? It’s a Small Business Administration program that’s been around for a long time. Under the program, small businesses (generally those with fewer than 500 employees) who are unable to get traditional financing through banks can apply for funds which can then be used for anything from buying a business and real estate to working capital. The loans, like the paycheck protection program loans, are received through an approved lender. But unlike the PPP, the Section 7(a) loans are not forgivable. When you borrow under this program, your interest rate is the prime rate (which is now 3.25%) plus anywhere from 2.25% to 4.75% (depending on the loan) and your payback can range from five to seven years for working capital to 25 years for real estate. The loans have been popular in the past because the SBA guarantees them, so banks are able to get the money into the hands of small businesses that don’t have collateral or financial history. But now, thanks to the Cares Act, these loans have become even more attractive. That’s because, for Section 7(a) financings closed before 27 September, a borrower will have the first six months of principal, interest and any fees forgiven. Just to put that in context, if you were to borrow say $500,000 you would not have to pay $33,000. To make things even more attractive, existing loan balances will also be reduced as if the payments were made. For some looking to buy a business, it’s big deal. “This is the opportunity of a lifetime for a well-positioned buyer,” Tony Calvacca, managing partner of the NYBB Group, a New York business brokerage told the business marketplace researchers at BizBuySell. “And if you already operate a solid, sustainable business, there is never going to be a better opportunity to grow your volume exponentially.” The paycheck protection program and economic injury disaster loans are providing much-needed relief. Tax incentives – from deferrals to the employee retention tax credit – are also helping. But these are programs designed to provide respite to small businesses who need the aid to survive the current economic downturn. The short-term tweaks to the Section 7(a) program have another purpose: help small businesses grow beyond the pandemic. That’s because economic downturns cause disruption. But now that most signs are pointing to recovery, many of the smart business owners I know are looking to take advantage of opportunities. They see the potential to hire key people, buy real estate, snap up inventory and equipment and even acquire other businesses. The ones with capital right now are the ones who will benefit. The incentives for getting a Section 7(a), thanks to the Cares Act, can help provide that much-needed capital – not for survival, but for future growth. “In all my years in M&amp;A, I’ve never seen anything like this,” Max Friar, a founding partner of Michigan based Calder Capital, says. “While this is a challenging time for small business owners, this unparalleled action provides quantifiable relief to small business owners and a great opportunity for those interested in purchasing a small business.”",US small business; Coronavirus; Business,Business
2020-06-15T14:16:53Z,"Covid-19 pandemic is 'fire drill' for effects of climate crisis, says UN official",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/15/covid-19-pandemic-is-fire-drill-for-effects-of-climate-crisis-says-un-official,"The coronavirus pandemic is “just a fire drill” for what is likely to follow from the climate crisis, and the protests over racial injustice around the world show the need to tie together social equality, environmental sustainability and health, the UN’s sustainable business chief has said. “The overall problem is that we are not sustainable in the ways we are living and producing on the planet today,” said Lise Kingo, the executive director of the UN Global Compact, under which businesses sign up to principles of environmental protection and social justice. “The only way forward is to create a world that leaves no one behind.” She said there were “very, very clear connections” between the Covid-19 and climate crises, and the Black Lives Matter protests around the world, which she said had helped to reveal deep-seated inequalities and “endemic and structural racism”. “We have seen illustrated to everyone that social inequality issues are part of the sustainable development agenda,” Kingo said. Human rights were “inseparable” from dealing with climate breakdown, she told the Guardian in an interview. “This horrible racism [seen in the killing of George Floyd] is about human rights. We have to make sure that we give the social part of the agenda equal focus.” She called on business leaders to take heed. “We want all chief executives to become social activists – to understand social equality,” she said. Not only was this the right thing to do, but “it creates stable markets for companies around the world” and reflects the desires of young people. “Young people are so engaged, so dedicated to this agenda, they don’t want to work for companies that do not have a solid responsibility strategy,” she said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said building a fairer society would be essential to the world’s health, as well as to saving the planet from climate breakdown and ecological destruction. “Today, the fabric of society and the wellbeing of people hinge on our ability to build a fair globalisation,” he told the two-day UN Global Compact virtual conference of business leaders, which started on Monday. “Where once ‘do no harm’ was a common approach for the business community, today we are arriving at a new landscape of elevated expectations and responsibilities. But despite progress, serious threats would undermine our future, including climate change, poverty, loss of biodiversity and widening social inequalities. The pandemic has underscored the world’s fragilities, which extend far beyond the realm of global health.” Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, told the conference that the Covid-19 crisis had shown how urgent it was to tackle global heating. “This is a crisis that will involve the whole world and from which no one can self-isolate,” he said. He called for all companies to provide clear information to customers, the public and investors about how they plan to move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. More than 10,000 companies are signed up to the UN Global Compact, and they are being urged to strengthen their commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Many have pledged to cut carbon in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding global temperature rises to no more than 2C. But scientific studies show that this may not be enough to stave off disaster, and that the consequences of even 1.5C of global heating will be severe. Kingo wants companies to revise their business plans in order to reduce carbon in line with a 1.5C goal. “We need to see leadership to drive this,” she said. A report by the UN for the 20th anniversary of the Global Compact found that only four in 10 companies had targets that would enable them to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals by the 2030 deadline, and fewer than a third thought their industry was moving fast enough. While 84% of companies participating in the UN Global Compact were taking action on the goals, fewer than half were “embedding” those targets into their core business activities, and only 37% were designing their business models to meet the goals. “The human community is completely interconnected and interdependent,” Kingo said. “Without solidarity, especially with those most vulnerable among us, we all lose. We are paying the price for turning a blind eye to obvious injustices in the world.”",Climate crisis; Sustainable development; Coronavirus; Black Lives Matter movement; United Nations; Environment; World news; Business,Environment
2020-02-25T06:00:42Z,Accountants urged to help firms worldwide combat climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/accountants-urged-to-help-firms-worldwide-combat-climate-crisis,"The world’s accountants must put the climate crisis at the forefront of their work to spur global companies to adopt green policies and help prepare them for the risks, according to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and other industry groups. They have called on a global alliance of accountants, representing more than 2.5 million professionals worldwide, to put their skills to use by helping companies prepare for a climate emergency. The groups want all members of the Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) network to integrate climate risk into their company audits to drive companies to set more sustainable business strategies. Michael Izza, the chief executive of the ICAEW, said it is crucial that chartered accountants use their “unique position” at the core of almost every business, government and non-governmental organisation to make the case for sustainability. “Chartered accountants bring practical skills like measurement and management to the table, and can work with business to build green policies into their working practices. We need to make this a decade of transition for business; failure to make this move will make the inevitable adjustments required much more difficult,” he said. Accountants should demonstrate the risks to business posed by the climate crisis, such as the impact of flooding or the effect of drought on the price of crops needed in the supply chain, the industry groups said. The call for climate action comes after the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, launched a review into whether companies and their auditors are adequately reflecting the financial risks of the climate crisis in their annual financial accounts. Sir Jon Thompson, the FRC’s chief executive, said auditors have a responsibility to challenge management to face up to the financial risks of the climate crisis and provide clear information to investors. Bruce Cartwright, the chief executive of Icas, the global professional body, said there are “dramatic implications for failing to tackle climate change – environmental, social and economic”. He said: “It is our future that is at risk and the urgency at which we are required to act must remain front of mind. Icas is working with fellow accountancy bodies to act now to limit the negative effects of climate change. Our individual actions, collectively, have the ability to make a difference.”",Accountancy; Business; Financial sector; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news; World news,Business
2019-12-22T13:54:18Z,FTSE leaves coal and oil firms and G4S on ethical investment list,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/22/ftse-leaves-coal-and-oil-firms-and-g4s-on-ethical-investment-list,"Some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, including Russia’s state oil giant Rosneft, have been added to the London Stock Exchange’s “ethical” investment lists. The FTSE4Good indices, run by the London Stock Exchange Group’s FTSE Russell subsidiary, are marketed to investors interested in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. However, the LSE has refused to remove big polluting companies or the security company G4S despite allegations of systematic labour abuses across the world. At its latest semi-annual review earlier this month, FTSE Russell added the world’s 13th and 15th largest oil companies by market capitalisation, Rosneft and ConocoPhillips, to the FTSE4Good index. Rosneft Oil, Russia’s state oil company, produced 1.9bn barrels of oil in 2018. ConocoPhillips produced 468m in the same period. Other new inclusions were: Marathon Oil Corporation, a US company which produced 153m barrels in 2018. Lundin Petroleum, which produced 29.6m barrels in 2018. Origin Energy, which owns Australia’s largest coal-fired power station, Eraring. The FTSE4Good index rules explicitly ban coal firms, but the company also added Itochu Corporation, a Japanese conglomerate that mines coal as well as having interests including food, technology, textiles and machinery. Itochu’s coal-mining subsidiaries made profits of 65.2bn Japanese yen (£455m) in 2018. However, a loophole in the rules means that this exclusion only applies to firms whose main business is coal production – letting through conglomerates. The Guardian has previously reported that the FTSE4Good indices contain some of the world’s largest coal miners as well as oil and gas exploration and production companies. At the same time as adding the fossil fuel companies, FTSE Russell’s ESG committee refused to remove G4S, despite serious allegations over its treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The allegations were detailed in a report by Norway’s Council of Ethics, which monitors investments in the country’s £860bn Government Pension Fund Global. The report said there was an “unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations”. Human rights campaigners had expected the pension fund report – and G4S’s acknowledgement of issues – to trigger its ejection from the index. Wolfgang Kuhn, director of investor engagement at ShareAction, said: “We’re incredibly disappointed at FTSE’s decision. It’s deeply troubling that the index provider doesn’t consider evidence of human rights abuses to warrant exclusion from a so-called ethical index, particularly its failure to apply its robust exclusion policy when it matters most. “FTSE4Good is at best a mis-selling scandal in the making, and at worst continues to reward the most harmful activities in the corporate world.” The latest publicly available factsheets show that 65 oil and gas companies were already present on FTSE4Good’s emerging and developed markets indices. They included British and French oil “supermajors” Royal Dutch Shell and Total – the sixth and 17th biggest contributers to carbon dioxide pollution in history. Others included Italian supermajor Eni, Canadian oil sands miners Imperial Oil and Suncor Energy, and India’s Reliance Industries, the world’s seventh largest oil company. In a press release this month Italy’s Enel, the 13th largest, trumpeted its inclusion on the index because of its “sustainable business model”. “Looking at the number of oil companies listed in this index, this looks more like FTSE4Crude than FTSE4Good,” said Rosie Rogers, the head of Greenpeace UK’s climate campaign. “It takes some brass neck to argue that there’s anything ‘ethical’ about investing in the fossil fuel companies driving the climate emergency.” A spokeswoman for FTSE Russell declined to comment on the inclusion of new fossil fuel companies. On G4S, the spokeswoman said: “FTSE Russell and the FTSE Russell ESG advisory committee considered G4S against the controversy framework at this review, which assesses both the severity/scale of an incident as well as how effectively the company has responded. “Based on this assessment it was decided not to suspend G4S at this review. FTSE Russell will continue to closely monitor developments in relation to G4S.” The London Stock Exchange Group’s head of sustainable business, David Harris, has previously told the Guardian he would not exclude the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring shareholder pressure to bear.",FTSE; Oil and gas companies; G4S; Ethical business; Coal; Stock markets; Business; Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment; Energy industry,Business
2020-06-21T11:16:12Z,Glasgow City's Champions League mountain made steeper by shutdown | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/21/glasgow-city-champions-league-wolfsburg-tough-task-even-harder,"Glasgow City already needed to summon their inner David to outwit Goliath-like Champions League quarter-final opponents, Wolfsburg, but now the odds are even further against the Scottish champions. Uefa has announced the remaining eight Champions League teams will play a straight knockout tournament at the San Mamés stadium in Bilbao and the Anoeta stadium in San Sebastián. It is welcome news after the curtailment of the majority of European women’s leagues that there will be women’s football in August, and Glasgow City’s general manager and co-founder, Laura Montgomery, says Uefa “have done the best they can do to get the games played, which pretty much everyone is desperate for”. However, it does present clubs with a variety of challenges. The two-times European champions Wolfsburg, who clinched their fourth consecutive Frauen-Bundesliga title with a 2-0 over Freiburg on Wednesday, and Bayern Munich, who will play the reigning champions, Lyon, have benefited from being the only two remaining teams to have had their domestic league resume. “I do have a giggle sometimes when I see us in the quarter-finals with these giants and all the money that sits around them,” Montgomery says. “That’s what it’s about though, there’s some romance in seeing us there. We’ve got a huge hill to climb in drawing Wolfsburg in the first place.” Unlike Lyon, who are similarly disadvantaged, Glasgow are “still significantly far away from returning to training of any description”. Montgomery adds: “Even if we can meet all the protocols to get back training we’re not going to have anyone to play against because no other team in Scotland is back or can afford to be back.” With the manager, Scott Booth, keen to have the players for four to six weeks, Montgomery is working towards an early-July return to training. The biggest barrier to meeting the protocols required to return is the cost of testing. “We’re working with our facility provider because essentially you have to create a bio-hub for a return to training,” Montgomery says. “So we’re preparing as best we can but without a doubt the cost of the testing is our biggest challenge. It’s just astronomical. It’s astronomical for the top level of our men’s game, it’s been a prohibitive measure for some of those teams coming back, but we don’t have any other option; we have to find a way and as Glasgow City we usually do. For the integrity of our game here we simply have to do everything to get ourselves to Spain to play this quarter-final.” Glasgow City, founded in 1998, have held their own as an independent club and sealed a 13th consecutive league title last November. Hibernian and now Celtic and Rangers have invested in their women’s teams to try to end the dominance of a club who have reached the top pioneering sustainability. “Like anyone else we’ve not had a revenue for months,” says Montgomery. “We’re glad to have the [Champions League] game played in that respect because that is a part of our budget. We run as a sustainable business. I would never run us in a way where if we had a sudden loss of income for six months the club would go under, so we are run well but obviously there’s only so long that can continue.” With lockdown kicking in one game into the season and sponsorships not in before then, Montgomery has been working towards “plugging the gap”. There has not been direct financial help offered, but Uefa is attempting to mitigate the damage done by playing this mini-tournament in Spain. “As clubs we’ve all lost our home gates and match sponsorship opportunities, we’ve lost our advertising opportunities, we’ve lost third-party broadcasting rights,” Montgomery says. Uefa is allowing clubs to honour existing domestic exclusivity broadcast deals, but clubs will lose the ability to sell rights beyond their own shores as the European governing body attempts to maximise reach. Montgomery says Uefa may share 30% of money from pitchside advertising with the clubs. “They’re going to take care of our accommodation costs when we’re out there where previously we would have paid that. I’ve not worked it out yet because we’ve not paid for our flights because we don’t know exactly what day we’re playing. “I’m guessing we’ll probably be behind on what we would have projected previously but it is dependent on a lot of things. How many of the fans that have bought a ticket will want their money back? If a lot of fans don’t that massively helps us; if a lot of fans do want a refund that’s got thousands of pounds attached.” Less of a problem for Glasgow, because they had to deal with it in March, is the issue of players being out of contract or leaving. “The other clubs are now facing a problem that we faced months ago,” says Montgomery. “I’m going to be honest, we’ll probably, at best, have 18 first-team players because we just don’t have enough that were signed by that March date. It’s clearly affecting all the clubs.”",Glasgow City FC; Women's Champions League; Women's football; Football; Sport,Football
2020-07-09T06:30:02Z,Banks and pension funds among investors bankrolling meat and dairy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/09/banks-and-pension-funds-among-investors-bankrolling-meat-and-dairy,"Banks, investors and pension funds have poured billions into the world’s largest meat and dairy companies over the past five years, a new report has found. It compares the environmental impact of “‘big ag” to that of big oil. The report, published on Thursday, said private financial backing for the world’s 35 largest meat and dairy companies totalled an estimated $478bn (£380bn) between January 2015 and 30 April this year. The financing came in the form of loans, bonds and share ownership from the likes of BNP Paribas, Barclays, HSBC, Prudential UK, Standard Life Aberdeen, Legal &amp; General and UK pension funds, including the Universities Superannuation Scheme and the Railways Pension Scheme. Scientists have repeatedly expressed alarm over the environmental impact of large-scale food and dairy production and are calling for a transformation of the global food system. They say the current model is responsible for up to 30% of greenhouse gas emissions and 70% of freshwater use, with huge reductions in meat-eating essential to avoid climate crisis. The report by the UK-based campaign group Feedback describes meat and dairy production as a “fundamentally extractive business model” propped up by “vast flows of private finance”. It adds: “There is no version of industrial animal agriculture that is compatible with climate justice and a zero-carbon future.” Feedback’s executive director, Carina Millstone, said the environmental and biodiversity damage from intensive meat and dairy production was “as bad if not worse” as that of major oil and gas companies. Dr Tara Garnett, an Oxford University food systems analyst, said “a sole focus on individual consumption practices” was totally inadequate. She called the funding and production of intensive animal protein to provide cheap food “a systemic problem created and maintained by powerful financial interests and by absent, unhelpful and damaging governance”. Better to be involved and influential, argue financiers Feedback’s report found that over the past five years HSBC had loaned Brazilian meat companies Marfrig and Minerva more than “$1.8bn and as of April 2020 held shares to the tune of $9m in JBS”. JBS, Marfrig and Minerva have been linked to cattle practices that lead to Amazon deforestation. An HSBC spokesperson said the bank took its “agricultural commodities policy very seriously” and regularly assessed clients “for commitment to sustainable business practices”. Its agriculture products policy “sets our minimum standards related to the impact on forests from palm oil, soy, rubberwood and cattle farming”. BNP Paribas, the report points out, has a net-zero deforestation commitment yet Feedback found it was the largest lender to the top 35 animal protein companies. A BNP Paribas spokesperson said it was difficult to comment without seeing all the data but the bank “regularly strengthens its policies linked to at-risk sectors, ie in the sectors of palm oil, wood pulp and agriculture, to meet the bank’s commitment to zero net deforestation”. Barclays, said the report, was a “prolific funder of US agribusiness”, providing an estimated $5bn since 2015 in loans and underwriting to companies such as meat producers Tyson Foods and Cargill. A Barclays spokesperson said it was a “longstanding supporter of the agriculture sector”, that it used its “expertise to support the diversification of the sector”, and that it had made “a firm commitment to align our entire financing portfolio to the goals of the Paris agreement”. Many financiers argue that it is better to be involved and influential. Asked about its Marfrig investment, a Standard Life Aberdeen spokesperson said that in the past 12 months it had “spoken with Marfrig management twice, specifically on sustainability issues”. A Prudential UK spokesperson said that it was actively engaging with Amazon fire and deforestation issues and sent a document explaining specific strategies with Marfrig and Minerva Foods. Separately, Minerva Foods said in a statement that despite the challenges of indirect cattle supply chains, it has been part of the Indirect Suppliers Working Group since 2015 and acting to improve risk management. JBS has said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to deforestation in its supply chain. Pension funds were also singled out for criticism in the report, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), often known as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund, listed as one of the largest shareholders in meat and dairy corporations. Line Aaltvedt, spokesperson for Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the GPFG fund, said it had regular dialogues with Brazilian soya and meat companies and with banks in Latin America and south-east Asia about lending policies to any companies that contributed to deforestation. At a UK level, the report found that the Universities Superannuation Scheme and the Railways Pension Scheme invest in Hormel, which produces Spam. A spokesperson confirmed by email that RPMI Railpen, the railway pension scheme’s asset manager, had an interest in Hormel Foods. The email said that as a “responsible asset owner” it believed “companies with robust corporate governance structures” were more likely to perform better financially over the long term. Railpen, it added, was part of a global investor engagement run by investor group FAIRR that encourages the world’s largest food companies to move away from an overreliance on animal proteins. The Universities Superannuation Scheme said it was actively engaged in Hormel’s animal welfare benchmarking but admitted there was work to be done on its carbon footprinting.",Environment; Agriculture; Farming; Climate crisis; Banking; Meat industry; Food,Environment
2020-03-11T11:59:02Z,Debenhams seeks CEO to oversee restructure after legal challenge fails,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/debenhams-goes-for-restructure-as-mike-ashley-legal-challenge-fails,"Debenhams is searching for a new chief executive as it presses ahead with plans to cut its debts after a legal challenge backed by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct drew to a close. The financial restructuring will result in at least £100m of the ailing department store chain’s £600m-plus of debt being converted to equity. Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive, said: “This is great news for Debenhams. We can put the distraction of this litigation behind us and proceed with our plans to turn the business around. With committed investors, a strengthened board and a restructured balance sheet, we have the platform from which to rebuild a sustainable business.” As part of its battle for survival, the group has closed 22 stores, 19 of which shut in January, resulting in more than 700 job losses. Another 28 of its remaining 141 stores are expected to close next year. Debenhams has appointed headhunters Spencer Stuart to find a replacement for Vansteenkiste, who joined from the turnaround firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal and took on the chief executive role in August last year. The process, first reported by Sky News, is understood to have been under way for some time as the company tries to secure a retail expert to take the business forward after its overhaul. Debenhams was taken over last year by a group of its financial backers, including the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree, after falling into administration. It then used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable sites and cut rents. The company is attempting to negotiate further rent cuts as it fights for survival in an increasingly tough market. The CVA plan was subject to a legal challenge amid pressure from Ashley, whose Sports Direct group’s investment of £150m was wiped out when Debenhams went into administration. Sports Direct, which was recently renamed Frasers Group, backed the legal challenge to the group’s CVA by a private Salford-based landlord owned by the family of the property investor Aubrey Weis, which owned six Debenhams properties. Ashley’s retail group was blocked from taking legal action. The legal action was the latest gambit in Ashley’s battle with the department store. The administration and pre-pack deal with Debenhams’ lenders foiled an attempt by the Sports Direct boss to take control of the department store chain, which he wanted to merge with his House of Fraser group. Debenhams and other British department stores are struggling as shoppers shift to buying online or spending on experiences such as holidays, digital services and takeaways, amid rising costs, including business rates and staff pay. Beales is closing its 23 stores after falling into administration in January, while House of Fraser has closed seven of its 59 branches and at least three more are to shut imminently. Last week John Lewis said it was considering closing outlets after profits at its department stores plunged by 65% to £40m.",Debenhams; Mike Ashley; Frasers Group; Business; Retail industry; UK news,Business
2020-05-26T20:12:40Z,"Fan ownership would give rugby and football clubs stability, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/fan-ownership-rugby-football-clubs-thinktank-onward,"The leading thinktank Onward has called on the government to encourage fans to take a financial stake in rugby and football clubs in order to create sustainability and offer greater protection during times of crisis. The recommendation is included in a report called A Sporting Chance, which focuses on how professional football below Premier League level, cricket and the two codes of rugby are coping during the coronavirus pandemic. Will Tanner, Onward’s director, said: “A number of clubs are already facing severe financial difficulty and if the distancing and gathering restrictions continue into next season, we will see large numbers of clubs collapse and many towns lose the cultural heritage sports clubs represent.” Tanner, who was the deputy head of the policy unit in Theresa May’s Conservative government, continued: “There are social as well as economic reasons for the government to take steps to safeguard those institutions for thousands of fans and communities that rely on clubs. We have good relationships with people in the government and we have spoken to some of them about our recommendations. “A number of us have worked in government and so we have focused on practical ideas ministers can take up quickly, such as assigning stadia as assets of community value which could not be sold off by an owner in the event of a club collapsing. The financial issues facing sports like rugby need to be taken seriously.” Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has launched a drive against obesity, which Tanner believes should lead to investment in sport. “Government guidance [in England] is aimed at getting people active again through cycling, walking and the like so people can build resistance to the virus itself,” he said. “It will be a huge policy driver in the coming months, which is why it is important to ensure that clubs remain in business. “What our research showed was that it is difficult for fans to get detailed information on how their clubs are run. The accounts of many are opaque and most rugby clubs rely on benefactors rather than sustainable business models. Fans invest a lot emotionally every week and pay increasing prices on the gate. There should be greater responsibility to them.” The report points out that clubs in Germany’s Bundesliga for the most part have to be at least 50% owned by members, with the average ticket price far lower than it is in the Premier League where, as in club rugby in England, increases in television and sponsorship income have tended to be passed on to players and agents. “This is about transparency, accountability and governance,” said Tanner. “We recommend greater fan ownership and involvement in the running of clubs, football and rugby. We want the government to encourage that and in its manifesto it included the promise of a £150m community ownership fund.” Premiership rugby union clubs are hoping to complete the season that was suspended after 13 rounds, leaving nine to go along with two play-off weekends and the knockout stages of the two European cups. The intention is to resume in July, but players have to be convinced it will be safe for them to restart contact training. Clubs are anxious to start playing again because their income has reduced to a trickle during lockdown due to a lack of gate receipts and central funding, and the fear is that a second wave of the virus would have an impact on next season. “The government’s approach so far has been to give a loan to rugby league because there was an existential risk to a sport that had only just started its season,” said Tanner. “Union is different because although very few clubs are profitable, none looks unviable at this moment. I think the government will look to existing schemes to support those most at risk rather than underwrite the whole sport. “A second wave of the virus would be a different ball game. All businesses would face a much greater challenge and recovery would become an order of magnitude. It would need a much different government response because drastic action would be needed to save all manner of concerns, including clubs.” He added: “Clubs need to find a different way of running their businesses and, with revenues reduced, they are unlikely to be willing to pay such high salaries. As the crisis is happening all over the world, the competitive pressures that have driven up wages will be tempered and that will help rugby move to a more sustainable model. “What is clear already is that ministers should take immediate action to protect sports clubs that are the pride of many communities and which will be needed to bring the country back together again once this pandemic is over.”",Sport; Rugby union; Football; Premiership; Cricket,Sport
2020-06-04T08:00:01Z,Revealed: UK banks and investors' $2bn backing of meat firms linked to Amazon deforestation,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/04/revealed-uk-banks-and-investors-2bn-backing-of-meat-firms-linked-to-amazon-deforestation,"British-based banks and finance houses have provided more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in financial backing in recent years to Brazilian beef companies which have been linked to Amazon deforestation, according to new research. Thousands of hectares of Amazon are being felled every year to graze cattle and provide meat for world markets. As well as providing financial backing for Minerva, Brazil’s second largest beef exporter, and Marfrig, its second largest meat processing company, UK-based financial institutions held tens of millions of dollars worth of shares in JBS, the world’s largest meat company. All three meat companies have been linked to deforestation in their supply chains, though they say they are working to monitor their suppliers and mitigate risks. Marfrig, a Brazilian meat company that has supplied fast-food chains around the world, was found to have bought cattle from a farm that had been using deforested land last year. JBS remains unable to monitor a significant proportion of its suppliers despite operating deep in the Amazon, while last year Marfrig admitted that more than half of the cattle it slaughtered originated from indirect suppliers that it could not monitor. According to a joint investigation by the Guardian, Unearthed and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, financial data between January 2013 and May 2019 shows that HSBC underwrote $1.1bn of bonds for Marfrig and $917m for Minerva. They also held nearly $3m in JBS shares. Schroders held $14m in Marfrig bonds and $12m in Minerva bonds, while Standard Life Aberdeen held $10m in Marfrig bonds and $3m in JBS shares. Prudential UK had $23m in JBS shares and $5m in Minerva bonds. Banks frequently hold bonds and shares on behalf of clients who invest through their asset management funds. Other European-based institutions provided an additional $2.1bn of backing. Santander underwrote $1.4bn worth of bonds across the three companies. Deutsche Bank underwrote $69m worth of Marfrig bonds and loaned JBS $57m. European institutions also held significant shares in JBS: Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank and Santander invested $37m, $12m and $7m respectively. All data was correct as of May 2019. The European Commission is considering new financial reporting rules in light of the coronavirus crisis that would require banks, insurance firms and listed companies to disclose their exposure to biodiversity loss and pandemic risk. Scientists have warned that deforestation is increasing the risk of new diseases emerging. Some of the financial institutions told the Guardian they were engaging with the three companies over deforestation, and could reconsider their support if they saw insufficient progress. The three meat companies say they are confident that the farms their slaughterhouses directly purchase cattle from are not involved in deforestation, but they also accept they cannot know the origin of some animals that have passed through other farms beforehand. In a statement, JBS said it had blocked thousands of direct suppliers for breaking rules concerning deforestation and was working with the Brazilian government and industry on solutions for monitoring indirect suppliers. Minerva said there was “no accessible and reliable data and statistics on the complete cattle traceability chain” in Brazil and that it was evaluating a new tool developed by the National Wildlife Federation and University of Wisconsin to monitor indirect suppliers. Marfrig said it was developing a tool to combat the risk of buying from indirect suppliers which it cannot monitor. “No UK financial institution should be profiting from the destruction of rainforest or other precious habitats in Brazil or elsewhere. If the government’s claims to global leadership on climate are to have any meaning at all, it must stop turning blind eye to the links between UK banks and deforestation, by introducing strong regulation, harsh penalties and strict provisions on full public transparency of environmental and social impacts of all investment portfolios,” said Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion. In response to the findings, a spokesperson for Aberdeen Standard Investments said: “There are definitely shortcomings in supply chain monitoring for the entire beef industry in Brazil, but these practices are improving across the industry and investor activism plays an important role in this development ... At present, we remain invested but this may change depending on a number of factors.” Schroders said it was in dialogue with both Minerva and Marfrig and that, “if we did not see these signs of progress, we would certainly consider changing our recommendations for these companies.” Deutsche Bank said it did not finance activities where there is clear and known evidence on clearing of primary forests, areas of high conservation value or peat lands, illegal logging or uncontrolled and/or illegal use of fire. Crédit Agricole said it did not finance projects on deforested land with high biodiversity value. Prudential UK said it was actively engaging with companies operating in the Amazon region to find solutions. HSBC said it conducted reviews of clients for their commitment to sustainable business practices. Santander said it conducted annual reviews of more than 2,000 clients in Brazil, including those that are large soy producers, soy traders and meatpackers, especially about their supply chain.",Meat industry; Brazil; Americas; Environment; Farming; Food; Deforestation; Amazon rainforest; Conservation; Trees and forests; World news,Environment
2020-07-21T05:24:39Z,Sydney Carriageworks saved but not all creditors happy with rescue package,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/21/carriageworks-to-be-saved-as-creditors-vote-to-accept-bailout-of-sydney-arts-company,"Carriageworks has a clear path towards recovery after creditors voted unopposed on Tuesday for a proposal to rescue the arts company with the support of philanthropists and the New South Wales government, but not everyone is happy with the deal. The multi-arts institution in Sydney’s inner-west went into administration on 4 May after suffering an “irreparable” loss of income following the shutdown of non-essential services in NSW due to the coronavirus crisis. Carriageworks owed more than $2m to more than 140 creditors, including many individual artists and small arts companies. Despite those creditors voting on Tuesday to save the company, some who spoke to Guardian Australia expressed concern about the financial blows that were ultimately falling on the shoulders of those smaller players, who would receive a fraction of the amount they were owed by Carriageworks – even in the case of its rescue. Since their appointment, administrators Phil Quinlan and Morgan Kelly from KPMG had been strongly pushing for creditors to agree to a deed of company arrangement (DOCA) rather than opt for liquidation. The DOCA relied upon pledged contributions from philanthropists – including Geoff Ainsworth and his wife Johanna Featherstone, Kerr Neilson, Michael Gonski and the Packer Family Foundation – that were contingent upon the security of a long-term lease of Carriageworks’ Eveleigh premises and funding from the NSW government. Since 2017, Carriageworks has been operating on a month-by-month lease at the historic Eveleigh rail yards. The company, which has a number of resident arts organisations, subleases the premises from Create NSW, which in turn leases it from Transport NSW. The insecurity of the leasing arrangement, and Create NSW’s failure to commit to a funding timetable for Carriageworks’ multi-year support, were key factors in the company’s collapse. In June, the second meeting of creditors was suspended until Tuesday this week to give the administrators more time to secure assurances from the government on these issues. Newly reinstated NSW minister for the arts, Don Harwin, announced on 10 July that the government had agreed to these terms. The DOCA allows for priority employees to be paid their entitlements in full, while unsecured creditors – many of which are individual artists and arts companies – are expected to receive an estimated 20-30% of what they are owed. While they would have received nothing in the case of liquidation, early estimates suggested the individuals and organisations owed money by the company would receive between 25% and 37% of the outstanding sums in the event that a DOCA was approved. However, some members of the arts community are frustrated that the administrative timeline had blown out – that as negotiations to secure the lease agreement and funding from Create NSW dragged on, the administrators’ high fees ate into assets that would have otherwise been dispersed to creditors. Visual artist Rafaela Pandolfini told Guardian Australia that small to medium companies were forfeiting disproportionately large sums in order for the Carriageworks to reopen. “We are one of the greatest financiers of Carriageworks moving forward so why don’t we also have a substantial say in how it will be run when it returns?” Pandolfini said. “I would like to see Carriageworks acknowledge this disastrous effect on the artistic community and remodel.” She also called for a greater focus on diversity, equal pay structures across the organisation, and “sustained pay and support to the artists involved in their programs rather than the gig economy”. “It was another financial blow that was not necessary,” another creditor told Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity. “We are excited that Carriageworks is coming back, but I don’t think people understand what that means for us as creditors. So many of us have lost work already.” The NSW government stepping forward on the DOCA proposal and agreeing to the lease and funding in a timely manner “would have been a really simple way to get money into the pockets of the arts workers. We’re all quite disappointed about that.” “When you see these announcements about Carriageworks you don’t think about the people who actually are bearing the cost of it,” the creditor said. “Arts workers are in a crappy position anyway. This blow was avoidable.” “We are both conscious and embarrassed that creditors have been disadvantaged,” chair of the Carriageworks board, Cass O’Connor, told Guardian Australia. “The arts communities feel quite vulnerable, and people are concerned that other organisations are teetering. Everyone’s worried about that and it’s completely justified.” She said the philanthropists backing the company’s renewal, particularly Geoff Ainsworth and Jo Featherstone, were “very keen that we were more generous than usual to the creditors involved, because many of those creditors were from the arts community”. “We wanted to pay as much as we humanly could, while also raising enough money to go into the future activities of the company and precinct. It is a balancing act,” O’Connor said. “We were frustrated at some of the delays. We – along with the creditors, and frankly, KPMG – were very frustrated that the second meeting had to be extended. KPMG were very upfront about what that would mean. From my viewpoint, this certainly wasn’t a fee gouge by KPMG.” The administrators will hand back the company to its directors in the next seven days, with public operations expected to resume in the coming months, beginning with the reopening of the farmers’ market in August. O’Connor said a key plank of the new sustainable business plan, approved by the parties involved in the DOCA, was a funding buffer to guard against further downturns, such as if Sydney was to experience another lockdown. In a statement on Tuesday, Carriageworks chief executive Blair French thanked those who had lent their support to the institution since it went into administration. “The risk of closure gave rise to a most extraordinary expression of community support that gave great heart to everyone involved with Carriageworks,” he said. “We recognise the impact of this process upon our staff, artists, suppliers, farmers’ market producers and audiences and look forward to re-engaging all our stakeholders as we re-emerge with renewed confidence and strength into what remains an operational environment constrained by Covid-19.”",Culture; Arts funding; Coronavirus; Australia news; Sydney; New South Wales; New South Wales politics,Culture

2021-05-08T15:00:54Z,"If we want to save the planet, the future of food is insects",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/08/if-we-want-to-save-the-planet-the-future-of-food-is-insects,"My first attempts at feeding insects to friends and family did not go down well. “What the hell is wrong with you?” asked my wife when I revealed that the tomato and oregano-flavoured cracker bites we had been munching with our G&amp;Ts were made from crickets. “Hang on, I’m vegetarian!” cried our friend – which prompted a slightly testy discussion on whether insects count as meat, how many thousand arthropods equate to one mammal and considering almost all industrial agriculture involves the mass slaughter of insects, what’s the difference? I then tried some Crunchy Critters dried mealworms on my seven-year-old. “It doesn’t taste of much,” he said. His friend wasn’t wild about his grasshoppers either. “The legs are weird.” But connoisseurs insist that dried specimens from a packet simply cannot compare to free-range, seasonal arthropods roasted in their own oils. “The fresh ones are much tastier, of course,” says Dr Monica Ayieko, senior insect researcher from the western region of Kenya – and one of an estimated two billion people who regularly eat insects. “I love the smell of roasting lake flies or crickets. It’s a nice savoury smell. This is one thing we pride ourselves on in Africa – we always eat fresh food.” The only unqualified success I had was with my nine-month-old, who seemed almost as keen on desiccated buffalo worms as he is on, well, just about anything he can shove into his mouth. And that’s just as well. If the evangelists for eating insects are to be believed, orthoptera, larvae and any number of the 900+ edible species of insects could form a regular part of his future diet. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has urged that we all make more of this “underutilised” resource. And given the issues of food supply sustainability, it may not be a question of choice. It ought to be obvious to anyone with an appetite that the way we eat is not sustainable – and that something fundamental will have to shift if we do not want to end up with half the world obese and the other half under water. “Civilisation is in crisis,” was the verdict of the EAT-Lancet international commission into the global food chain in 2019, which contained a dire warning of 200,000 years of human history culminating in ecological disaster. Modern industrial agriculture, extractive capitalism, the profit motive, governments cowering before Big Food and our own greedy western appetites all must take a share of the blame. It is in this context that “future food” – food that promises to be good for you and animals and the environment – has taken on the buzz that was once associated with Silicon Valley start-ups. Younger consumers are increasingly anxious to make ethical, sustainable choices – and tech industry venture capitalists are increasingly keen to invest in them, too. The Californian “alternative meat” company Beyond Meat, valued at around $9bn, has now launched its products in 445 British supermarkets and its rival, Impossible Foods, is expected to follow soon. Cell-grown meat isn’t far off: in December, the Singapore Food Agency approved the world’s first fully synthetic chicken nugget. Still, recent history suggests that tech investor-backed American processed food companies vying to dominate the protein market isn’t likely to lead to utopia. Insect protein is not as “sexy” as the alternative meat companies, admits Leah Bessa of the South African start-up Gourmet Grubb, but she feels anyone interested in food security should be looking for multiple solutions. “I don’t think we should be expecting any one food to solve things,” she says. “The problem with our agriculture system is that we don’t have enough diversity to cater for different climates and landscapes. What’s great about insects is that you can farm them anywhere, in any environment. They don’t destroy land, you can grow them on by-products of the food industry and they’re full of nutrients.” But, she cautions: “It has taken the plant-based food movement decades to get to where it is now,” she says. “If insects can do the same, it will be a big win.” Currently, most of the investment is heading towards insects-as-feed for other animals. Mars Petcare recently announced a new insect-based cat food range, Lovebug, and insects show great potential as feed in aquaculture and for livestock. The French firm Ÿnsect recently raised $225m to open the world’s largest insect farm in Amiens that will soon be producing 100,000 tonnes of protein per year. The British company, Entocycle, has, meanwhile, received a £10m government grant to build a black soldier fly larvae farm outside London. As a sustainable business model, it sounds almost too good to be true. Insects not only make a far more efficient feed – they can also be fed on waste and their “frass” (excrement) can be used as fertiliser. Currently, around 33% of cropland worldwide is used to feed livestock. Dr Sarah Beynon, an entomologist who runs the Bug Farm, a working insect farm and visitor attraction in Pembrokeshire, believes we will have to get used to a different idea of farming: hi-tech, robot-operated vertical facilities devoted to maximising protein yield. As inhumane as that sounds, from the insect’s point of view, she stresses, it’s a good deal. “With insects, we can farm them intensively without compromising their welfare. They’re actually happier when they’re close to many other insects of the same species.” Insect lifecycles are also highly conducive to factory farming: at certain stages of their lives they produce heat and at other stages they need heat, so an indoor farm can be more efficient than an outdoor farm in a warmer climate. Still, Beynon worries that using insects for livestock feed could end up serving to prop up a dysfunctional and wasteful food system. “It’s an important stepping stone, especially where it comes to replacing unsustainable fishmeal – but it’s not actually attacking the problem itself,” she says. The problem being our insane overconsumption of meat. “It’s slightly crazy to me to feed the by-products of plant-based farming to insects which are then fed into an animal-based farming system. The more extra steps you have in the food chain, the more energy and food you’re wasting. It’s always more efficient and sustainable to take a step out.” In other words: if we don’t want to take the drastic step of simply eating more vegetables… we should probably get used to eating insects ourselves. While western consumers are not ready for whole insects, Bessa believes they aren’t necessarily averse to innovations, such as her Entomilk, which is made from black soldier fly larvae (“BSFL” in industry parlance) which are rich in fats and minerals, including calcium. “People are starting to become more aware of what food does, not only to their bodies but to the environment – and they travel a lot now, their minds are much more open. They’re more willing to try what they might have considered gross before.” The edible insects market will grow to $6.3bn by 2030 according to a report by Barclays. Research by Sainsbury’s found 42% of British consumers are willing to try insects. But it’s one thing persuading someone to try a novel insect product – and another making it part of their weekly shop. This is the challenge that Francesco Majno, the Italian entrepreneur behind the Small Giants cricket snacks that I attempted to foist on my house guests, is trying to meet. It’s not so surprising to find the insect start-up space littered with the husks of companies that barely emerged from pupal stage. The first company to penetrate a British supermarket was Eat Grub, whose whole insects appeared in Sainsbury’s in 2018 – only to be quietly removed from shelves this year (though they are still available online). Majno believes that offering insects in “familiar” products such as crackers and tortilla chips is a surer route to acceptance: “I can say that we have a completely different approach compared to Eat Grub or other similar insect brands such as Crunchy Critters,” he says. “We believe that the only way to tackle the yuck factor is by giving insects a familiar form that can help anyone to try them the first time and to understand how tasty and nutritious they are.” It’s not hard to convey that at a market stall, where Majno can go into salesman mode. Did you know crickets emit less than 0.1% of the greenhouse emissions of cows to produce the same amount of protein? They require vastly less water, too: it takes 112 litres of water to produce a single gram of beef but less than 23 litres for a gram of insect protein. (Insects also comfortably beat chickpeas in this regard.) But it’s hard to get all that across in the snack aisle of Sainsbury’s – where Small Giants now competes with Cool Original Doritos and Really Cheesy Giant Wotsits, foods with long histories, large marketing budgets and lower price points. Majno is encouraged by the number of repeat customers and the fact that he recently won a Great Taste Award. But in truth, I couldn’t really have distinguished the Small Giants snacks from cheaper rye crackers. And once you get over the oddness of biting into insects and insect products, you realise a more pressing problem: they’re actually quite bland. There are further obstacles, too. Numerous species of insects are moving towards regulatory approval in the EU, but, post-Brexit, it is unclear whether Britain will adopt these European standards or start all over again, which would set British insect-farming back years. And while there is increased demand, seasonal insects are subject to numerous restrictions. Eduardo Gomez, who runs the Mexican food specialist MexGrocer, says he is prevented from importing Mexican delicacies such as escamoles (ant larvae and pupae), since meat and cheese products from Mexico are banned in Europe. “High-end restaurants have been asking me for years – please can you bring insects in? The future is in insects. Eventually, people will realise this. It’s the best we can do right now if we want to save the planet.” For the moment, however, our insect future in the west feels rather beige: highly processed products enriched with insect protein powder – as opposed to grasshoppers with guacamole, or the lake fly dumpling stews that Dr Ayieko conjures. And it’s worth stressing that for all the talk of insects as a state-of-the-art protein for westerners, for many people, insects are a food of the present – and an endangered one, too. Dr Monica Ayieko’s eyes were opened to the potential of insect protein when she married into a family who lived on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria, near the city of Kisumu. Here, the tiny lake flies swarm so abundantly, they look like smoke rising from the lake. When they swarmed in her home, she set about them with insect spray before being upbraided by her mother-in-law, who showed her how to collect them in a sweep net and crush them into dumplings – which can then be dried, tossed into a stew or eaten raw. When she returned to her own village she found a neighbour’s child had died of malnutrition – and she feels such cases could be averted if only more use was made of this readily available source of protein. Now based at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University in Kenya, she has devoted her career to researching local traditions and developing insect farming as a route to food security. “This is local, highly indigenous knowledge – it’s not something that has been imposed on us,” Ayieko says. “We now have 120 masters and PhD students here, studying sustainable agriculture and their research must be on insects for food and feed, which is very encouraging.” However, while insect-eating is becoming more accepted, insects are still widely seen as a food of the poor. “Some people in rural areas can now afford to buy chicken and fish, which means those who can’t feel shy about collecting insects – they don’t want to be seen as poor.” Meanwhile, habitat destruction means there are fewer insects to collect. “We are currently seeing a reduction in the lake-fly population because of climate change. When I published my first paper on lake flies, there was an abundance of insects. Now in my old age I am seeing less and less of it.” One of Ayieko’s favourite types of ant, carebara vidua, can no longer be found. “This insect is a big delicacy in my community. But you don’t see it any more. Normally, it would emerge from wetlands – but we have chopped down trees and built roads and laid concrete and done all the things that human beings do.” There is a bitter irony to the idea that just as insects are being held up as novel solutions to the dysfunctions of the western food system, they are disappearing from the areas where they are genuinely relied upon – areas that are likely to see the worst effects of climate change. Dr Sarah Beynon echoes the point – as western standards of affluence are held up as something to aspire to in the developing world, local traditions and expertise are being lost, perhaps irreversibly. But she, too, sees education as the route to a better future and has been working with local schools to introduce young children to issues of sustainability. “Young people will make their food choices around sustainability – so long as the product tastes good and has a texture they’re used to. They don’t want to see parts of insects – so it’s a case of using the protein and the nutrients. But we shouldn’t hide the fact that they’re insects.” She has helped to develop a product called VEXo mince, a plant- and insect-based mince that can be used in all mince contexts: burgers, meatballs, etc. As soon as Covid recedes, she hopes to put insects on school menus in Pembrokeshire and beyond. “That’s the key. If we can normalise them on school menus, it will be a huge step for the future.” And I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch. We like to think we eat what we eat due to time-honoured traditions – that national dishes, such as roast chicken, are part of who we are. But it wasn’t so long ago that sushi and packet sandwiches were seen as outlandish and pointless – and a couple of generations back, roast chicken was an elite food. In the 1950s, only around 1m chickens were eaten in Britain each year. Now, that figure is closer to 1bn. Majno tells me he felt an insect snack was the way to introduce the idea of entomophagy to consumers – much more manageable than an insect-based meal. But it’s worth stressing that snacking is itself a relatively new phenomenon. Doritos were invented in 1966; Wotsits in 1970. When I was a child in the 1980s, “eating between meals” was still the sort of thing your granny tutted at. And this cultural taboo has been obliterated mostly by the might of the food industry – which has always strived to create new moments for eating. The America obesity researcher Barry Popkin has compiled extensive evidence showing that obesity levels rise as developing countries adopt the western diet – of which snack foods are a key part. That could lead you to despair. But my point is: nothing about how we eat is fixed. If we can get our heads around factory-farmed chicken, Wotsits and the Impossible Burger, we can probably get our heads around cricket flour, BSFL milk and mealworm bolognese. And we can hopefully look at those cultures that eat insects regularly with admiration as opposed to disgust. Dr Ayieko tells me she is optimistic. “If we cannot figure out a sure way to sustain these insects, we are treading towards extinction. But if we can, we are safe. We will provide for them and they will provide for us.”",Food; Environment; Insects; Animals; Wildlife,Food
2020-01-12T19:00:35Z,Beales department store chain close to collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/12/beales-department-store-chain-close-to-collapse,"The department store chain Beales is on the brink of collapse and must find a buyer within days, with about 1,000 jobs at risk if the historic retailer does not complete a rescue deal. Beales, which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881, has filed notice of its intention to appoint administrators, as the retailer considers its options while seeking to complete a sale process begun last month. Sources close to the firm said it was still hopeful of being able to secure a deal, amid interest from at least two suitors including another retail firm and a venture-capital investor currently holding eleventh-hour talks with Beales and its financial advisers. Beales appointed the advisory firm KPMG in the final retail trading week before Christmas to help advise on its “strategic and financing options” – including a sale of the whole company or its subsidiaries. KPMG declined to comment. In a bid to fund its moves towards a “sustainable business model”, the firm said it needed funding to support a refreshed strategy, which included an overhaul of its product ranges and cost-saving efforts. Beales, which has 22 stores across the UK, including in Bedford, Mansfield, Perth, Southport and Yeovil, completed a management buyout in October 2018 led by its chief executive, Tony Brown. Pretax losses more than doubled to £3.2m in the year to March 2019 from £1.5m a year before as sales remained steady at £48.3m. The business had net current debts of £15.8m. It said in those accounts that trading had been hampered by an industry-wide downturn in sales of women’s fashion and the 2018 summer heatwave. Department stores are under pressure from rising costs, particularly business rates, and increasing competition, as the brands they have specialised in are increasingly going direct to shoppers either online or via their own stores. The retail industry has warned that 2019 was the worst on record for sales, with the volume bought by customers falling for the first time in 24 years amid a dire period for high-street shops. Households across the country have been reining in their expenditure in recent months against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty over Brexit. Several firms have reported a disappointing Christmas shopping period, the most important time of the year for retail industry profits. Marks &amp; Spencer warned last week that it had been dented by rivals’ discounts as well as its own buying mistakes after it stocked too many men’s skinny jeans and mince pies. John Lewis warned last week it could ditch the annual bonus for its 81,000 employees as it flagged a big fall in profits and announced the departure of its boss.",Retail industry; Business; Shops and shopping; Consumer spending; Economics; UK news,Business
2019-12-17T16:41:24Z,Retailer Beales puts itself on the market in 'challenging times',https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/17/retailer-beales-puts-itself-on-the-market-in-challenging-times,"Beales, the department store chain, has put itself on the market after warning it faced “exceptionally challenging times”. The loss-making retailer said it had appointed the advisory firm KPMG to help assess “strategic and financing options” including a sale of the whole company or its subsidiaries in a bid to fund its moves towards a “sustainable business model”. In October 2018, Beales, which has 22 outlets across the UK, completed a management buyout led by the chief executive, Anthony Brown. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Beales said it needed funds to support a new strategy, which included a rejig of its product ranges, cost-saving efforts and acquiring stores similar to an outlet in Fareham that opened in October in a former Marks &amp; Spencer branch. The appointment of KPMG, which is known for its expertise on insolvency and restructuring, is likely to raise fears that the retailer is facing a crash crunch. Beale Ltd, the Bournemouth-based group’s parent company, said it was facing “exceptionally challenging times” in accounts for the year to the end of March filed at Companies House in October. Pretax losses for the group more than doubled to £3.2m in the year to March from £1.5m a year before as sales remained steady at £48.3m. The business had net current debts of £15.8m. It said in those accounts that trading had been hampered by an industry-wide downturn in sales of women’s fashion and the heatwave in summer 2018. Beale Ltd said its working capital had been funded by Wells Fargo, with which the department store has a £17.3m facility in place until May 2021, and that the company also had credit arrangements in place with major suppliers. But department stores are under pressure from rising costs, particularly business rates, and increasing competition as the brands they have specialised in are now going direct to shoppers either online or via their own stores. Sports Direct’s House of Fraser chain has closed seven of its 59 sites since buying it out of administration last year, and it is expected to close more in 2020. Debenhams is poised to close more than 20 stores in January, and a number of local department store groups including Scotland’s Watt Brothers have fallen into administration.",Retail industry; Business; UK news,Business
2020-03-09T13:01:04Z,Mike Cannon-Brookes says staff will desert companies that do not speak out on social issues,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/10/mike-cannon-brookes-says-staff-will-desert-companies-that-do-not-speak-out-on-social-issues,"Company bosses need to speak out about environmental and social issues if they want to keep their staff and stay in business for the long term, Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-chief executive of Atlassian, said. Research done for Atlassian by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers showed almost a third of Australian and US workers were willing to quit their jobs if their employer acted in a way that did not align with their values. “The responsibility of business leaders to provide leadership in areas of the community and participate in leadership alongside government and other groups is something they should be aware of,” Cannon-Brookes said. The number of people willing to leave a company over its stance on social issues was “a lot higher than we expected across the generations”. “There’s a cost of inaction as much as there’s a cost of action here,” he said. Top issues for Australian workers were the cost of living, the long-running drought and access to healthcare. Mental health, the cost of healthcare, pollution and the climate crisis also featured heavily among workers surveyed in December, before the bushfire season hit its peak. “Anecdotally, and obviously in the media and other areas, climate change, long-term planning, listening to experts – there’s a lot of things that I think the horrific summer that we’ve had have highlighted in the minds of society in general,” Cannon-Brookes said. “People in society [whose] house was confronted by a bushfire emergency, they’re people that work in businesses. Businesses are collections of people; business leaders are people.” In the US, workers were most concerned with the cost of healthcare, the highest in the developed world at almost 17% of gross domestic product. Access to healthcare, mental health and poverty were among US workers’ top concerns, pushing environmental issues – including pollution and global heating – down the table. Cannon-Brookes has been outspoken calling for companies to take positions on economic and social issues. Grok Ventures, his and wife Annie’s private investment vehicle, has supported shareholder resolutions put forward by the activist group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, designed to put pressure on BHP to quit the Minerals Council. Cannon-Brookes said other business leaders often told him they agreed with his positions on social and environmental issues but felt they could never go public. “If we could remove some of the hesitation, the fear, some of the sense that this is going to be a negative thing for one’s business or one’s personal position, I think we’ll have better conversations as a whole,” he said. He slammed commentators who have called for business leaders to abandon social activism in favour of a narrower focus on generating returns for shareholders. “I’m not sure that the people who are theoretically commenting on returns to shareholders understand how returns to shareholders work,” he said. “Those returns are generated by the employees at some level in whatever business you are. “Attracting and retaining fantastic people is a non-trivial exercise in business nowadays. “There’s a huge correlation if you look at corporate social responsibility between profitable, sustainable businesses and those who care about their corporate social responsibility. “One of businesses’ goals is to stay in business, and to be a sustainable business you need to have fantastic people and take longer-term sustainable positions on a lot of issues.” He said the survey showed employees wanted their business leaders “not to hide in the corner when it comes to important issues for society at large”. PwC surveyed 1,300 Australian and 2,500 US workers across age groups and industries. A partner at PwC, Diane Rutter, said the research showed the risk of inaction for employers was high. “There is a vocal younger cohort or generation coming through the workplace that are personally engaged and quite vocal around societal issues, and their expectations of workplaces are equally high,” she said. Employers who thought they could ignore the data should also be aware there was a reward for taking action. “There’s a large portion of employees that agree that businesses known for speaking out on issues important to them are much more attractive as future employers,” she said. “We see that is significantly higher for Generation Z – so again, that generation coming through.”",Business; Climate crisis; Work & careers; Australia news; Guardian Careers; Mike Cannon-Brookes,Australia news
2020-04-21T02:20:01Z,Pay cuts give Rugby Australia time but fight for sustainability starts now | Bret Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/pay-cuts-give-rugby-australia-time-but-fight-for-sustainability-starts-now,"The agreement between Rugby Australia and the Rugby Union Players Association for players to take 60 per cent pay cuts will provide critical short-term financial relief for the struggling code during the coronavirus pandemic. But as drawn out as these negotiations were, they should be just the first step towards striking a new deal between RA and its most valuable asset, serving as a precursor to a re-negotiated Collective Bargaining Agreement which will give the code a greater chance to achieve long-term sustainability. The interim pay deal gives RA another six months’ breathing space to survive the current crisis, but the CBA looms as a potentially even more important negotiation for the future of the game. RA needs to rethink how it is going to engage with the players in order to be on a stronger footing to survive downturns, particularly unexpected ones. Both RA and the RUPA seemed to come out of the negotiation with a reasonably fair deal based on the understanding that they need each other. Similarly, the two parties need to come to a mutual understanding on what is a sustainable business model for the future or they will not have a game to administer and play, at least not one as we know it. Australia’s professional players are entitled to seek the highest salaries they can, but for the last decade or so Australian rugby has been forced to pay a premium for players because of strong competition from rich clubs in Europe and Japan. This has placed a strain on Australian rugby’s capacity to invest in the grassroots of the game, which has fallen well behind its major rivals, especially the AFL. Under the current CBA, players receive a generous 29 per cent of player-generated revenue regardless of the game’s income streams or player performance. That’s a pretty good deal for the players, but for a financially fragile code like rugby, it may not be sustainable. During the life of the current CBA the Wallabies have slipped to seventh in the world, their lowest ever ranking, while no Australian Super Rugby team has won the title in this period. Yet, the players’ pay scale remains the same. RA should seek a player payment model that rewards success. Australian players give their all, but sport is driven by results and Australia’s professional rugby teams have not delivered for some time. A tiered payment model which might begin at a minimum of 20-to-25 per cent of player-generated revenue and increase in line with success on and off the field is possibly a more realistic option for a cash-strapped code. The Wallabies receive bonuses when they win the World Cup. Why not extend this to winning the Bledisloe Cup, The Rugby Championship and the Super Rugby title? As well, if players successfully re-engaged with Australian rugby’s disillusioned fan base, perhaps they could also benefit indirectly from increased crowds and television ratings by factoring bonuses into the CBA. This would give the players skin in the game. The players have accepted massive pay cuts now because really there was no other choice. RA was in danger of becoming insolvent and players would have lined up with the rest of the creditors for whatever cents they could get out of dollars owed. The pay cuts allow RA to slash its overall wages bill by around 80 per cent and have cleared the way to secure a $16m loan from World Rugby to help keep it afloat until play resumes and revenues are generated again. But without a broadcast deal beyond the end of this year, Australian rugby remains in a vulnerable position. Whether RA secures a new broadcast partner such as Optus or returns to long-time partner Fox Sports, it is hard to imagine it negotiating a better deal than the current $57m-a-year in the current economic climate. RA will need the cooperation and goodwill of the players more than ever in a post-coronavirus world. As part of the interim agreement the players will be involved in discussions about any future competitions and structures. Any new CBA negotiation needs to recognise the fact Australian rugby players are a valuable commodity on the global market. How can RA keep costs down in an uncertain future and ensure its top players are properly rewarded? Part of the solution may already lie in the interim agreement. Up to six highly paid players will be allowed to take sabbaticals overseas to recoup lost earnings from their salary sacrifice. Perhaps this measure could be expanded to allow more players to take sabbaticals so that Rugby Australia could pay its leading players what it could afford without players being financially penalised. It would not be an ideal solution as the Super Rugby teams would bear the brunt of being without some of their star players, but if RA can successfully reduce the salary burden in the next CBA it could free up much-needed revenue to invest in the growth of the game. Rugby is a players’ game, not just present players, but players of the future also.",Rugby union; Australia rugby union team; Australia sport; Sport; Rugby Australia,Sport
2020-05-23T19:00:01Z,'Every club makes a loss': Wasps chief on adapting to rugby's new normal | Paul Rees,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/wasps-chief-steven-vaughan-premiership-rugby-union-new-normal,"“It is not like George Best turning up in town.” Ask Stephen Vaughan, the chief executive of Wasps, about whether marquee players add to the opposition’s gate receipts when they visit and he gives a blunt response. Ask him whether players can expect the Premiership’s eventual return to be close to what went before and he is likewise outspoken. “When we resume playing, there will be a new normal regarding costs and personnel is part of that: nothing is off the table.” Vaughan is not alone among the chief executives of Premiership clubs in regarding the current sporting lockdown as an opportunity to reset businesses that have tended over the years to be guided by dreams rather than reality and relied on the largesse of owners and backers. Vaughan says: “We would love to think that things will go back to where they were, but clearly there will be an impact. You want to do the best you can for the excellent people we have here and that keeps you awake at night.” Wasps, like the other Premiership clubs, have cut wages for players and furloughed staff. The clubs hope to restart at the beginning of July and play the campaign to its conclusion to ensure they do not have to pay rebates to broadcasters, but they are waiting for clearance from the government to resume full training early next month. “Whatever we do next, we have to be up front with the players,” says Vaughan, “and engage with the Rugby Players’ Association, a force of good: they have the players’ interests at heart but they are very sensible. They understand life has changed. We have very little revenue coming in and we are spending considerable time looking at parts of the business, including the playing side, and how we can be more efficient when we are able to open the doors again. We have talked to the players and coaches about what it will look like and they have not held back in their views.” Similar conversations have been held throughout the Premiership in recent weeks, which is why many clubs were angry when Bristol broke ranks this week when they said they would oppose the recommendation of Lord Myners, in his recent report on the salary cap regulations, that the provision for two marquee players outside the cap should be reviewed, as well as any attempt to lower the cap from its current £7m, which has another season to run. “Every club is entitled to its opinion,” says Vaughan, who this week became the group chief executive, adding the portfolio of events at the Ricoh Arena to the fields of sport, marketing and commerce that he had been in charge of since August after seven years at Gloucester. “Bristol’s vision is to win league titles and Europe and if they have the money to back it up, their strategy will not be cutting the salary cap. You will always get a couple of outliers with rich backers but the majority of clubs have a really sensible approach. “You only have to look at the accounts of clubs in general to realise that pretty much every one makes a loss and does not work as a sustainable business. The lack of revenue now will only heighten that problem. Even though players have had a salary cut of 25%, it does not go very far in covering the massive costs of running that department when there is no income being generated. “The pandemic has shone a light on the unsustainability clubs were at already and the majority neither want nor will be able to continue to operate in the new world in the same way we did then. We believe a collective approach is better than everyone doing their own thing: one of the Premiership’s objectives is to have a competitive league and it is because each club is paying within a few shillings of its rivals.” Vaughan sympathises with Bristol who, after years in the Championship, have the means to tilt at the big time. “It is not their fault they have an owner in the rich list and wants great things for the club he loves. I have no malice with them, but it will sit differently with those who may not think it is in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve during this pandemic. Collective action is sensible in the light of the hole in revenue every club will face. We support Lord Myners’s recommendations and his report was a powerful piece of work. “When he says we should look at whether marquee players are adding to the value of the game or creating a disparity within the business, we should do. I do not share Bristol’s belief that marquee players add to the gate when they are playing away. “When I was at Gloucester, we always struggled to sell tickets for Saracens despite the number of unbelievable players they had. It is not like George Best turning up in town. I understand Bristol’s ambition, but for the Premiership as a whole survival at this point is the ambition.” Wasps have the highest turnover in the Premiership, £32m, but the entire business has been hit by the restrictions on gatherings, from rugby to conferencing, exhibitions and concerts. “The Killers and Rammstein were due to perform at the Ricoh Arena this summer, but they have postponed until next year. The business was growing and we were having a record year in terms of events and conferences while the priority on the field has changed since the club first moved to Coventry. “We have a clear strategy to become a club where players stay because of the culture. We do not want to buy in superstars every year to fill a gap. Yes, you need quality players, but we do not want to be known as a cheque-book club, rather one that punches above its weight in the top four. “These are the most challenging times all of us have known, but I believe that if we stick together, we will all emerge from it stronger.”",Wasps; Premiership; Rugby union; Sport,Sport
2020-01-15T11:45:45Z,Climate crisis fills top five places of World Economic Forum’s risks report,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/climate-crisis-environment-top-five-places-world-economic-forum-risks-report,"A year of extreme weather events and mounting evidence of global heating have catapulted the climate emergency to the top of the list of issues worrying the world’s elite. The World Economic Forum’s annual risks report found that, for the first time in its 15-year history, the environment filled the top five places in the list of concerns likely to have a major impact over the next decade. Børge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, said: “The political landscape is polarised, sea levels are rising and climate fires are burning. This is the year when world leaders must work with all sectors of society to repair and reinvigorate our systems of cooperation, not just for short-term benefit but for tackling our deep-rooted risks.” After a month in which bushfires have raged out of control in Australia, Brende said there was a need for urgent action. “We have only a very small window and if we don’t use that window in the next 10 years we will be moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.” The WEF report said the retreat from the multilateral approach that helped cope with the 2008 financial crisis made it more difficult to tackle shared global risks. It said the top five risks in terms of likelihood in the next 10 years were: Extreme weather events with major damage to property, infrastructure and loss of human life. Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation by governments and businesses. Human-made environmental damage and disasters, including environmental crime, such as oil spills and radioactive contamination. Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse with irreversible consequences for the environment, resulting in severely depleted resources for humankind as well as industries. Major natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and geomagnetic storms. The report was released ahead of the WEF’s annual meeting in Davos next week, which will be attended by the chief executives of some of the world’s biggest and powerful companies. Despite the large number of participants flying in to Switzerland by private jet, the WEF said Davos would be a carbon-neutral event. But John Drzik, the chairman of Marsh &amp; McLennan insights, which helped to compile the report, said businesses had to step up their action on global heating. “There is mounting pressure on companies from investors, regulators, customers, and employees to demonstrate their resilience to rising climate volatility. Scientific advances mean that climate risks can now be modelled with greater accuracy and incorporated into risk management and business plans. High-profile events, like recent bushfires in Australia and California, are adding pressure on companies to take action on climate risk at a time when they also face greater geopolitical and cyber risk challenges.” Peter Giger, group chief risk officer of Zurich Insurance Group, which also collaborates in the preparation of the risks report, said there was a pressing need to adapt faster to avoid the worst and irreversible impacts of the climate crisis and to do more to protect the planet’s biodiversity. “Biologically diverse ecosystems capture vast amounts of carbon and provide massive economic benefits that are estimated at $33tn (£25tn) per year – the equivalent to the GDP of the US and China combined. It’s critical that companies and policymakers move faster to transition to a low carbon economy and more sustainable business models. “We are already seeing companies destroyed by failing to align their strategies to shifts in policy and customer preferences. Transitionary risks are real, and everyone must play their part to mitigate them. It’s not just an economic imperative, it is simply the right thing to do,” he said.",Business; Climate crisis,Business
2020-04-19T07:30:31Z,Young Britons have been hit hard. We owe them a future they can believe in | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/young-britons-have-been-hit-hard-we-owe-them-a-future-they-can-believe-in,"It’s time the young got a break. Already, those who left education to enter the workforce after the financial crisis of 2008 have had their lives scarred. If you get unlucky and enter work in bad economic times, it will shadow your entire life. Thus the 2008-11 “crisis cohort”, as the Resolution Foundation calls them, have suffered measurably lower wages, fewer career opportunities and more insecure work than their predecessors. And now Covid-19 is creating a “super-crisis cohort” about to experience the same effect, only worse. Unless government, business and society collectively act, what lies ahead will be unfairness heaped upon unfairness. Last week, it became obvious just how profound the impact is going to be. What caught the headlines was the Office for Budget Responsibility’s scenario of a possible fall in GDP of 35% over the next three months with a rise in unemployment of two million. But it optimistically assumed that an exit strategy would allow a rapid economic recovery. Without vaccines and extensive capacity to mass test and contact-trace, there is no prospect of an early and swift bounce-back – just a gradual, trial-and-error, partial easing of the lockdown. And, sorry to mention it, but the self-defeating Brexit at a time of collapsing world trade is going to make matters worse. Already, the early figures are showing that, once again, the young are being hardest hit. The under-30s are now two-fifths more likely to be working fewer hours and two-thirds more likely to be made unemployed than their seniors – they tend to be in more insecure work and have fewer skills. Moreover, even low-skilled work, of the type that used to be available, is drying up. We failed to build an economy with roots, of firms with sustainable business models; the last 40 years was a world of soft options, financial engineering, easy money and extravagant pay at the top. The property market constituted an amazingly unsustainable 14% of GDP. It is all unravelling in a matter of weeks and, as matters stand, it will be our children who will bear the brunt. The first to be hit will be those who were due to take exams this summer, now to be accorded GCSEs, A-levels and degrees on the basis of their course work and teachers’ assessments. The worry for all of them is that 2020 qualifications won’t stack up against those taken in 2021 or 2022. That is not all. Young people have active social lives. They go clubbing and to concerts, they share flats and houses. The world of social distancing ahead is going to make all that so much harder. Small wonder that young people are disproportionately reporting depression and mental health problems. But in my experience, the millennials and generation Z are morally grounded and ethically driven, perhaps more so than their world-weary elders. They want to do right, to act on the world for the better. It is not faddishness that drives their passion to confront climate change, eat less meat, treat each other equitably and want strong relationships with their parents. What is striking in this crisis is just how willing these young people, for whom coronavirus is less life-threatening, are to stand shoulder to shoulder with older people. They are an awe-inspiring bunch. It’s a debt society must repay. So, all plans for recovery and rebuilding must be organised in a way that there is no disadvantage in being under 35 and, where possible, our societal debt is acknowledged. Let’s limit the damage to our children’s education. Primary schools and nurseries must be opened first, followed rapidly by secondary schools and universities. The Student Loan Scheme needs to be wholly recast or replaced. Beyond that, there is a triple obligation: to build an economy that does not treat young workers as disposable commodities; to take measures that safeguard the young as much as the old; and to use the pandemic as the trigger for societal reinvention. We have to future-proof ourselves, nationally and internationally, against viruses, climate crisis, cyber-attack and the many menaces ahead. All organisations should be obliged to be purposeful generators of genuine value, housed in a reformed ecosystem of finance, ownership and regulation that fosters it. That is the precondition for creating great workplaces for young people and the possibility of building skills and careers. However, this must be buttressed by an overhaul of our training system and trade unions that appeal to youth. Too much of the burden – of paying taxes, of propping up the housing market as first-time buyers, of being the first to be made redundant – is borne by our youth. The triple lock on pensioner incomes is now insupportable. The furloughing scheme should not be summarily dropped after lockdown: rather, it should morph into a variant of the German “short-work” scheme, offering job subsidies for lost working hours but targeted at workers who entered the labour market after 2008 and those with children. Where the young(ish) have negative equity as house prices fall (as they inevitably must), government and lenders must offer a mortgage guarantee. But, above all, let’s build an economy and a society that inspires. Let’s offer young people hope that they can believe in the future. The new normal must not be a regression to former inequalities but one that, in trying to enfranchise everyone, will offer them a fairer deal. My generation could have left a much better legacy. If this noxious microbe becomes the catalyst for changing that, it would provide at least one silver lining among otherwise overwhelmingly dark clouds. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Society; Employability; Housing; UK news; Youth unemployment; Coronavirus; Young people; Students; Education,Opinion
2020-04-09T10:59:22Z,The Breakdown | Shutdown gives rugby union an unmissable opportunity to reset,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/shutdown-gives-rugby-union-an-unmissable-opportunity-to-reset,"Realism in rugby has gone viral in the last month. English club owners from Bristol’s Steve Lansdown to London Irish’s Mick Crossan and unions from England to Australia all agree the suspension of the game as countries look to slow the spread of coronavirus has presented an opportunity to reset the professional game. “Club rugby has to change,” Crossan said. “Last season cost me £4m and I can’t afford that. It’s definitely not a sustainable business. We cannot keep relying on rich benefactors. This crisis may actually help club rugby if everyone cuts their cloth to suit their pockets and it brings back common sense.” The lockdown has exposed the sport’s parlous financial position, union and club, with increases in turnover tending to be spent on wages so they are no better off. Worcester’s last financial accounts showed a turnover of £12.1m that was eclipsed by a wage bill of £12.8m. No wonder the club was sold for £1. “We do not want to come back in and carry on with the same model that repeats the errors of the past,” said the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney. “When you have a crisis of this scale, and I do not think anyone predicted this magnitude, it highlights where there are fault lines. Some are being exposed now.” The game in Europe went into the professional era 25 years ago sleepwalking but the south was more alert. Wealthy entrepreneurs in England and France saw an opportunity and took over clubs, quickly finding themselves on a collision course with their unions when there was not even a distant prospect of turning a profit. All that has changed since are running costs owing to an explosion in wages. “We are all acutely aware that from present adversity new opportunity could, and very much should, be born,” said the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, Gareth Davies. “Streamlining our playing calendar and balancing up the need for revenue generation have long been issues facing our sport. “We need each other more than ever to resolve this conundrum and all rugby playing nations should now realise the extent to which we are interdependent. The end result should be a truly global international calendar. Unity is not only the key to survival but long-term prosperity.” Premiership Rugby this week repeated its desire to complete the season and fulfil commercial contracts but it will be a long time before normal life resumes. Even if the restrictions on large gatherings were relaxed sooner rather than later, would there be a demand for big-capacity sporting events amid fears of a renewed outbreak of Covid-19? Social distancing will take on a voluntary nature and there appears to be more chance of next season being affected than a resumption any time soon. The financial squeeze will become greater and when rugby is played again Test matches will have priority because they are the sport’s commercial driver. The south faces losing its incoming tours: if that happened, Europe’s autumn schedule would need to be revamped and revenue shared, a subject the north has consistently refused to address. As Davies said, all the unions are in it together and they have an opportunity to assert their authority together, as they should have done in 1995. This week the French Rugby Federation president, Bernard Laporte, floated the idea of a world club championship, a more exclusive version of the Champions Cup. It was not something he had suddenly dreamed up. Laporte is running on a ticket with the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, who is up for re-election next month. Laporte is bidding to become his deputy and the governing body’s plan for a nations league, which was scuppered by some of the Six Nations last year, still has legs. The planned divisions below the Rugby Championship and the Six Nations are being organised, providing a pathway for second- and third-tier nations. The European unions are in talks with the private equity company CVC about taking a 15% stake in their business in return for £300m. There will be a temptation, with all the unions predicting substantial losses this year, to snatch the £50m+ each would receive but how far would it go after debts had been absorbed? The Premiership clubs last year received £12.5m each after selling a 27% stake to CVC, which means they will each receive around £1.5m less from central funds each year at a time when enhanced television and sponsorship deals will be tough to negotiate. The nations league promised a substantial increase in turnover for unions with all the money raised going to the game and none to speculators whose concern was the bottom line. Put together with Laporte’s proposal, it would allow all the tier one unions to contract their leading players, relieving some of the financial burden on clubs in France and England. The clubs would resist the move. Owners have put a significant amount into the domestic game with a consequent rise in playing standards and facilities but wage inflation means the business as a whole is losing some £50m a year, a figure that will rise. The £7m salary cap will be reviewed after the start of the season but it will need to come down rather than go up. The playing calendar in Europe is a compromised mish-mash, a product of the drive for cash, which serves neither club nor country well. It cannot survive the current crisis and unions will never have a better opportunity to force change. The game needs them to seize the moment.

The American chief executive survived one big regulatory investigation when he was judged in 2018 to be merely incompetent (failing to show “due skill, care and diligence”), as opposed to lacking personal integrity, in trying to unmask an internal whistleblower. But the new investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England is different: it’s about whether Staley lied, or was less than frank, when describing to Barclays’ board the nature of his relationship with Epstein. Only a finding of 100% cleanliness will do. The same applies to the board itself since it is backing Staley all the way and the regulatory inquiry also concerns the bank’s letter to the FCA setting out the chief executive’s relationship with Epstein when at JP Morgan Chase. Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins, in post for less than a year, needs a pristine regulatory outcome himself. In other circumstances, Staley would have expected applause from shareholders for Barclays’ numbers for 2019, which showed a 25% jump in pre-tax profits to £4.4bn. The only quibble was the alert that the target of a 10% return on equity might be missed this year. The financial performance, though, is a sideshow. For what feels like the umpteenth time, we’re waiting to see if Barclays’ boardroom is about to spit out another famous investment banker. National energy champion to FTSE 100 relegation in five years Centrica’s decline on Iain Conn’s watch as chief executive has been spectacular and, even in his final months in charge, the bad news outweighs the good. The core British Gas retail division is still getting clobbered by the price cap. Weak natural gas prices are still hurting the exploration and production division. And the 20% stake in outage-prone nuclear generator British Energy is still hanging around more than a year after it was put for sale. A share price that was 280p in 2015 is now 72p and Centrica is worth a puny £4.2bn. In truth, it was always wrong to think of Centrica as any sort of champion. The group contained too many odds and ends, which is why Conn’s strategy of concentrating on the consumer side, and adding “connected home” initiatives, made some sense. The tragedy for shareholders is that Conn’s bet ended up as a gamble on the government staying out of the retail energy market. He lost. When the price cap arrived, Centrica’s fragile financial arithmetic couldn’t stand the strain – Conn calculates the cap cost the group £300m last year. The company found itself locked into countless rounds of job cuts in a futile attempt to protect the dividend. The upstream assets are now being sold at a bad moment in the commodity cycle. Conn is right, though, when he says Centrica’s cash flows now roughly balance after his second cut in the dividend, which is one definition of a “sustainable” business. British Gas hasn’t halted the loss of customers but it has slowed the rate substantially. And the “services and solutions” operation – which spans smart boilers, domestic storage batteries and software for electric vehicle charging – is growing rapidly; it looks a decent business to own on the way to a lower carbon future. That, though, is for the next chief executive, when he or share is eventually appointed. In the meantime, the share price is a hostage to the prices achieved for selling the exploration assets plus the British Energy stake. As with Conn’s exit, their departure is taking ages. Watchdog should launch investigation in to grubby ticket sales The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has already warned Viagogo and StubHub to pause any integration of their businesses while it considers a probe of the two firms’ merger. Here, though, is a strong reason for the watchdog to go further and launch a full-scale investigation: this paper’s revelations about the scale of StubHub’s activities in the grubby business of reselling football tickets. Evidence suggest about 5% of the seats for next Monday’s Chelsea versus Manchester United game have sold or advertised via StubHub, despite a law banning reselling of tickets. There are many other examples. The CMA should take a hint. Consumers aren’t bothered about JD Sports’ takeover of Footasylum, a small deal that fascinates the boffins, but they do care about football tickets.",Barclays; Jeffrey Epstein; Banking; Business; Bank of England; Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA); Financial Conduct Authority; Financial sector; Regulators; Jes Staley,Business
2021-03-28T07:00:36Z,Soy of the Rovers: the vegan football club kickstarting a green revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/28/soy-of-the-rovers-the-vegan-football-club-kickstarting-a-green-revolution,"A player miskicks the ball – skies it – and its clatter on the metal roof is the loudest sound in the Covid-emptied stand. There’s not much by way of a corresponding stand on the other side of the pitch, mostly just advertising boards and a momentarily malfunctioning scoreboard. Behind them a hillock, behind that a sunset. There’s an ill-timed tackle, a melee of angry players, a red card for the home team. But the visitors, Colchester United, look rudderless – it’s the first game for their interim manager – and 10-man Forest Green Rovers run out 3-0 winners. If much of this is a typical scene of lower-league football, as played out all over the country every week of the season, in some crucial details it is not. It’s partly the setting that’s different, on a hill outside Stroud in Gloucestershire, in a landscape more redolent of point-to-points than professional football. “Jilly Cooper loves Forest Green Rovers!” says one of the billboards – a tribute from a local author to the local team. “Red sky at night,” says one of the few people permitted to be there, as he contemplates the sunset, “shepherds’ delight.” I’m pretty sure I haven’t heard that line of commentary at a football match before. And then there’s the fact that the players’ striking strips (lime green with a black zebra-stripe pattern) are – tonight, for the first time for any team anywhere in the world – made with a composite of waste coffee grounds and recycled plastic. The pitchside adverts don’t only celebrate Cooper’s raunchy, horsey novels but also brands associated with healthy and sustainable living: Quorn, Oatly, Innocent, Elixinol cannabidiol products, Grundon environmentally friendly waste management. One has the skull and crossbones insignia of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society: Defending Ocean Wildlife Worldwide, it says. My stomach is getting to know a shiitake mushroom burger I ate just before kick-off, and finding it less confrontational, digestion-wise, than the traditional meat-and-whatever-else version that is served at football grounds. For this is Forest Green Rovers, declared by Fifa the “greenest team in the world”, certified by the United Nations as the world’s first carbon-neutral football club, which in the decade since its acquisition by the green energy industrialist Dale Vince has become famous well beyond its size, for its sustainability and, especially, for the all-vegan menus offered to both players and fans. It’s not stopping there: apart from the coffee kits, there’s also a plan for a new all-timber stadium designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, which in February was approved by the English Football League, having won planning permission from Stroud District Council last December. Nor are Vince’s wider range of eco-initiatives slowing down. He shows me some diamonds on the Zoom screen, made with carbon (incredible as this may seem) taken from the atmosphere, a process that he says reduces the colossal waste that comes with mining the precious stones. He already has Devil’s Kitchen, a vegan food business spun off from the football club, which makes burgers, plant balls and suchlike, now available through Ocado. The main source of his wealth is Ecotricity, a renewable energy supplier that developed from the windmills Vince erected in the 1990s. He created Nemesis, a Lotus Exige chassis modified with electric motors and batteries, which in 2012 broke the UK speed record for electric cars. Last month, he teamed up with the Daily Express, of all newspapers, to promote its Green Britain Needs You campaign. Vince’s speciality is to bring green practices and ideas to blokey aspects of life not usually associated with such things: football, burgers, cars. Or, three decades ago, energy provision. “You have the most fun and most impact preaching to the unconverted,” he says of his work with the Express. “On the right wing of life the people at the Express have had people saying to them: ‘What are you doing working with that bloke?’ and on the left wing of life I’ve had people saying to me: ‘What are you doing working with that newspaper?’ And we both say the same thing – we can’t live in our bubbles, we’ve got to talk to each other.” * * * Vince, 59, is the sort of have-a-go entrepreneur who you might have thought was extinct in a time of corporate leviathans. He is restless, rapid-speaking, both engaging and elusive, his manner at once laidback and wired. I’m told by people who’ve dealt with him that he is both shy and direct, that “he doesn’t hang back from expressing opinions”, that he can be assertive, that he “doesn’t suit the more English-y sort of people”. As he describes himself in his recent book, Manifesto: “I look at and do things my own way. It’s got me into plenty of trouble but it’s also a bit of a superpower.” He might now be described as “Britain’s richest hippy”, living in a castellated former fort on a hill above Stroud, with a large solar array in its untamed garden, but he once had almost nothing. The son of a Great Yarmouth lorry driver, he left school at 15 and spent years as a traveller, living in a lashed-up old ambulance, or a pickup truck, or a bus, driving a 30-year-old fire engine to Spain, riding motorbikes, moving from one site to another – “old airfields, gravel pits, car parks”, as Vince writes in Manifesto. In 1985 he was embroiled in the notorious “Battle of the Beanfield”, an outbreak of what he calls “wanton state-sponsored violence”, an assault by 1,300 police on 600 travellers heading towards Stonehenge. In 1991 he had “an epiphany”. He’d already made a little money putting up improvised wind-powered phone stations (“windphones”) at the Glastonbury festival, and he’d added a small windmill to his trailer, connected to old train batteries he’d rescued from a scrapyard, capable of 50 watts, enough for two dim lights and water pump. The first big power-generating windmills in Britain were built that year, in Cornwall, and Vince decided to have a go himself. He educated himself on “aerodynamics, mechanics, electronics, statistics… windmill technology, planning and environment assessments, grid compatibility, financial modelling, construction”. He made his own 30-metre mast for testing wind speed, won the co-operation of the owner of the hill, and spent his last “few hundred quid” on some respectable clothes and a flight to Germany to meet the manufacturers of the then-unconventional variable-speed windmill that he wanted. He gained planning permission. Representing himself in court, he defeated a legal challenge from the National Trust. He negotiated a connection to the local grid, raised £350,000 in finance and, five years after his epiphany, got the windmill up and running. This was the beginning of Ecotricity, a company that in 2019 had a turnover of £201m. Later, Vince turned to electric transport: the Nemesis project never turned into a mass-produced car, but it did lead to the Electric Highway, a national network of charging points. Vince’s company had to fight off an attempt by Elon Musk and Tesla to shove them aside, but it now has 300 stations across the country. Forest Green Rovers now looks like a perfect extension to the Ecotricity brand – it even has “green” in its name – but Vince insists that its transformation into a “global force” was “serendipity”. “I just bumped into it along the way. It was a rescue mission, only that.” The club was “leaking money everywhere… it was about to fold. I thought that was wrong. It was a big part of this community, 120 years old, lovely people. They invited me to a game. It was fabulous, like a small theatre, intense and personal.” He stepped in and bought it. “On day two I bumped into the fact that we were serving red meat to our players and I thought: ‘Oh my God, we’re part of the meat trade, I can’t be that,’ so we had to make that change.” They realised, he says, “that we might not be speaking to the most receptive audience, but that only added to the appeal of doing it. The one thing everyone wants to know is how can you have a vegan menu without having a riot from your fans.” The answer, he says, was to show that “food without animals in is great food”. The club’s players “were the easiest audience of all. We simply said to them that red meat will impair your performance.” It’s now widely recognised among elite athletes, says Vince, that vegan diets improve performance and reduce injury. The Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero, for example, goes on a vegan diet during the football season. So they sell the fans pies, sausage rolls and burgers, chips and gravy, all plant-based, as well as options that are not imitating meat. Away supporters, the club chef Jade Crawford tells me, mockingly turn up in butchers’ aprons. They chant “Where’s your burger van?” But, she says, the products she offers “sell out, so they must like them”. Some home fans “said at first they were a bit annoyed about it. They said they might stop coming, but they tried the food and said it was really good.” * * * The diet has grabbed most of the headlines, but there are other aspects to Forest Green’s greenness: power from solar panels and from Ecotricity’s green energy, a pitch free of chemical fertilisers or pesticides, charging points for electric cars, the capturing of rainwater from the roof to irrigate the pitch, an electric van for the kit man, and soon, it is hoped, an electric team bus. There’s a well-publicised “mow-bot”, a GPS-directed solar-powered lawnmower. Forest Green Rovers’ performances on the pitch have improved since Vince’s takeover. Once teetering on the edge of relegation from the Conference, the fifth tier of English football, they were later promoted to League Two, which in the logic-free system of numbering these things is the fourth tier. They currently have good prospects of promotion to League One and hopes of eventually getting to the level above that, the Championship. The combination of veganism, sustainability and some sporting success has brought them global attention. They have 100 fan clubs in over 20 countries, such as the Forest Green Rovers Chicagoland Supporters group, foundedin 2016 by people who “shared a passion for the environment and soccer”. The Arsenal full-back Héctor Bellerín, attracted by the club’s ethos, has become a shareholder. “Engaging fans through their favourite sport and getting them to be fans of the environment” is what Vince calls it. The United Nations invited the club to be founding members of its Sports for Climate Action programme, which, he says, “is pretty much based on what Forest Green have done”. Bigger names have followed where Forest Green Rovers have led. The mighty Real Madrid recently announced a partnership with the British plant-based producer Meatless Farm to encourage sustainable eating (still a lesser level of commitment to the environment than that of the Stroud side). The future stadium, which will use contemporary timber engineering techniques to achieve its all-wooden structure, is intended as a vehicle to get the club to the next level, while also promoting its principles. It will have a capacity of 5,000, with the ability to go up to 10,000 or 12,000 without too much difficulty, which would be big enough for a Championship side. “We might shoot for 15,” says the ever-ambitious Vince. Because timber is renewable, and absorbs carbon during its growth, it greatly reduces the carbon and energy costs that go into construction, which might be three times those expended on such things as light, heat and power used over the lifetime of a stadium. The stadium’s completion is still some years off, not least because it is to be part of a grander plan: a “Green Technology Cluster”, a “truly sustainable” business park that aims to create up to 4,000 jobs. Some 20% of the 50 hectare site is to be wetlands, alongside a restored stretch of a historic canal. The location is currently green fields, next to Junction 13 of the M5. This doesn’t sound environmental – neither building on fields nor relying on road transport – but “farmed fields are wildlife deserts”, Vince says, and his proposals will provide more biodiversity than the land they replace. There are not many options for getting fans to his stadium by public transport, but he promises electric buses and cross-country walking and cycling routes. The seductive images of the project show an elegant curving form rising out of a lush green landscape, its undulations echoing the soft hills behind. In some ways it is what you would expect from Zaha Hadid Architects – striking forms are their thing, and their work on the London 2012 Aquatics Centre and Al Wakrah Stadium for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, as well as their now-abandoned designs for the Tokyo Olympic Stadium, have made sports buildings one of their specialities. On the other hand, the Forest Green Rovers project is small by the current standards of this global practice, and their designs – which are almost always in concrete and steel – have not hitherto been especially noted for their sustainability. The mighty roof of the Aquatics Centre, for example, used prodigious quantities of steel. Alex de Rijke, an architect who has pioneered modern timber construction, including a proposed wooden handball arena for the London Olympics, is sceptical that ZHA are the best people for the job, given their previous lack of interest in timber structures. It’s “excellent that Forest Green are building a timber stadium”, he says, but wonders whether this design grows out of the structural characteristics of wood or steel. He suggests that the practice isn’t usually driven by optimised use of sustainable materials, but by what he calls “the dogged mission to invent novel forms” – the desire, to put it another way, to look striking. Jim Heverin, the director at ZHA in charge of the project, acknowledges that this is partly new territory for them, which was part of the attraction of the job: they want “to grow out of the shadow of what people think we are, and carbon is the challenge of our generation”. He says that the design does pay attention to issues such as waste – the curving silhouettes are made out of assemblies of straight elements, for example – and as it develops they will also consider such matters as the distance the materials have to travel from their place of origin. He’s also clear that looking striking – the power of the image – is important to the practice, and that the project “will cost more than normal because it’s not conventional – you can’t just buy it out of factories”. This reflects an aspect of the Vince philosophy, which is that “whether it’s burgers, cars or football we can still have fun doing it differently”. The idea of Nemesis, he once said, was to “smash the boring, Noddy stereotype of the green car”. His current plan for mining the sky for diamonds is “bling without the sting”. Which brings up a core question behind the whole Vince enterprise: what’s the substance, what’s the spectacle, what is what he calls “storytelling”? It’s hard to think, for example, that a solar-powered lawnmower will make a huge impact on the club’s carbon footprint; its role is more to be an eye-catching messenger of its values. But it’s hard to argue with the seriousness of his overall achievement. The point of his combined ventures is that they are all of the above: they combine the humdrum business of large-scale energy provision with the coffee kits and the shiitake burgers that get environmental messages to hard-to-reach audiences. His hometown of Stroud, birthplace of Extinction Rebellion, is the sort of place that would give short shrift to greenwash. Although his building proposals have attracted objections, there doesn’t seem to be much by way of significant challenges to his overall green credentials. The worst thing I hear about him is that his presence is a bit too dominating, looking down on the town from his castle, his burger-windmill-diamond factory and frequent Ecotricity banners being hard to miss. “It’s a bit medieval,” I’m told. Molly Scott Cato, a Stroud resident who until Brexit was a Green party MEP for South West England, has had some political confrontations with the Labour-supporting Vince, who wanted the Greens to step aside at the last general election. But she said that “it’s brilliant for the town having a renewable energy firm” and that the “football club is really important in reaching out to people that are hardest to get to”. He may not, with his flurries of initiatives, always get everything right, but collectively they’re a force for good. If Forest Green Rovers raise the question: how much impact can a League Two football club have, the answer is quite a lot.",Forest Green Rovers; Architecture; Football; Ethical and green living; Carbon offsetting; Environmental activism; Culture; Sport; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions,Football
2019-11-28T00:01:23Z,City investors urge UK's top firms to pay workers living wage,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/28/city-investors-urge-royal-mail-british-airways-jd-sports-to-pay-workers-living-wage,"Influential City investors have written to the chief executives of companies including Royal Mail, British Airways and JD Sports urging them to pay their workers a real living wage. The letter calls on businesses to seek accreditation from the Living Wage Foundation, which makes sure companies pay employees and contractors an hourly rate higher than the national minimum. Signatories include the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, Candriam Investors Group, BMO Global Asset Management and responsible investment group Hermes EOS. The investors together control almost £2tn in assets. The foundation’s real living wage – calculated as “what employees and their families need to live” – is £9.30 an hour across the UK, or £10.75 in higher-cost London. That contrasts with the £8.21 legal minimum for over-25s – dubbed the “national living wage” by the former chancellor George Osborne – or the £7.70 minimum wage for the under-25s. Concern over low pay for employees has risen up the political agenda since the financial crisis, with British workers enduring the worst decade for real-terms pay growth since the Napoleonic wars of 1803–1815, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. At the same time, executive pay has risen dramatically. More than 5,500 employers are accredited as living wage employers, but only 38 of the companies listed on the FTSE-100 index have signed up so far. Pauline Lecoursonnois, who negotiates with companies for Hermes EOS, said: “The case is clear: a workforce that is fairly paid, well valued and respected will perform better than one that isn’t and therefore we are asking UK companies to consider paying the living wage as a key indicator of a responsible and sustainable business.” Royal Mail, whose workers are appealing in court to try to strike over the Christmas period, was among the recipients of the letter. A spokesman said the “vast majority” of its employees earned more than the living wage. Hargreaves Lansdown, the FTSE-100 investment platform, said it planned to gain living wage accreditation in response to the letter, which was organised by ShareAction, a campaign group. The government-appointed Low Pay Commission on Wednesday delayed its publication of its recommendation for the national living wage, citing the purdah period ahead of the general election. Other companies who received letters were the takeaway app Just Eat, the software company Aveva, the bookmaker Flutter Entertainment, and the manufacturers Halma and Smurfit Kappa. Four of the companies had still not signed up to the living wage despite having faced investor pressure on the issue over the past year. They were IAG, which owns British Airways, the United Utilities water company, the pest control and cleaning company Rentokil Initial, and the Irish industrial group DCC. BA said all its workers were paid more than the legal minimums. Rentokil said only a small number of workers were paid below the living wage as a starting salary. United Utilities and Just Eat said all direct employees were paid the living wage. The property developer British Land said it pays all direct employees the living wage, but could not guarantee the pay rates of outsourced suppliers such as cleaning contractors.",Living wage; Royal Mail; British Airways; JD Sports Fashion; Business; Society; Poverty; Gig economy; UK news,Society
2020-04-26T05:00:05Z,A society to inspire young people? If only | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/society-inspire-young-people-if-only-letters,"As a young person in Britain, I read Will Hutton’s article with both despair and relief (“Young Britons have been hit hard. We owe them a future they can believe in”, Comment). Relief that the palpable challenges facing those maturing in the post-2008 era are being acknowledged, but despair at the pace with which our prospects continue to wither. The exceptional circumstances we face will alter the already fragile futures of young people, but what these circumstances underline is that the exception has become the norm. I have experienced the meritocratic messages given out in formal education from both sides of the fence (as a pupil and a zero-hours contracted teacher in a working-class area of Sheffield). These messages, which often continue to be sticks with which to beat young people, eventually led me to leaving teaching as I felt morally unable to promote an idea of the good life to those for whom it was unattainable. For those without pre-existing professional connections, or the intangible characteristic of “polish”, the future has been little more than zero-hours contracts, an unsustainable housing market and “low-skilled” employment opportunities for a decade and more. I welcome Hutton’s call to build a society that inspires young people, but would remind him that the “former” inequalities, both within and between generations, are very much alive. Jack Aizlewood Sheffield Will Hutton posits a poignant call to arms to save our disenfranchised youth as post-pandemic economic projections are bleak. His theory supports the importance of ethical “sustainable business models” leading to a cultural and societal hiatus, so the next generation of young people are not used as “disposable commodities”, which I fully support. He refers to “low-skilled work” but the very term is irksome, especially when the government has repeatedly equated low pay with low skill. Language can covertly reinforce the very inequality we are trying to undermine. Should we not change our view from “low-skilled” to “essential” – especially at a time when such work has become central to our survival? Jayne Sanders Sheffield Local authorities, local heroes Andrew Rawnsley discusses the future of some of our institutions after Covid-19 ends (“This crisis is stress testing the strengths and frailties of our national institutions”, Comment). He mentions the army, the BBC and of course the NHS, all of which are playing a crucial role during the crisis. He omits to mention local authorities, however. These too have come in for some consistent bashing from the Conservatives and have suffered massive budget cuts during austerity. They have been cast, in similar fashion to the civil service, as hidebound and inefficient. Now, scarcely a No 10 briefing passes without the minister praising them and saying what more he is asking them to do. Suddenly, they are vital to getting through the pandemic. Whether it’s help for rough sleepers or small businesses, they are the ones doing the work. Perhaps they too, when this is all over, will be “reminding the nation why they are essential to Britain”. Peter Curbishley Great Durnford, Salisbury Wilts Me, Jay and a gastro wedding I hate to rain on Jay Rayner’s own wedding narrative (“Blackboard menus, sanded floors, posh grub and a pint: it’s a recipe that’s served gastropubs very well”, Magazine), but…. Late January 1991 I wandered into a new London pub, the Eagle. It was empty, beyond owners David Eyre and Mike Belben, who described their intention: serious food, definitely not a restaurant, art gallery upstairs. Evidence of their cooking intent was clear, with the kitchen on show. Nice lads, I thought; good luck. A few months later I was arranging my own wedding. We had virtually no money. I remembered the conversation with the lads at the bar. Thought I would do them a favour. I phoned and said I would give them £400 with which to cook whatever they wished for the wedding meal; they could choose the wine. Bless them. It saved me having to accept my future father-in-law’s conditional offer that he’d pay for the reception so long as it was held at the Connaught Rooms. The wedding was 28 September 1991. Many years later, Mike trained my son Ivan as a chef. I see the Eagle imitated around the world. Nowhere can replicate the fusion of informality and culinary quality. Remarkably, the kitchen is as good today as ever. Jay is bang on there. Stephen Chambers London N5 Cuban car love not all it seems I always enjoy reading about the Cuban love affair with their old cars and how they pass on skills down the generations (“Take me to your Lada: Cubans’ passion for a little Russian box”, Focus). However, the cosy back-street mechanic pictures belie the desperate shortage of parts and new vehicles imposed on the Cubans by the American blockade. This is not nostalgia, but necessity. Taking the story of the Lada in Cuba out of context imposes another representative form of news blockade on the people of Cuba. Alan Hunter Somersham, Huntingdon Cambs It’s not all about forgiveness Nick Cohen says that it was unchristian of Christ to say that “to everyone who has will more be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away” (“Beware a new wave of populism, born of virus-induced inequity”, Comment). Were he to read the whole of Matthew’s gospel, from which this quote is taken, he would see that love and forgiveness are only part of Jesus’s teaching. Judgment is there also. Peter Smith Halifax Stormin’ Norman I was very sad to hear that Norman Hunter, one of the great footballing heroes of the 1960s, had succumbed to the Covid-19 virus. Norman was a role model for my generation and Jonathan Bouquet’s excellent article brought back many memories (“May I have a word”, Comment). Some years after Hunter’s heyday, when I was working in Luxembourg for one of the European institutions, we had a brilliant football match against colleagues from other institutions.

2019-11-29T07:52:30Z,"Npower to axe up to 4,500 jobs as part of major restructuring plan",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/29/npower-to-cut-up-to-4500-jobs-as-part-of-restructuring-plan,"The new owner of npower plans to cut up to 4,500 jobs from the struggling business as part of the biggest dismantling of a UK energy supplier since privatisation. Britain’s sixth-largest energy supplier will lose the majority of its 5,700 staff and eight UK offices across the country after a takeover by the German energy giant E.ON. The owner of E.ON UK will take two years to break apart npower’s energy business and let go of its staff in a £500m overhaul described as a “cruel blow” to employees in the run-up to Christmas. The restructuring will hand millions of npower customers to E.ON UK to create Britain’s second-largest energy supplier, while cutting the market’s big six incumbent energy players to five. E.ON said it is working with trade unions and staff representatives from npower’s offices and call centres in Rainton, Hull, Leeds, Birmingham, Solihull, Oldbury in Warwickshire, Worcester and Swindon to reduce the impact on staff. However, trade unions have warned that the “horrific” scale of the proposed staff cull, due to begin in the new year, would be “as bad as it gets” for the energy company’s employees. “This is a cruel blow for npower employees,” said Dave Prentis, the general secretary of the Unison union. “They’ve been worried about their jobs for months. Now their worst fears have been realised, less than a month before Christmas.” From next spring millions of npower’s home and small business customers will be handed to E.ON UK, while npower’s profitable supply arm servicing business and industrial customers will continue to operate as normal. The end of the energy market’s big six era comes after E.ON inherited npower as part of the mega-deal with rival energy giant RWE earlier this year, and was unlikely to find a buyer for the struggling business. Npower has lost millions of customers in the last four years, leading to consecutive financial losses for the troubled company. In the first nine months of the year losses deepened to €167m (£142m), from a loss of €71m in the same months last year, as customer losses accelerated to 220,000 in the last three months alone. The supplier had 3.6 million gas and electricity customer accounts at the end of September, down from four million at the start of the year and 5.4 million at the end of 2015. Michael Lewis, the chief executive of E.ON UK, said restructuring npower would help build “a sustainable business with a lower cost base that allows us to compete in this extremely challenging market”. He said: “In the last 18 months we have seen almost one third of suppliers going bust or continuing to operate at a loss. What we’re announcing today is our response to this difficult situation in order to remain sustainable.” Npower had hoped to weather the “unprecedented market challenges” by merging with SSE’s energy supply business but the deal fell apart late last year amid concerns over the credit worthiness of the planned new company. Since then, SSE has agreed to sell its supply arm to the independent energy supplier Ovo Energy in a £500m deal to create the UK’s second largest energy supplier and safeguard the jobs of almost 8,000 staff. Npower has been unable to find a new buyer despite efforts to cut costs and reduce staff. Unison’s Prentis said npower’s woes provided a “powerful case” for the big six energy firms to be renationalised, a plan put forward by Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour party’s election manifesto. “The UK energy market is in real danger of collapse,” Prentis said. “If nothing is done, there could soon be other casualties. Npower’s demise means there’s no time to waste. It makes the powerful case for bringing the retail arms of the big six energy firms into public ownership. This would preserve jobs, ensure customers get a better deal and allow the UK to meet its carbon neutral targets.”",RWE npower; Energy industry; Business; Utilities; UK news; Job losses; Trade unions; Unison; E.ON,Business
2019-11-11T14:20:07Z,"British Steel to be sold to Chinese firm in deal that could save 4,000 jobs",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/british-steel-rescue-deal-jingye-scunthorpe-jobs,"British Steel is to be sold to the Chinese firm Jingye, the UK government has announced, in a deal that prevents the closure of the company’s Scunthorpe site and could safeguard 4,000 jobs. Jingye and the government’s official receiver signed a sales contract on Monday, with a formal deal subject to regulatory approvals as well as consultations with employees over new job offers. The deal was worth about £50m, a person close to the talks said. An announcement on the Insolvency Service’s website said Jingye’s new UK subsidiaries had agreed to “acquire the business and assets of British Steel Ltd”. As well as the main site in Scunthorpe, the contract also includes mills in Teesside and Skinningrove and subsidiaries in Workington, the Netherlands and France. Jingye is planning to invest about £1.2bn in British Steel over the next decade, including upgrading, lowering emissions and improving energy efficiency. In a statement, Jingye said it “anticipates making offers to as many employees across the business as possible”. A person with knowledge of Jingye’s plans said no guarantees could be given before the deal was formally closed. British Steel collapsed into liquidation in May, with orders under pressure from intense global competition as well as difficulties caused by Brexit. The official receiver took over the running of the business from the investment firm Greybull Capital while a buyer was sought. Jingye’s move for British Steel came after talks fell through between the official receiver and Ataer Holding, a subsidiary of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak. Jingye’s chairman and founder, Li Ganpo, has spent the past week in Scunthorpe, home of British Steel’s steelworks, in talks with government officials, trade unions and local politicians. The Chinese conglomerate, which also has hotel and retail interests, produces about 15m tonnes of steel a year in China and it plans to expand internationally. Jingye pledged to invest in “identifying new markets and products” for British Steel. Li said: “We know that this is only the start of the hard work of revitalising British Steel. But we believe that this combination will create a powerful, profitable and sustainable business that will ensure the long-term future of thousands of jobs while producing the innovative high-quality steel products that the world needs.” The formal sale process could take months more to complete, although it is understood to be much further advanced than talks with Ataer before they collapsed. Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of the Unite trade union, welcomed the end of anxiety for steelworkers and their families but cautioned that the union was seeking assurances on jobs. He said: “There have been a series of false dawns in finding a buyer for British Steel and Unite will not be raising any false hopes without seeing detailed plans for the entire business and the ink is dry on the contracts.” Labour’s Nic Dakin, the MP for Scunthorpe, said he had been impressed by Li’s knowledge of the steelmaking industry. He also welcomed Jingye’s pledge to invest. “This is a highly skilled and able workforce that has kept this business going selling steel,” he said. “The new owner would be wise to treasure the workforce going forward.” However, the government faced criticism for allowing the sale of one of the UK’s industrial assets – a major supplier to the British railways – to a Chinese company. China has repeatedly been accused of dumping cheap steel in order to dominate the global industry. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport minister who sits in the House of Lords, said Conservative governments had resisted measures to tackle steel dumping, before allowing a Chinese firm to buy it for “a pittance”. An industry source suggested that a £50m price tag equated to little more than the working capital contained within the business. Sam Gyimah, the former Conservative party MP who is now Liberal Democrat shadow business secretary, said the deal represented Britain “being overtaken by rising economic powers”.",British Steel; Steel industry; Business; UK news,Business
2019-12-12T01:37:40Z,Queensland school runs out of water as commercial bottlers harvest local supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/queensland-school-water-commercial-bottlers-tamborine-mountain,"The Tamborine Mountain state school has run out of water, even as water miners in the Gold Coast hinterland are sending millions of litres to commercial bottling operations. Trucks sent by the Queensland government carrying emergency supplies to the school, including Mount Tamborine bottled water, have been passing trucks heading in the opposite direction taking local water to bottling plants for beverage giants such as Coca-Cola. The school remains open but parents have been advised by teachers to consider keeping their children at home. Water miners in the Mount Tamborine area supply roughly 130m litres of water each year to commercial bottling operations. Now the local bores are running dry. “I was staggered,” one local resident, Craig Peters, told Guardian Australia. “It was more or less the final straw for me. The school’s bore is 50 metres deep and has never ever had these issues before.” “We had an award ceremony at the school yesterday and earlier in the day [the school] sent out an SMS about the water situation. “At the conclusion of that ceremony they said give serious consideration to not sending kids to school for the rest of the week because of the lack of water. “The school bore has been operating since the school was there. There’s many other bores that have run dry. We are the largest community in Australia that doesn’t have reticulated water. If it doesn’t rain, people get water trucked in to fill their tanks. “Now the government is buying water back from Coca-Cola to bring here, which is where it came from in the first place.” The education department said it would continue to deliver water to the school until the end of the school holidays. Residents said the situation was a tipping point and would concentrate longstanding concern that the local water supply should be prioritised above the three commercial operations, which between them have approvals to send roughly 2.5m litres a week down the mountain. The situation seems to fall into a regulatory void, with no mechanism to halt commercial operations in times of severe drought or ensure that local water is allocated to locals. Peters said the community wanted the state’s natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, to use emergency powers to prioritise local supply. Lynham said in a statement he understood the concerns of residents and the impact of the drought on their water supply. “As I have previously said, groundwater is not regulated on Mount Tamborine and so my department does not have the power to limit take. “I do have the power to limit take in a declared water shortage – but that is everyone’s take, including local farmers, households, and businesses.” “QUT research says levels of groundwater extraction are equivalent to less than five per cent of average annual groundwater recharge. “Of that five per cent, farmers use almost 84 per cent of the extracted groundwater for horticulture, households almost 11 per cent, and bottled water operations, about five per cent.” The Scenic Rim council has responsibility for monitoring the commercial water miners and ensuring they comply with their development conditions. In September the Scenic Rim mayor, Greg Christensen, tabled a mayoral minute that raised concern about the situation. It said authorities had no legal recourse to prioritise local supply in times of drought. “Council is aware that local water carriers are expressing concerns that the supply of water for household delivery on Tamborine Mountain is reduced, and with no rain predicted soon, may become critical,” Christensen said. “Additional water supplies (bores) are being sought to supplement existing supplies to cope with increased demand. Any commercial water extractor on the mountain is doing so in the context of relevant approvals and therefore a legitimate use. “There is no legal recourse for council to require water suppliers to provide additional water for local use. Once a development has been approved, it may continue to conduct the use indefinitely as approved.” Past studies have pointed to negligible impacts from groundwater extraction operations, and that the water table can replenish itself through rainfall. But Peters – who supplies water from his property for local consumption – said the situation had changed. The drought, which dried out nearby Gondwana rainforest that burned in spring bushfires, has bitten hard. “The water patterns have changed,” Peters said. “What might have potentially been a sustainable business at one point in time, that’s no longer sustainable.”",Water; Drought; Bushfires; Queensland; Coca-Cola; Australia news; World news; Environment,Environment
2020-02-05T15:04:59Z,"Choose vintage, avoid stretch: how to wear jeans sustainably",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/05/choose-vintage-avoid-stretch-how-to-wear-jeans-sustainably,"Why are jeans so controversial? Is it the estimated 10,000 litres of water needed to grow the cotton for every pair? The dark blue lines of toxic pollution in China’s Pearl River that can be seen from space? The potassium permanganate, widely used to make new jeans look old and distressed, that may cause lung damage in workers? Or is it because there is no guarantee that those workers are paid a living wage, never mind being paid for the overtime they are forced to do? “The denim industry is at a pivotal moment,” says Roian Atwood, senior director of global sustainable business at Kontoor Brands, which owns Wrangler and Lee, when we met at ART (Alter Repair Transform), a denim upcycling and mending workshop at the Copenhagen international fashion fair (CIFF) last month. Lee are among the 30 brands contributing to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Jeans Redesign project, a new initiative governing all aspects of jean production from regeneratively farmed fibres to washing and finishing techniques – potassium permanganate, for example, is not allowed. Jeans must be made with rivets and hardware that can easily be removed after the jeans are no longer fit for purpose, allowing them to be recycled into something new. The first products bearing the Jeans Redesign logo will go on sale in the autumn. The industry is working hard to make itself cleaner and more sustainable, investing in new technology such as the innovative dry foam to dye Lee’s Indigood jeans – the use of water is pretty much eliminated, as well as reducing energy and chemicals and hopefully ending the rivers of toxic blue effluent. Already in operation at three denim mills in Spain, Mexico and India, Lee is also launching “compostable” jeans this spring. “They will fully decompose,” says Atwood. “We believe it will take 200 days.” There is still a long way to go. According to Atwood, there is “a new and emerging environmental issue we are not quite ready to talk about yet, which is that denim has become integrated with a lot of synthetics. The comfort and the stretch movement, athleisure and the omnipresence of the yoga pant have given rise to a lot more stretch in denim. It’s plastic,” he says. And as such, your skinny jeans are responsible for shedding microplastics. Appropriately enough, we meet in the “confessional booth” designed for visitors to confess their fashion sins and record them for a podcast. “If we are confessing our sins, I am here to say I like to wear light jeans,” he says. “A dark pair of denim uses less water in the wash-down process.” The lighter the denim, the more washing processes it has been through and the more water it has used. The designer Duran Lantink, who was commissioned to work with Lee’s deadstock to create a small collection of upcycled denim, wears jeans every day (he switches between two vintage pairs) but is aware of the issues. “I think that, by buying a pre-washed jean, it is ruin in reverse,” he says. “I don’t get that.” Lantink is part of a growing band of designers who are not just concerned about the environmental impact of the industry but also its waste. Bethany Williams, who has perfected the art of unpicking and upcycling unwanted jeans, has grown a cult following. Brands such as E.L.V. Denim (short for East London Vintage), which is sold at a range of stockists including Net-a-Porter, are building healthy businesses using secondhand denim as their raw material. “There are more jeans than people in the world,” says founder Anna Foster. At her studio and showroom, clients can choose from off-the-peg or custom-made jeans, ingeniously spliced together a few miles away at the Blackhorse Lane Ateliers in Walthamstow. But slowing down production is not on the agenda for the big denim brands, who would prefer to cut their environmental impact by reducing water and chemical consumption while continuing to produce at the same levels. However, there are some smart and potentially highly disruptive initiatives coming from smaller independents. Netherlands-based Mud Jeans offers a subscription system that allows you to lease your jeans for €7.50 per month, including free repairs. Once you are finished with your jeans, you send them back and they will be recycled. Hiut Jeans, which has revitalised the denim industry in Cardigan, Wales, makes just 100 pairs of jeans per week. “We are here to try and make the best jeans we can and not the most jeans we can,” it says. It also offer free repairs for life. How to shop sustainably for jeans Start with vintage Whether you are a denim aficionado or a student on a budget, you can find jeans to suit your budget and your style if you shop secondhand. Raw is best Raw denim hasn’t been washed and treated multiple times. This is what denim used to look like before we started to sandblast, bleach and rip it to make it look old. Buy a pair of unwashed jeans and let them age with you. Avoid stretch Let leggings be leggings and jeans be jeans. One hundred per cent means the denim in your jeans can eventually be recycled. Look at the label If you are buying new, check the fabric composition. You might want to do some research online first. Look for recycled cotton, GOTS certified organic cotton, Better Cotton Initiative cotton, or G-Star’s Cradle 2 Cradle Gold certification, which means it is 98% recyclable, 100% organic and uses the minimum amount of water. Wash cold, if at all One of the biggest sources of water impact and energy use is during the consumer use phase. Roian Atwood advises a cold wash. Hiut Denim has a No Wash Club. Repair your jeans A good pair of jeans can last for decades if you look after them and repair them. Ask your denim brand where you can have your jeans repaired. Levi’s has a number of tailor shops where you can customise or repair jeans. Nudie Jeans offers free repairs for life in their shops or, if you can’t get to one, they will send you a free repair kit.

2019-10-22T11:00:59Z,Homecare agencies are at breaking point. Reform is long overdue | David Brindle,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/22/homecare-agencies-breaking-point-reform-fix-care-system,"The face of social care is changing. The steady shift away from looking after older people in residential care to supporting more of them at home is shrinking the care home sector and growing the domiciliary care market. In London, the number of homecare agencies now exceeds the number of care homes for the first time. This would be a more welcome trend if we could have greater confidence in the quality of homecare services. Although the Care Quality Commission rates 82% of agencies in England as “good”, and a further 4% “outstanding”, there is widespread anecdotal evidence of rushed or missed visits and a constant churn of care workers. According to official estimates, 50% of the domiciliary workforce is on zero-hours contracts and annual staff turnover is 44%, with one in 10 jobs unfilled at any one time. Care agencies say they cannot improve workers’ pay and conditions, and improve turnover, because most councils do not pay them enough to do so. The UK Homecare Association (UKHA), which represents the sector, says only one in seven councils pays care providers a contract price that is enough to run a sustainable business and meet minimum wage obligations: a price it puts at £18.93 an hour, allowing for 55p profit. Now the association has a cause celebre. In August, Walsall council moved to a system of paying for homecare by the minute. While this is not unique – one leading national agency reckons that about one in six of its contracts is paid on this basis, using electronic monitoring of care visits – Walsall was already one of the lowest-paying councils. Its current rate is believed to be £14.33 an hour, £4.60 below the UKHA’s benchmark. Local agencies warned that the change would imperil a fragile system. Sure enough, the regional Express &amp; Star newspaper recently reported that the council had written to its contracted agencies saying it had 70 unallocated cases on its books, “putting at risk vulnerable service users”, and pleading with the agencies to pick them up. The UKHA has since made a freedom of information request to Walsall, demanding the rationale for what it describes as an “irresponsible” change of payment system. Under the new approach, the association claims, homecare visits lasting longer than 20 minutes are paid by the minute, shorter “check” calls are paid a flat rate, but visits briefer than eight minutes are not paid at all. A care worker who finds that a householder is out, or that they decline a service, perhaps because they have a visitor, appears to trigger no payment. Walsall, which is Conservative-led, says the changes were made within the terms of agencies’ existing contracts. “The underlying objective is to ensure that public funds are only spent on care that is actually delivered to service users in accordance with their assessed care needs.” Since it alerted agencies to the 70 unallocated cases, it says, the number “has now considerably reduced”. Booked calls are paid a flat rate in the event of “cancellation” by the householder with less than 24 hours’ notice. There was general dismay at the absence of any concrete proposals on social care in last week’s Queen’s speech setting out the government’s programme. Hopes of a breakthrough had risen, with speculation that a white paper or even a bill would be announced to take forward what the prime minister had described as “a clear plan we have prepared”, but all that emerged was a vague pledge to “bring forward proposals to reform adult social care in England to ensure dignity in old age”. In December, it will be 1,000 days since we were first promised a green paper setting out options for reform. What is happening in Walsall reminds us that if and when reform proposals do appear, they must address the broken system in its entirety and not just provide a fix to enable people needing care to avoid having to sell their homes to pay for it. • David Brindle is the Guardian’s public services editor",Social care; Society; Care workers; Care Quality Commission (CQC); Regulators; Health; Politics; UK news,Society
2019-07-17T20:41:00Z,R&A chief executive refuses to condone or condemn Portrush march,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/17/portrush-march-open-championship-martin-slumbers-golf,"The R&amp;A has refused to condemn a “celebration of marching bands” which is staging a three-hour show in Portrush on Saturday before marching to an Orange hall. Much has been made of the inclusive nature of this Open championship, which is the first to be held in Northern Ireland since 1951 because of the political and religious troubles. But when the Guardian asked Martin Slumbers, the chief executive of the R&amp;A, whether he felt uneasy that a parade of marching bands including the Sons of Ulster would send the wrong message, he sidestepped the question – and pointed out that there were always things going on around the tournament that were “wonderful”. “We are very conscious that the Open comes to town once every X years,” said Slumbers. “We are very conscious that we are guests here. We’re guests every year at the place we go. As guests we are very conscious that we want to be part of the community. But we will be gone in a couple of weeks. And so we want to live with the community. And every year since I’ve been here, there’s always things on around the golf. And that’s wonderful. And the community carries on. Our job is to put on the Open Championship and to respect the fact that we are guests.” However, the march was criticised by Conn Connolly, owner of the tourist firm Real Irish Golf, who called it an “unnecessary provocation”. He said: “Broadly my view would be that the Open coming to Portrush is a celebration of the fact that Northern Ireland has changed in ways we all know over 20 years. “In many ways it is coming because sectarianism on both sides has wilted and we have moved on. For me it’s an unnecessary provocation to have an Orange parade right in the middle of this. 12 July was last week. This is sticking a finger in the eye of the people who had brought this to Portrush.” Meanwhile Slumbers has hinted the R&amp;A may rename the Women’s British Open the Women’s Open Championship when it takes full control of the event next year. “That’s something we are considering very carefully,” he said. “We’ll be announcing something in due course.” However he was less forthcoming when asked whether he could foresee a time where there will be equal prize money between men and women. “To build the economics of the Women’s British Open, to be able to keep raising the prize money, we need to do it as a sustainable business model,” he added.",The Open 2019; Northern Ireland; The Open; US sports; European Tour; PGA Tour; Golf; UK news; Sport,Sport
2019-06-20T23:01:29Z,Energy consumers face £172m bill for collapse of 11 suppliers,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/21/energy-consumers-face-172m-bill-for-collapse-of-11-suppliers,"Energy consumers will be forced to foot a £172m bill to cover the cost of the collapse of 11 energy suppliers since the start of last year. Citizens Advice said almost 30 million households will need to bail out the bust energy suppliers through their bills, while 32,000 may also be targeted aggressively by debt collectors hired by their administrators. The charity said it has helped more than a thousand consumers left “distressed and anxious” by the collapse of their supplier because administrators are not bound by the same consumer protection laws as typical collection agencies. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Consumers shouldn’t have to foot the multimillion pound bill left behind when companies collapse – and they certainly shouldn’t lose their usual protections in the process.” Citizens Advice has called on the government to close the gap between the protections offered to customers of live energy suppliers and those who have gone bust. It has also urged Ofgem to limit the cost of future supplier failures. “It must act now,” Guy said. Ofgem has overseen the spiralling multimillion pound hit for bill payers by spreading the unpaid cost of renewable energy and grid upgrades across the energy market when a supplier goes under. Under its “safety net” procedure it hands the customers of a failed energy company to another supplier before reclaiming the unpaid costs via energy bills. Energy UK, the industry’s trade group, said the regulator was forced to use this process “more than ever expected” after lowering the minimum standards for new energy suppliers to encourage more competition for the big six incumbent suppliers. Ofgem said earlier this year that it plans to stress test prospective energy suppliers to make sure they are financially fit to provide an essential service before granting them a supply licence. “The increase in competition and the number of suppliers in recent years have been great for customers in providing choice and driving down prices,” Energy UK said. “But we welcome Ofgem bringing in tougher checks for suppliers entering and operating in the market to ensure they have sustainable business models and are adequately financed to serve their customers.”",Energy bills; Household bills; Energy industry; Business; Consumer affairs; Money; Consumer rights; Ofgem,Money
2019-10-21T17:32:55Z,"Up to 12,000 Asda workers could lose jobs amid contract row",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/21/up-to-12000-asda-workers-risk-losing-their-jobs-amid-contract-row,"Up to 12,000 Asda workers could lose their jobs next week, according to union officials, if they refuse to sign up to a new contract that will hit pay and benefits for thousands of workers. The deal increases basic hourly pay but ends paid breaks, cuts premium pay on most bank holidays and reduces the number of hours rated as better-paid night shifts. The contracts, which will apply to more than 100,000 of hourly-paid staff, also forces workers to accept variable shifts between 8am and 10pm and to switch between departments as required. In August, the company told staff if they did not sign up to the new deal they would leave the business on 2 November. The deal has been nicknamed the “Martini contract” after the drink’s 1970s advertising slogan “any time, any place, anywhere”. The pay changes come after Asda group’s profits rose by 13% to £805m last year, while payouts to directors increased to £12m from £9.5m the year before. Neil Derrick, the regional secretary of the GMB union, said: “Workers can be asked to work wherever, whenever including bank holidays. The flexibility and lack of certainty about when they are working, that’s the killer. “Asda has recruited a workforce saying ‘come to us we are family-friendly business’ and this contract has driven a coach and horses through that.” Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, has claimed in a letter to Asda’s chief executive, Roger Burnley, that approximately 2,700 staff would lose up to £500 per year as a result of the changes, with a further 300 hit even harder. But the GMB believes at least 6,000 staff could be financially worse off out of 118,000 Asda store staff it says are on hourly pay. Gary Carter, the GMB national officer, has written to Asda asking it to postpone the contract change and ensure there were no dismissals through negotiations with the union. “On 2 November, we understand up to 12,000 of your loyal Asda workers will be given the sack – just before Christmas. That cannot be right,” he wrote. McDonagh described the move by Asda as “shameful”. The MP said: “Of course I welcome any increase in basic pay, but I am completely appalled that such a major high street retailer would use this as a smokescreen to slash the terms and conditions for thousands of their most loyal staff, triggering the redundancy of even more.” She added: “What an utterly shameful way to treat so many longstanding employees who have given decades of dedication and hard work.” Asda says 95% of its hourly paid staff will be financially better off under the new contract. It has agreed to top up wages until mid-2021 for those losing out under the new deal. The new contract increases the base pay rate for shop workers from £8.21 to £9 an hour, excluding premiums based on location or for special skills such as bakery. It also maintains existing benefits including an annual bonus, share save scheme and staff discount. Asda says festive bank holidays of Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day will continue to be “voluntary” with pay at double time. The company says the new contracts represent an investment of more than £80m and are not about cost cuts. An Asda spokesperson said: “We have been clear that we don’t want any of our colleagues to leave us and while the vast majority of colleagues have chosen to sign the new contract, we continue to have conversations with those who have chosen not to, to try to understand their concerns. “It is vital that we make sure we are prepared to adapt to the demands of our market. Change is never easy but we are determined that Asda remains a sustainable business for its customers and colleagues – now and in the future.” Asda’s contract change reflects similar alterations at rival supermarkets, which have offset increases in basic wages – partly driven by the annual increase in the legal minimum wage – by removing other perks. Competition for workers, amid high-profile efforts by the fast-growing grocery discounters Aldi and Lidl to pay more than the legal minimum, have prompted traditional supermarkets to increase their basic pay. Sainsbury’s eliminated paid breaks but increased the base level of pay last year. Tesco ditched its annual bonus but pledged to increase hourly pay over the next two years to £9.30, up from £8.40.",Asda; Supermarkets; Business; Trade unions; Aldi; Tesco; Lidl; UK news; Politics; Retail industry,Business
2019-08-22T03:10:09Z,Asic to ban or restrict investment products which lose customers $2bn a year,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/asic-to-ban-or-restrict-investment-products-which-lose-customers-2bn-a-year,"The corporate regulator says it will ban or restrict the sale of two exotic investment products that cost customers almost $2bn a year. Using new product intervention powers gained in April, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission wants to ban the sale of binary options to ordinary Australians for 18 months – the maximum period allowed under the law. It also plans to dramatically reduce the amount of leverage allowed on contracts for difference, or “spread betting”, from as much as 500 to one to as little as two to one. Firms will also be banned from allowing clients to get into a position where they owe the company money. A binary option is a bet on whether a share price or other financial indicator will go up or down while a contract for difference involves picking both the direction and size of the movement. There are 65 firms offering one or both of the products licensed in Australia, including the London-listed IG Markets and CMC Markets, US giant FXCM and home-grown outfit Pepperstone. Despite their exotic nature, the products are heavily promoted through a network of introducers and through internet advertising including on dating sites. They are extremely popular with retail investors. Asic data released on Thursday shows that about a third of investors in binary options or CFDs have an income of less than $37,000 a year. Investors lose about $490m a year on binary options and about $1.5bn a year on CFDs, according to Asic data. The Australian market has also more than doubled in size, from about 450,000 clients to about 1 million over the past two years as other countries, including the UK, Israel and much of the EU, have banned or restricted the products. “Only 17% of the clients of these products are in Australia,” Asic commissioner Cathie Armour told Guardian Australia. “We are concerned about the fact that 62% of the clients are located in Asia, the biggest proportion of that in China. “The Chinese regulators are very clear in our conversations with them that people in China are prohibited from trading in what we call contracts for difference.” The high leverage in CFD products means that a bad move in the market can result in an investor not only losing all the money they have deposited with the provider but also end up owing it substantial amounts of money. “We have seen a number of complaints from people who didn’t realise the funding costs and found themselves facing significant debts,” Armour said. It is the second time Asic has said it wants to use its new banning powers since they were introduced in April – in July it said it wanted to ban payday lending products that can result in charges of up to 990% of the amount loaned. Under the new laws, Asic is required to consult with industry before banning or restricting products. Armour said CFDs could be a good investment for some people, and downplayed the idea companies offering them might be driven out of business. “We think they can have a good and effective business if they operate under the adjustments we’re proposing here,” she said. “Happy customers … help contribute to a really sustainable business.” The consultation closes on 1 October.",Business; Business; Australia news; Corporate governance,Australia news

The supermarket chain said it was responding to changes in customers’ habits, including a shift towards using the larger Metro stores for convenience shopping rather than large weekly food shops. It is also facing tough competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are continuing to open new shops. But Labour said the cuts indicated that the government was not doing enough to alleviate the burden on traditional shops and prevent the high street being “hollowed out”. According to the British Retail Consortium the number of people employed in retail is down 72,000 on a year ago. In a statement on its website, Tesco said the job cuts were part of an effort to “simplify and reduce processes and administrative tasks” across all of its Metro stores. “The changes in our Metro stores will be focused on better tailoring them to how our customers shop,” it said. “The Metro format was originally designed for larger, weekly shops, but today nearly 70% of customers use them as convenience stores, buying food for that day.” It said it could cut staff numbers because it had found simpler ways of stacking shelves that meant there was less need to store stock in backrooms, while it also wanted to simplify store management structures and introduce more flexible working hours. Tesco will also reduce opening hours in 134 of its 1,750 smaller neighbourhood Express stores, where footfall is lower. Jason Tarry, the supermarket’s UK and Ireland boss, said: “In a challenging, evolving retail environment, with increasing cost pressures, we have to continue to review the way we run our stores to ensure we reflect the way our customers are shopping and do so in the most efficient way. “We do not take any decision which impacts colleagues lightly, but have to make sure we remain relevant for customers and operate a sustainable business now and in the future.” The retailer, which has more than 300,000 UK employees and more than 3,400 stores, said earlier this year it could cut 9,000 jobs, although it hoped to redeploy up to half into other customer service roles. Fishmonger, butcher and baker jobs at the retailer were expected to be at risk, along with counter staff. The cuts at Tesco are part of plans by the chief executive, Dave Lewis, to slash £1.5bn from Tesco’s cost base. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business minister, said: “These job cuts add to the growing tally over the last 18 months. Hundreds of thousands of jobs and our communities rely on our high streets but the Tories are allowing them to be hollowed out. “The government must urgently act to save Britain’s high streets and prevent even more jobs being lost.” She said Labour would breathe new life into the high street with five policies including free bus travel for under-25s on improved bus services, free public wifi in town centres, measures to end ATM charges and stem bank and Post Office closures. She also promised annual revaluations of business rates and registers of landlords who own empty shops.",Tesco; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Business; Redundancy; UK news,Business
2019-12-13T11:00:43Z,The Upside's best things that happened in 2019,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/13/the-best-things-that-happened-in-2019,"How’s it been for you? Annus horribilis or golden year? We’d love to hear from Upside fans about their 2019: what was the best thing that happened? The funniest thing you witnessed? The very best joke? The most promising dab of progress that you came across? Anything that made it good to feel alive? Email us at the usual address (theupside@theguardian.com). We’ll showcase a sample in next week’s festive edition, the last newsletter of the year. The best email wins a hole punch. For us, the most positive things of 2019 included: • The school strikes and mounting awareness of the climate emergency. • The fact that more people voted in elections than ever before. • The sudden awareness of the power of the tree. • The great progress in the battle against Aids and malaria. • The growing consumer backlash against environmental waste. • The cautious optimism about ketamine as a treatment for psychological disorders. • The numbers of companies successfully experimenting with four-day working weeks. • Upsider responses to our requests for unsung heroes – we will publish this as an alternative honours list between Christmas and new year. As for this week, an eclectic flurry of uplifting journalism, including: • Why Dutch prisons are so empty. Three-minute read. • A room with a view (to a career in journalism). One-minute read. • Young women take over Finnish government. Even shorter. • A new country for the Pacific? Ninety-second read. • The town giving families $500 a month. Two-minute read. Lucky numbers The world will be 1C cooler by mid-century than it would have been had ozone-damaging CFCs not been banned under the 1987 Montreal protocol. So it IS possible … Oh, and as pointed out by Beautiful News, everything that kills children is in decline. What we liked In a week, a year, a decade of division, kudos to the BBC’s Crossing Divides series, which found 10 reasons why Brits are actually not that divided. We also liked this New York Times piece about people hosting recently released prisoners to give them a stable re-entry into civilian life. What we heard Our recent piece on biochar generated a prodigious response from you lot. New Yorker Miguel Hoffman wrote in from El Salvador: Biochar can be a wonderful component to a climate change mitigation program. However, it does not make sense, as some would suggest, to grow, kill and then char trees. So, we ask, what other sources could be pyrolysed and charred? The answer just might be at our fingertips and within reach all over the impoverished world. Throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America, stagnant or semi-stagnant lakes, lagoons, canals and reservoirs have become home to massive and persistent infestations of the beautiful violet flowering plant the floating water hyacinth. Why does it reproduce at such great velocity? Because nature assigned it a double role: to suction every type of contaminant in its midst and to absorb all the carbon dioxide it possibly can. Essentially, its purpose in this world is to decontaminate waterways and decarbonise the atmosphere. Not bad for such a maligned “pest”! There is an added bonus to the water hyacinth. The plant has high levels of cellulose, oils and lipids and low level of lignin. The cellulose, oils and lipids are the components for biofuels. The low level of lignin makes the other components accessible for production of a perfect substitute for fossil fuels. Cyrus Forouhar wrote in on a recently revived laptop: I have an idea for what should be covered: The short lifespan of smartphones and laptops that invariably end up in a tip because manufacturers make it hard, or very expensive, to change batteries and carry out repairs, in the expectation that consumers will throw them away and upgrade to the latest offering. Case in point: I have a five-year-old MacBook that was reborn when Apple fitted a new (and expensive) battery. I am pretty sure that in a few years when I have to change the battery again, I will not be able to find a replacement anywhere and a perfectly good machine will end up in a council dump, a huge and unnecessary waste of materials and resources. We need to dramatically slow down strip mining the planet to produce new shiny gadgets. And Bev Colgan from the western US got in touch early with her Christmas wish: Hello Upside Santa, What I would like from you this year is to free up a few elves to start a project that gives low- or no-cost loans and knowhow to people in working-class neighbourhoods like mine for little solar projects. We have so much sun out here in the western US! And here in my neighbourhood are plenty of people who have the skills to build a solar car port to charge an electric car, or install a few solar panels to heat a garage/workshop in the winter, or put in an a solar-powered attic exhaust fan. But they, and I, don’t have the extra couple thousand bucks to pay for materials, or any clue, really, about how to successfully set about it. And most of my neighbours believe that solar is very expensive and only for the rich people. I’d love for your elves to do a successful pilot project and then watch the ripple effect. Saving the planet – and money – is always good news. Finally, Dieter Lehmkuhl wrote in from Berlin: I just read your article Good company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit. Maybe you also might want to cover, if you haven’t done yet, the economy of the common good (Gemeinwohl-Ökonomie), which is a concept worthwhile to consider as an ethical and sustainable business.

2019-09-28T23:05:21Z,British manufacturing: back in fashion,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/29/fashion-designer-patrick-grant-social-enterprise-community-clothing,"This year has seen more than its fair share of unwelcome headlines, yet one from September will have resonated with fashion designer Patrick Grant more than most. “UK factory output dives to seven-year low,” came the news, off the back of a snapshot taken from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (the body that the Treasury relies on for early warning signs affecting the British economy). It confirmed what we all know: that the British manufacturing industry is in dire straits. But for Grant it will have served as a reminder of the importance of his Community Clothing initiative. Established in 2016, it was designed to be a lifeline to the fashion manufacturing workforce in the UK, addressing and maximising the capacity of British factories. The idea first came to Grant when he bought his own factory in Blackburn and looked at how it was operating. “What was really clear was that it needed good, steady work that it could do in the periods when it was quiet.” The concept is elementary in its essence. Grant wants to turn the quiet periods on the factory floor – where employees have nothing to do or, in worst cases, are laid off until the work starts to pick up again – into an efficient use of time. To do this, he has created a brand (also called Community Clothing) that produces timeless wardrobe staples for both men and women for which he’s certain there will be an ongoing demand. “We deliberately call it clothing because my opinion is that fashion has become a grim place. With everything we know about the badness of fast fashion, it’s becoming difficult to wear things with any lasting joy.” Grant calls it “a social enterprise” which has three aims: to make great clothes that are sustainable, affordable and well made; to create and sustain quality jobs in towns that were once alive with clothing-manufacturing activity; and to restore civic pride in communities and consumers. After introducing it to his own factory, where he employs 38 people from the local area, Community Clothing now works with 25 factories and suppliers in the UK and has created more than 124,000 hours of skilled work, which is paid at the National Living Wage. “The idea that simple, manufactured goods need to be made in low-labour-cost countries is no longer valid because automation and technology have changed the game. We won’t return to the industrial economy of the past, where we had 1.5 million people making this stuff, but we could create a serious number of sustainable jobs. Engineers to run advanced manufacturing equipment, IT specialists to create the software that runs all this – it’s not necessarily people who know how to make clothes.” At £22 for a T-shirt and £39 for a sweater, he can keep it cheap by not spending money where brands traditionally do. This means direct-to-consumer retailing and no seasonal collections. Last year the brand spent just £428 on marketing, which is where large portions of the profit usually get eaten up. The community is expanding. You’ll find fabrics spun in Dukinfield, knitted in Leicester, sewn in Blackburn, printed in Blackpool, finished in Burnley (the list goes on), while jumpers are made in Hawick and scarves in Ayrshire. Former factory employees in Tredegar in south Wales, who lost their jobs when all six of the local factories closed, have been recruited to make a new line of underwear in time for Christmas. If they sell well, Grant is committed to employing more of their former colleagues. “We think we can create 5,000 jobs in the next 10 to 15 years if we are successful.” Employees are embracing the initiative. “In our factory, everyone sees this as a solution,” says Grant. “They are supportive and thankful we are creating a sustainable business route. The UK has turned its nose up at factory work, but the truth is most people who work in the factories love it. There is a great camaraderie. There is pride.” It’s not just about existing workers, but future proofing, too. “There aren’t the same number of people trained to do what we need, so we need to create a separate stream in schools that takes care of those who aren’t naturally academically minded. If we make manufacturing cool and sexy, people will want to do it and for many it will be far more rewarding than struggling through a uni degree that doesn’t really lead anywhere,” says Grant. “It’s basically about setting different objectives,” he continues. “That’s what is exciting about social enterprise: it’s not about creating riches for already rich people, it’s about a new set of constituents and serving the community, serving employees and making customers feel good about doing something that has been forgotten for a long time.” Now that’s a headline we can get on board with.

2019-07-30T09:52:30Z,Centrica boss to step down as energy firm posts first-half losses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/30/british-gas-owner-centrica-loss-iain-conn,"Iain Conn has agreed to step down as chief executive of Centrica, the owner of British Gas, after the energy company swung to a loss for the first half of the year and slashed shareholder payouts. The embattled energy boss said he would retire from the board by next year’s annual general meeting, five years after taking the reins of the company in 2015. The former BP executive has faced increasing pressure to step down after a steady decline in the company’s market value, which is now a quarter of what it was when Conn took the top job. Since then Britain’s biggest energy supplier has lost over 1m customer accounts and made thousands of job cuts as part of a plan to steady the company. Conn said he had “agreed with the board that this is the right thing to do” after “months of talks” over the company’s future. He announced his departure alongside worse-than-expected financial results for the first half of the year, and a “deeply regrettable” dividend cut for investors. Centrica’s shareholders, which include about 600,000 individual investors, will receive less than half the expected return after the company slashed its interim dividend by 58% to 1.5p a share. It said the full-year dividend total will also be cut by 58%, from 12p to 5p a share. The company’s share share price plunged 19% on Tuesday to 77p, the lowest in more than 20 years, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The company announced its lowest dividend in 15 years less than four months after revealing it had handed Conn a 44% pay rise for 2018 to £2.4m. The hike in pay angered trade unions and was awarded despite a difficult year in which the company imposed two bill increases, warned on profits and announced 4,000 job cuts. Conn said he had reinvested most of his bonus payouts in the company while he worked to shift Centrica’s traditional energy business towards selling energy services and devices. Many City analysts are unconvinced that the plan can bear fruit after a series of disappointing financial results for Centrica in recent years. The company posted a pretax loss of £569m for the six months to 30 June compared with a profit of £415m last year. Centrica blamed an “exceptionally challenging” environment in the first half of 2019, including the government price cap on standard energy tariffs and additional pension contributions. The swing to a pretax loss is the latest blow to the owner of Britain’s biggest energy supplier which was already planning to sell its nuclear, oil and gas business units to pay off debts and cut thousands of jobs from its shrinking workforce. “It has been an exceptionally challenging first half with some really difficult circumstances,” Conn said. “Our results were weak.” The group took a pretax charge of £346m in the first half. This included £257m of restructuring costs, £64m one-off pension costs and asset writedowns of nearly £90m, partly due to the fall in near-term gas prices. But Conn said the company “has momentum” which should see a return to growth in the second half of the year and into 2020. Although British Gas lost 178,000 UK home energy supply accounts in the first half, the figures mark a slowdown in losses compared with recent years because its prices are more competitive and its brand remains strong, Conn said. He said Centrica’s new deal with Ford to provide electric vehicle tariffs and charge points was an example of “where we are moving to” in the future. Centrica plans to exit oil and gas production to focus on customers, and expects to sell its last major asset, its stake in the oil and gas venture Spirit Energy, by the end of 2020. Conn added that the company is speaking to “at least two groups” of investors which are interested in buying its stake in EDF Energy’s fleet of UK nuclear reactors. Charles Berry, the chairman, said: “Iain has led the strategic repositioning of Centrica since 2015 and has been the driving force behind our plan to turn Centrica into a sustainable business.”",Centrica; Energy industry; Utilities; Business; UK news; Job losses; Corporate governance,Business
2020-07-19T07:00:44Z,Lily Cole: ‘We need to be more forgiving’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/19/lily-cole-fashion-activist-environment-climate-change-interview-we-need-to-be-more-forgiving,"I am tramping through the long grass of a Sussex nature reserve with supermodel-turned-activist Lily Cole. Beyond the gorse and the bracken, a vast open sky stretches before us. It certainly beats a sterile Zoom call. “How amazing is this?” she says. “I’ve been talking about moving to nature for years and then, finally, I decided to do it two years ago. I’ve been very grateful for it in general and particularly, obviously, these last few months.” Cole, 32, has just rocked up on a big beast of an e-bike. Of course she is on a bike, though she could have as easily been driving her fancy electric Tesla car. The Tesla tech whiz Elon Musk is just one of the so-called “Wizards” she has interviewed for her book, Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World. The Wizards are the people who are using technology in an attempt to innovate us out of the environmental crisis. In the other camp are the “Prophets” who say we must cut back, travel less, consume less, simplify. Cole examines both approaches in the book. Today Cole is in full Prophet mode in her “old, well-loved boots”, with her trademark flame-red hair tied in a top knot, but shaved underneath – an extremely beautiful hippie Prophet, dressed for comfort in jeans in a Conscious Exclusive bamboo fabric, T-shirt and cool round Wires sunglasses, a sustainable business she is involved with. As for many of us, her lockdown has been an “emotional roller coaster” but she daren’t whinge: “I feel like we’re in such a privileged position here. I can’t complain.” She has been “baking a ton, gardening a ton”, making nut milks, doing yoga, enjoying slowing down and spending more time with her five-year-old daughter, Wylde. So far, so hashtag blessed, and it would be easy to peg Cole as a virtue-signalling, silver-spooned bluestocking, but that would be to do her an injustice. Yes, her Uncle Adam was heir to a seat at the House of Lords (he turned it down to become a cinematographer, then a pioneer in sustainable energy), but Cole’s own upbringing was more frugal than gilded. She was born in Devon to a fisherman father and a mother who is an artist and writer; her parents split when she was seven weeks old. Cole was raised in London by her mother, who suffers from a rare genetic condition and was frequently unable to work. Her grandparents owned a farm in South Wales. Cole was scouted outside a Soho burger bar by Storm Models when she was 14, and modelling was a dream ticket for her. In no time she was pulling sickies from school to work with the world’s most prestigious brands – Alexander McQueen, Louis Vuitton and Chanel to name but a few – and appearing on Vogue covers internationally. But pretty soon she was grappling with the darker side of consumerism’s lurking complexities. At 15 she was (uncomfortably) wearing fur on the catwalk. By 17 she had found her voice. “Eventually saying no to fur cost me work, but it was a fairly straightforward choice to make: little boxes on contracts, usually appearing next to ‘No Nudity’”. A more complex decision came when she found herself caught up with the jewellery company De Beers, which had been accused of evicting the San people to mine diamonds in Botswana. The company denied any wrongdoing, but in a bold move for one so young, Cole refused to work for them and instead helped the San sell their own fair trade jewellery. “This experience in Botswana marked me. I felt an enormous responsibility to understand and respect what I was selling. I wasn’t just buying the companies’ products, I was asking other people to buy them too,” she writes. It’s telling that we still know Cole as a supermodel. Though she rarely models these days, her distinctive face and bright auburn hair are what we remember, yet modelling was only ever part of her story, a sideline, first to her academic life – she has a double first in history of art from Cambridge and got straights As in her A-levels – then to her entrepreneurial ventures and acting. Her first role was in the 2007 remake of St Trinian’s, followed by Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus, and in 2017 she played the Virgin Queen in Channel 5’s Elizabeth I. She has also stepped behind the camera to make a film about the plight of the refugees on the island of Samos, and has lent her time and profile to numerous charities and social enterprises. “I’ve been quite lucky in that modelling is something you can do part-time, but ironically it’s the most visible part of my life, even though I spend less time doing it, because it only takes a few seconds to take a photo that’s then very visible and always there, in comparison, say, to the many months I might spend slogging behind a computer.” In her latest incarnation as a writer, Cole spends the morning working and afternoons with her daughter. There has been no rigorous home-schooling. Cole is a fan of “the Scandinavian approach” and “preserving the sanctity of childhood” until the age of seven. Of course she is. But still she has been “finding ways to slip in lessons”, writing in a more playful way by making postcards for people and reading Philip Pullman’s Northern Lights. In her book, Cole takes a deep dive into the issues surrounding gender equality and the environment. She mentions that when she was pregnant she wrote a Post-it Note contract, which was “part in jest (but in spirit very serious!)” agreeing to split the childcare 50/50 with her partner, tech-entrepreneur Kwame Ferreira. The “contract” with Ferreira was prompted by an article she read that said most couples never discuss the division of childcare before their baby’s arrival. “It really rang out to me,” she says. So how is that working? Do they have a timetable? Does her partner stick to it? “I think it works really well – I’d highly recommend it. I’m not saying everyone has to make that choice or do the same division we decided on,” she says. “It’s not a rigid thing, more a loose understanding that we try to honour.” Then, in a typically cerebral response, Cole spends a good five minutes explaining the philosophy behind this choice. “I’m not saying I’m against, in any form, women taking time out to look after their children; if that’s what they want to do it’s a beautiful decision to make. The point I’m making is, I think ideas about who is responsible for the children have a big impact on gender parity for women. I’m not saying there’s a ‘right’ way to do it; I’m encouraging parents to be conscious of what they want, rather than slipping into what their parents did. Or what their grandparents did.” She also mentions that she supports single motherhood and same-sex parenting. “Sorry – long answer,” she says. “But it’s important, right?” As we tramp through the long grass, passing the odd dog walker, Cole nods hello. This is the other part of the countryside equation that she appreciates. But does she miss London at all? “I like being able to access it, but I don’t miss the daily experience. I feel like all my defences are up: it’s so urban and busy, and no one says hello. It’s a little bit more human here.” Last year, Cole signed a letter in support of Extinction Rebellion, with other celebrities such as Jude Law, Jaime Winstone and Daisy Lowe, who work in fashion and film, jetsetting industries with huge carbon footprints – but Cole won’t be drawn into finger-wagging. The sensible answer would be to make the rich pay for their oversized carbon footprints, with a pollution tax on flights, as suggested by the campaign A Free Ride, she says. We could each have just one tax-free return flight a year. Cole tries hard not to fly herself, “but without saying I’ll never fly again” because it’s more difficult to travel ethically than you think. After hearing Greta Thunberg speak in Stockholm, she attempted to come home by train. “But that route isn’t really designed for that. I fucked it up.” After two days, four train rides, a bus ride, a ferry crossing and a night sleeping in Copenhagen, she missed her last connection. In the end she booked a (very cheap) flight, offsetting it on Climeworks, and cried in frustration because she felt like a failure – but also because it seemed indicative of a wider problem. She had more luck travelling to Portugal on a bumpy, old-fashioned, 1980s sleeper train, which delighted her daughter with its fold-down beds and grey felt walls. “It was awesome, so much more memorable than travelling by plane.” This is all very right-on of course, but Cole is able to laugh at herself (and frequently does). She is well aware of her privileged position. Fearing criticism, she questioned whether she should even write the book at all. “I’m definitely not perfect, but then no one is,” she admits. “I think that’s a natural instinct that comes from a society that is quite tough on each other. But being tough does nothing but distract from the conversation and the effort. So you have to resist that. It would be nice if we were a bit more forgiving as a culture,” she says. She is now embracing the idea of being “an imperfect environmentalist”. Cole’s first exposure to activism came at the age of eight, when her 16-year-old cousin, Emma, was photographed chained to a tree in newspapers. “I was, like, why is my cousin tied to a tree?” Emma has since said that she thinks this approach alienated people, that people looked at activists chained to trees and thought: “I’m not like that, so the environment isn’t something I need to care about.” Does Cole agree? “I can really understand what she was saying because you don’t want to create an ‘us’ and ‘them’ mentality. The reality we’re dealing with should make everyone an environmentalist. It’s something that concerns us all in the same way as Covid is something that concerns us all: the environment is similarly real. It’s really important to keep listening and to stay open-minded, because we’re all in this together, no one has the right answers. No one knows what’s right.” What law would she introduce if she were prime minister for the day? “From an environmental point of view? Put a price on pollution.” A similar tax caused uproar in France, when fuel tax riots engulfed Paris in 2018. “But the devil is in the detail right? They didn’t design it in the right way, so it impacted people financially. But there are examples, like Canada, where it’s well designed and doesn’t penalise poorer communities, and can even offer wealth redistribution, with the tax redistributed equally among citizens, so the less you pollute the more you make.” The ink was just drying on her book when Covid-19 hit. She has spent part of lockdown rewriting the preface, but does she think we will take this chance to finally pivot, to let nature bounce back? “We’ve yet to see what will happen with Covid. Whether it will be a distraction, because we’re focused on a new set of problems or whether it will compound it. I hope it compounds it because we’ve already started experiencing some of the things scientists have been warning about for years.” Like the bushfires? “Yes and Covid itself is a result of the way we’re interacting with the natural world, the way we’re industrialising animal agriculture – and that’s not a conversation that’s in the mainstream.” On her bleakest days Cole says she soothes herself with the thought that if we don’t get our climate sorted the Earth will carry on regardless. “What’s the worst-case scenario? Just that we’re going to wipe ourselves out, along with other species, but the world will no doubt bounce back and there might even be more interesting creatures that emerge instead of us.” Fashion’s best lesson – an extract from Who Cares Wins by Lily Cole Unless you live in an entirely self-sufficient way, everything we touch, eat and use is connected to a complex web of trade relationships that we are responsible for being part of. When we make a purchase, we are explicitly supporting that way of doing business by giving a company our money; we are funding them keeping going. Of course, the power of money lies not just in how you spend it, but also in how you earn it, save it and invest it. Many of us want to earn our money working for – or setting up – companies that are looking to solve problems. Employees often have the greatest leverage to change the working practices inside companies, and there has been a boom in social businesses and new legal structures that seek to remodel a new vision of capitalism. My journey in thinking about these issues began when I was plunged head first into the epicentre of consumerism: fashion. I was always a fairly material girl: I remember trawling Portobello Market from a very young age, begging my mum to buy me a trinket. I had a penchant for dressing up, and second-hand clothes were my palette. Mum’s answer was usually no, met by hysteria. But sometimes she would give in and buy it. Then a store opened in Kilburn selling new clothes at unbelievably cheap prices: T-shirts for £1, dresses for £3. I saved my Christmas money and would fill up one of their big baskets until it was so heavy I could barely lift it. I never considered how clothes could be made so cheaply. It was as if they had dropped from heaven. And one day, my life changed. I was walking in Soho with friends when a man approached us, holding a little white card and said something about modelling. I pocketed the card and let my heart spring under a cautious face. My mum took me into the modelling agency the first time. I was given a big blue book, which would be filled with pictures of me: I was to become my own travelling saleswoman. I had just turned 14 and the blue book was heavy with possibilities. Fashion offered a fairytale for my inner child, and initially I indulged it without question. I made money and friends, and fulfilled my dream of travelling. Yet it also offered me a surprising gift: an education in capitalism. Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World by Lily Cole (Penguin Life , £20) is out on 30 July.

2019-11-24T15:23:38Z,Good company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/b-corps-captalism-for-an-environmentally-endangered-age,"In a volatile world jolted by protest, revolt and environmental alarm, capitalism is showing signs of twitchiness. For decades, business has been all about maximising profits and keeping owners happy. Now, thousands of companies and organisations are experimenting with broader values – purpose over profit, staff and communities ahead of shareholders – in order to meet the mood of the times. Driving this shift in consciousness is a phalanx of upstart, sustainable businesses. They cluster under different groupings – Conscious Capitalism, B Corp, The B Team, Just Capital – but all share the same central objective: to reshape capitalism for an environmentally endangered age. The best of these boast laudable motivations. In the past, if you wanted to change the world, you went into politics or joined a campaign group. Given the shift of power and resources to the private sector over recent decades, the smart money is increasingly on business to deliver solutions. Not business as usual, that is. Plastering products with eco labels or providing perks to employees will make not a jot of difference if, behind the scenes, companies are still happily burning fossil fuels and browbeating suppliers. “If businesses really want to be part of this movement for change, then great. But that change has to be radical and transformational. If not, it’s empty words and spin,” says Katie Hill, a spokesperson for the ethical certification body B Corp, which now counts over 3,100 registered members in over 70 countries. For a flavour of the changemaking businesses, she points to B Corps’ latest Best for the World list. The selection includes a US bank that specialises in financing community-based enterprises, a locally owned windfarm in Australia and a zero-waste Argentinian restaurant chain. (Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, recently announced that it too had been certified as a B corp). To date, founder-led businesses, cooperatives and employee-owned firms have tended to dominate such listings. Most are small, which makes sense. The larger the organisation, the harder it is to keep its mission clear and its values consistent. Small may be beautiful in ethical terms, but it’s not ideal for effecting large-scale change. If endemic poverty is ever to be reversed or global heating resolved, then big business also needs to embrace this more inclusive approach to business. There are signs of that happening. Natura, the huge Brazilian cosmetic brand, and its subsidiary The Body Shop, for example, now feature among a growing roster of multinational B Corps. The purpose-led business agenda received a shot in the arm this summer when the Business Roundtable, a grouping of some 200 top US companies like Amazon, Apple and GM, committed to “lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders”. Even the financial markets are beginning to prick up their ears. Take the rapid rise of the sustainable debt market, which has now passed the $1tn mark. Only last month, beverage giant PepsiCo issued a $1bn “green” bond to fund environmental programmes – a move unthinkable just a few year ago. “If the old economy makes a change, then that’s how you change the world,” said Dutch sustainable business expert Roeland Dikker Hupkes. Of course, the buy-in of big business comes with risks. Greenwashing is perhaps the most obvious, but some practices are more subtle. After the Fairtrade organic chocolate brand Green &amp; Black’s was taken over by food giant Kraft, for example, it started to produce confectionary that was neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified. Corporations are aware of a growing clamour, from consumers, employees, regulators, and even some investors, for business to demonstrate a social purpose beyond profitmaking. But can leopards change their spots? Most of the frontrunners in the “purpose economy” were set up to solve a specific social or environmental problem. Only then did they go about putting together a business to deliver it – not vice versa. In that sense, it’s a question few of them have had to ask. Take Fairphone. Located in Amsterdam, this hyper-ethical phone manufacturer insists on only using metals and other materials that are sustainably sourced and can be traced back to their origin. It’s a commitment that grew out of the firm’s origins as a campaign group against abuses in the telecoms supply chain. “Back then, we decided that we were not really creating any alternatives, so instead we should become part of the industry ourselves,” explains Eva Gouwens, the chief executive of the maverick phone brand. Yet retrofitting a traditional profit-maximising company is a different story altogether. The Belgian materials firm Umicore offers a very rare example of success. Once a dirty, old-school smelting firm, it has reinvented itself over the last decade or so into a pioneering recycler of waste metals. With ever lower margins in the smelting business, Umicore’s motivation was as much economic as it was environmental. The same cold logic enjoys growing traction in other old-school industries, from energy firms facing peak oil to carmakers confronting ever stricter eco standards. Also pushing companies to transform is a growing awareness among individual business leaders about the destructive route down which shareholder capitalism has pushed the planet. As Douglas Lamont, head of the UK beverage brand Innocent Drinks (now part of Coca-Cola), recently told a roomful of fellow executives at B Corps’ annual European summit: “We are the first generation of leaders who cannot say we didn’t know [about the climate emergency] … and we are also the last generation who can do anything about it.” The growing demand for a fairer, more caring form of capitalism has also given rise to a related phenomenon: the emergence of the purpose-driven consultant. Over recent years, a cottage industry of advisory firms has sprung up, all promising to help companies on this “journey” (a favourite phrase) towards a more purposeful, less profit-centric model of business. In the spirit of business-as-unusual, their approach is refreshingly unorthodox. “Bold”, “heartfelt” and “emotionally involved” are among the defining characteristics that sustainability expert Ed Gillespie associates with this new breed of consultant. To get the ball rolling, for example, conventional companies may well need a dose of shock therapy, according to Gillespie, who styles himself as an “insultant”: “Sometimes this will involve making clients feel very uncomfortable and might even lead to losing pitches, which most consultants are too chicken to do.” Another hallmark of these challenger consultants is their focus on the motivations and mindsets of individual decision makers. Alter how executives think and changes in business strategy and values will follow, the logic goes. David Rosenberg is one such proponent of this more personal approach. An associate at the advisory firm Better Future (also a certified B Corp), he is involved in taking corporate executives on “learning journeys” to overseas locations that lie “outside their comfort zone”. Past examples include home stays for cocoa-sector execs with smallholder farmers in Africa, and for bankers with their microfinance customers. “You confront them with challenges rooted in observable realities, [which] gives them fresh perspectives on their impacts in the world and presents opportunities for positive change,” says Rosenberg. For now, the companies and consultants pushing to reset capitalism occupy the fringes of the business mainstream. This is not surprising: attachments to shareholder capitalism and the pursuit for profit run deep. But change is in the air. And it’s this cohort of dissenters and disruptors who are pointing the way. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

2019-07-21T12:08:28Z,Ex-Unilever boss seeks 'heroic CEOs' to tackle climate change and inequality,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/21/ex-unilever-boss-seeks-heroic-ceos-to-tackle-climate-change-and-inequality-paul-polman,"The former boss of Unilever is seeking a team of “heroic chief executives” to drive a shift to a low-carbon, more inclusive way of doing business. Paul Polman, who stepped down from the Anglo-Dutch owner of Marmite and Dove in November last year after a decade at the helm, warns that the rise of populism and Brexit are symptoms of capitalism’s failure to adapt. Bosses, he insists, must commit to fighting inequality and tackling the climate emergency. “We are about to commit the biggest intergenerational crime in the history of mankind. We need to bring us together not drive us apart,” said the 63-year-old Dutchman, who won plaudits for pushing the benefits of sustainable business long before it became fashionable. “If you don’t address inequality and climate change, to keep it simple, a lot more people are going to be dissatisfied, feel not included or left behind, and making these choices of rejection at the ballot box. The fact we are having these issues of populism and schisms in society is exactly because we are not addressing the underlying issue to evolve capitalism and make sure it works for everybody,” he said. He believes the starting point is “heroic chief executives willing to step up and move outside of the comfort zone and take personal risks. I tried to do the same with Unilever. It’s a matter of willpower.” Polman has backed his words with cash by investing in Imagine, a foundation to push the UN’s sustainable development goals. But he has several other projects on the go, including helping the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and François-Henri Pinault, the boss of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner Kering, to develop a fashion-industry deal to cut waste and carbon emissions that is set to be announced at the G7 meeting in Biarritz next month. Polman said the aim is to get a fifth of the industry on board. He his hoping that signatories including the Calvin Klein owner PVH, H&amp;M and Inditex, the owner of Zara, will inspire others. Polman is also backing an initiative that adopts similar tactics to advance disability rights, Valuable 500. The campaign, which is aiming to recruit 500 chief executives of major companies who commit to putting disability on their board agenda this year, has just won the backing of seven major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, HSBC and Lloyds. The banks join existing signatories, including Barclays, Accenture, Microsoft, Virgin Media and Sainsbury’s. “We are trying to create tipping points on a sectorial level. The premise is that chief executives in the private sector need to drive major change in the absence of politicians doing it right now. Not exclusively but actively helping de-risk the political process,” Polman said. “Over the next 10 years more responsibility will be put on business to move faster to implement the [UN’s] sustainability goals simply because of financial flow that needs to happen that cannot come right now from government.” With only 100 companies responsible for 71% of carbon emissions , persuading a handful of these bosses to see the economic and moral benefit of changing their ways can create a race to the top, according to Polman. The boss who has publicly backed the young people behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of the teenage activist Greta Thunberg, said businesses that do not embrace issues of diversity, sustainability and equal rights will also struggle to attract talented young workers. “Millennials want to work for companies that stand for more than just making money.” Polman said he is no longer ridiculed for suggesting that tackling climate change makes business sense and that companies are also beginning to see that addressing equal rights is just as important. “We are now at a point in society where the cost of not acting in these areas is higher than acting. It is becoming mainstream. It comes down to humans, that’s the missing element,” Polman said. Caroline Casey, the founder of the Valuable 500 campaign, hopes that persuading key business leaders, such as Richard Branson, who has dyslexia, to be more open about their own disabilities and take action to make their companies more inclusive will demonstrate change is “good for business, good for people with disability and good for society in general”. She points out that there are about 13m people with disabilities in the UK who, together with their families, have a spending power of £249bn. However, businesses pay them far less attention than vegans, for example, who number less than one million. People with disabilities are also valuable employees who may be concealing non-obvious conditions such as autism, mental health problems or even blindness in the workplace. “There’s a cost to exclusion because we’re not releasing potential,” Casey said.",Business; Unilever; Climate crisis; Inequality; Bank of England; Greta Thunberg; HSBC; Lloyds Banking Group; World news; Europe; UK news,Business
2019-06-05T15:24:07Z,To dye for: Wrangler's new denim process eliminates water waste,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/05/wranglers-new-denim-process-eliminates-water-waste-dye,"Denim manufacturing doesn’t have a good reputation when it comes to creating excessive levels of waste, but an innovative process spearheaded by the US jeans brand Wrangler may change that. The company has partnered with Texas Tech University (TTU) and the Valencia-based fabric mill Tejidos Royo to create a foam-dyed, water-free process, eliminating the waste generated from the traditional dyeing processes. To put this in perspective, the usual way to dye denim that traditional James Dean blue uses a repetitive dip-and-dry method to transfer indigo on to yarn. Multiple vats of water – up to 12, each containing thousands of litres of water – are used and then discarded. By the time they reach a shop, one pair of jeans can have used gallons of water. The new process, Indigood, eliminates the need for “reduction” chemicals and instead uses a foaming agent. The indigo dye is transferred on to yarns in an oxygen-deprived environment sealed by a nitrogen hood. Roian Atwood, the senior director of global sustainable business at the parent company Kontoor Brands, describes it as “an elegant one-process step” that “removes 100% of water from the dye process” as well as reducing energy and waste by 60% each. The technology has been in development for a decade, but achieving the depth of colour for indigo denim has only been achieved in the past three years. “We want this to be adopted by as many brands as possible because it transforms our industry,” says Atwood. While water is still required to grow the cotton yarn in the first place, the brand says it has partnered with several organisations – including the Soil Health Institute and Cotton Connect – to help farmers adopt best practices. The pieces in its first collection using the technology are made from up to 30% recycled cotton. It is a case, says Atwood, of not waiting to be 100%, but to take small steps. “Sustainability is a journey to making improvement – you can have a small initiative that is seen as a key priority,” he says. While initially used for the brand’s autumn/winter 2019 Icons collection, priced between £80 and £130, the technology will be rolled out across the brand’s cheaper ranges so that “sustainable products aren’t a choice between basic needs and doing the right thing”, says Atwood. There are also plans for Lee Jeans, also owned by Kontoor, to release Indigood collections later this year. The announcement comes as the fashion industry is having a major reassessment of processes throughout the often complex supply chain after intense scrutiny of past exploitation and polluting practices. Atwood says that Wrangler conforms to the “buy less, buy better” school of thought. “We will have to clothe ourselves, but at the same time be mindful of how we do that,” he says. “The fashion industry must do far more to reduce its huge environmental impact – which includes vast water usage and chemical and micro-plastic pollution,” says Emma Priestland, a Friends of the Earth campaigner. “Innovation and new technology have an important role to play – and it’s encouraging to see a number of firms looking for ways to reduce their eco-footprint, but we also need government intervention to ensure that the whole industry reduces its impact on the environment. We can all play our part too by rejecting the fast-fashion, throwaway culture and the damage, pollution and waste it causes.” Atwood says that “durability is by far the No 1 sustainable tenet” when it comes to being a retailer. “If you have a jean jacket for 30 years, that’s a real testament to its construction. If something blows out in eight months, it increases the need for continuous consumption. At the same time we have to mitigate the very real impacts happening up and down the supply chain.” This has to be done “at an urgent rate in order to meet the global imperative – from climate crisis to lack of biodiversity and good workplace standards to the international manufacturing community”, says Atwood. “There is a way in this resource revolution to make products with far fewer impacts; that is what [Indigood] represents. To take the water footprint in dyeing and take it down to zero is the type of technology upheaval we need.” • This article was amended on 4 July 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Indigood process using “chemical-free soap”.

2019-02-20T15:39:51Z,Extinction Rebellion co-founder 'shut out' at London fashion show,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/20/extinction-rebellion-member-clare-farrell-barred-bethany-williams-london-fashion-week-show,"Clare Farrell, co-founder of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, claimed she was barred from entering a show at London fashion week two days after helping to organise a protest against the British Fashion Council to highlight the industry’s role in fuelling climate change. About 150 people from Extinction Rebellion formed human roadblocks and brought traffic to a standstill outside event venues on Sunday to cause disruption and urge the industry body to declare a climate emergency. Farrell, who is also a spokeswoman for the direct action group, said she was approached by a police officer who addressed her by name when she was in the queue for the Bethany Williams show at 180 The Strand, London, on Tuesday afternoon, and was told she was not allowed to enter. “The police liaison officer said I could queue up but that the venue wouldn’t let me in,” Farrell said. “She referenced Extinction Rebellion and pointed to a badge I was wearing.” Farrell, a fashion designer, said that she had helped produce Williams’ line, which is dedicated to social justice and sustainability, and that she had not been intending to protest at the event. “To exclude a designer who was both involved in the production of the line and working to bring attention to the climate and ecological crises from the show is just unbelievable,” she added. The group said Farrell had a ticket for the show, and that staff at the venue were informed of her multiple roles in the production of Williams’ award-winning line. Williams was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II design award for her work, which addresses environmental issues, by the Duchess of Cornwall on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “On Tuesday 19 February, the organisers of a private event taking place on The Strand in central London took a decision not to admit a member of the public to their event. This decision was conveyed to the member of the public by a police officer at the scene.” On Sunday, the British Fashion Council said that it was “pleased that we live in a country where we have a right to protest peacefully”. It said in a statement: “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core. “This week we hope to both encourage the showcasing of these creative businesses whilst increasing the dialogue around mindful consumerism, one that we are raising ourselves through our Positive Fashion programme.” The British Fashion Council has been contacted for further comment.",London fashion week; Life and style; Fashion; Fashion weeks; UK news; Climate crisis; Activism; Environment; Extinction Rebellion,Fashion
2019-02-04T11:55:54Z,Kitchen for rent? Ikea to trial leasing of furniture,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/04/kitchen-for-rent-ikea-to-trial-leasing-of-furniture,"Ikea is to start renting out furniture as part of attempts to build a more environmentally friendly business. The world’s largest furniture retailer said it wanted to test out the idea of leasing office furniture such as desks and chairs to business customers, starting in Switzerland. However, kitchens could also potentially be rented rather than sold in future. The leasing strategy is part of Ikea’s wider effort to design and sell goods that can be repaired, reused, recycled or resold and promote services that prolong the life of a product. “You could say leasing is another way of financing a kitchen. When this circular model is up and running, we have a much bigger interest in not just selling a product but seeing what happens with it and that the consumer takes care of it,” Torbjorn Lööf, the chief executive of Inter Ikea, which owns the Ikea brand, told the Financial Times (£). He said the Swedish company was also considering launching its own spare parts business so that customers could replace components, such as hinges or screws, for furniture no longer stocked in Ikea’s stores. An Ikea spokesperson said: “We have an ambition to inspire and enable people to play an active role in making the circular economy a reality, which we can support by developing new ways for people to buy, care for and pass on products. “In certain markets, such as Switzerland, we’re exploring and testing potential solutions and have a pilot project to look into the leasing of furniture, but it’s still too early to confirm exactly what this will look like.” Shoppers can already return some types of used furniture to stores in the UK for resale or donation to charity, while every store now has repair and repackaging facilities so that items damaged in transit can be sold and not wasted. Ikea has said it wants to source 100% of its wood and paper from more sustainable sources by 2020 and plans to ditch fossil fuels by 2030. The company has invested more than €1.7bn (£1.5bn) in renewable energy including windfarms and rooftop solar, owns more than 100,000 hectares of forest and has put money into a plastics recycling business as part of its efforts to build a more environmentally sustainable business. This week Ikea will open what it says will be its most sustainable store yet in Greenwich, London. Services available will include a “learning lab” where shoppers can find out how to refurbish or repurpose old furnishings. The developments come after Ikea’s profits fell by more than a third last year as it invested in its online business and tested smaller city-centre stores. Last year it said it was cutting 7,500 office jobs worldwide, including 350 in the UK, to focus on improving its online operation and city-centre format.",Ikea; Retail industry; Business; Sweden; UK news; Europe,Business
2019-12-02T06:00:25Z,"UK's regional theatre at risk amid funding cuts, say directors",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/02/uk-regional-theatre-at-risk-amid-funding-cuts-say-directors,"The future of theatre in some of the UK’s biggest cities remains under threat, regional artistic directors have warned, amid funding cuts and an ongoing search for sustainable business models. A year on from the collapse of Liverpool Everyman’s repertory company, the Guardian spoke to the artistic director of that theatre, as well as those at Leeds Playhouse and Manchester Royal Exchange, all of whom are facing the same challenge: what does a contemporary, local theatre look like in 2019? Gemma Bodinetz, the artistic director of the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse theatres, attempted to answer that question with a bold, experimental rep company that harks back to the 70s – when Jonathan Pryce, Bill Nighy and Julie Walters all came through the Liverpool system. The rep model establishes an in-house acting team, who are embedded in a place and produce bespoke theatre. Established in 2016, it was the first rep company at the Everyman in 25 years, and it almost brought the organisation to its knees. After a successful first season, which won an award for innovation, the decision was taken to “pause” the rep programme in late November 2018. That hiatus would become permanent. Less than a month later, the Everyman announced it was pulling out of the Arts Council’s national portfolio (NPO) for funding – a huge step for a theatre of the Everyman’s stature and one that was taken because the strain the rep model had put on its finances meant it would not reach obligatory fiscal targets. Then high-profile board members – David Morrissey and Michael Mansfield QC – left. In September, the executive director, Deborah Aydon, who had been in post for 15 years, stepped down as well. It was an extraordinary chain of events, especially at a theatre that three years earlier had won the Stirling prize for its revered £28m new home, but also had a proud tradition of rep theatre. “We won the award for innovation [after the first season],” says Bodinetz. “I remember at the time, being so proud of that. But I realise now – with all honesty – that I hadn’t quite understood what a massive thing we were doing.” Bodinetz and current the Everyman chief executive, Fiona Gibson, say the problems with the rep theatre stemmed from not understanding the cost – both financial and in terms of time – that the company would demand. Although they don’t regret it. “I think if money had been a little bit more generous, and we’d given it five years, it would have been a massive success,” says Bodenitz. The rep company wasn’t just seen as a misstep for the Everyman, but as an existential crisis for local theatre at large. If the Everyman – a theatre that was one of the most respected in Europe, with an award-winning artistic director and a Stirling prize-winning facility – could not make this model work, what hope for the rest? One editorial asked whether the Everyman was “the canary in the coal mine for regional theatre”. The situation was more dire because it was happening during a period that was the most testing since the end of the 80s, when Margaret Thatcher’s government slashed arts budgets and used the example of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s work as being the type of theatre that could pay for itself and therefore warranted a place on British stages. Nearly £400m has been cut from annual local authority spending on culture and the arts since 2010, according to research by the County Councils Network. The Arts Council budget, meanwhile, has been reduced by 30% since 2010. In 2015, an Arts Council report showed a 17% drop in cultural spending by local councils since austerity began. Bodenitz praises the local council and Arts Council support, but in Liverpool, where there’s been a £816 per head fall in day-to-day public spending since 2010, there’s an inevitable knock-on effect. “It is hard,” says Gibson. “Because people’s ‘leisure pound’, if I can call it that, could go on so many things. So it’s about making sure that what we do offer what they really want to see.” There’s a substantial funding gap between London theatres and those outside of the capital. Since 2010/11 the Liverpool Everyman has received £30,260,493 from the Arts Council, the Leeds Playhouse has been awarded £22,417,718 and Manchester Royal Exchange – the only one of three to not have a huge capital investment project in that period – £22,058,556. Compared to the National Theatre, which between 2018 and 2022 alone will receive £66,800,000, the disparity is clear. At the Leeds Playhouse, artistic director James Brining paid close attention to what was happening further down the M62. A former director of the Dundee Rep company, he wanted Liverpool’s gamble to pay off. But the Leeds United fan, who would read TS Eliot and Jane Austen on the Elland Road terraces, felt that it was a case of great idea, but wrong place and time. “In an ideal world where we have more money, then you’d have a small permanent company that you might do a show with, and they’d go into schools and do work in communities,” says Brining, who has been at Leeds Playhouse for seven years. “It’s a really wonderful way of working, but in the current climate of British theatre it’s a really difficult thing to pull off.” The Leeds Playhouse has just finished its own multimillion pound makeover. A £15.8m facelift of its city centre building has been completed and offers a more welcoming appearance to the old West Yorkshire Playhouse location. For Brining, success at the new-look Leeds Playhouse will be measured on more than getting bums on seats. “We see mission as so much more than what is on our stages,” he says. “There’s a civic function, which might sound like an old-fashioned idea or an ancient idea, but that’s where our roots are.” That function includes outreach programmes with refugees, offering rehearsal space to young theatremakers and hosting weekly events for over-65s. But the Everyman’s Fiona Gibson believes even the best theatres can run into trouble after big building projects, like the one in Leeds. “If you look at many theatres that have had challenges, it’s often on the back of a capital investment programme,” says Gibson, who also worked at the Octagon Theatre in Bolton. “You raise all the money for the building, and then it’s hard to get revenue, especially at that time when you’re focused on fundraising for capital.” At Manchester’s Royal Exchange theatre, two new artistic directors – Roy Alexander Weise and Bryony Shanahan – don’t have the weight of a new building to deal with, but there is another form of pressure. They have just taken over from Sarah Frankcom, who ran the theatre since 2014, putting on Maxine Peake’s Hamlet, the current Simon Stephens’ production Light Falls, and establishing the Bruntwood prize for playwriting – the biggest award for playwriting in Europe. “It doesn’t feel like a scary shadow kind of lingering here,” says Shanahan, who moved to Manchester four years ago. “Sarah’s done so much with the organisation and we’re gonna continue that”. Weise, who was an associate artist at the Donmar Warehouse, describes himself as “a blind optimist” but admits that the first two weeks in the role have included some “reality checking” about what is possible. “I think our board is really excited about seeing what, two very different, slightly unorthodox artists will bring to artistic leadership,” he says. Frankcom’s final season has just been announced, so for Weise and Shanahan, now is a time to plan what their version of the Royal Exchange will look like. “This site is important, and is incredible, and difficult and challenging,” admits Shanahan. “But you’ve got to look out our doors as well. We can’t just be a satellite.” Theatre profiles Liverpool Everyman Gemma Bodinetz, the artistic director of the Liverpool Everyman, is one of the longest-serving theatre figures in the UK – having moved to the city in 2003 after making a name for herself while at Hampstead Theatre and the National Theatre. Bodinetz says the Stirling prize win in 2014, when the Everyman’s renovated home in the centre of Liverpool beat off competition from the Shard, is still her proudest moment. Her tenure has seen victories on stage as well, including Golda Rosheuvel starring in a production of Othello as an out lesbian, and a critically lauded season during Liverpool’s capital of culture year in 2008. Bodinetz said that as Sir Ian McKellen prepared his one-man show at the Liverpool Playhouse last year, he playfully admonished her for stopping the rep company. “He said: ‘We’re all very disappointed in you, in the theatre world’,” recalls Bodinetz. “‘All our hopes were pinned on your repertory company. It was a brilliant idea. Why did you stop it?’” Bodinetz and Gibson have implemented a two year business plan with an ultimate goal of applying to go back into NPO funding. Leeds Playhouse The recently reopened Leeds Playhouse still has a remit of being a producing theatre for the whole of West Yorkshire, despite its name change last year. Its artistic director, James Brining, grew up in the Leeds suburb of Chapel Allerton, and moved back to the city to take over at the Playhouse after a successful stint at Dundee Rep and the Orange Tree in Richmond. A passionate supporter of Leeds United and new writing, it wasn’t a surprise when the new Playhouse opened with Charley Miles’s There Are No Beginnings – a play based on interviews with women who lived through Peter Sutcliffe’s reign of terror in the county. The Playhouse’s new smaller performance space The Bramall Rock Void is seen as a place to test new writing, rather than having to make the immediate jump up to the larger Courtyard or main Quarry space, which seats 750. Leeds Playhouse’s refurbishment was commissioned for four reasons: to make it more accessible, more sustainable, create the Bramall Rock Void, and generate more income from new bars and cafes. It’s the first major work done on the site since 1990, and its completion comes before the Playhouse celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2020. Royal Exchange, Manchester Manchester has a busy theatre scene with Contact, Home, Palace Theatre, The Lowry in Salford, Oldham Coliseum Theatre and the Bolton Octagon all on the Royal Exchange’s doorstep. It receives the highest amount of Arts Council funding for any theatre outside of London, and is situated in a building that was once the world’s largest cotton exchange. Outgoing artistic director Sarah Frankcom said Weise and Shanahan – who pitched for the role together – are “exceptional artists” who make “visceral and transformative theatre”. Shanahan has experience of working at the Exchange, having staged Maxine Peake’s drama Queens of the Coal Age last year. Weise, meanwhile, is best known for directing Nine Night, Natasha Gordon’s debut about a Jamaican funeral wake, and The Mountaintop – a play about Martin Luther King that played at the Young Vic. The pair successfully got the role after a pitch that involved them discussing their unusual routes into theatre. Weise told the board story of how he walked into a theatre in London to use the toilet on the way home from school and ended up staying. Weise says that part of the challenge for them is to make the Royal Exchange seem more accessible and prone to happy accidents, like his. “When you invite people into your house there might be some rules,” he says. “You might have to take off your shoes so you don’t get the carpet. But it’s also about the hospitality that you bring as well.”",Theatre; Stage; Arts funding; Culture; Everyman theatre; Royal Exchange; Manchester; Liverpool; Leeds; Greater Manchester; UK news; Dundee Rep,Stage
2019-02-17T11:28:26Z,Climate protesters disrupt London fashion week by blocking roads,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/17/climate-protesters-take-action-to-disrupt-london-fashion-week,"Protesters from the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion disrupted the third day of London fashion week, forming human blockades on roads around event venues to highlight the spiralling throwaway culture in the UK’s clothing market and to urge the British Fashion Council (BFC) to declare a climate emergency. Groups made up of scores of demonstrators wearing black to mourn those whose lives have been devastated by environmental destruction caused traffic standstills for seven-minute intervals, unfurling banners saying “Rebel for life” and holding placards inscribed “Climate change = mass murder”. Models and protesters mingled outside the main venue at 180 Strand in central London throughout Sunday, with lighthearted impromptu catwalks staged while leaflets were passed to motorists and bystanders warning of the catastrophic consequences of unsustainable growth and inaction over climate change. Attendees outside the events said that ethical considerations had become fashionable, even mainstream, though campaigners contended they had always been trendy. “Minds in fashion are changing right now,” said Jonas Aucher, a French fashion student. “Fast-fashion brands like Zara have a huge impact, and the protesters are right that the industry has to change.” However, he added: “Recycled products are too expensive.” Roxanne Murray, a stylist on her way in to an event, emphasised that most people were sympathetic to the need to be more environmentally conscious and that fast fashion needed to slow down. “We don’t have to buy new, cheaply made clothes,” she said. Shop at secondhand stores and wear vintage. Fashion isn’t just about you, it’s about all of us. If we all change together, it will have a great impact.” Some fashionistas dismissed the protesters’ concerns, while others questioned whether climate change was indeed a man-made phenomenon. “We are in a diabolical situation and it’s too late to convince climate deniers,” said Caroline Vincent, a scientist. “We do need to engage, but we really don’t have the time: we must convince the people who already recognise there is a problem to do something about it.” The afternoon of civil disobedience by about 150 people passed peacefully with no arrests, as organisers stayed in constant contact with police on the ground and allowed emergency vehicles to pass when required. Following one of the constructive conversations between protesters and drivers halted by the traffic, a liaison officer said the action had been a pleasure to police, adding: “You are getting the point across.” Shortly after, one motorist who refused to turn off his engine during the stoppage shouted, “Fuck off back to Richmond. Can’t you move these soapy bastards?” However, most people waited patiently and read the leaflets, and the sound of horns swiftly subsided as chants of “What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now!” echoed down the street. Extinction Rebellion met the BFC on Tuesday to discuss the action it planned to take. The group also discussed how the industry body could use its influence to transform fashion into a force for cultural change that would stop the trend for excessive consumption and respond to the “urgent and existential threat of climate change”. Clare Farrell, a fashion designer and co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, said: “We need to hold thought leaders and creators of culture to account. The fashion industry’s influence permeates deep within culture and radiates globally. “While the fashion industry is not responsible for the unsustainable system it exists within, it is a key driver of global trends and a significant source of ecological devastation.” She said global clothing consumption had doubled in the past 15 years, while utilisation – how often clothes are worn – had decreased by 36%, with total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2bn tonnes annually, exceeding those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. “There are no signs that this is slowing, and events such as London fashion week contribute to and encourage this continued unsustainable growth,” Farrell added, saying that the fashion industry was the most influential on earth. The BFC said it showcased British businesses engaging in sustainable practices and that it believed shifts within London-based brands could spearhead changes within the wider industry. “We are committed to supporting businesses to do more to develop through green growth and our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come,” a spokesperson said. “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core.”",Environmental activism; London fashion week; Climate crisis; Fashion industry; Retail industry; Ethical and green living; Life and style; Fashion weeks; Fashion; Business; Environment; London; Protest; UK news; Extinction Rebellion,Environment
2019-05-10T11:26:49Z,Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard: ‘Denying climate change is evil’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/10/yvon-chouinard-patagonia-founder-denying-climate-change-is-evil,"In his bridge-club cords and grandpa shoes, 80-year-old Yvon Chouinard doesn’t look the rock-star entrepreneur. And, when he speaks, he doesn’t sound much like one either. The founder of US outdoor apparel brand Patagonia believes stock market valuations are “absurd”, investing in shares is “buying blue sky” – and modern-day capitalism is destroying the planet. “I’d like to see an end to public corporations because we’re not going to revolutionise them, we’re not going to change them,” the self-confessed reluctant businessman told the Guardian. It is easy to dismiss such comments as sour grapes or market envy. As a private company (Chouinard remains sole owner), Patagonia lacks the investment clout of Nike or The North Face. Not that that has necessarily restricted the plucky Californian brand, which posted sales revenues of more than $1bn last year. A soft-spoken former climber hailed by some as the Steve Jobs of eco-conscious commerce, Chouinard is not your usual businessman. Based in the small Californian town of Ventura, he eschews publicity and prefers gardening to board meetings. He set up his first company – a small climbing equipment firm – more than 50 years ago only because no one was selling the kind of pitons he wanted. In 1973, he established Patagonia to help finance the low-margin equipment firm. Despite Patagonia’s exponential growth, Chouinard insists his company has sought to remain true to its eco-conscious origins. He cites the brand’s decision to use 100% organic cotton in its garments and to donate 10% of its profits (or 1% of sales – whichever is greater) to environmental charities by way of example. Patagonia is far from perfect, however. By his own admission, the idea of a fully sustainable business or product is impossible: “There is no such thing as sustainability. The best we can do is cause the least amount of harm.” Instead of “sustainable”, he prefers the term “responsible”, which, he argues, starts with companies treating nature not as a resource to be exploited but as a unique, life-giving entity on which we all – not least business – depend. Chouinard may have his acolytes among eco-conscious consumers, but he doubts mainstream companies are listening to his reforming message. “I used to think that if we could show that being a responsible business is good business, then others would follow. And some do, but they’re tiny little companies. But the public companies, they’re all green-washing. I have no hope that they’re going to change.” Nor does he hold out much hope for government to force big business to act more responsibly. Politicians are “pawns of corporations” says the man who, together with a coalition of indigenous North American tribes and grassroots groups, is currently suing the Trump administration for attempts to reduce the size of ancestral lands in Utah. Our best hope for change lies with consumers, Chouinard maintains: “You’ve got to change the consumers first and then the corporations will follow and then government will follow the corporations. They [governments] are last in line.” Hence, his recent appearance in New York, where Patagonia was premiering a new documentary at the Tribeca film festival about the dangers to wild salmon of fish hatcheries and open-net fish farms. The film, entitled Artifishal, is intentionally provocative, Chouinard admits. “People don’t read any more and they make decisions based on emotions, so I think film is the best way to elicit people’s emotions.” Eliciting consumers’ emotions is not without its risks, of course. One of the chief beneficiaries of salmon hatcheries are recreational anglers, a key consumer group for Patagonia. Chouinard says he couldn’t care less: if he loses business, so be it. “I absolutely don’t believe in doing … focus groups and all that shit. Proctor and Gamble-style, no risk. Just do it,” he says. The same thinking lay behind his decision in 2011 to run an ad campaign on Black Friday, the busiest day in the US retail calendar, with the tagline: ‘Don’t Buy This Jacket’. But 50 years of activism has seen Chouinard lose as many battles as he has won; high-profile campaigns against ocean pollution and genetically modified food are two notable cases in point. Failure, fortunately, doesn’t seem to dishearten him. “If you expect victories, then you’re in the wrong business. Evil never stops. And it’s just a matter of endless fighting … the fight is the important thing.” For all his talk of evil, it would be tempting to think Chouinard was religious. He is not. The money that is being spent on going to Mars “to see if God is up there”, he jokes, would be better spent on “doing some actual good”. As he enters his ninth decade, the appetite of this business pioneer to disrupt the status quo appears to be growing, not shrinking. Sparking his radicalism is the election of populist leaders, such as the US’s Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, whom he accuses of riding roughshod over nature. More important still is the looming threat of climate change and massive species loss. As he told the audience at Tribeca: “The polar bear is toast.” It’s time for brands to become more vocally political, he argues. Consumers, especially among the young, increasingly expect their favourite brands to speak out, he says. Chouinard, for one, leaves little doubt where his politics lie. When President Trump announced his decision to slash corporate taxes, for example, Patagonia announced it would give away the money saved. That added another $10m to its charitable outgoings, bringing to $105m (£80m) the total lifetime amount donated to environmental causes. Chouinard sees it as an act of “karma”: “After all, we don’t need it, we’re debt-free.” Similarly, plans are afoot to jazz up Patagonia’s political advertising. Rather than just call on the US public to vote for the environment, it now intends to specifically endorse pro-conservation candidates, says Chouinard. “We simply can’t pussyfoot around anymore. We have to just say, you know, this administration is evil and anybody who is denying climate change is evil.” Such moves will provoke controversy without doubt. Not that Chouinard cares. As he likes to advise graduating students, life is easier if you break the rules rather than conform to them. “Invent your own game and that way you can always be a winner.” • This article was updated on May 20 to remove an earlier inaccuracy which stated that Patagonia gained 600,000 new customers and year-on-year sales quadrupled as a result of its 2011 campaign Don’t Buy This Jacket.",Business; World news; US news; Fashion; Life and style; Environment,World news
2018-12-03T00:41:52Z,Almost 150 jobs to go as Fairfax and Nine merger restructure revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/03/almost-150-jobs-to-go-as-fairfax-and-nine-merger-restructure-revealed,"A total of 144 jobs will disappear as a result of the merger between Fairfax Media and Nine, with 92 people to be made redundant before the new business is formed on 10 December. The remainder of the positions that will be lost are currently vacant. The merger was given court approval last week after being approved by Fairfax shareholders last month. The chief executive of Nine, Hugh Marks, made the restructure announcement to staff at Nine and Fairfax on Monday morning, outlining which executives would stay and who was leaving. The redundancies are spread across both media companies. Nine will be organised into four divisions. Publishing will be led by Fairfax executive Chris Janz and will include metropolitan mastheads the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, as well as Nine’s websites and events division. The Canberra Times will be part of the Australian Community Media division rather than metro, which may leave it more vulnerable to a sale. The streaming service Stan, formerly a joint venture between Fairfax and Nine, will be led by the founding executive, Mike Sneesby. Australian Community Media and printing will continue to be led by Allen Williams. The New Zealand business, Stuff, will be run by Sinead Boucher, reporting to Williams. The television division will be led by Nine’s long-serving director of television, Michael Healy. Greg Barnes will be chief financial officer. Along with outgoing Fairfax chief executive Greg Hywood, the senior Fairfax executives to lose their jobs include David Housego, Gail Hambly, Michelle Williams, Dhruv Gupta and Brad Hatch. Nine has said there will be no editorial redundancies however it was announced on the same day that the national affairs editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Mark Kenny, had resigned after six years in the Fairfax Canberra bureau. It was also announced that the Victorian publisher of Fairfax Media, Mark Hawthorne, would be leaving. “The new corporate structure is designed to strengthen our offerings to audiences and clients, including maximising our combined ability to invest in quality Australian content and journalism,” Marks said in a note to staff seen by Guardian Australia. “Thank you to everyone for your patience as we have worked through the process. We can now move forward with confidence as a stronger and more sustainable business with many new and exciting opportunities ahead. This is truly an amazing opportunity for our combined future.” Nine will become majority shareholder in Domain, led by Jason Pellegrino, and Macquarie Radio, led by Adam Lang. Both will remain as separately listed companies with independent boards. Redundancies in IT, human resources, payroll, office productivity and content management have yet to be decided. In a separate note to Fairfax, Hywood thanked his staff for their “magnificent” work. “Now virtually complete, this exciting merger with Nine is the right next step for Fairfax Media,” Hywood said. “Our businesses will be better for it and the opportunities for our people will expand over time.” Hywood is hosting a corporate farewell party dubbed The Long and Winding Road at Sydney’s Carriageworks on Wednesday night.",Fairfax Media; Nine Entertainment; Australian media; Media; Australia news,Media
2019-02-22T13:41:34Z,Just how ethical is ethical investment?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/22/just-how-ethical-is-ethical-investment,"Supposedly environmental stock market indices used to help investors allocate hundreds of billions of pounds in investments include some of the world’s biggest contributors to fossil fuel pollution. Index providers including FTSE Russell, MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Stoxx all run indices that take into account environmental, social and corporate governance concerns known as ESG. FTSE Russell, owned by the London Stock Exchange, says it has a “hard exclusion” for coal companies from its FTSE4Good ethical indices, after it was decided that the most-polluting major fossil fuel did not fit its criteria for a sustainable future. However, major coal producers including BHP and Anglo American are included because they are listed as “general mining” firms rather than coal companies. FTSE Russell refused to provide the Guardian with a full list of index constituents but publicly available factsheets indicate that 34 oil and gas related companies account for 3.4% of the FTSE4Good developed index by market capitalisation. The inclusion of major oil and coal companies on indices is likely to prompt concerns about the term ESG being used to “greenwash” the reputations of major polluters. The New York-headquartered MSCI claims that investors worldwide have used its ESG indices to direct well over £200bn in investments since 2014. Fund managers such as Blackrock and Vanguard sell investors products such as exchange-traded funds, which track the performance of ESG indices. Savers whose money is invested using these indices may be unaware that they are funding fossil fuel extraction, said Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “In today’s world, many people buying products labelled ‘4 Good’ may expect that a fund created to take into account environmental impact would not include oil or other fossil fuel companies,” he said. “The stark reality is that to achieve the targets of the Paris agreement and avoid huge impacts on billions of people as well as massive biodiversity loss, there will have to be drastic changes to the way we power our societies, move around, grow much of our food and look after the natural world. Including oil companies in funds that are marketed as protecting the environment won’t help that transformation – it will slow it down.” Some index providers argue that ESG indices can be used to give greater weight to those companies which do better than their peers on various sustainability issues. Linda-Eling Lee, global head of ESG research at MSCI, told the Guardian this “competitive logic” can give companies incentives to improve their operations. MSCI’s indices favour those companies that “are actually paying attention to these emerging or latent ESG risks”, she said. All of the index firms provide detailed methodologies for their indices, assigning clearly defined ESG scores to companies. However, the scoring systems used by some indices only count direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions, such as those from company vehicles or offices – ignoring the much larger emissions from burning fossil fuels extracted by energy companies, known as scope 3 emissions. David Harris, the group head of sustainable business at the London Stock Exchange Group, said scope 3 emissions calculations are not suitable for index creation. “Scope 3 is a great concept but if you want to use it for investment purposes there’s very little data,” he said. FTSE Russell’s aim instead was on “raising the standards over time” by engaging with companies on the indices on their environmental practices, with the threat of them being thrown off if they do not improve, he said. He ruled out excluding the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring investor pressure to bear. Spokespeople for MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones and Stoxx also cited engagement with companies as a key reason for retaining polluters on indices. All of the index providers argued that they offer investors choices for how they structure their portfolios and that it was not their responsibility to rule out entire sectors. The index firms do offer sub-indices that exclude fossil fuel producers and they run profitable and growing businesses that can produce bespoke indices for investors. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “It’s daft that these oil, gas, and mining giants are allowed to be labelled as businesses with ‘strong environmental practices’ when their whole business model is predicated on extracting and burning fossil fuels. This speaks to a wider need for regulatory clarification on what constitutes a green investment but in the meantime a little common sense wouldn’t go amiss.” She added: “Investment firms and index providers must take responsibility for the products they market to consumers and implement stricter rules for qualifying for ESG indices. So much is at stake.” Index providers have previously resisted activist pressure to adjust their ESG indices but the activists have also scored some notable successes. Dow Jones Sustainability Indices removed Golden Agri-Resources, a Singapore-listed palm oil company, from ESG benchmarks in December, after Friends of the Earth accused the index of “greenwashing” a company behind deforestation. “There’s a lot of hiding behind opaque metrics of what sustainability investing is,” said Gaurav Madan, senior forests and lands campaigner at FoE in the US. He added that companies “hide behind [the] idea of engagement” with boards to improve practices.",Ethical business; Stock markets; Corporate governance; Investing; Business; UK news; Dow Jones; FTSE; Greenpeace; Environment; US news,Business
2018-10-30T16:41:15Z,Fears for hundreds of jobs as Sports Direct buys up Evans Cycles,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/30/fears-for-uk-jobs-as-sports-direct-buys-up-evans-cycles,"Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct has bought Evans Cycles out of administration but has warned that it may have to close half the specialist retailer’s 62 stores, putting about 440 jobs at risk. Evans, which traces its roots back nearly 100 years, had been seeking a buyer after its management team said they needed £20m for a turnaround plan that its former private equity owners were unwilling to fund. Sports Direct bought House of Fraser in a similar prepack deal in August and is also thought to be interested in buying Debenhams, the department store group in which it owns a large stake. Ashley, chief executive of Sports Direct, said: “We are pleased to have rescued the Evans Cycles brand. However, in order to save the business, we only believe we will be able to keep 50% of stores open in the future. Unfortunately, some stores will have to close.” Evans, which employs 1,300 people in total, of whom about 880 work in store, had been struggling to survive amid tough high street conditions that have already seen Toys R Us, Maplin and House of Fraser collapse into administration, and a string of other well-known names close their stores. The cycle retailer also faced fierce price competition, particularly from the fast-growing online sports retailer rival Wiggle. Evans found itself nearly £6m into the red in 2016 and has since faced rising business rates, an increase in the minimum wage and a fall in the pound’s value, which has made imported goods more expensive. In the year to October 2017, its sales rose nearly 2% to £138m, but the company recorded another loss, of £2.5m. Amid the difficulties across the retail sector, the private equity firm ECI Partners, which bought Evans three years ago, and the retailers’ lenders, AIB and HSBC, were unable to agree on a deal to fund management’s rescue plan. James Keany, at the advisory firm CBRE, which is retained to manage property for Sports Direct, said: “We are looking forward to working with landlords in order to help create a sustainable business. We will make contact with landlords over the next few days and discuss the future of individual stores.” Sports Direct’s warning that it was likely to close half of Evans’ stores appears to have come as a surprise to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the advisory firm that sealed the sale of Evans and put it into administration immediately ahead of the sale on Tuesday. Matt Callaghan, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: “Evans is a longstanding, well known and trusted brand with nearly 100 years of heritage in the cycling market. To have managed to preserve the business and transfer all staff to the purchaser is particularly pleasing; 2018 has been a very difficult trading year for the business, in part due to the impact of the extended winter weather in the early part of the year and a lack of cash to invest in stores and develop the online platform. A combination of losses, the capital expenditure requirements and tightening credit has led to a liquidity crunch.”",Frasers Group; Cycling; Mike Ashley; Retail industry; Job losses; Business; UK news; Mergers and acquisitions; Life and style; PwC; Accountancy; Financial sector,Business
2018-08-01T12:08:39Z,E.ON to cut 500 UK jobs as it prepares for energy price cap,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/01/eon-to-cut-500-uk-jobs-as-it-prepares-for-energy-price-cap,"The German energy company E.ON is to cut around 500 jobs across the UK, as it blames the forthcoming price cap for the need to reduce costs. The firm, which employs 9,400 people, said the UK energy market continued to change at an unprecedented rate and was an increasingly competitive environment. E.ON, one of the “big six” energy providers in the UK, said it was looking to reduce numbers across non-customer facing departments as part of ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and “continue to innovate”. E.ON’s chief executive, Michael Lewis, said: “Clearly there are numerous challenges across the energy market and we are dealing with all of them, not least the forthcoming price cap.” The energy price cap is due to come into effect in December.Bills for more than 11m households will be capped, saving people up to £100 a year, according to government estimates. “We’re always looking to make sure we’re equipped to respond to the rapid pace and challenges of the UK energy market and we know we can never stand still if we are to continue giving customers a high-quality and cost-effective service,” Lewis said. “We’ve undertaken a rigorous review of our options to ensure we keep costs as low as possible, become a more agile organisation and remain a sustainable business in the UK.” He said the company had held talks with unions and identified potential reductions of around 500 roles across the UK. It plans to make the redundancies on a voluntary basis where possible. “This is one element of our ongoing transformation which, in total, will help us achieve savings of around £100m across our mid-term plan,” Lewis said. “I’m very aware this will be a difficult time for our colleagues but our aim has always been to keep uncertainty to a minimum and I can assure everyone affected that we’ll be as supportive as we can.” E.ON said it was not yet possible to say how many workers at individual sites or specific business areas would be affected by the proposals.",E.ON; Business; Energy industry; Utilities; Job losses; UK news,Business
2018-08-13T18:46:09Z,Facebook exec: media firms that don't work with us will end up 'in hospice',https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/facebook-news-media-campbell-brown-hospice,"A senior Facebook executive told Australian media companies that if they didn’t cooperate with the social network, their businesses would die. According to a report by The Australian, Campbell Brown, Facebook’s head of news partnerships, told a group of more than 20 broadcasters and publishers that she wanted to help media companies develop sustainable business models through the platform. “We will help you revitalise journalism … in a few years the reverse looks like I’ll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice,” she said, in comments corroborated by five people who attended the meeting in Sydney on Tuesday. The Australian also reported that Brown said that Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, “doesn’t care about publishers but is giving me a lot of leeway and concessions to make these changes”, although both Facebook and Brown vehemently deny this comment was made, referring to a transcript they have from the meeting. Facebook would not release the transcript from the meeting. During the four-hour meeting, Brown also talked about the company’s decision to prioritise personal posts from family and friends over journalistic content within the news feed. The move has hit some publishers who rely heavily on referrals from Facebook hard. “We are not interested in talking to you about your traffic and referrals anymore. That is the old world and there is no going back – Mark wouldn’t agree to this,” said Brown. In a statement issued on Monday, Brown said: “These quotes are simply not accurate and don’t reflect the discussion we had in the meeting. We know there’s much more to do, but our goal at Facebook – what the team works on every day with publishers and reporters around the world – is to help journalism succeed and thrive, both on our platform and off.” This wouldn’t be the first time that Brown, a former CNN news anchor, has used blunt language in stark contrast with the mealy-mouthed corporate messaging Facebook typically delivers. In March, she told the audience at a conference in London that threatening to sue the Guardian ahead of its Cambridge Analytica exposé on data harvesting was “not our wisest move”. Facebook hired Brown in January 2017 to help build better relations with news organisations after the social network was criticised for its role in disseminating misinformation in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election. “Right now we are watching massive transformation take place in the news business – both in the way people consume news and in the way reporters disseminate news. Facebook is a major part of this transformation,” she said on her Facebook page at the time.

2018-09-12T18:02:38Z,Viral publisher Unilad faces insolvency action by HMRC,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/12/viral-publisher-unilad-faces-insolvency-action-by-hmrc,"The viral publisher Unilad, known for its commitment to student-friendly online “banter”, is facing insolvency proceedings following a demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) amid concerns over the future of the site’s Facebook-centric business model. HMRC issued a winding-up petition against Unilad’s parent company in July, which is due to be heard at the high court next week. Such notices are usually issued when a business has failed to pay its taxes and the company could be liquidated unless it can come to an agreement. “The situation with HMRC is being resolved swiftly,” said a spokesperson for Unilad, who declined to give any further information on the social media publisher’s financial position or why it was facing the demand from the taxman. The British site is currently the fourth biggest publisher on Facebook, according to analysis service NewsWhip, attracting more interactions from readers than major news outlets such as the New York Times, MailOnline, and the BBC. It has continued to rise up the Facebook rankings in recent months despite the social network’s insistence it is changing its algorithm to push higher-quality news in people’s newsfeeds. There are continued concerns over whether such social media-centric publishers can continue to thrive and build sustainable business models, especially while relying on native advertising – where the sites produce their own content such as branded video for advertisers. A spokesperson for Unilad also declined to comment on claims that staff had recently been laid off by the site. There was also no response to suggestions that the company could struggle to pay the site’s original founder Alex Partridge following a lengthy court case regarding his right to a stake in the company. Earlier this year Unilad co-chief executive Sam Bentley left the Manchester-based company following unspecific “allegations of historic misconduct made against the company”, with Unilad saying other staff had been disciplined as a result of an internal investigation. The site began life as a viral Facebook page founded in 2010 by Partridge, an Oxford Brookes university student who coincidentally also founded its arch-rival LADbible. Unilad’s original incarnation was briefly shut down two years later after being held up as symptomatic of “lad culture” and facing a backlash over posts that made jokes about rape and homophobia. The Unilad brand and its Facebook page were later reused for a new site launched in 2014 under the leadership of Liam Harrington and Bentley, who were both in their early 20s. The site’s main Facebook page currently has 40 million followers, who see a mix of lighthearted news stories, memes, and viral videos. On Wednesday afternoon stories include the “Terrifying moment worker discovers dozens of rats under concrete”, a video of a cow with three horns in Brazil, and a tribute post to the BBC series Peaky Blinders. Harrington told the Guardian in 2016 that publishers such as his are “social enterprises that are catering to everyone” and in common with other male-focussed viral publishers, had toned down its more extreme and offensive content and increased the number of features on issues such as men’s mental health. It also has a variety of sites and Facebook pages covering tech, gaming, food, and sport and launched a longform documentary series on the “Dark side of Britain”.",Business; UK news; HMRC,Business
2018-11-27T19:47:41Z,MPs criticise high street fashion's throwaway culture,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/nov/27/mps-criticise-high-street-fashion-throwaway-culture,"Major high street names including Primark, Boohoo and Missguided have come under fire for fuelling a throwaway fast fashion culture that has been linked to the exploitation of low-paid workers in UK factories. Britons buy more new clothes than any other country in Europe and MPs are looking at the environmental and human cost of £2 and £200 T-shirts amid growing concerns the multibillion-pound fashion industry is wasting valuable resources and contributing to climate change. The low prices in Primark stores, where T-shirts can cost as little as £2, were challenged by MPs on the Commons environmental audit select committee, who suggested shoppers viewed its clothing as disposable. “Isn’t the real problem with the fast fashion industry that if you are selling stuff at £5 people aren’t going to treat it with any respect and at the end of its life it’s going to go in the bin?” asked the Labour MP Mary Creagh, the committee chair. Paul Lister, Primark’s head of ethical trade and environmental sustainability, denied that was the case: “We are proud of the quality and durability of our garments. They are not bought to throw away.” Lister said the retailer kept its prices low by shunning traditional advertising, which saved it about £150m compared with rivals and “that goes straight into price”. He said he knew of no one under 16 working in any of its supply factories. “Factory to store, we keep our costs to the absolute minimum and in store we keep margins very tight,” he said. “Our business model takes us to a £2 T-shirt.” While Primark was forced to defend its low prices, Burberry was scrutinised over its now-defunct policy of burning piles of unsold expensive clothes. Leanne Wood, the brand’s chief people and corporate affairs officer, told MPs it was an industry-wide practice: “We’re the only luxury business that’s reported it in their accounts … but it is something that happens in the industry.” Online retailers Asos, Boohoo and Missguided were questioned about the health checks carried out on the large number of Leicester factories they worked with. An investigation by Channel 4’s Dispatches alleged last year UK factories supplying retailers such as River Island, New Look, Boohoo and Missguided were paying workers between £3 and £3.50 an hour. A Financial Times investigation (£) also found examples of exploitation in Leicester factories. Creagh questioned how it was physically possible for Manchester-based Boohoo to sell UK-made dresses for £5 when the hourly minimum wage was £7.83. The company’s joint chief executive Carol Kane said the company did not make any profit on the £5 dresses, which were “loss leaders” designed to attract shoppers to its website. The typically short dresses, made out of polyester and elastane, featured no zips or buttons, so were easy for machinists to run up, she said. “We do not make a profit on a £5 dress,” said Kane, adding that the cost price of the garments was even less at £2.50 to £3. “It’s a loss leader. It’s a marketing tool designed to drive visitors to the website.” Asos and Missguided told the hearing they had pulled production from a number of factories in Leicester that fell short of their standards. The select committee is examining the impact of clothing production, ranging from environmental cost to worker conditions, especially when garments are produced cheaply and quickly in response to fast fashion trends. With 300,000 tonnes of clothing sent to landfill every year in the UK, Primark said it would launch a clothing collection service in all its stores next year in a similar vein to Marks &amp; Spencer’s “shwopping” scheme. But Mike Barry, M&amp;S’s head of sustainable business, said collecting unwanted clothes was not the biggest problem for the industry – it has collected 30m garments over the past decade – but what to to with them, given the lack of a domestic industry to process the material. “It is quite possible to prevent clothing going to landfill but much harder to do something with the fibres you recover.” The environmental cost of UK fashion Britons spend £52.7bn a year on fashion, according to the government-backed Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap). The lion’s share (£47.4bn) goes on clothing while £4.5bn is spent on accessories. The amount of clothes bought each year continues to rise – 1.13m tonnes in 2016, up from 950,000 tonnes in 2012, according to a 2017 Wrap report. The total carbon footprint of the clothing worn in the UK was 26.2m tonnes of CO2e in 2016, up 9% on 2012. The carbon footprint per tonne fell 8% but was outweighed by the increase in consumption. About 1m tonnes of clothing is cleared out of wardrobes every year. Of that, 700,000 tonnes is collected for reuse and recycling with the remainder sent to landfill or incinerated, at an estimated cost of £82m. In the UK, two-thirds of clothing is made from synthetic plastic materials, which are among the leading contributors to microplastic pollution. Up to 2,900 tonnes of microplastics from the washing of synthetic clothing such as fleeces could be passing through wastewater treatment into UK rivers and estuaries, according to a recent Friends of the Earth report.",Fashion; Pollution; Ethical and green living; Retail industry; Primark; Burberry; Burberry group; Ethical business; Environment; Business; UK news; Politics; Recycling; Waste; Boohoo,Fashion
2018-08-14T11:00:02Z,Is there really such a thing as 'Amish Uber'?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/14/amish-uber-small-business-marketing,"Timothy Hochstedler is from the village of Colon, Michigan, which has a small Amish community, and recently started a new business offering horse and buggy rides in his authentic Amish vehicle. So what to name this little venture? Amish Buggy Rides? Tim’s Horse and Wagon? Nope. How about: “Amish Uber”. Genius. Publicity followed – and lots of it. “Uber is a cool thing,” Hochstedler told local news station WMMT. “Every single year something new comes in and Uber is hot right now, so we have the Amish Uber.” Let’s be clear: this is not Uber. In fact, it’s not even close. Hochstedler doesn’t work for Uber. He charges a flat $5 for a ride. There are no other drivers in his company but him. There’s no app, no GPS and no other technology being used. You can’t even find him on your smartphone. If you want a ride you’re going to have to flag him down on the road and hope he’s available. In other words, this Amish entrepreneur is pretty much doing what many others of his like have been doing for centuries: offering buggy rides to wide-eyed tourists and other fascinated bystanders. Except he’s borrowed Uber’s name. And the customers love it! “First time Ubering and we’re riding in a buggy!” one Amish Uber rider said in the WMMT report. “It was fascinating,” said another. “It’s not an activity you typically associate with the Amish.” The customers aren’t the only ones gushing about Amish Uber either. The media has been covering the story like Donald Trump himself is driving the buggy. There are stories about Amish Uber everywhere. Regardless of whether the new venture is a prank or not (and it really could be) I still say: good for him. Premeditated or not, Hochstedler has stumbled on a marketing tactic that always has a decent chance of succeeding: just come up with a product or service that’s comparable to another well-known brand, create a similar name (be careful!) and hope people either confuse your product for the real thing or are so amused by your ingenuity that they buy from you anyway. It’s the copycat model and it’s all around us. Take a quick trip to your local grocery store and you’ll see laundry detergent boxes that look very similar to each other and crackers that are like the original, but aren’t. There are ketchup bottles that look like Heinz … but they’re not. There’s Dr Pepper … and Dr Publix (and Dr Browns too). There’s Pringles … and Chipz. There’s Nike … and, well a bunch of other knock-offs that try to be like Nike. Copycat brands are not a new thing. But are they a sustainable business model? One big downside of all the media attention about Amish Uber is that the attorneys at Uber are sure to have noticed Hochstedler by now and for all we know a cease and desist letter is already in the mail. Then again, it’s possible that Uber has bigger fish to fry and may not want any negative publicity from forcing a sweet Amish guy to shut down his business and therefore may just leave him alone. Regardless of what happens, just remember: this kind of marketing can be effective, but it can also be very risky. I may be enticed to try out a buggy ride with Amish Uber if I’m ever in Colon. But as a long-term business strategy I’m not sure I’m sold that this is the right direction for any entrepreneur.",US small business; Uber; Business; Marketing & PR,Business
2019-02-22T07:30:18Z,Life cycle: is it the end for Britain's dockless bike schemes?,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/22/life-cycle-is-it-the-end-for-britains-dockless-bike-schemes,"Not so long ago, Chinese bike-sharing company ofo was planning to put 150,000 of its distinctive yellow bikes on London streets. Buoyed by $2bn of venture capital funding, ofo was going to “optimise city resources” and “save public space”. Mobike, another Chinese start-up and ofo’s main competitor, was also apparently in the business of tech-altruism. Its journey data would provide “invaluable insights” for local planning departments. But in January, ofo followed oBike and Urbo to become the third dockless operator to withdraw from Britain in just over a year. New data gathered by Oliver O’Brien, an academic at UCL’s Consumer Data Research Centre, shows that the four major dockless operators covered an area of 617 sq km during the peak competition period in July 2018. Of those four, only Mobike remains, and its operating areas have shrunk, to a total of around 37sq km. Yobike operates a smaller dockless scheme in Bristol and Southampton which is not captured in the data. The most dramatic boom and bust was oBike, which put 1,300 bikes in London in July 2017, and withdrew them four months later. Wandsworth council impounded hundreds, complaining the bikes had appeared “without any warning”. In the absence of regulation, operators don’t need to consult councils before launching. It’s impossible to know the exact number of bikes on the streets. Operators are cagey because of high losses to vandalism and theft. In London, O’Brien’s latest count shows just over 2,100 bikes at the end of January, down from a peak of 5,800. But Joe Seal-Driver, a Trustee of CoMo UK, a trade body which represents shared mobility firms, says dockless isn’t dead. “The industry’s taken a breath, there’s been a pause in the expansion of bike services. But you’ve got new operators coming through. The fact that we’ve not seen a model with hundreds of thousands of bikes running for years in the UK yet doesn’t testify to [failure].” Steve Milton, Mobike’s head of growth and PR in Europe, said the company had learned to pick its battles. “Many cities across Europe want bike sharing, while others just put the shutters down. “Do we really want to fight that? Or do we just want to go where people actually want us? For 2019, our focus is building a sustainable business.” Can dockless ever be profitable and sustainable? Milton claims some European cities have already met a break-even target, but will not reveal which ones. Meanwhile Mobike is downsizing its fleets to “avoid an oversupply,” according to Chen Shaohui, the chief financial officer of parent company Meituan, which bought Mobike last April. Ofo shut its international division last month, and has laid off thousands of staff. It is estimated to owe more than 1bn yuan (£114m) in deposits in East Asian markets. When ofo arrived in Sheffield this time last year, Douglas Johnson, a Green councillor, decided he was going to learn to cycle. “I never had a bike when I was a kid, so I thought it was a chance to get to grips with it”, he said. “There was a lot excitement about ofo. The bikes were simple to use, there was no cost to the taxpayer at all.” But with the excitement came the slew of local news reports about bikes dangling from trees and set alight for fun. Just six months later, ofo had removed all 2,000 bikes. “I was sad to see them go. But as I found out a bit more, it wasn’t simply because of the selfishness and destructiveness of Sheffield people, it was part of a bigger global restructure.” As a result of the restructure, Adam Rose, ofo’s former operations manager in Sheffield, was made redundant. “It was really exciting at the start,” Rose said. “It was was all about bringing other cities in, all about land grab. “But then suddenly that all changed. Bikes weren’t being delivered, there were cashflow issues, suppliers weren’t being paid”. Rose himself is still owed £6,000 in expenses and remains unemployed. Sheffield saw the most dizzying success and the most difficult setbacks. “It took all of London a year to hit the rider figures we got by our third week”, Rose said. “It was a big thing in Sheffield, despite the hills, despite the weather. People were raring for it. “Unfortunately we also had the highest vandalism and theft rates. I couldn’t say exactly how many bikes we lost, but it was certainly in the hundreds.” Rose can’t explain the exact reasons for the termination. “We just got told what to do by China, never why. We had to come up with our own assumptions and give our own stories to the staff on the ground.” Sheffield used to have a dock-based bike share system funded by the university and the council. When ofo arrived, that was no longer considered financially viable. The council and the university have no immediate plans to restart the system. In a number of London boroughs, dockless and dock-based bikeshare coexisted. Islington councillor Paul Convery said ofo and Mobike were able to cater to demand that wasn’t met by Transport for London’s Santander Cycles scheme, which is concentrated in the south of the borough. He believes there’s a happy medium. “Mobike and ofo had a crazy, buccaneering venture-capital ethos. They were burning through millions in start-up money. “TfL is the exact opposite, hugely over-cautious about spending, and it really suffers from that. That said, it is meticulously managed and has very high user satisfaction.” For now, Santander’s coverage in Islington remains limited. Ofo has withdrawn, and Mobike’s future is uncertain after its Memorandum of Understanding with the council has expired. Meanwhile, new dockless operators continue to enter the market. Lime, which has put electric bikes in US cities and across Europe, has just launched in Brent and Ealing, while Uber is considering launching its Jump e-bikes in the UK. “Everyone’s trying to be the Amazon of mobility”, said Katharine Butler, co-founder of bike start-up Freebike, in an interview with Yahoo. Mobike’s CTO Joe Xia has talked about the company’s ambitions to cover longer journeys, and even get into “flying cars”. But if the endgame of dockless bike companies is to become “multi-modal” platforms covering a range of different transport types, they’ve hit a bump in the road. Unlike Airbnb and Uber, who outsource costs by minimising fixed assets, the production and maintenance of a dockless bike fleet has proved hugely – often fatally – expensive. Nicole Badstuber, a researcher in urban transport governance at UCL, believes there is a future for dockless, but only if cities take the lead. “The current regulation is not fit for purpose. It treats bikes as clutter rather than as transport. Looking back, councils were on the back foot with dockless, they wanted to see how the market played out. “Our streets are public space, and local government should have powers to guide how companies are using that space. If we want to reduce congestion or see more active travel, cities need to take a more proactive role.” Badstuber cites Bologna, where the council has signed a contract with Mobike to provide its bikesharing service, as an example of close collaboration. In the UK, the Greater London Authority has proposed London-wide regulation of dockless operators, overseen by TfL. Despite the setbacks of the last year, Seal-Driver remains optimistic. “For every problem with bike sharing, there’s a technological solution”, he says. O’Brien proposes a mixture of better incentives for users to help with the onerous task of redistributing bikes, and heavier fines for negligent companies. But clever technological solutions are secondary to economic realities. Turning a profit on rides alone seems improbable when you factor in the costs of replacing vandalised and stolen bikes.

2018-12-04T05:00:23Z,'My life is spent in this car': Uber drives its Indian workers to despair | Amrit Dhillon,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/04/my-life-is-spent-in-this-car-uber-drives-indian-workers-to-despair,"Moham Kumar wolfs down a few spoonfuls of spiced black chickpeas for lunch between passengers. It is 3pm. Kumar has been on the roads of the Indian capital since 9am without a break. He will continue driving until 9pm or 10pm. This is his routine, seven days a week. “When I get home my daughter is asleep. My life is spent in this car,” he says. Kumar is an Uber driver in New Delhi. But the dream he and thousands of other drivers were sold by the company has turned sour. The past few weeks have seen Uber drivers – and those who drive for Ola, the domestic cab aggregator company – on the streets protesting about their conditions, calling their work “slavery”, and demanding that the government intervene. Uber entered the Indian market in 2013. Kumar was one of many poor, semi-literate Indians who left their jobs to join up, taking out a loan for a car, and expecting to significantly increase their earning potential. “They gave us the impression that the sky was the limit in terms of money. They said what we earned all depended on us. I was told by an Uber agent that some drivers were earning up to 90,000 rupees [£1,015] a month,” says Kumar. He became a “driver-partner”, in Uber parlance, in early 2016. By working about 10 hours a day, he was able to manage his monthly instalment on the car loan, the cost of fuel and maintenance, and enjoy savings of around 50,000 rupees – an astronomical sum for any Indian driver. “For the first time in my life, I could put some money away,” he says. The crash, when it came at the end of 2016, was brutal. “Uber reduced the rate per km charged to passengers from 10 rupees [11p] to just six rupees. We used to get an incentive of 2,000 rupees every day once we had completed a dozen rides. This was cut back to just once a week for doing 40-50 rides. And they hiked their commission from 20% to 25%,” says New Delhi Uber driver Naresh Kumar (no relation). Certainly, my ride is cheap. The 5km journey in an air-conditioned WagonR costs me 90 rupees – around the same as a hot, windy, uncomfortable ride in an auto-rickshaw. Indian passengers are thrilled with the low fares. But these rates – along with the other measures – are a disaster for drivers. They cannot reduce the size of their monthly car repayments. Those who want to sell the car and get out cannot do so as the resale value won’t be enough to repay the loan. And while the ride rates have fallen, the price of petrol and diesel have gone up. “They are locked into a form of bondage,” says Gautam Mody, secretary of the New Trade Union Initiative, a relatively new national organisation. While many drivers angrily accuse Uber of making false promises, even “guarantees” about income, Mody concedes it is probably unlikely that the San Francisco-based company promised specific numbers in its advertising. What isn’t known is how its agents projected the work. And the fundamental point, in any case, says Mody, is that Indian drivers with barely an education but a strong desire to support their families are vulnerable when anyone promises them a better life. “The fact is that Uber created a perception that spread by word of mouth. I know not just of drivers who left OK jobs, but of office employees – lower level accountants and bank clerks – who left their jobs to earn better money as Uber drivers,” says Mody. Sunil Borkar, head of a Mumbai union that represents Uber drivers, says drivers had been lured into working for the company with big promises and then left high and dry after Uber changed the terms. “Now they are saddled with car loans they can’t pay off. Some are desperate – breaking their backs and just breaking even, if that. There is no exit for them,” says Borkar. Borkar says that Uber and Ola officials have refused to meet union representatives. He wants the Mumbai authorities and those in other states to force the two companies to increase the fares by between 25% and 50%. When Ramesh Sethi recently visited an Uber office outside Delhi, pretending to be interested in joining, he was given the hard sell. “They told me I could earn big sums, that I could save as much as 40,000-60,000 rupees a month after expenses if I worked hard. They said it all depended on the hours I was prepared to put in,” says Sethi. They also held out a bait: join right now by paying a 2,000 rupee fee and we will give you a 5,000 rupee lump sum the moment you start. Borkar says the chief minister of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, has agreed to meet him soon to try to resolve the problem. But Mody says ad hoc meetings in one state or the other are not the answer. “The crux of it is that it’s a lawless industry. It needs to be regulated to protect both passengers and drivers,” he sau. An Uber spokesman said: “Over the past two years, as the popularity of our service has increased, we have moved from a startup mode to a more sustainable business model and started to reduce higher levels of incentives while investing more in drivers and our products for the long term. Hence, while driver incentives across India have tapered from the 2016 levels, earnings have largely remained sustainable and consistent over the past several months. “We keep experimenting with our incentive structures, which may differ from city to city and can vary between one driver partner to another, based on the kind of incentive structures they opt for. That said, we are focused on ensuring that offering trips through the Uber App remain attractive. Driver earnings across India have largely remained sustainable and consistent over the last year.” The spokesman acknowledged that recent fuel price increases have impacted earnings, and said the company had introduced a mechanism to ensure driver earnings across India correlate with changes in the price of fuel. The mechanism has been rolled out in Mumbai. He added that Uber is also “working towards providing driver partners access to health insurance, life insurance and micro loans and a host of other benefits aimed at improving their welfare”. • This article was amended on 6 December 2018 to clarify where Uber driver Moham Kumar works.",Private sector; Global development; Uber; India; South and central Asia; Technology; World news; Employment,Global development
2018-07-31T00:56:28Z,Guardian Australia reports its first profit in 2018 annual results,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/31/guardian-australia-reports-first-profit-2018-annual-results,"Guardian Australia has turned a profit and is on a sustainable business footing, five years after its launch. Financial results for 2017-18 released on Tuesday show the organisation making an operating profit of $700,000. Under the Guardian’s business model all profits made are reinvested in journalism. The Australian edition of the global Guardian was founded in 2013 under the leadership of Katharine Viner, who is now editor-in-chief of Guardian News &amp; Media. Now edited by Lenore Taylor, the independent online news site employs 80 staff and has news bureaux in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane. Two years after launching reader contributions, the site has 65,000 paying Australian readers who value its public interest journalism, including reporting on politics, the environment, asylum policy and Indigenous issues. Taylor said everyone involved within Guardian Australia had worked hard to create “a new independent source of quality Australian news in a media market that’s becoming ever more concentrated”. “We’re proud Australian readers are enjoying and valuing what we do,” she said. The managing director of Guardian Australia, Dan Stinton, said while other media companies had put up a paywall the Guardian wanted its journalism to be “open and available to all, in order for it to have the greatest impact possible”. “Clearly our readers understand the importance of this – we have 65,000 readers who have made some form of financial contribution to Guardian Australia, and those funds go directly towards producing quality, truly independent journalism,” Stinton said. The membership program was launched in July 2016 and now accounts for 36% of the local website’s revenue, and is up 145% year-on-year. Advertising revenue, including sponsored content produced by Guardian Labs, accounts for the remaining 64%. Stinton said reader support was vital and the company would not have been able to break even without it. “Advertising remains an important revenue stream and is performing well but its future is far less certain due to the increasing dominance of Google and Facebook,” Stinton said. “We will continue to rely on the generosity of readers to grow and support our Australian journalism.” The site’s parent company, Guardian Media Group, has recapitalised Guardian Australia, enabling it to repay the startup loan from the Wotif.com founder and philanthropist Graeme Wood. Guardian Australia has retained a $9m capital fund for investment in the sustainability of the business and possible expansion. Stinton thanked Wood for his invaluable contribution, saying: “Graeme was critical in the setting up of Guardian Australia and we are proud of what we have achieved.” He said the company was now working on a strategic plan for the medium-term future of Guardian Australia. “It’s too early to go into any details now, but it is absolutely our intention to invest more in Australian journalism and become a dominant progressive voice in the Australian media landscape,” he said. The probable merger of Nine and Fairfax Media would create another “formidable competitor” from an advertising perspective, Stinton said. “Guardian Australia’s audience is unique and growing, and this will enable us to hold our own in the market, but reader revenue will become even more critical in the years ahead.” Guardian Australia has grown to become the fifth most popular news website in the country, with 3 million unique visitors every month, according to the latest figures from Nielsen. It has more online readers than News Corp Australia’s mastheads the Australian and the Daily Telegraph. Guardian Australia is part of the Guardian’s 24-hour global news operation, helping to cover breaking international stories in all parts of the world. Since launching its US and Australia digital editions in 2011 and 2013, respectively, traffic from outside the UK now represents more than two-thirds of the Guardian’s total digital audience.",Guardian Australia; Australian media; The Guardian; Australia news; Media; World news,Media
2019-07-01T16:13:37Z,Rental jeans and recycled swimsuits – six revolutionary fashion brands,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/01/rental-jeans-and-recycled-swimsuits-six-revolutionary-fashion-brands,"Globally, nearly three-fifths of clothing ends up in an incinerator or landfill site within a year of being made. Shopping for clothes is no longer a harmless pastime; it is yet another painful frontier between desire and conscience. No wonder so-called “sustainable fashion” is popping up on retail sites from Boohoo to Bloomingdale’s. But Orsola de Castro, co-founder of Fashion Revolution – a nonprofit movement campaigning for a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion industry – dislikes that term. “I just call it good design looking for solutions,” she says. But, whatever you call it, this approach is booming: the fashion search site Lyst recorded a 47% increase in shoppers looking for items through terms including “organic cotton” and “vegan leather” last year, while searches for the sustainable shoe brand Veja were up 113%. From upcyclers to zero wasters, activists to fabric inventors, here are six young labels that offer great design for the thoughtfully stylish – and might just change the way the wider industry thinks about fashion. Econyl – the brand turning old fishing nets into swimwear that can be endlessly recycled Swimwear brands that use postconsumer recycled fabric are garnering a lot of attention. Auria London has dressed Daisy Lowe and Rihanna. Davy J has swimsuits for wild and sporting swimmers. Ruby Moon offers “activewear for activists”. Fisch is stocked at Matches. Mara Hoffman’s pieces sell for hundreds of pounds. But follow the stories of all these labels and you will arrive in the same place: at Econyl, a recycled nylon fibre that its Italian manufacturer claims is “infinitely recyclable”. “At the beginning, many people were laughing at me,” says Giulio Bonazzi, CEO of Econyl’s parent company, Aquafil. An average of 64,000 tonnes of fishing nets are left in the ocean each year, and these were the first nylon items that Bonazzi’s company collected for recycling, initially from the fish farming industry in Scotland and Norway, from professional divers who spotted ghost nets, and now from “all over the world – Japan, Australia, south-east Asia, north and South America”. Lejeune says that, when she started the Ethical Fashion Forum in 2006, plastic as an issue was not on her radar. “That has really changed in the past two years.” There is an obvious and pleasing circularity to the idea of swimmers bathing in recycled ocean waste. No wonder small fashion brands are not the only ones to love Econyl. Gucci adopted the fibre in 2017. Stella McCartney has pledged to stop using virgin nylon by 2020, switching to Econyl (she makes bags with it, too.) The company now has more than 750 fashion clients and “demand is growing strongly day by day”, Bonazzi says. He has his sights set on the plastic industry at large – “glasses, furniture, chairs”, he rattles off – and even nets in which to transport and sell supermarket fruit. Ninety Percent – the brand giving away its profits “We are trying a crazy idea and seeing if it connects with people,” says Shafiq Hassan, co-founder of Ninety Percent, which sells well-cut organic cotton T-shirts, tie-dye hoodie dresses, asymmetric skirts and leisurewear. The brand gives away 90% of distributed profits, putting philanthropy centre stage. The people who make its clothes, in Bangladesh and Turkey, get 5%, the people who build the brand get 5%, and the rest is split between four charities, which consumers help to choose. Each piece’s care label carries a code that shoppers type into the website to vote for their preferred beneficiary. As Tamsin Lejeune, founder of the Ethical Fashion Forum and CEO of the new enterprise Common Objective, points out, Ninety Percent is interesting because “some of the best and most innovative examples of change in the fashion industry are coming from the supply sector”. As for Hassan, his family moved from Bangladesh to England in 1971; and he lived his teenage years listening to John Lennon’s Imagine and Pink Floyd’s Breathe (“Don’t be afraid to care …”). On a sourcing trip for New Look in the early 90s, he drove past the dump near Kamalapur railway station in Bangladesh. The smell was appalling, but worse still he could see “children eking out a living there”, and started to think about a sustainable business model. With his partner Para Hamilton, he set up the charity Children’s Hope (one of Ninety Percent’s beneficiaries). When the pair opened a factory in 2009, they provided a canteen with fresh food cooked daily. Other benefits include health insurance and on-site healthcare (there are now 12,000 employees and the factory has produced clothes for H&amp;M, Debenhams and New Look.) “Younger companies have to lead the way in sustainability,” Hassan says. But while Ninety Percent sounds like a radical idea, it is the result of decades of experience in the Bangladesh garment industry. Some of Hassan’s questions remain. “How can we be an agent of change? How can we share empathy, compassion, value, purpose and transparency? Power to the people, [that] sort of thing.” Matthew Needham – transforming shopping trolleys into raincoats Matthew Needham was an intern at a major luxury brand in Paris where he saw firsthand the degree to which waste is built into the fashion industry. “It takes 10 weeks to order leather from the tannery, so the brands tend to order more colours than they need,” he says. They decide only when they arrive which to use and which to dispose of. “For me, the waste was thoughtless”. He describes himself as an upcycler, an approach shared by fellow designers Bethany Williams, who has worked with materials including book waste, and Helen Kirkum, with her amazing mash-up trainers made from discarded shoes. Needham, like De Castro, believes that sustainability “should be inherent in the design process for everyone”. He finds luxury deadstock before it goes to incineration (“Like the Burberry thing” – where the company destroyed £28m of its own products to guard against counterfeiting). He scours markets, the streets and sometimes his own studio. After a shopping trolley with no apparent owner sat in the street for two weeks, he turned it into a raincoat. Lace-like plastic found on a beach in Norway became a skirt. Often he blends these finds with high-end unused fabric, such as tweed that might have been Chanel, but instead spent years in a warehouse. “I like the idea of considering the value in creativity. Not the value in the materialistic thing itself, but the value in the creativity. That’s luxury. The craft, the skill, the mindset, the thought process that goes into making something,” he says. His work has already appeared in i-D and he is often approached by big-name brands wanting to benefit by association. He usually declines. “For them, I’m a tick box.” Needham creates pieces to order; a deal with a major retailer is only a matter of time away. Being at the start of his career, he says, is a major advantage. “You have the benefit of not being tied down by marketing and business plans. You really have to decide for yourself what you think sustainable is. For me, it’s about using what we have, because we have too much.” Kayu – the brand turning straw into sustainable fashion gold Jamie Lim grew up in Malaysia and Hong Kong. She loved the batik prints her parents wore, the beautiful furniture made of straw. At 17 she moved to the US for university, and each time she went home on vacation she looked for artisanal gifts to take back for friends. As time went by, they became harder to find. Plastic straw began to proliferate. “So that was the impetus of the brand – it started as a way to preserve indigenous techniques,” Lim says. Now, Kayu’s beautiful bags – California-style totes handwoven from natural plant fibres by artisans in Terengganu, Malaysia – are stocked at high-end stores including Liberty, Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and Net-a-Porter. Reese Witherspoon and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, carry them. Crucially, these bags look great. They prove that conscientious fashion can compete with, and lead, the mainstream fashion industry in terms of aesthetics and design. “What they are producing is absolutely beautiful, and completely separate from what you might think of as sustainable fashion,” says Emma Slade Edmondson, a creative consultant who specialises in sustainability and ethics in fashion retail. Lim is also in the process of steering Kayu towards zero waste. Excess fibre from the bags is being made into alphabet tags or pouches, with the proceeds donated to charity. The straw waste is biodegradable, of course, as are the bags, over time, although some of the hardware is not. “At the beginning, people weren’t really on board. Now our customers are asking lots of questions. Is the straw plastic or real? Is it vegan? Have the bags been mass-produced?” And retailers are also asking those questions, Lim says. “Net-a-Porter asks the designers, what are your sustainable initiatives? [And] consumers really demand it.” Mud Jeans – creating a rental revolution in denim “The idea was to make jeans – organic cotton, people getting properly paid,” says Bert van Son, who founded Mud in 2012. Nothing too radical there. “But we soon found out that cotton could be easily recycled. We thought: why not get the jeans back?” Mud offers a choice between buying jeans or leasing them. Those who rent simply swap the old ones for new. “There is a mindshift happening,” Van Son says. “We used to have a 50/50 split between people renting and buying. But over the past 12 months the leasing has grown. People like to take another colour, wash or style after a year. They’re happy to send back their old jeans and get a fresh pair.” As the rental side of the business grows, so, too, does the proportion of postconsumer recycled waste that the label uses. Initially, Mud jeans blended 20% recycled denim with 80% virgin cotton. Now, the recycled proportion accounts for up to 40%. Next year, Van Son is “hoping to announce the first 100% recycled postconsumer pair of jeans”. The important word in that sentence is “postconsumer”. Other forms of recycling may repurpose offcuts from the factory floor, but postconsumer recycling finds a new life for a garment that might otherwise go to landfill. More than a billion pairs of jeans are sold globally each year, while less than 1% of materials used to produce clothing is recycled into new clothing. At Mud, the buttons are made of stainless steel, which can be recycled. “The paper tags are cradle-to-cradle certified. We don’t use leather. We are making the pocket linings out of 100% cotton”. And then? “We will try to get biodegradable polyester stitching lining”, says Van Son. “We are purists.” Birdsong – the brand that brings you face to face with its makers Anyone buying a piece from Birdsong will come face to face with its maker. The London social enterprise label, which majors on statement tees and classic shifts, puts photographs of the women (they are all women) who cut, sew, embroider or knit the clothes on its labels. This is not a gimmick. Birdsong’s creators, Sophie Slater and Sarah Neville, started out working in women’s charities. They personally know the 12 to 50 people who make the clothes. “We never set out to make a fashion brand,” Slater says. “We just loved fashion as the conduit, a way to use these women’s skills to bring about change.” Now the clothes are sold in more than 30 countries. The brand was born out of feminism and the Fashion Revolution movement. Slater and Beckett wanted to take the clothes that were being made in daycare centres and sold in bring-and-buy sales, and showcase them on a stylish website. “Then we had the idea of collaborating with all these amazing feminist photographers,” Slater says. She enlisted activists she knew how to model the clothes and adopted the slogan: “No sweatshop &amp; no Photoshop.” Now Birdsong has its own designer, bringing shape and coherence to the talents of the makers. To reduce waste and overstock, the knitwear designer Katie Jones has created a template for crocheted blocks that can be quickly sewn into sweaters or cardigans, depending on orders received. “Traceability and transparency are big priorities,” says Emma Slade Edmondson (she suggests checking out another brand, Know The Origin, too). Slater, for instance, knows the Birdsong makers by name, pays them a London living wage, and has even been to a family wedding. “I guess our mission is to create beautiful things the women enjoy working on, and give them a revenue stream.” Birdsong’s place in the fashion industry is changing, too. “When we used to be invited to events, it was to give a talk at a hemp convention,” Slater says. But at a recent industry breakfast with representatives from well-known high-street brands, some of Slater’s fellow attendees were discussing whether sustainability was a trend. “I stood up and said, ‘We’ve got 50 harvests left!’” she says – referring to the news that soil fertility will be eroded in the UK in the coming decades. “Me and my friends working in ethical fashion always said we felt like the geeks and the fashion people were the cool ones. Now it feels like they are really paying attention.”",Fashion; Life and style; Ethical and green living; Fashion industry; Environment; Sustainable fashion,Fashion

2018-08-21T20:57:45Z,Steve McClaren and QPR dazed and confused after shambolic start,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/21/qpr-bristol-city-championship-match-report,"“Shambles.” That’s the word QPR fans Simon, 58, and Reg, 70, quickly settle on when asked to describe the current state of their club. It is exactly the same word that springs from the mouth of 18-year-old Matthew, another supporter awaiting this fixture: a must-win game for the Hoops just four games into a fledgling Championship season. It is a fair assumption that the subsequent 3-0 home defeat will have done nothing to change their minds. QPR remain bottom of the championship after unravelling in the face of a persistent Bristol City. Matty Taylor’s ruthless opener was followed by a second-half double for Andreas Weimann, with both of the Austrian’s goals made far too easy for him by a shambolic home defence. There’s that word again. Sometimes the mood can be unfairly volatile in football but QPR’s recent trauma has been worse than most. The club have had four defeats in their first four matches, the third a 7-1 walloping at West Brom for which Steve McClaren felt necessary to apologise in his programme notes. This performance was not much better, but looming over the club are more existential concerns too. This summer the club accepted a £17m fine from the EFL over FFP irregularities and were put under a transfer embargo. That takes effect from January. In this window QPR have not spent a penny in transfer fees. For Simon and Reg, the trouble lies at the top and a lack of accountability from the director of football, Les Ferdinand, and the chief executive, Lee Hoos. For Matthew, the immediate problem lies with McClaren. All three question the wisdom of replacing the previous manager, Ian Holloway, after he kept the Rs clear of the drop zone last season. Sporting that familiar half-dazed expression, the beleaguered McClaren used his post-match remarks to reinforce the need for signings – whether on a free transfer or on loan – before the window shuts for EFL clubs at the end of this month. “The next 10 days are big‚“ he said. “We have talent out there, we have potential, but right now we’re suffering. I believe, if we get the right players in, we’ll be ok.” McClaren was asked for his response to the home fans who joined in with Bristol City chants of “You’re getting sacked in the morning,” whether out of gallows humour or otherwise. “That’s society now, it’s an instant reaction,” he said. “It’s not a good start [to the season]. Am I pleased? No. Am I angry? Yes. Disappointed? Yes. Am I determined to put this right? Yes.” Bristol City have not enjoyed a great start to the season themselves and were yet to win in the league before this fixture. They took the lead in a first half of few chances after the former Bristol Rovers front man Taylor cut inside from the right, leaving full-back Jake Bidwell on his posterior, and fired low past Matt Ingram into the far corner. The visitors did not take long to double their advantage. Five minutes into the second half, Swedish winger Niclas Eliasson was found in space on the left of the QPR box. His cross was quick, accurate and found Weimann in lots of room. The former Derby forward had time to size up the situation, fling his head at the ball and place it beyond Ingram’s right hand. It was at this point that the away fans began to sing at McClaren. Beneath them, in the School End, stood an empty tier of seats. Parts of the rest of the ground were sparsely attended too, a reminder that the problems QPR face have not sprung up overnight. Hoos said recently that the club would have to leave Loftus Road, their home since 1917, as a ground with a capacity of 18,439 could not “create a sustainable business”. The attendance for this match was 11,739. As normal time came to an end Weimann tapped home a third after a bout of chaotic defending. “Why the hell are you still here?” sang the away end at those few home fans still remaining. “Where’s the money gone?” was another one. QPR’s settlement with the EFL was a reckoning after the club broke fair play rules on their way to promotion to the Premier League in 2012. Those days seem a long way away now.",QPR; Bristol City; Football; Sport,Football
2018-06-17T06:00:06Z,Singing Sainsbury’s boss still has to convince the critics,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/17/singing-sainsburys-boss-mike-coupe-asda-merger,"Get out your tap shoes: Mike Coupe is doing a show. Yes, the tuneful Sainsbury’s boss – who was captured on camera singing the 42nd Street number We’re in the Money on the day he unveiled controversial plans to merge with Asda – is set to perform again this week, this time in front of an audience of parliamentarians. Roger Burnley, Coupe’s opposite number at Asda (plus Asda’s sustainable business director, Christopher Brown, and Sainsbury’s director of brand, Judith Batchelar), will also be there in supporting roles. They will face questions from the environment, food and rural affairs select committee on their plan to create a group controlling 31% of the grocery market. Coupe has claimed the tie-up will benefit consumers via 10% price cuts on “many of the products customers buy regularly”, and the committee will probably want to examine that pledge. MPs might ask: do you know how many products? (“You hum it son, I’ll play it”); and how long will the price cuts last? But those questions are merely a segue into this committee’s chorus, which goes: are you planning to cut prices by bullying your suppliers? The problem for Coupe is, to answer that one, he might need footwork fancier than Fred Astaire’s. Conventional economic theory suggests that one of the most effective ways of bringing down prices is competition, but his deal reduces it. The merger would create a much more powerful buyer, in an industry that has shown a fondness for squeezing suppliers hard enough to create a choir of sopranos. Conversely, established grocery players have gone to great lengths to demonstrate how they don’t really enjoy competing very much at all, and only tend to give it their best shot when they get forced into it. Despite all the platitudes from British supermarkets about how hard they’ve always battled with each other, it actually took a couple of German upstarts to barge their way into the market to remind the incumbents what competition actually entails. When shoppers started to defect to the discounters Aldi and Lidl, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Tesco and the like suddenly found new – previously impossible – ways of cutting prices. It is hard to see how that innovative spirit will be fostered if a larger entity can achieve similar results just by kicking suppliers. Tesco, along with a combined Sainsbury’s/Asda, would control more than half of the UK grocery market, which is close to being a working definition of a duopoly. However much Coupe wants to argue that local competition has been enhanced by the growth of Aldi and Lidl, such a concentration of national power is tricky to ignore. The weakness of Coupe’s defence is betrayed by some wobbly-looking arguments. He memorably claimed that an expanded Sainsbury’s would have only 26% of the market, not the 31% estimated by independent agencies, but you can tell he’s really straining to hit that note. To get there it is necessary for him to include M&amp;S and Boots – but Boots is only a grocer if you live off a diet of Ribena and low-calorie sarnies. Of course, if Coupe were thinking about the Asda tie-up motivating the enlarged group into developing leaner, more productive processes, then we might speculate that his subconscious mind would have alighted on a different ditty from 42nd Street when announcing the deal. “If you’re wise, exercise all the fat off”, the lyrics of Keep Young and Beautiful go. “Take it off, off of here, off of there.”",J Sainsbury; Asda; Business; Retail industry; Supermarkets; Mergers and acquisitions,Business
2018-05-31T07:44:59Z,"Big four banks quit coal only to invest in other fossil fuels, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/31/big-four-banks-quit-coal-only-to-invest-in-other-fossil-fuels-research-finds,"Australia’s big four banks have significantly increased investment to projects that will expand the fossil fuel industry as they claim to support efforts to limit global climate change, according to new research by the environmental finance group Market Forces. The report shows the banks have effectively walked away from coal, after years of increased pressure from the environmental lobby and customers wanting to deal with sustainable companies. None of the big four banks has invested in new coal projects since 2015. But a spike in finance for new oil and gas projects has, according to Market Forces’ head of research, Jack Bertolus, put a significant dent in those green credentials. “It’s all well and good to commit to ‘two degrees’ [the Paris target to limit climate increases above pre-industrial levels] but you’ve got to back it up with action, and it’s plainly obvious that we can’t be expanding the size of the fossil fuel industry. That’s what the science says but it’s also common sense.” Market Forces found that big bank lending to new fossil fuel projects increased by 50% in 2017, a total of $2.265bn up from $1.509bn the year before. ANZ topped the list, lending $905m, an increase of 93% from 2016, which included investment in gas fields in North Sumatra and in the Ichthys field off the northern Australian coast. The report says ANZ, CommBank, Westpac and NAB banks have provided direct project finance for 17 new fossil fuel projects since making commitments to the Paris target. “Over their lifetimes, these projects are expected to enable 4.9bn tonnes of CO2, enough to cancel out Australia’s emissions reduction target more than five times over,” the report says. Bertolus said banks had clearly realised that investment in coal was not worth the damage to their reputation. But he said it was hypocritical to get public relations mileage on one hand, and on the other continue to fund oil and gas projects. “In a sense it doesn’t matter if you’re funding coal or oil and gas – if it’s inconsistent with two degrees it’s essentially a race to the precipice,” he said. The report is particularly critical of ANZ and CommBank’s funding for fossil fuels. NAB is the best of the big four, putting considerably less into fossil fuels but still more than on renewable energy projects. “There are plenty of choices outside of the big four that don’t fund fossil fuels at all, and in some cases have active policies about not funding the fossil fuel industry,” Bertolus said. ANZ has publicly stated it supports the goal of attempting to limit climate increase to 2C above pre-industrial levels. “ANZ as a responsible and sustainable business is playing its part to support the transition to a decarbonised economy,” it has said. A spokesperson for the Commonwealth said the bank’s coal funding had been “trending down for some time” and was relatively small. The bank described gas as “a transition fuel”. “We expect that trend to continue over time as we help finance the transition to a low carbon economy. “CBA has been supporting the shift in the Australian economy towards low carbon energy alternatives, with a significant movement from coal towards renewable energy, and gas as a transition fuel.”",Banking ; Mining; Australian economy; Banking; World news; Australia news; Business,Australia news
2018-09-30T08:00:48Z,Labour has caught the mood of the times. Now it needs new ideas to remake capitalism | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/30/labour-has-caught-mood-of-times-needs-new-ideas-to-remake-capitalism,"Labour, by common consent, is winning the battle of ideas. Even as shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s plans for reshaping British capitalism were being dismissed as a regression to statism and trade union power, his critics were bemoaning that the Tories’ response was either a pale imitation of the same or a reheated and tired Thatcherism. Worse for his critics, McDonnell was winning a hearing because he spoke to widely held concerns about the economy. Suddenly, the economic debate has broken out of the ascendancy of variants of Thatcherism. As an advocate of stakeholder capitalism for more than 20 years, I was both taken aback and pleased to find McDonnell praising the ideas on the Today programme – and just as taken aback that some Tories want to develop their own version. But stakeholder capitalism is not a series of half-remembered magic solutions to breathe new life into traditional socialism or relegitimise free-market conservatism. It is a self-standing, distinct set of interlinked propositions about how capitalism can be made to work for all, requiring a radical change of mindset from the traditional left and libertarian right alike. The starting point is that the capitalist firm is of necessity a social organisation. Entrepreneurialism is not about a succession of individualistic sole traders having lightbulb moments that can only turn into successful businesses if there is little regulation and minimal tax. Rather, wealth-creation, innovation and productivity growth reside in the complicated business of marshalling people and resources. This requires lots of compromises and trade-offs, in substantive institutions that work better the stronger the social glue and shared sense of purpose. That means being animated by more than simply making profits, crucial though that is to the life of the enterprise. Purpose – to create “the happiness of its members” (John Lewis), say, or to make “a better everyday life for the many” (Ikea) – brings the unity of vision around which the firm can manage all the competing claims upon it. Moreover, that purpose is the key to building any sustainable business and means it cannot be a vehicle solely to enrich those at the top. Seen through this prism, workers are not locked in a do-or-die struggle with capital to which the resolution is the socialisation of production. Rather, they are in a complicated relationship of interdependence, resolving conflicts in a joint project of creating great goods and services. In the 1970s, leftwing trade union leaders Hugh Scanlon and Rodney Bickerstaffe were bitterly opposed to workers on boards as proposed by the Bullock commission under James Callaghan: it was a betrayal of socialism’s existential struggle with capitalism. Today, John McDonnell has crossed a line: by wanting workers as shareholders and represented on boards, he signals that capitalism can be made to work for the common good. His comrades from the 1970s would turn in their graves. Scorn has been hurled at his proposed inclusive ownership funds, demanding that every company with more than 250 people progressively allocate 10% of its shares to be held on the employees’ behalf – but with dividends going to the state after the workers have each received £500. It is confiscatory and a backdoor tax increase. But if you recast it as a compulsory employee stock ownership plan, then it is trying to achieve what George Osborne’s 2013 Enterprise Act attempted but failed miserably to do; not one firm has launched an Osbornian employee ownership scheme. This is only the beginning of a very long march. If McDonnell wants to reshape capitalism rather than abolish it, then he needs to further change his mindset and think more systemically. For example, he would have been wiser to plump for another model of employee ownership – the voluntary employee-owned trust– than his controlling, top-down variant. For what stakeholder capitalism aims to achieve is a private sector that improves worker and customer welfare within its own terms. The state sets the framework: it pump-primes; it strategises; it may even create a sovereign wealth fund, but all designed to achieve stakeholder vibrancy. On this, McDonnell said nothing. Worker directors, which he advocates, risk suffering acute conflicts of interest in today’s unreformed firms, as the old left feared (and many board fear too). It is stakeholder companies, unified around a common purpose, which dissolve structural conflicts. This world is already being tentatively embraced, as would be clear to him and critics if they had read the latest Financial Reporting Council’s corporate governance code. It even calls for boards to experiment with a worker-director to guarantee the firm’s purpose. McDonnell could build on these. He could propose a new Companies Act to make a commitment to purpose a condition of forming a company. Companies need more long-term, engaged, substantive shareholders on whom they can depend. He could turn his attention to Britain’s asset management industry and direct it to take its obligations to steward companies much more seriously. He could explain how he wants to reshape the financial system to lower the cost of capital. He could wean himself off an instinctive reflex to nationalise by embracing different corporate forms through which social benefit can be delivered. He could declare that his aim is to create a new generation of great British companies whose strength will be built on the new communities of interest between repurposed trade unions, customers and long-term shareholders. He could build a great political coalition of the left and the centre. This, of course, would be better done within the EU. Stakeholder capitalism, a revived social contract and stopping Brexit are parts of the same vision – a very different one from the Brexiter notion of a turbo-boosted Thatcherism. Labour is inching nearer to a position that would win a public vote and be the basis for national renewal thereafter. There is no other viable political force or set of propositions to save the country. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",John McDonnell; Labour; Politics; UK news,Opinion
2018-05-31T22:55:32Z,"Franchisees advised to steal workers' wages, inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/franchisees-advised-to-steal-workers-wages-inquiry-hears,"The parliamentary inquiry into the franchise sector has been handed a “chilling” succession of similar stories by small-business owners who claim franchisors suggested they should steal wages from vulnerable workers. Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who is deputy chair of the committee investigating franchising, told Guardian Australia the inquiry would need to look at how franchise business practices encouraged the exploitation of workers. In a published submission to the inquiry, a former Muffin Break franchisee, Faheem Mirza, said he was told “to consider underpaying staff that I can trust”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The key message was that as migrants, I must be aware of other migrants or students who would gladly accept underpayments in lure of their first job and hence not report or complain,” Mizra said. “So, if I were able to exploit my employees I could generate a profit. Otherwise there is no other cost that can be managed enough to reverse this loss-making scenario.” Foodco, the franchise operation that owns the Muffin Break brand, said it “strongly refutes this false allegation”. Another small business owner, from a different franchise group, told Guardian Australia he was advised by an associate of the franchisor that he should exploit staff on 457 visas by demanding kickbacks. The business owner said he was later told by his staff that a wages rort – which involved paying foreign workers the standard rate, then demanding a portion be returned in cash – had been in place before he bought the business. “The whole suggestion was that we could get away with it, because they wouldn’t speak out. We just said: ‘We won’t do that,’ ” he said. O’Neill said there had been many confidential submissions to the inquiry and that stories about wage theft were common. Guardian Australia reported last month that many franchisees were afraid to speak publicly because of concern that doing so would violate agreements that were heavily weighted in favour of brand owners. “We’re in a situation where across the country people are independently putting forward evidence to the committee where they’re too frightened to have their name put to it,” O’Neill said. “But there’s a consistency of storytelling here. They’ve been sold a business model that too often depends on wage theft to make a sustainable business. “There’s a chilling similarity in the stories. That’s why they have such credibility. They’re doing it confidentially for fear of retribution.” Rob Whittet and Emma Forsyth, from Toowoomba, in Queensland, estimate they lost $2.5m on failed Jamaica Blue franchises licensed by Foodco. “It’s destroyed everything we had,” Whittet said. “We lost a property we owned outright. We had an investment property, we’re now living in.” Whittet said the business model he was sold was, in reality, not profitable while paying staff the minimum wage, even when he and Forsyth were working more than 80 hours a week and not drawing a wage. Regardless of whether his business turned a profit, the master franchise always got their cut, because royalty fees were based on turnover. He said franchisors should have a stake in the profitability of businesses, and ensuring that franchisees met their obligations to pay staff and bills, which meant ensuring standard practice was for royalties to be paid based on a percentage of profit, not turnover. Foodco said in a statement: “We take very seriously our obligations to ensure our franchisees comply in the important area of lawful employment practices. “Far from encouraging this practice of underpayment, in January 2017 Foodco entered into a voluntary partnership with the office of the fair work ombudsman by way of a proactive compliance deed. “We regularly audit our network to ensure compliance issues are identified and remedied as quickly as possible.”",Business; Australian economy; Australia news; Australian politics,Business

Last week, the young-fashion brand Boohoo had 486 dresses available online for less than £5. Many – like a black bandeau jersey bodycon number – were just £3.75, meaning the delivery charge cost more than the contents of the package. Rival Asos was offering 257 dresses and 2,141 different tops for less than £10. Now, however, some fashion experts believe the party could be coming to an end for such disposable clothing and a backlash could be brewing, just as it has against takeaway coffee cups, plastic packaging and meat. Overall, the fashion industry as a whole is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. If trends continue, the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050. In the past 15 years, global clothing production has doubled to meet demand. But it has left a trail of cast-offs, with more than half of fast fashion items thrown away in less than a year, according to the consultants McKinsey. Disposing of clothing and household textiles costs the UK alone about £82m a year, according to a 2014 study by the government-backed recycling charity Wrap. In 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production globally totalled 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, according to a report by the industry-led Circular Fibres Initiative. This is more than the emissions of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. Less than 1% of the material used to produce clothing globally is recycled into new clothing, with 12% recycled into other products such as insulation or mattress stuffing. With a parliamentary committee set to produce a report on the issue in February and concerns about plastic pollution spurred by the BBC’s Blue Planet documentary now turning to microfibres from clothing, industry insiders believe a backlash against fast fashion is on the way. Mike Barry, director of sustainable business at Marks &amp; Spencer, said: “The signals are [fashion is] on the same trajectory as plastics and forests and alternatives to meat. These were all underlying concerns that got through to the mainstream consumer. “There is not an obvious consumer backlash against fast fashion today, but it would be a very brave business leader who didn’t look into the next 12 to 18 months and say we are not heading there. Every business leader in the fashion industry knows that clothing will have the same level of questioning and challenging that food has had for years. “It is going from being a business-to-business and risk-management issue behind the scenes to a consumer issue, in the same way as plastics and deforestation linked to palm oil have been in the last 12 months.” His hunch is backed up by research that suggests shoppers have already begun buying clothing less frequently. In 2018, a third of consumers bought clothing once a month, down from 37% in 2016, while those buying every two or three months or less rose from 64% to 67%, according to the market research firm Mintel. Samantha Dover, senior retail analyst at Mintel, says nearly half of consumers say they prefer to buy clothing from companies trying to reduce their impact on the environment, and that rises to 60% among under-24s. “People are far more interested than before in knowing exactly where products are coming from and how they are being made,” Dover says. She says consumers are still more interested in the price and style of the clothing than where and how it has been made, but that change is coming. With that in mind, switched-on clothing companies are no longer just setting up a few racks of eco clothing in the corner of a store but considering how to make their entire range more sustainable. The government-backed sustainable clothing action plan, whose signatories include Next, M&amp;S, Ted Baker, Primark and Asos, has committed nine major retailers to reducing waste being sent to landfill, water use and carbon footprint by 15% by 2020. The government also wants to introduce extended producer-responsibility schemes for household and commercial textiles and clothing, similar to those currently in place for batteries and electronics, which would force companies to pay for the recovery of waste. But it is a slow process, with consultation promised only by 2025. Mary Creagh MP, chair of the parliamentary environmental audit committee, which has been investigating fashion industry sustainability, says the timetable is too slow. “We have only got 12 years to tackle damaging climate change,” she says. “We as consumers have to ask questions of brands. Brands have to make it part of what they do. These are massive companies run by some of the world’s richest men. Someone is doing OK out of it.” Creagh adds that cheap fashion comes with a social as well as an environmental cost – with low-paid workers overseas unable to provide for their families. “We are not saying to people on a low income you can’t buy cheap clothes. We are saying it is time that the cost should reflect the true cost of the minimum wage and decent working conditions and growing stuff without pesticides. It needs to be sustainable from top to bottom and we don’t think the true cost is a £5 dress. That price is not being paid by us, it is being paid by someone else and the environment.” Testifying to Creagh in parliament, Boohoo said that its £5 dresses were intended as loss leaders on which the company made no profit. It has also previously said that it takes sustainability seriously: ‘The youthful demographic of our customer means that education is key and we use our huge reach across social channels globally to help share ideas of how a garment can be utilised in their wardrobe again and again. We are also working with reGAIN, a company that allows users to recycle unwanted clothing to prevent them from going to landfill.” Environmental campaigners say people who want to be more sustainable should choose quality clothes and make them last as long as possible by learning to repair or rework them. Buying secondhand or vintage clothing, considering renting outfits rather than buying, and washing garments less often at lower temperatures in a full machine can all help. In many ways, younger people are ahead of the game, using trading sites such as Depop and Thredup to resell and upcycle clothing. Even cleaning and mending services appear to be in vogue. Earlier this month, H&amp;M brought its free mending service to the UK, making it a key part of a store revamp in Hammersmith. The brand is jumping on a bandwagon kickstarted by ethical brands such as Patagonia, which makes 40,000 repairs a year at its service centre in Reno, Nevada. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles-based sports shoe cleaning specialist Jason Markk opened its first London store in March on Carnaby Street. It claims its “sneaker care technicians” have professionally cleaned more than 50,000 pairs of shoes since opening in the US in 2014. Recycling is also becoming mainstream, with Primark set to launch a clothing take-back scheme in 2019, joining similar efforts by M&amp;S and H&amp;M that have been in operation for several years. Barry at M&amp;S, which collects about 3 million items a year via its “shwopping” scheme, says it is only part of the answer. “The challenge is not getting clothing back: it’s what to do with it,” he says. About 1.2 million tonnes of fibre from clothing is sold in the UK every year, about half of which is cotton, a third synthetic and the rest viscose or animal products such as leather. Reprocessing these fibres is tricky, according to Mark Sumner, a lecturer in sustainable fashion at the University of Leeds. Most fabrics are a mix of different kinds of thread – such as cotton and Tencel for a T-shirt – and there are currently no commercial-scale facilities that can separate and reprocess such fabrics. Strong modern dyes are also extremely difficult to remove so, meaning that recycled threads cannot be recoloured. Sumner says: “The more you process and play with them the worse they are and the quality reduces. “Recycled fibres through traditional routes are poor quality.” Sumner and Barry say the government and businesses need to fund research into how good-quality fibres can be reprocessed on a large scale to build a closed-loop industry. “If we can find a way of recycling, we can think about the UK being an exporter of those fabrics or rescuing our textile industry. There is an economic story there,” Sumner says.",Retail industry; Fashion industry; Recycling; Ethical and green living; Marks & Spencer; H&M; Primark; Next; Asos; Business; Sustainable fashion,Business
2018-08-26T06:00:07Z,Trump sees win with push to reform quarterly earnings reports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/26/trump-quarterly-earnings-reports-six-month-system,"Donald Trump may be roiling financial markets, threatening to widen a trade war or predicting “the market would crash” if he is impeached, but one presidential endorsement has some American CEOs cheering. Last week, the president tweeted that he had asked the world’s “top business leaders” what would improve their lives. Their answer? Stop the current system of reporting earnings every three months and move to a six-month system. “That would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money,” Trump wrote. “I have asked the SEC to study!” American CEOs loved Trump’s tax cuts. But since then they have increasingly been at odds with the White House on subjects ranging from immigration to trade. Reform of the earnings calendar might win Trump a few more fans back. Why the idea of changing the quarterly earning system should come up now isn’t hard to grasp. In June, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase; Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway; and the Business Roundtable, an association of nearly 200 CEOs from major companies, penned a joint letter titled Short-Termism Is Harming the Economy. Reporting company results four times a year is just too much, they argued. In view of their “responsibility to leave behind a stronger, more prosperous society than the one [they] found” the CEOs called on public companies to consider moving away from providing quarterly earnings per share guidance. “In our experience,” they wrote, “quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.” Quarterly earnings per share guidance had contributed to a shift away from long-term investments and “caused companies to hold back on technology spending, hiring and research and development to meet quarterly earnings forecasts”. Moreover, Dimon and Buffett said, the pressure had contributed to the decline in the number of public companies in America over the past two decades. Their proposal, they said, built on a Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles manifesto US business leaders developed in 2016 and would advance business practices that “create value for millions of Americans without sacrificing the transparency and accountability that investors deserve”. The idea was then picked up by the outgoing PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi who, Trump later reported, had told him over dinner at his golf retreat in New Jersey: “Two-time-a-year reporting, not quarterly.” The idea has some academic backing, too. Tensie Whelan, founding director of New York University’s Stern’s Center for Sustainable Business, recently wrote that the need to hit quarterly targets had led to “unprecedented share buybacks which artificially boost stock prices, non-strategic cost-cutting, less investment in longer-term basic and applied research (versus product development), as well as an unhealthy pressure on labor costs”. Quarterly reporting began in the US in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash when regulators wanted to give investors a more frequent opportunity to look under the hood of the publicly traded companies they were investing in. The US Chamber of Commerce thinks scaling back reporting frequency because what befitted a 1930s-era disclosure system “no longer meets the needs of a 21st-century economy”. Others, like the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, argue there should be a deal in which regulators offer to reduce frequency of reporting if investors get information about changes more quickly. He told the Wall Street Journal that the aim of reducing reporting costs is “something that investors should want as well”. While flipping back to to a biannual system would bring the US in line with Europe, which scrapped rules requiring quarterly earnings reports after the global financial crisis as part of a drive to reduce the bureaucratic burden on businesses, others believe that cutting down the frequency of financial performance information doesn’t solve the underlying problem of earnings manipulation. “If you bring it down to twice a year then you’ll get manipulation twice a year instead,” argues Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “If the goal is to eliminate earnings manipulation, this isn’t the way to do it.’ Elson argues that quarterly reporting is like the speedometer in a car, useful to check once in awhile but not crucial to the overall journey. The only number with any significance for judging a business, he says, is the year-end number. Getting rid of quarterly reporting, he says, is “a solution in search of a problem”. If there is an issue, it’s about how management communicates with analysts, he says. “A management that plays with numbers ultimately gets discovered. If you have a bad quarter and can explain why, people give you the benefit of doubt – that’s called communication.” The best way to solve the issue of “short-termism” identified by Dimon, Buffett and Business Roundtable is not to offer less information because that doesn’t solve the issue of poor management. “It’s not that what they are suggesting is terrible it’s just not a solution to the problem they’re responding to,” Elson says. “The way to avoid mismanagement is for the board to insist that management runs the company not for a quarter but for long-term results.” The proposal to maintain or scrap quarterly earnings reporting ultimately falls under the purview of the SEC. The commission chairman, Jay Clayton, said in a statement that Trump had “highlighted a key consideration for American companies and, importantly, American investors and their families – encouraging long-term investment in our country”. Whether or not that will prove to be the case remains to be seen.",Business; Donald Trump; US news; Stock markets,Business
2018-09-08T08:15:20Z,Join the club: how Burning Man festival and co-ops are helping shape journalism,https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/sep/08/membership-puzzle-burning-man-co-ops-journalism,"I’ve never associated the Burning Man community and arts festival with news sites. I didn’t come to my current job expecting that a group of volunteers who built a jumbo jet disco camp in the desert would be natural subjects for a study about membership models for supporting journalism. Yet the field badly needs to enlist expertise and diverse contributions, so I commissioned a researcher to help our Membership Puzzle Project at New York University so we could look at less obvious fields including open-source software, faith-based groups, alternative currencies, eco-communities and communes. At the project, where I lead research into sustainable business models for journalism, I encourage design and audience development teams to seek research subjects and experimental areas that can initially seem out of reach. Studying the needs of “extreme users” – those who might comprise a cause or organisation’s most loyal 1-10% – can help us develop insights and designs that better serve 90-99% of other prospective users. Members of the Big Imagination art group brought a Boeing 747 aircraft – and an accompanying disco party – to Burning Man in 2016. The effort to bring a plane to the dry-lake playa required thousands of hours with volunteer members. Some people spent a week at a rented house in the Mojave desert in the summer months preceding the festival for hands-on work. They gutted, reconstructed, extended, and reinforced the plane, then refurbished the cockpit and installed new staircases. They moved the wings, landing gear, and upper half 500 miles to Black Rock City, the location of Burning Man, where they bolted the rest of the plane together. For our research team at Membership Puzzle, it served as a highly visual example of collaboration on a shared endeavour, with people of varying levels of expertise in different areas. We can learn a great deal more from these highly committed people than we can from those who engage in activities more casually. I believe that we can come away with more that’s useful to us, and faster, from studying members of a kibbutz who live, work, and prosper or fail financially together than those at a co-op grocery store who may participate a few hours a month and with less at stake. I don’t have anything against the latter’s method of food shopping: I just want our team to start with the most provocative examples to best shake up our thinking. This led us to interview a member of the Israeli kibbutz Mishmar Ha’emek on the topics of trust, privacy, and inclusion, even when it would have been simpler for us to talk to nearby members of the famed Park Slope Food Co-op. What does this look like in practice? At the Membership Puzzle Project, we regularly interview people who support independent news organisations with their time, expertise, ideas, and money. With our director, Jay Rosen, we’re delving into research on ways that journalism organisations are diversifying their revenues, with a particular focus on membership programmes and optimising news for trust. The Guardian is among the sites we study, and we partner with the Dutch news publisher De Correspondent, who use members’ own skills and knowledge to enhance their product. Some contributors, many of whom have never worked in a newsroom, act as volunteer comment moderators and fact-checkers. Most commonly, their contributions are in the form of a financial donation to a news site, which is highly valuable as advertising revenue declines and the costs of reporting news rise. Yet we’re increasingly compelled to learn about those who can give not financially, but in their time. One thing we hear frequently is that no matter what they can offer, supporters want to experience an authentic sense of belonging in the organisations they support. Given this insight, our team of researchers and I have been learning what it means to live and work in community with others whose values are aligned with ours (note: this doesn’t just mean “people like me”). We’re filling in gaps in our understanding about what “community” actually means in practice. We do this by interviewing and observing people who take part in activities completely: that is to say, they practice with others daily, are deeply passionate about what they affiliate themselves with, and perhaps use their involvement to earn their livelihoods. Recently we’ve been investigating what the news industry can learn from other member-driven movements. Journalism’s traditional financial models are dying. We’re asking: could churches, environmental movements, and open-source communities hold clues to its survival? As Zeynep Tufekci argued in a different context in the New York Times, it pays to “develop respect for hard-earned expertise in areas other than our own” if we want to improve our industry. So that’s what we did. Over six months researchers including Laura Ballay, JP Gomes, Corinne Osnos, Daniel Stringer, Cherie Hu, Matt Thompson, and Gonzalo del Peon interviewed dozens of leaders and members in organisations around the world, with an emphasis on member motivation, participation, and scale. The question for our team was: what clues might we glean from other membership veterans and pioneers? How are they tackling their own challenges? And how might news organisations emulate some of those techniques, be inspired by their thinking, or learn from their examples? We found that membership models are fundamentally different from subscription or product models – and that they require whole new methods to be successful. Membership isn’t just “subscription by another name”, though it’s often referred to that way, or about giving consumers access to a product. It’s participation in a larger cause that reflects what people want to see in civil society. In membership, there’s a different social contract or value proposition between the site and its members. At the basic level of “What do you give? What do you get?”, subscribers pay their money and get access to a product. But members join the cause and participate because they believe in it and want to help effect change. Emily Gologoski is research director at The Membership Puzzle Project.

2020-03-27T06:00:49Z,'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19,"Of the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I’d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I’d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I’d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated containment level 3, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney’s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be “of the type used in the nuclear industry”; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials. But Heeney couldn’t take the risk. Understandably, he didn’t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. “It’s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don’t know who they’re passing on the bus or the train,” he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. “I don’t have time to get sick,” Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University’s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He’s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom. Since 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods – a platform, in vaccine parlance – that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (£1.6m) to fund research into a universal flu vaccine – one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. “It’s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,” Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: “Let’s do with this what we’re doing with the flu.” Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines; it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine – the quintessential silver bullet – has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don’t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ’s genetic code – its DNA or RNA – which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies. Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines in development around the world – in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, moved into human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a “world indoor record”, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Nothing has ever gone that fast.” Until this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick; a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told New Scientist magazine that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work. The thrust of this revolution – the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all – can seem godlike. But the next two stages – testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use – remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines – DNA or RNA vaccines – have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there’s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we’ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months. If a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment – not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won’t be the last. The climate is warming, we’re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we’ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make. * * * Heeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. “I’m a scientist,” he said. “I can’t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.” Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease’s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. “We thought: ‘OK, this is a coronavirus. It’s going to be a tough one.’” The first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. “Some collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,” Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn’t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them. In its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body’s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that’s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years. The latest class of vaccines – the type that Heeney works on – hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA; these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures; once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases. In the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell – just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories. It wasn’t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ’s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it. That’s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan’s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had posted online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA – ribonucleic acid, its genetic material. For scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus’s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within. Shortly after the coronavirus’s sequence was published, Heeney’s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens – what portions of the virus – can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them. The first thing Heeney’s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down. When, after a few days, they had selected their antigens – the spike protein, but also some others – the biologists in Heeney’s lab looked for their “blueprints”: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes – made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA. These minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it’s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice. In all of this, no one in Heeney’s team handled the coronavirus itself; in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, “no one outside China had isolated the virus”. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they’d grown cultures of the virus. Braving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. “I wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They’ll be important for us down the line,” Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. “When I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can’t do that any more.” Unlike Heeney’s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it’s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. “There are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,” he said. But if even one succeeds, “then we’ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines”. * * * To an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage – when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials – is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers. Regulatory trials take months or even years because, for one, they can’t go faster than the rate at which humans metabolise vaccines. But they’re also time-consuming because so much is at stake, and because it’s impossible to predict how our complex physiology will react to a new vaccine. These trials determine if a vaccine is safe, what its dosages should be, how effective it is, and what its side effects are. In the US, 90% of drugs fail to make it past these trials. The overriding purpose of the process is abundant caution; a vaccine that unexpectedly proves harmful is the industry’s worst nightmare. In the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops; nearly 150 of them died. The field’s classic reference text, Plotkin’s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to “the Cutter incident” – a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10. The US’s strict rules to regulate vaccines emerged, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether; others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies. In the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process – politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope – that there’s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 – like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford’s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon’s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life; one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die. So Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain–Barré syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition. The vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after; by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain–Barré. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know; the counterfactual – no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic – was hidden from view. This vaccine’s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people. Already, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using “a solid flu vaccine … on corona”. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies – one of them Moderna – have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn’t be rushed. “There will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,” Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. “We have to avoid overpromising, because if there’s an accident with one of those first vaccines – if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, ‘New vaccine threatens survival’ or some ridiculous headline – then people won’t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking here.” Among the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford’s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert’s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. “Please do not contact me about volunteering.” Gilbert’s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that “you can’t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.” Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said – it’s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren’t being exposed to the virus at all. “This is herd immunity – good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,” she explained. The best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic’s peak – pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. “So we’d really be pleased,” Gilbert said sternly, “if everyone will just do what they’re being told and stay at home.” * * * At some point in March, Heeney’s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning; once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. “The coronavirus dominates our days,” he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. “There are conference calls, there’s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there’s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There’s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.” Like every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive; so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. “If you’re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you’re going to need billions and billions of dollars,” Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic. Most of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” (It isn’t, the analysts concluded.) Diseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. “We have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,” Hotez told me. If the business wasn’t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he’d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez’s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19. When Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged; one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez’s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. “Sars dropped off their list of priorities,” Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez’s collaborators at Baylor, told me. “We had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.” The industry’s attention is easily diverted, Hotez said. “It’s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.” So much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can’t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated – a bumper payday from billions of doses – or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? “At some point, there will be a go/no-go decision to make for companies,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. “And then they’ll have to figure out if it’s worth the risk.” One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US passed a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices. At the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who’d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she’d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. “If we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,” Weller told me. “We have to do it so that the risk is shared.” Two years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi’s funding – about $740m – comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi’s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials. One of Cepi’s ambitions is to create its own “investigational stockpile” of vaccines – vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage – which must be conducted in a real outbreak – and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside individually with manufacturers. This disappointed me; for a second, I’d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic – a Svalbard against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude. * * * A week after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college; he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. “It’s not like I’ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,” he said. He was full of praise for his team – “all these bright, talented individuals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery”. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. “It was crazy. I thought: ‘Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?’” His lab is still running trials in mice. It’s a long process, he said. “You take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We’re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn’t.” It’s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. “You know, I think it’s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,” Heeney said. “The trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I’m wrong. I really hope I’m wrong.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",Coronavirus; Vaccines and immunisation; Infectious diseases; Medical research; Microbiology; Biology; Science; World news; Health,World news
2019-03-11T06:00:06Z,"Greta Thunberg, schoolgirl climate change warrior: ‘Some people can let things go. I can’t’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant,"Greta Thunberg cut a frail and lonely figure when she started a school strike for the climate outside the Swedish parliament building last August. Her parents tried to dissuade her. Classmates declined to join. Passersby expressed pity and bemusement at the sight of the then unknown 15-year-old sitting on the cobblestones with a hand-painted banner. Eight months on, the picture could not be more different. The pigtailed teenager is feted across the world as a model of determination, inspiration and positive action. National presidents and corporate executives line up to be criticised by her, face to face. Her skolstrejk för klimatet (school strike for climate) banner has been translated into dozens of languages. And, most striking of all, the loner is now anything but alone. On 15 March, when she returns to the cobblestones (as she has done almost every Friday in rain, sun, ice and snow), it will be as a figurehead for a vast and growing movement. The global climate strike this Friday is gearing up to be one of the biggest environmental protests the world has ever seen. As it approaches, Thunberg is clearly excited. “It’s amazing,” she says. “It’s more than 71 countries and more than 700 places, and counting. It’s increasing very much now, and that’s very, very fun.” A year ago, this was unimaginable. Back then, Thunberg was a painfully introverted, slightly built nobody, waking at 6am to prepare for school and heading back home at 3pm. “Nothing really was happening in my life,” she recalls. “I have always been that girl in the back who doesn’t say anything. I thought I couldn’t make a difference because I was too small.” She was never quite like the other kids. Her mother, Malena Ernman, is one of Sweden’s most celebrated opera singers. Her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor and author (named after Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated how carbon dioxide emissions could lead to the greenhouse effect). Greta was exceptionally bright. Four years ago, she was diagnosed with Asperger’s. “I overthink. Some people can just let things go, but I can’t, especially if there’s something that worries me or makes me sad. I remember when I was younger, and in school, our teachers showed us films of plastic in the ocean, starving polar bears and so on. I cried through all the movies. My classmates were concerned when they watched the film, but when it stopped, they started thinking about other things. I couldn’t do that. Those pictures were stuck in my head.” She has come to accept this as part of who she is – and made it a motivating force instead of a source of paralysing depression, which it once was. At about the age of eight, when she first learned about climate change, she was shocked that adults did not appear to be taking the issue seriously. It was not the only reason she became depressed a few years later, but it was a significant factor. “I kept thinking about it and I just wondered if I am going to have a future. And I kept that to myself because I’m not very much of a talker, and that wasn’t healthy. I became very depressed and stopped going to school. When I was home, my parents took care of me, and we started talking because we had nothing else to do. And then I told them about my worries and concerns about the climate crisis and the environment. And it felt good to just get that off my chest. “They just told me everything will be all right. That didn’t help, of course, but it was good to talk. And then I kept on going, talking about this all the time and showing my parents pictures, graphs and films, articles and reports. And, after a while, they started listening to what I actually said. That’s when I kind of realised I could make a difference. And how I got out of that depression was that I thought: it is just a waste of time feeling this way because I can do so much good with my life. I am trying to do that still now.” Her parents were the guinea pigs. She discovered she had remarkable powers of persuasion, and her mother gave up flying, which had a severe impact on her career. Her father became a vegetarian. As well as feeling relieved by the transformation of their formerly quiet and morose daughter, they say they were persuaded by her reasoning. “Over the years, I ran out of arguments,” says her father. “She kept showing us documentaries, and we read books together. Before that, I really didn’t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted,” he says. “She changed us and now she is changing a great many other people. There was no hint of this in her childhood. It’s unbelievable. If this can happen, anything can happen.” The climate strike was inspired by students from the Parkland school in Florida, who walked out of classes in protest against the US gun laws that enabled the massacre on their campus. Greta was part of a group that wanted to do something similar to raise awareness about climate change, but they couldn’t agree what. Last summer, after a record heatwave in northern Europe and forest fires that ravaged swathes of Swedish land up to the Arctic, Thunberg decided to go it alone. Day one was 20 August 2018. “I painted the sign on a piece of wood and, for the flyers, wrote down some facts I thought everyone should know. And then I took my bike to the parliament and just sat there,” she recalls. “The first day, I sat alone from about 8.30am to 3pm – the regular schoolday. And then on the second day, people started joining me. After that, there were people there all the time.” She kept her promise to strike every day until the Swedish national elections. Afterwards, she agreed to make a speech in front of thousands of people at a People’s Climate March rally. Her parents were reluctant. Knowing Thunberg had been so reticent that she had previously been diagnosed with selective mutism, they tried to talk her out of it. But the teenager was determined. “In some cases where I am really passionate, I will not change my mind,” she says. Despite her family’s concerns, she delivered the address in nearly flawless English, and invited the crowd to film her on their mobile phones and spread the message through social media. “I cried,” says her proud dad. People with selective mutism have a tendency to worry more than others. Thunberg has since weaponised this in meetings with political leaders, and with billionaire entrepreneurs in Davos. “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act,” she told them. Such tongue-lashings have gone down well. Many politicians laud her candidness. In return, she listens to their claims that stronger climate policies are unrealistic unless the public make the issue more of a priority. She is unconvinced. “They are still not doing anything. So I don’t know really why they are supporting us because we are criticising them. It’s kind of weird.” She has also been withering about leaders in the US, UK and Australia who either ignore the strikers or admonish them for skipping classes. “They are desperately trying to change the subject whenever the school strikes come up. They know they can’t win this fight because they haven’t done anything.” Such blunt talk has found a broad audience among people jaded by empty promises and eager to find a climate leader willing to ramp up ambition. Thunberg’s rise coincides with growing scientific concern. A slew of recent reports has warned oceans are heating and the poles melting faster than expected. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the dangers of surpassing 1.5C of global warming. To have any chance of avoiding that outcome, it said, emissions must fall rapidly by 2030. That will require far more pressure on politicians – and nobody has proved more effective at that over the past eight months than Thunberg. The girl who once slipped into despair is now a beacon of hope. One after another, veteran campaigners and grizzled scientists have described her as the best news for the climate movement in decades. She has been lauded at the UN, met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, shared a podium with the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and has been endorsed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. You may think this would put the weight of the world on the 16-year-old’s shoulders, but she claims to feel no pressure. If “people are so desperate for hope”, she says, that is not her or the other strikers’ responsibility. “I don’t care if what I’m doing – what we’re doing – is hopeful. We need to do it anyway. Even if there’s no hope left and everything is hopeless, we must do what we can.” In this regard, her family see her Asperger’s as a blessing. She is someone who strips away social distractions and focuses with black-and-white clarity on the issues. “It’s nothing that I want to change about me,” she says. “It’s just who I am. If I had been just like everyone else and been social, then I would have just tried to start an organisation. But I couldn’t do that. I’m not very good with people, so I did something myself instead.” While she has little time for chit-chat, she gets satisfaction from speaking to a big audience about climate change. Regardless of the size of the crowd, she says she does not feel the least bit nervous. She seems incapable of the cognitive dissonance that allows other people to lament what is happening to the climate one minute, then tuck into a steak, buy a car or fly off for a weekend break the next. Although Thunberg believes political action far outweighs individual changes to consumer habits, she lives her values. She is a vegan, and only travels abroad by train. At its best, this sharpness can slice through the Gordian knot of the climate debate. It can also sting. There are no comfortable reassurances in her speech, just a steady frankness. Asked whether she has become more optimistic because the climate issue has risen up the political agenda and politicians in the US and Europe are considering green New Deals that would ramp up the transition to renewable energy, her reply is brutally honest. “No, I am not more hopeful than when I started. The emissions are increasing and that is the only thing that matters. I think that needs to be our focus. We cannot talk about anything else.” Some people consider this a threat. A handful of fossil fuel lobbyists, politicians and journalists have argued Thunberg is not what she seems; that she was propelled into prominence by environmental groups and sustainable business interests. They say the entrepreneur who first tweeted about the climate strike, Ingmar Rentzhog, used Thunberg’s name to raise investment for his company, but her father says the connection was overblown. Greta, he says, initiated the strike before anyone in the family had heard of Rentzhog. As soon as she found he had used her name without her permission, she cut all links with the company, and has since vowed never to be associated with commercial interests. Her family says she has never been paid for her activities. In a recent interview, Rentzhog defended his actions, denied exploiting Greta and said that climate change, not profit, was his motive. On social media, there have been other crude attacks on Thunberg’s reputation and appearance. Already familiar with bullying from school, she appears unfazed. “I expected when I started that if this is going to become big, then there will be a lot of hate,” she says. “It’s a positive sign. I think that must be because they see us as a threat. That means that something has changed in the debate, and we are making a difference.” She intends to strike outside parliament every Friday until the Swedish government’s policies are in line with the Paris climate agreement. This has led to what she calls “strange contrasts”: balancing her maths homework with her fight to save the planet; listening attentively to teachers and decrying the immaturity of world leaders; weighing up the existential threat of climate change alongside the agonising choice of what subjects to study in high school. It can be gruelling. She still gets up at 6am to get ready for school. Interviews and writing speeches can leave her working 12- to 15-hour days. “Of course, it takes a lot of energy. I don’t have much spare time. But I just keep reminding myself why I am doing this, and then I just try to do as much as I can.” So far, this does not appear to have affected her academic performance. She keeps up with homework and is in the top five in her class, according to her father. And now that she is active on climate, she is no longer lonely, no longer silent, no longer so depressed. She is too busy trying to make a difference. And enjoying herself. This Friday, when she takes her usual spot outside the Swedish parliament, she will be joined by classmates and students from other schools. “It’s going to be very, very big internationally, with hundreds of thousands of children going to strike from school to say that we aren’t going to accept this any more,” she says. “I think we are only seeing the beginning. I think that change is on the horizon and the people will stand up for their future.” And then the activist slips back into being a teenager. “I’m looking forward to it and to see all the pictures the day afterwards. It’s going to be fun.” • This article was amended on 11 March 2019 to revise an explanation of mutism. An earlier version of the piece said: “People with selective mutism typically do not suffer from an inability to talk; rather, they choose not to engage in conversations they do not consider worthwhile.” This is not the accepted definition. The National Health Service, for example, notes: “Selective mutism is a severe anxiety disorder where a person is unable to speak in certain social situations , such as with classmates at school or to relatives they don’t see very often … A child or adult with selective mutism doesn’t refuse or choose not to speak, they’re literally unable to speak.”",Greta Thunberg; Environmental activism; Climate crisis; Climate science; School climate strikes,Environment
2018-04-06T21:36:00Z,Lewis Hamilton handed five-place grid penalty for Bahrain Grand Prix,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/06/f1-teams-proposal-cheaper-louder-engines-2021,"Lewis Hamilton faces a huge challenge to close Sebastian Vettel’s early lead in the world championship standings after receiving a five-place grid penalty due to a gearbox change the team had to institute after a hydraulics leak at the first round in Australia. A software error cost Hamilton a probable win in Melbourne as the Ferrari driver established a seven-point advantage with victory. After the race Mercedes admitted the British driver suffered a hydraulics leak, adding that he was fortunate to finish the race, let alone in second place. It means Hamilton will start only sixth even if he manages to post the quickest time in qualifying on Saturday. Kimi Räikkönen topped the time sheets in second practice at Bahrain, the only session that takes place in the evening and thus most representative of race conditions, ahead of his team-mate Vettel, with Valtteri Bottas in third and Hamilton in fourth. Daniel Ricciardo in the Red Bull was quickest in the afternoon during FP1. Meanwhile proposals for the future of Formula One including a cost cap and louder engines were received with general approval when presented to the teams on Friday. The sport’s owner, Liberty Media, unveiled its five-point plan outlining its vision of F1 for 2021. However, its objectives remain broad and a considerable and potentially difficult period of negotiation remains. Liberty’s blueprint was a distillation of concepts that have previously been aired by Ross Brawn, F1’s sporting director. The key points include cheaper, louder and simpler engines, that will be more attractive to new manufacturers, and a cost cap, understood to have been set at $150m. The big teams currently spend an estimated $300m. It also contains a proposal for revenue distribution to be more balanced, based on performance, and including a recognition of historical franchises and value – a reference to additional payments to teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, above their share of performance revenue. There is also an intention to have cars better suited to race one another, making the driver the predominant factor and maintaining the unique design while standardising parts that are not relevant to fans. The proposals given to the teams are understood to have included more detail than was publicly released and are crucial to the future of the sport. Christian Horner, who has long been critical of the rules as they stand, was broadly optimistic. “The positive thing is they are focused on the fans,” he said. “On creating a better show, a more affordable F1. The big question is the devil in the detail. They have put big issues up but how is it going to be delivered?” Ferrari and Mercedes have previously expressed disquiet about the proposed changes with the former threatening to leave and the task now facing Liberty is reaching agreement with them. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, believed it was a constructive starting point. “The positive of today is we know what their vision is,” he said. However, he was cautious about the proposed cost cap. “We need to work with Liberty and find a compromise, that number will not be achievable but we are all in the same financial reality.” “My priority is protecting our structure and our people. We have been here a long time and the same with Ferrari and Red Bull, so you need to ask how you can achieve a sustainable business model without having any hardship on anybody.” The teams below them on the grid, for whom this represents a chance to close what has become a vast gap to the top three, were unsurprisingly positive. Claire Williams, the Williams deputy team principal, was enthusiastic. “Everything they presented from revenue redistribution to cost cap is absolutely everything we want to see from 2021 and beyond,” she said. “I’m personally delighted at the proposals.” McLaren’s executive director, Zak Brown, concurred. “I think the direction they’re taking is the right direction,” he said. “The sport starts with the fan and that’s what Liberty are focused on. We all recognise the sport is not where it needs to be today, so it’s in our collective interest to improve the show.”Brawn has described the current regulations as a deterrent to new teams and his plans met with approval from Andy Palmer, the head of Aston Martin. “These prospective changes support many of the requirements needed for Aston Martin to enter the sport as an engine supplier.

2018-02-20T08:54:45Z,William Hill fined £6.2m by Gambling Commission,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/william-hill-fined-62m-by-gambling-commission,"Betting group William Hill has been fined £6.2m by the gambling industry regulator for failing to protect consumers and prevent money laundering. The Gambling Commission said that over the two years to August 2016, the company failed to spot obvious signs of problem gambling, and in doing so breached anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. It is the commission’s second-largest penalty on record, after it fined the betting firm 888 £7.8m last year for failing to protect vulnerable customers. The regulator said that as a result of failings by senior management and staff at William Hill’s online operations, 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences, which resulted in financial gains for the group of around £1.2m. Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, said there were clear warning signs of problem gambling in the spending patterns of some customers that William Hill should have picked up on. “In many respects, this wasn’t properly resourced or staffed, so a lot of the checks weren’t happening. People were potentially able to gamble money that was the proceeds of crime; in one case, money stolen from a local council,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There were clear warning signs, the escalating amount of money that was being spent should have set off alarm bells.” Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party and shadow culture secretary, accused the industry of “turning a blind eye to dirty money”. William Hill will pay £5m for breaching regulations and a further £1.2m for the money earned from the transactions with the 10 customers. The commission said if further failures relating to this case emerge, the firm will forfeit any money made from these transactions. Neil McArthur, executive director of the regulator, said the commission was prepared to use the full range of its powers to make gambling fairer and safer. “This was a systemic failing at William Hill which went on for nearly two years and today’s penalty package – which could exceed £6.2m – reflects the seriousness of the breaches. “Gambling businesses have a responsibility to ensure that they keep crime out of gambling and tackle problem gambling – and as part of that they must be constantly curious about where the money they are taking is coming from.” The commission said that William Hill failed to adequately seek information about the source of their funds or establish whether they were problem gamblers. As part of its investigation, the commission found that one customer was allowed to deposit £541,000 over 14 months, after William Hill staff assumed his income could be £365,000 a year based on a verbal conversation and without further questioning. The customer was in fact earning around £30,000 a year and was funding his gambling habit by stealing from his employer. The betting industry is currently awaiting the details of a government clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which are machines that allow customers to stake up to £100 every 20 seconds on digital casino games such as roulette. It is understood the government is considering tough curbs, potentially cutting maximum bets on the machines to £2. Campaigners against FOBTs claim they are particularly addictive, clustered in deprived areas, and allow gamblers to rack up huge losses. William Hill will now appoint external auditors to review its anti-money laundering and social responsibility policies and procedures. Responding to the fine, William Hill’s chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said: “William Hill has fully co-operated with the commission throughout this process, introducing new and improved policies and increased levels of resourcing. We have also committed to an independent process review and will work to implement any recommendations that emerge from that review. “We are fully committed to operating a sustainable business that properly identifies risk and better protects customers. We will continue to assist the commission and work with other operators to improve practices in the areas identified.”",William Hill; Gambling; Business; Society; UK news; Corporate governance; Sport betting; Sport,Business
2018-05-06T06:00:12Z,WhatsApp founder sends Facebook users a coded message by quitting | John Naughton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/06/whatsapp-founder-sends-facebook-users-coded-message,"Early in 2009, two former Yahoo employees, Brian Acton and Jan Koum, sat down to try and create a smartphone messaging app. They had a few simple design principles. One was that it should be easy to use: no complicated log-in and authentication procedures; instead, each user would be identified by his or her mobile number. And second, the app should have an honest business model – no more pretending it’s free while covertly monetising users’ data: instead, users would pay $1 a year after a certain period. Searching for a name for their service, they came up with WhatsApp, a play on “What’s Up?” Koum was born in Ukraine during the Soviet era and emigrated to the US with his mother and grandmother when he was 16. So his childhood had a background of tapped telephones, thought control and state surveillance. In the US, they lived on welfare in Mountain View, a town in Silicon Valley. Acton, in contrast, grew up in Florida and went to Stanford, where he graduated with a degree in computer science. The two men became friends when they worked briefly at the consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young. They were then recruited by Yahoo, where they spent 10 years, after which they departed with substantial personal savings, took a year out and then turned their attention to what became WhatsApp. From the beginning, WhatsApp was a delight, but it grew slowly at first until Apple enabled push notifications in the iPhone operating system. Koum changed the app so that when a user’s status changed, everyone in that person’s network would be notified. From then on, WhatsApp took off like a rocket. Five years after its launch, it had turned into one of the world’s most popular and profitable smartphone apps. From the outset, Koum stood out from the Silicon Valley herd because of his antipathy to advertising-driven business models and his vigorous dislike of being called an “entrepreneur”: entrepreneurs, he was fond of saying, just wanted to make money, whereas what drove him was creating excellent services with sustainable business models. Pinned to his desk in WhatsApp’s modest Mountain View headquarters was a note written by Acton that read: “No ads! No games! No gimmicks!” And he was adamant that he had no intention of selling WhatsApp to anyone. And then Facebook came by and offered $19bn for the company, which at that moment was valued at $1.5bn. Koum and Acton accepted the offer and instantly became billionaires. Some people were enraged by Koum’s volte face in particular, accusing him of rank hypocrisy. Most observers, though, viewed it with a kind of cynical realism. If money talks – and it always does in Silicon Valley – then $19bn positively screams. Besides, who could blame a lad who grew up poor from grabbing the chance of a lifetime? So WhatsApp became a subsidiary of Facebook and Koum joined the new owner’s main board. The big puzzle at the time was why Facebook had paid so far over the odds for a messaging app. The conventional wisdom was that Zuckerberg &amp; co had noted WhatsApp’s rapid rise and wanted to be able to monetise all the lovely data that would flow from it. Facebook’s algorithms would read WhatsApp messages and use them to target the service’s users. But then Koum and Acton did something that made that impossible – they implemented end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp, which meant that Facebook (and, interestingly, the US government) couldn’t snoop on users’ communications. But the pill was sweetened, at least from Facebook’s point of view, by a decision to change WhatsApp’s terms and conditions to allow Zuckerberg’s crowd to access the phone numbers of the app’s users – unless they had opted out. This was a key moment, because once Facebook has your phone number, then you’re easy meat for identity purposes. In this way, WhatsApp was launched on to the slippery slope that leads to full-blown surveillance capitalism. As it happened, some of us wondered how Koum was viewing the perversion of his dream. Now we know. Last week, the Washington Post broke the story that he was leaving Facebook after clashing with the company’s leadership over WhatsApp’s strategic direction under its current ownership and Facebook’s attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption. What’s not known is whether the Cambridge Analytica scandal played any role in Koum’s decision. But it may not be a coincidence that Acton left Facebook last November and has played a major role in creating Signal , a strongly encrypted and free messaging app, which might just be the obvious destination for WhatsApp users who are distressed by the prospect of becoming advertising fodder for Zuckerberg and his antisocial network. What I’m reading Full Marx Two centuries ago, Karl Marx was born in Trier in Germany. Philosopher Peter Singer has written a judicious assessment of his influence for projectsyndicate.org. Marx thought that the evolution of ideas, religions, and political institutions is not independent of the tools we use to satisfy our needs, nor of the economic structures we organise around those tools, and the financial interests they create. Which is what we’re learning as we assess the impact of tech giants on our world. Vision on Is digital photography real photography? Analogue nostalgia says no. But Finnish photographer Peter Forsgård argues on his YouTube channel that it is – and that we’re just having the same argument that a previous generation had over the Box Brownie.

2019-02-13T12:05:03Z,School climate strike children’s brave stand has our support | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/school-climate-strike-childrens-brave-stand-has-our-support,"We, the undersigned academics, stand in solidarity with the children going on school climate strike on 15 February, and with all those taking a stand for the future of the planet. Nelson Mandela once said: “Our children are our greatest treasure. They are our future. Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.” Human planetary abuse is, in a very real sense, child neglect. As many of us and other fellow academics have indicated previously in this newspaper (Letters, 27 October 2018), the scientific evidence of climate change is clear. For example, the summer of 2018 has been confirmed by the Met Office as the hottest on record for England. The heatwave adversely affected crops across Europe, with wheat and potato harvests reduced by one quarter, which in turn impacted upon food prices. Australia is similarly experiencing “hottest on record” weather events. As citizens across the globe will know and testify, many comparably disturbing examples could be given. We cannot nurture our children without Nature. We are rapidly losing sea ice in the Arctic. The warming of the ocean, the melting of land ice and the ensuing rising sea levels will threaten coasts. In 2018, the European Drought Observatory noted a high deficit in soil moisture across Scotland, Ireland and much of northern Europe. This increases the risk of wildfires, such as those we saw across England in 2018. As well as posing a direct threat to life, fires produce toxic smoke, which is a significant health risk to young and old alike. Sir David Attenborough has warned: “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” Many other organisations, like Extinction Rebellion, are now working to bring the truth about the ecological crisis to the public’s attention. It is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students – some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future – who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action. They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken. We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.

2018-03-12T11:24:55Z,'Social enterprises go bust all the time' - how the sector is tackling its image problem,https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2018/mar/12/social-enterprises-go-bust-all-the-time-how-the-sector-is-tackling-its-image-problem,"When Emily Mathieson set up her homeware business Aerende in 2016, she didn’t know it would be a social enterprise. She hadn’t even heard the term before. Aerende’s products are made by people who face social challenges, including survivors of trafficking and people with learning disabilities. “I wanted to set up a business doing what I wanted to do, and I wanted to make sure it wasn’t going to have a negative effect on the world,” she says. “So I sort of fell into social enterprise.” Fast forward 18 months and, despite a number of big wins and 400% growth year-on-year, Mathieson isn’t sure it’s a sustainable business model. “My commitment to ethics makes everything more expensive and much more time-consuming,” she adds. “My margins are smaller … and a lot of routes to funding are closed to me,” she says. Most social enterprises, including Aerende, are established as a company limited by guarantee, which means there’s no share capital or shareholders, and the business may be excluded from applying for a grant because it is not a registered charity. “Everyone I’ve spoken to has said there’s nothing for anyone to invest in if they can’t have a share,” says Mathieson. “You end up having to compromise, but where do you draw the line [between success and social impact]?” Finding the balance between social purpose and commercial viability is not an uncommon situation for social entrepreneurs to find themselves in. According to figures from UnLtd, a foundation for social entrepreneurs, 71% still struggle to make a living from a social venture. The same proportion struggle to find sustainable revenue streams and 60% find it difficult to access the right kind of finance. Despite the challenges, one in four people who want to start a business want to create a social enterprise. According to the most recent figures from the government, the sector now accounts for 9% of the small business population, employing 1.44 million people. Social Enterprise UK estimates the startup rate is three times that of mainstream SMEs. Peter Holbrook, chief executive of Social Enterprise UK, says the rise of social enterprise businesses could help fix many of society’s ills. “These are businesses that are outperforming traditional SMEs on turnover and innovation, and they are leading the way when it comes to diversity and fair pay, as well as creating jobs and opportunities in the communities where they are needed most.” Demand from the market is fuelling this boom. UnLtd found 73% of consumers are more likely to buy from brands that put purpose before profit. Among those under 35, it’s 81%. But Mona Shah, co-founder of chocolatier Harry Specters, says social enterprises still face wariness from the broader business community. Shah and her husband set up the company, which employs people on the autistic spectrum to make chocolates, after worrying about career opportunities for their son Ash. There are an estimated 700,000 adults with autism in the UK, but only 32% are in some form of paid employment. Since launching in 2013, Harry Specters now employs six staff (full or part time) and has a pool of 20 workers for peak seasonal periods. “There’s a perception people have of social enterprise – they think it’s a charity and equate that with a rubbish product,” she says. “We have to get past that barrier every single time. People read about us employing people with autism and skip the part that says we have won 22 awards in four years. A lot of corporates buy from us but they’re always hesitatant about whether we’ll be able to do it [even though] we have always delivered when no one else would, on a really quick turnaround and with massive volumes. “We’re constantly having to prove we are just as good – even better – than the leading chocolate brands.” That reluctance to do business with social entrepreneurs was noticed by lawyer Abbie Rumbold in a negotiation meeting with a private sector provider of public services. The company wanted payment guarantees in the contract because “social enterprises go bust all the time and we have to protect ourselves”, Rumbold reported. But a subsequent research project in 2014 that spanned 30 years found social ventures were no more likely to fail than other businesses. More recent government figures back this up – almost all (93%) social enterprise employers generated a surplus or profits in 2016, compared to 76% of SME employers. More needs to be done at a policy level to encourage businesses to work with social enterprise, says Mark Norbury, chief executive of UnLtd, particularly when it comes to public procurement in the wake of Brexit. Despite the Public Services (Social Value) Act of 2012, barriers to public procurement can be high, although 54% of social enterprises do some trade. Of those, one in eight have European money of some sort, meaning many will lose significant funding streams after the UK leaves the European Union. “The idea that you’re building a business that’s also doing something good – people get that and they love it,” Norbury says. “But we know not enough customers understand what social entrepreneurship really is. That there isn’t enough capital at the right time that’s affordable and appropriate to social entrepreneurs. And not enough businesses or public sector departments are buying into social firms.” Matthew Thomson, chief executive of Fifteen Cornwall, a social enterprise established in 2006, which has now trained 191 disadvantaged young people to be chefs, agrees. He supports the chair of Social Enterprise UK who recently called for social enterprise to be moved to the remit of the Department for Business, Energy and Industry. “We’ve already made a decision to do something differently,” Thomson says, referring to the EU referendum. “Already that means redefining the way quite a few things work in Britain. That has got to be an opportunity for social enterprise.” Sign up to the regular Guardian B2B email here for more insight and advice direct to your inbox.",Business to business; Small business; Business; Guardian Small Business Network; Social enterprises; Society; Entrepreneurs,Guardian Small Business Network
2018-01-31T06:38:39Z,Dark twisted fantasies: why are sitcoms tying themselves in knots?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/31/why-are-sitcoms-tying-themselves-in-knots-search-party-the-good-place,"The Good Place was enjoyable enough as it was. A cute and clever high-concept comedy from the makers of Parks and Recreation that traced the paranoia-filled days of Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a heartless young woman who is accidentally sent to heaven when she should be in hell. But during the series one finale, what had been a smart sitcom was transformed into something else – something gasp-inducingly, mind-bendingly brilliant – all thanks to an earth-shattering twist. A great plot twist is a thing to be treasured. A floor-buckling revelation that shifts the parameters of a fictional world can leave you reeling for days – sometimes even years. But now the twist is beginning to sprawl outside its natural habitats (the final stretch of a whodunnit; auteur-helmed appointment drama) into less traditional realms, like the sitcom. Alongside The Good Place, there’s Back: the Mitchell &amp; Webb comedy in which Robert Webb plays his Peep Show compadre’s one-time foster brother (is he evil or just extremely lovely?); Search Party, part-mystery noir, part-millennial sadcom, whose twist subverts the entire mystery genre; sci-fi animation Rick and Morty, whose alien adventures are liberally sprinkled with labyrinthine plot twists; and the musical sitcom Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which examines the tropes of mental illness with, according to Vulture, a “fully developed, Lost-style twist”. Why has comedy adopted the plot twist? Partly as a ploy to rejuvenate the slightly stale sitcom format: surprises are funny, and a twist in a sitcom is doubly surprising because you don’t expect it to be there. It’s also something that goes hand in hand with the long-brewing trend for high-concept comedy. A group of mates in a flatshare getting off with each other is no longer a captivating enough USP for a comedy in the crowded landscape of on-demand TV: instead you need zombies (Santa Clarita Diet), post-apocalyptic cannibals (Cockroaches), demons (Crazyhead), a very specific 80s subculture setting (GLOW, White Gold) or to double as a highly sophisticated exploration of identity politics (Transparent, Master of None). One of the most hilarious comedies of last year was Channel 4’s The End of The F***king World, a series about a teen psychopath who runs away with a girl from school in order to murder her. Recently, the real world has been delivering unthinkable plot twists, from Donald Trump’s presidency to the revelation that prolific sex offenders seemingly hid in plain sight in nearly all areas of public life. Not only are viewers’ standards for being genuinely taken off-guard now higher than ever, but recent events mean we’re now constantly anticipating the adrenaline rush of an extreme left-turn. That makes it boom-time for shows with the ability to shake us to the core, such as Charlie Brooker’s tech-centric dark comedy series Black Mirror, which, over its four series, has become steadily more about the world-upending denouement. Also taking cues from old anthology shows like Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone is Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s brilliant BBC series Inside No 9. The pair fuse the horror of those shows with amiable comedy, producing a parade of conscientiously gag-filled half-hour dramas that have become famous for their goosebumpy endings. But as well as mimicking reality, twists also feel like a relief from it. When comprehending the world correctly feels nigh-on impossible, the twist is a safe outlet for feeling thoroughly wrong. The realisation that you have been deliberately mislead means the burden of parsing reality is lifted for a moment – and it makes trawling through your memory for the lies you gulped down and the false micro-assumptions you made a fun game, rather than a postscript to a disastrous decision. Comedy’s newfound proclivity for twists also has its roots in something else: internet fan culture. A key ingredient of prestige dramas like Sherlock, Westworld, The Leftovers and Mr Robot is the online conversation around the plot twists, giving geeky fans something to catalogue as well as the chance to try to outwit the shows’ writers (indeed, Westworld’s creator Jonathan Nolan even changed the plot of series two after fans predicted the twist on Reddit). The Good Place has already seen its twist bear fruit in the form of lengthly Reddit threads and reams of fan-directed content, sporting headlines such as “All the Clues You Missed About The Good Place’s Big Finale Twist” and “The Good Place’ Creator Michael Schur Reveals Five Clues About Season 2”. On the one hand, twist-heavy TV shows make us better viewers. They work as an antidote to compromised attention spans and means those who persevere can appreciate the spine-tingling surprise at the end. On the other, they can produce one-dimensional audiences, greedy for genius twists and merely tolerant of the other forms of storytelling that go into making a TV show. The Good Place has done a sterling job of following up its bombastic revelation with a series of smaller but still very canny twists, there’s little doubt that it’s a case of diminishing returns. While continually blindsiding audiences with gobsmackingly ingenious plot development may not be a particularly sustainable business model for television, in these early days of twisted TV comedy, we can at least sit back and enjoy some brilliantly bumpy rides.",Television; Television & radio; Culture,Television & radio
2018-11-23T09:43:57Z,Society of Editors annual conference - Katharine Viner speech,https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2018/nov/23/society-of-editors-annual-conference-katharine-viner-speech,"This is my first time at the Society of Editors conference… and it was wonderful to get such a warm welcome to the Guardian from the former editor of the Daily Mail. After the speech last night I wanted to say that Alan Rusbridger, my predecessor, was a fantastic editor to work for; he was the first editor who most understood and embraced the digital revolution; and his record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account. Without Edward Snowden, Alan Rusbridger’s Guardian and brave journalists like the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr, we would know far less about the often-insidious influence of the digital platforms. And anyway, I’ve manfully been editor for three and a half years now, so I’d like to talk about the Guardian as it is today, rather than in the past. Thank you to the Society of Editors for inviting me and for hosting this event. I am delighted to be in glorious greater Manchester because it’s always been one of my favourite cities ever since I would visit as a teenager growing up on the other side of the Pennines. I love the people, the attitude; I love Afflecks and the Whitworth and the Royal Exchange Theatre … and of course, I love it because it’s here that the Guardian was founded. Darren Thwaites’ speech yesterday was a wonderful expression of the spirit of this city. I’m going to talk today about how I see the purpose of the Guardian in this political moment, with a particular emphasis on how our readers now help fund us. The Guardian’s history begins in Manchester on 16 August 1819. John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist, had attended an enormous demonstration for parliamentary reform in St Peter’s Field, just ten minutes walk from here. He witnessed how the city’s magistrates, intimidated by the size of the 60,000-strong crowd and their demand for representation in Parliament, ordered armed cavalry to charge, killing 18 people. It’s been dramatised in Mike Leigh’s fantastic new film. Taylor’s relentless effort to report the full story of Peterloo strengthened his own reformist political views. His newspaper, the Manchester Guardian, was launched shortly afterwards with great confidence, by a man who believed that, “in spite of Peterloo and police spies, reason was great and would prevail”. It was founded in a mood of real hope. The story of Peterloo demonstrates that our country’s journey to democracy was a product of ordinary people working together for the common good. Today, we are living through another extraordinary moment in history. If the Guardian was founded in a period of political shocks, popular protests and rapid change, then that all feels very contemporary. We might be here at the Society of Editors largely to reflect on the rapid changes in our own industry, but the societies we report on, and which our readers experience in their daily lives, are every bit as chaotic and disrupted. The world today is a more confusing, contested place than in recent memory. Scientists and the UN tell us we have just 12 years to prevent catastrophic climate change. Humanity has wiped out 60% of the world’s mammals, birds, reptiles and fish since 1970, according to a report last week from the World Wildlife Fund. The excesses of neoliberalism have fostered huge inequality, division and resentment. We hear that advances in technology will make up to one in three jobs obsolete. These global crises coincide with destabilised national politics around the world over the past three years, from Bolsonaro to Erdogan, Salvini to Trump. At home, we face the daily shambles and chaos of the Brexit negotiations, and the widespread collapse of civic life, with public space sold off, and vital services being starved of funding or outsourced or privatised and a new homelessness crisis, particularly acute here in Manchester. It’s no wonder that our lives have become increasingly atomised, with depression and loneliness rising fast. People long to help each other, to be together, to share experiences, to be part of a community, to influence the powers that control their lives. But in everyday life, such togetherness is hard to achieve. In these disorientating times, championing the public interest – which has always been at the heart of the Guardian’s mission – has become an urgent necessity for the media. When John Harris, one of the Guardian’s biggest proponents of getting out and talking to people, made his most recent “Anywhere But Westminster” documentaries in Walsall and Lincolnshire, he kept hearing certain phrases from the public. Phrases like: “Nothing is solid”. “We’ve lost control”. Whether young or old, in cities or in towns, pro-Brexit or pro-Remain, people feel betrayed; undermined; powerless. It isn’t hard to imagine how all this has produced the growing tide of resentment that has shaken our politics, with the desire to belong just as easily finding a home in dark places. But all these crises also recall AJP Taylor’s remark that Peterloo “began the breakup of the old order” – and I cannot help wondering if this is another such moment. What is the media’s role in interpreting these times? How can we answer people’s questions and concerns, providing clarity to help them understand the world? How can we inspire imagination to think of ways out of the crisis that speaks to people’s alienation and their frustration with political elites? How can we make space for hope? For the Guardian I believe there are six ways we need to change and evolve. These principles won’t necessarily apply to any other news organisation of course. 1) Develop ideas, not just critiques First - if people long to create a better world, then at the Guardian we must use our platform to develop ideas, not just critiques. We cannot just criticise the status quo; we must also explore the new ideas that might displace it. The Guardian will always embrace progressive policies and ideas, but in an age of filter bubbles and hyper-partisan politics, we must also make space for different ideas, and diverse opinions. Our guiding focus will be to challenge the economic assumptions of the past three decades, which have extended market values such as competition and self-interest far beyond their natural sphere and seized the public realm. Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty has done that over the past year with a column called The Alternatives. Aditya has talked to the people and communities finding creative new solutions to austerity, to loneliness and social housing, from Preston to Oldham to Wolfhagen in Germany. Whenever possible I want our columnists and reporters to get out of the office and meet people with new ideas. Deliberately seeking out hopeful news hasn’t traditionally been what the media does and I think it has to be done very carefully so as not to be banal. But our global series, The Upside, on the people and innovations trying to find answers to the world’s most difficult problems, has been very popular with readers. Readers like fresh ideas. And this moment calls for them. 2) Collaborate Our second principle is that these times demand greater collaboration. With readers; and with other partners and publishers too. The Guardian has collaborated with more than 100 different organisations on public interest stories over the last three years. Last month we worked together with ITV News to expose some of Britain’s most persistent rogue landlords. We worked with more than 70 news organisations around the world on the Panama and Paradise Papers stories - which exposed tax avoidance on a global scale. And we worked with 17 other news organisations to continue the reporting of Maltese reporter Daphne Caruana Galizia, after she was brutally assassinated near her home, one year ago. We have also collaborated with readers and marginalised communities. In March this year, after a school shooting in which 17 students and teachers were killed at Marjory Stoneman High School in Parkland, Florida, we invited students from the school’s magazine to come to our New York office and to report from the student march against gun violence in Washington DC. The student editors directed our coverage for 48 hours, got exclusive interviews with Bernie Sanders and Marco Rubio, received a special letter from George Clooney, and brought their own, very personal perspectives to a very divisive issue in the US. In a world where reputable media compete for attention not just with each other, but with Facebook, Netflix and hundreds of others, making sure good journalism reaches the biggest possible audience for impact really matters. I loved the way that 20 papers from the north of England came together to campaign on the chaos of the northern rail crisis this summer, telling the government that enough is enough. It was brilliant, and as someone who often takes trains in the north, I understand the pain. If journalists from Johnston Press, Reach and Newsquest can work together, and more importantly - those from Yorkshire and Lancashire - then anything is possible… These collaborations don’t just give us greater reach and impact. They challenge our reporting and the ways in which we represent different communities too - and ultimately improve the journalism. 3) Diversify If we believe listening to people is important, then we must also be constantly thinking about how we make journalism more diverse, more inclusive of different voices, and the communities we report on. If we don’t, we’ll risk becoming ever more distant from people’s lives at this time of crisis; we’ll miss stories, and drive mistrust in the media. People from different backgrounds have different perspectives on what makes ‘news’. Journalists should be part of the communities we report on, not floating above them — a truth demonstrated by how the MEN reported on the Manchester attacks in such a careful and intimate way, allied with the community. This summer we turned over an entire edition of Guardian Weekend magazine to the editors and writers from gal-dem, an online magazine written by young women of colour, for them to guest edit. It made for a wonderful edition, full of life. Liv Little, gal-dem’s editor, wrote that the feedback was overwhelming - with young women messaging to tell her “this is the first time I’ve picked up a paper and it really shows someone who looks like me.” As editors should all reflect on that comment. We intend to follow the example set by ITN and Channel Four, and carry out an audit of pay by ethnicity across Guardian News &amp; Media in the next 12 months, just as we now do for gender. It will help us to be more representative, the 3rd principle, and to make journalism stronger. 4) Be meaningful As I’ve said, these are serious times with big issues often at the forefront. But meaningful journalism about technology, economics, science, fashion, sport and the arts still matter. But readers want to be nourished, not fattened up with junk. They want useful, enjoyable reporting on how we live now, spotting trends, catching the mood, understanding what people are talking about – life-affirming, inspiring, challenging. In print and in digital, we strive to be explanatory, visual, keepable, and above all meaningful. Last week we launched Today In Focus, the Guardian’s new daily podcast, presented by Anushka Asthana. It’s a chance to go deep into a subject and find an audience in new ways and has had a thrilling first few episodes. And last month we re-launched Guardian Weekly, a newspaper that’s nearly 100 years old, as an international news magazine. It’s a beautiful weekly magazine and a way to take a step back and read about the biggest issues from all around the world. So far, Guardian Weekly is performing beyond expectations. And I’m pleased to say that in the first few weeks since launch, by far the biggest group of new subscribers are millennials. It’s probably too soon to say that we’ve reinvented print for a new generation, but it’s pretty exciting. 5) Report fairly on people as well as power The final editorial principle is about the primacy of reporting. If people long to understand the world, then news organisations must provide readers with clarity: facts they can trust, information that they need, reported and written and edited with care and precision. So our most important principle at the Guardian is that we must report fairly on people, as well as power. Too many important stories get “drive-by” coverage, when what they deserve after the big moment is patient attention, forensic reporting which reveals injustice, or gives a voice to the silenced. News organisations must never de-prioritise the vital skill of finding things out, getting to the facts, and reporting them clearly. We all know this can be painstaking, time-consuming work. But that is what getting to the heart of a story as complex as the Windrush scandal requires. Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman spent six months writing on Windrush before we got the government to take notice. Milly’s revelatory reporting initially focused on the human cost of the hostile environment policy: the cumulative impact finally led to a political scandal and the resignation of the home secretary. Reporting on people was also central to the Guardian’s Made In Stoke project this year - an eight-part documentary series on the so-called “Brexit capital of Britain” by John Domokos, who spent time building relationships so he could go beyond the easy headlines and explore how the city is renewing itself. Perhaps the biggest story we’ve run this year has spoken truth not to the politically powerful, but to the new centre of power in the 21st century - Silicon Valley. Observer reporter Carole Cadwalladr spent more than a year piecing together the dodgy digital practices behind the campaign for Brexit and Trump’s election - looking at Facebook in great detail, and making Cambridge Analytica a household name ... until it ceased to exist. Along the way Carole faced legal threats, and vile trolling from some of the protagonists - but she held her nerve and with support from colleagues on the Observer and Guardian she cracked open a global debate on data, privacy and power which is still echoing around the US electoral system, a parliamentary inquiry here in Britain, and beyond. If we don’t find ways to give reporters time and space like this, we risk failing to play the role in public life that citizens expect of the media. Making our journalism sustainable There’s a sixth priority for me at the Guardian too, which is to make the Guardian sustainable and I’d like to tell you the story of how our readers now help fund the Guardian. When David Pemsel and I took over as editor-in-chief and CEO of the Guardian in summer 2015, we were, over our first few weeks, presented with a dramatic set of commercial figures. Month by month, print advertising was collapsing, with new digital ad spend moving almost entirely to Facebook and Google. We realised that we were heading for a very big operating loss. So, as well as tackling costs, we had to find new ways to bring in revenue. The obvious answer was to go to our readers. Last month, we had 176m browsers around the world, with more than two-thirds of them outside of Britain, and many of them have a special relationship with the Guardian. We have more than 1bn page views every month, and meaningful reach like this has built an engaged and meaningful audience too. But could we build a sustainable business model out of those relationships? In 2015 we had an existing membership scheme but it was small - just 12,000 members - with an offer based around events, a special building in King’s Cross, and little editorial involvement. I felt that a dramatic shift was needed and that it should be much more embedded in Guardian journalism rather than something that felt like ‘brand extension’. So I appointed Natalie Hanman, a former opinion editor who deeply understands relationships with Guardian readers in a digital world, to the newly-created role of executive editor for membership. And I asked her to work with Amanda Michel, an American colleague with a background in community journalism and political campaigning and fundraising. They quickly put together a small team drawing on the skills of other journalists, UX researchers and designers, data analysts, engineers, marketing and product managers. They discovered that while our existing members and subscribers preferred to support us through a regular payment, and get something tangible in exchange, a lot of people didn’t want anything. They just wanted to support Guardian journalism directly - at a level and frequency they could dictate and afford. Through some experimentation, guerrilla research and testing, we started to ask people to give us money to fund our journalism and the contributions model was born. Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the Guardian. This was helped by the fact that any money made by the Guardian has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner. This approach is not unusual in the US, where news organisations such as NPR, Mother Jones, the Texas Tribune and ProPublica all look to the support of their readers. But globally, large, newspaper institutions have tended to put up paywalls. In the UK, the idea of a media organisation asking its readers for direct contributions was unheard of at the time. I’ll be honest with you, it really did not have much support inside the Guardian, to begin with – or outside. One journalist kept stopping me in the corridor saying, ‘but I still don’t understand, you give money, but then what do you actually GET?’ Some commercial colleagues were highly suspicious of something so… uncommercial. Why would anyone pay for something they could just get for free. But the readers understood it. The uncertainty from colleagues stopped when they started to see the figures. Since March 2016 I’m pleased to announce today that the Guardian has received financial support from more than one million people. Over half a million of them continue to support us every month - through either a subscription, membership, or a recurring contribution. And since switching on the first contributions test, after the publication of the Panama Papers in April 2016, we have received over 600,000 one-off contributions from 170 countries. More than half of our one-off contributions so far are from the US, and contributions are one of the reasons that the Guardian’s American and Australian editions are now on a sound financial footing. This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the Guardian to break even by next April. And we’re absolutely on track to do that. And last year contributions helped us to grow digital revenues faster than print revenues declined. Contributions is just one part of our new reader revenue strategy. In addition, we have enhanced the Guardian’s premium digital app, which you subscribe to, and print subscriptions are at a record high despite declining newsstand sales. We now make it easy for our audience to support Guardian journalism in a number of ways, while still being free if you can’t afford to pay. Other models like paywalls might work well for other news organisations, but model seems to work for the Guardian. The success of contributions shows is that people do value something that’s also available for free. In fact, many readers have told us they give us money specifically because they want the Guardian to stay free, open and accessible to all, so that progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact. Readers tell us that they want to ensure that more people are more informed – that this is fundamental to the healthy functioning of democracies. They share a passion for the same issues we care deeply about: the climate crisis being top of that list. We are inspired to see that other media outlets are also exploring how their communities of readers can sustain what they do — from eldario.es in Spain to the Bristol Cable. The Guardian’s founding prospectus declared that “no former period, in the history of our Country, has been marked by the agitation of questions of a more important character, than those which are now claiming the attention of the public.” This feels like a similarly critical moment, one that demands that journalism connects with readers as citizens, and inspires them to engage with the world. I think we must use clarity and imagination to build hope. Because the crisis we in the media face is not just about a broken business model. It’s also about people’s growing distrust of media institutions. To face this crisis, we need to ask ourselves how journalism can regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society - and I believe the Guardian’s funding model is a step in that direction.",Press releases; Press releases 2018,GNM press office
2018-04-21T07:00:07Z,'It's about expanding Earth': could we build cities in space?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/21/expanding-earth-could-we-build-cities-in-space,"During the early weeks of his 167-day stint aboard the International Space Station in 2014, astronaut Barry “Butch” Wilmore noticed that a torque wrench was missing. “It’s not uncommon for things to disappear in space,” he tells me over the phone from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “You just don’t have gravity keeping stuff in place.” Wilmore mentioned the missing tool to Nasa’s mission control as he was tending to a 3D printer, a microwave-sized box that extrudes heated plastic to build up objects layer by layer, which was being tested on the space station. About a week later, Wilmore opened the door to the 3D printer to find a perfect replica of his missing wrench. He was thrilled, a moment captured in a photo that was shared with the world’s media at the time. Until that point, the machine had produced only very simple objects. “This was a printed, all-inclusive wrench, with a ratchet mechanism, that worked,” Wilmore says. Unbeknown to the astronaut, the team that designed and operated the 3D printer – a California-based company called Made In Space – had been listening in on his conversation with Nasa (a privilege for companies working with the space agency) and worked round the clock to design a version of the tool that met Nasa’s rigorous safety requirements. “Once Nasa approved the wrench, we sent the file to the printer – essentially we emailed it to space and hit print,” says Jason Dunn, Made In Space’s co-founder and chief technology officer, sitting across the table in a conference room at the company’s headquarters in Moffett Field, Santa Clara County. “I get goosebumps every time I think about that story.” For Dunn, that wrench is symbolic of an entirely new frontier in space exploration, one in which his eight-year-old company is a pioneer: manufacturing items in space, rather than relying only on those objects you can find room to pack on a rocket from Earth. “It’s a really neat capability that allows us as humans to extend our reach beyond Earth,” he tells me. Supplying the 3D printer on the International Space Station was only the start: the company is developing systems for making and assembling not only small tools and trinkets, but giant structures such as satellites and, eventually, even space colonies – houses on the surface of the moon or Mars, or giant spaceships on which people could live and work. Dunn, 33, is sitting in a scruffy conference room called The Bridge – a nod to the Star Trek command centre – on the second of two floors in a long building that once served as barracks for the US navy and now houses most of Made In Space’s 43 employees. It’s one of dozens of nondescript white buildings dotted around Moffett Field in Mountain View, which was closed as a military base in 1994 and turned over to Nasa for research purposes. The agency leases buildings to different advanced technology companies with whom it has research ties. From the outside, there’s no sign of the cosmic ambition bubbling up inside. With his stubble and dark hair, swept to one side, Dunn looks like a dishevelled Clark Kent. He traces his interest in exploration back to his childhood in Florida. He lived by the Gulf of Mexico, where he and his friends would spend hours in a little boat exploring mangroves and islands. “I grew up with this fascination with exploration,” he says. “This idea that I sit on the shore and I look out and I can’t even see the horizon, and I don’t know what’s beyond it.” That feeling grew after he watched the space shuttle launch from the nearby Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, seeing what looked like “a little star” moving up into the sky. “I remember the fascination of seeing that one star and thinking ‘There’s people on it, disappearing into space’,” he says. “Everyone on the planet sits on the shoreline of space. It’s this big ocean we should be exploring,” he adds, with a tinge of wistful disappointment about the lack of progress. For Dunn, working at Nasa seemed inevitable: he was inspired by his high school physics teacher, who had been a finalist in a group of teachers selected by Nasa. Later, he studied aerospace engineering at the University of Orlando, where he worked on the shuttle programme via an internship at Boeing, which was contracted by Nasa to build the spacecraft. Dunn was enamoured of the vision for the space shuttle. Initially sold to the US Congress in the early 1970s as a reusable vehicle that would fly to space on a routine basis, it promised a much cheaper way of sending things there. This led scientists and engineers to think creatively about what they could build if they weren’t hamstrung by the prohibitive cost. “Once we have low-cost access into and back from space, then the industry changes and opens up,” Dunn explains. But the space shuttle did not fulfil this promise. It cost around $450m (£315m) every time it launched, so it didn’t fly nearly as frequently as proposed. In 2010, Nasa announced it was retiring the programme, after 30 years. “I felt a little heartbroken and very confused,” Dunn says, “because the whole reason I was doing this was to work on the space shuttle.” Feeling lost, he turned to a college-based club called Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, where he met entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize, a non-profit organisation that stages lucrative competitions to reward teams who develop breakthrough innovations. Dunn learned that he could create a startup in the space industry. This seemed “ludicrous” at the time: to his mind, the space industry was the preserve of nation states and giant companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. In the summer of 2010, Dunn moved to California to attend Singularity University, an educational programme and business incubator co-founded by Diamandis, which focuses on “exponential” technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. There, Dunn met two of his Made In Space co-founders – Mike Chen and Aaron Kemmer – and together they spent 10 weeks researching the space industry and ideas for a sustainable business; the fourth co-founder, chief engineer Michael Snyder, joined shortly after. The private space companies that attract the most attention – Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Virgin Galactic or Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin – prioritise fulfilling the original promise of the space shuttle: making access to space cheaper, by building reusable or larger rockets. Dunn, Chen and Kemmer asked a different question: “What if we didn’t need to launch anything at all?” Asking that question meant they were no longer restricted to dimensions of space objects that could be packed inside a rocket and able to survive the shuddering forces of a launch from Earth. “We could have structures in space so big, they could be the backbone of huge internet telecommunications antenna,” Dunn says. “Or a giant space station colony, or giant arrays of solar panels. Or we could send robots to the surface of the moon, or Mars, and use resources there to build habitats.” Dunn predicts that, over the next 10 years, space will become an industrial zone filled with orbiting factories. “Like oil platforms on the ocean, but not polluting.” There are already several companies – including Axiom Space, with which Made In Space has formed a partnership, and Bigelow Aerospace – building commercial space stations that could house manufacturing equipment in orbit within a couple of years, Dunn notes. Eventually, he says, people will go to the factories in space to work in much the same way as oil riggers do. “Although most of the manufacturing will be automated, you need people to fix and maintain the robots. It might not be pretty, it might not be that safe, but they will make a good living and then come back home.” Others will pay to go on “cruise ships”, either to orbit Earth or “do a nice week-long trip around the moon”. Companies such as Blue Origin and SpaceX are making “huge strides in delivering humans into space safely”. The relationship between orbiting factories and launch companies will be symbiotic. “They are really opening the frontier of space,” Dunn says. “We built our company on the promise of what they are creating; they are building their companies based on the hope that Made In Spaces will exist.” He is close-lipped about specific commercial relationships with the launch companies, but says that his company is “actively working” with some of them. Over time, manufacturers will start to populate Earth’s orbit, starting at lower altitudes and working their way out in concentric circles until they reach the moon. Made In Space is even preparing for a lunar colony by developing “rego” bricks, made by combining a special polymer with simulated moon dust (regolith). The bricks, which look like samples of paving stones in various shades of grey, are heavy and feel plasticky. In theory, a brick-making autonomous vehicle could use the dust on the surface of the moon to construct housing ahead of astronauts’ arrival. Before building colonies on the moon, Made In Space had first to develop a 3D printer that worked in microgravity and could be put on the International Space Station. The printer is the company’s “foundational technology”, according to chief executive Andrew Rush, 33, a former intellectual property lawyer who came on board in 2015. He says he was “doomed to like space from birth”, having also grown up in Florida with parents who raised him on a diet of Star Trek, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein and physics books. Rush is one of many self-described sci-fi nerds at Made In Space. During interviews for new recruits, he will ask: “Star Trek or Star Wars?” “It’s mostly for fun,” he says. “It’s certainly a bit of a culture fit indicator.” I ask if Made In Space is more Star Trek or Star Wars. He laughs, then hesitates, reluctant to alienate an entire tribe of potential recruits. “You will get me in trouble,” he says, before conceding, “I think I’d say we are more Star Trek.” The life-sized cardboard cutout of Spock in the reception area is a bit of a giveaway. As are the framed posters on the wall by the stairs for 1960s episodes of sci-fi television series such as The Tholian Web and Mirror Mirror. “In Star Trek, the technology and the philosophy are often more motivating than in Star Wars, which is more of an epic-driven narrative and universe,” Rush explains, adding that “space is a team sport”. Dunn agrees: “We are creating the technology of Star Trek, building the replicator and transporter all in one with 3D printers.” At first, the team assumed that Nasa already had a 3D printer on the space station, but discovered that, although the agency had experimented with the idea in the late 1990s, it decided that the printing technology was too immature and the space station too small at the time to risk it. However, once the space station expanded, Nasa designated the US segment a national laboratory, inviting companies, research institutions and government agencies to pitch microgravity research projects. Made In Space flew out to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, to pitch the commercial potential for 3D printing in space. The problem with regular 3D printers is that they are designed to work in gravity. Without that constant downward force, you have to secure every belt, cog and pulley – a few millimetres of unintended movement wreaks havoc on the printing mechanism, leading to failed or wonky printing. To ensure their 3D printer would work on the International Space Station, the Made In Space team spent many hours aboard a “vomit comet”, a converted passenger jet that follows a rollercoaster trajectory, offering about 20 seconds of weightlessness with every nosedive. The team took their device on 10 such flights, each lasting around two hours, during which they monitored how the 3D printer was performing. “The feeling of zero gravity is impossible to explain,” Dunn explains. “It’s an entirely new feeling. Outside of when you’re an infant, you don’t really have entirely new feelings.” The team also had to automate almost every part of the experiment – the combination of strong anti-nausea pills and the novel sensation of floating meant human-made decisions were virtually impossible. Adjustments would be made to the printer after each flight, until they finally cracked it on the 10th mission. The printer was installed on the International Space Station in November 2014. The first thing it printed was a part for the printer: a plastic electronics cover about the size of a playing card with raised wording that read “Made In Space”. A month later, it would print the missing torque wrench, which underlined the potential of the technology to astronaut Barry Wilmore. “It’s going to be a game-changer, or as we say in Tennessee, it’s a big dang deal,” Wilmore tells me, although he adds that he wasn’t allowed to use the wrench because it had to be sent back to Earth for assessment. In 2015, the company was awarded the Space Frontier Foundation’s Vision To Reality award, which recognises outstanding achievement in space. (Previously, it was given to SpaceX for the launch of its reusable Falcon 1 rocket and to the Nasa Kepler Program for its low-cost mission to find planets outside of our solar system.) Staff operate the game-changing printer from their own mission control, a small office space with two work stations, each of them with three screens – some showing live video feeds from around the space station, others directly looking at what’s being printed. Made In Space will talk to a Nasa payload communications manager (a “Paycom”) in Houston, who will relay messages or instructions to the astronauts. On rare occasions, if there’s a complicated technical issue with one of the machines, Made In Space will communicate directly with astronauts. *** Unlike most startups, particularly in capital-intensive industries such as space, Made In Space has never taken any external investment. The core technologies of the business have been funded through development contracts from Nasa and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Research groups and companies also pay Made In Space for time spent using its microgravity 3D printer. The money from this core work allows the company to explore more out-there projects, such as building on the moon. Made In Space’s most ambitious experiment is Archinaut, a robot-operated factory that would be placed in Earth’s orbit to build large structures in space. If it pulls it off, it has the potential to radically transform the way satellites and space telescopes are built, repaired and enhanced. Without having to worry about fitting everything into a launch rocket, these orbiting structures can be much, much bigger. And bigger means better: better arrays of solar panels for powering missions into deep space; better space telescopes for exploring the galaxies beyond our solar system and better satellite-delivered internet services on Earth. “You could send a satellite the size of a small refrigerator into orbit, then a robot would start to build it out,” Rush explains. “You could manufacture a 10m- to 15m-long antenna, the kind you usually get on a big honking 2,000kg satellite.” To make large structures, Made In Space needed a 3D printer that could print off as long an object as required. It managed it: there’s a 37m-long strut stretching the length of the hallway on the ground floor of its headquarters. “It’s larger than the solar wing on the ISS,” Rush says (in February, it was awarded a Guinness World Record for being the world’s longest 3D-printed nonassembled piece). The company is also thinking about the importing business, developing “space-enabled materials” – materials that can be manufactured only in microgravity, but which are needed on Earth. The first material made in this way was ZBLAN, a type of optical fibre that is structurally of higher quality than anything that can be made on Earth. Optical fibres, the blood vessels of the internet, are made by heating glass rods to melting temperature and drawing them out until they are thinner than a human hair. When that’s done on Earth, the different densities of the materials mean they can crystallise with tiny defects. “When we remove gravity, we allow the glass to crystallise in a uniform manner,” Dunn says. “Now you get a perfect glass crystal which allows light to pass through it with much more efficiency.” ZBLAN is in high demand from telecommunications companies desperate to deliver more bandwidth to their data-hungry customers. “Industries are buying exotic optical fibre at such a high cost,” Dunn says, “you can justify flying raw materials into space, making it and bringing it back, and still have a successful business.” With that in mind, Made In Space has developed a pilot factory contained inside a metal box roughly the size of a mini-fridge, which can produce a few kilometres of fibre per mission. So far, it’s only been tested fully on the space station once, before it was brought back to Earth to assess the quality of the fibre and tweak the system. This month, the machine is being installed a second time, for further testing. Similarly, Archinaut has been tested only on Earth, with smaller structures built in vacuum chambers that simulate space conditions. The company’s flashy videos of dextrous robotic arms assembling satellites in orbit remain a science fiction. “People were writing about travelling to the stars before [Robert] Goddard had made a liquid-fuelled rocket,” Rush says. “Our vision and imagination for what we can do in space has always far outstripped what we’ve been able to do.” If the space industry develops according to Made In Space’s plan – and that’s a big if – the ultimate aim is to help build space colonies the size of cities. For Dunn, this is a necessity. “It’s not about leaving Earth, but expanding and saving it,” he says, pointing out that there are not enough resources on our planet to give every person an equal standard of living to that enjoyed in many western nations: having a laptop, mobile phone and car. “There’s a limit to how much energy production we can handle, how much CO2 we can keep putting into the atmosphere, how much food we can produce. The only way those limits disappear is when we think beyond the boundary of this finite volume of Earth.” • Objects printed by Made In Space’s zero-gravity 3D printer will be exhibited during the V&amp;A’s upcoming exhibition The Future Starts Here, from 12 May; go to vam.ac.uk/thefuturestartshere for details.
