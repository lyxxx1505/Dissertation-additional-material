2025-06-25T16:04:05Z,A ban on forever chemicals would be best | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/25/a-ban-on-forever-chemicals-would-be-best,"The researcher quoted in your disturbing report on Sweden’s Pfas (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) scandal says her work feels like trying to catch a runaway train (Poison in the water: the town with the world’s worst case of forever chemicals contamination, 19 June). Kallinge is one of a growing list of European towns with extreme levels of Pfas. In fact, there are tens of thousands of contaminated sites. It is time to slam on the brakes. There is a lot of talk about clean-up technologies and how these might solve the problem. But relying on clean-ups is like bailing out a sinking boat with a teacup while the crew is busy drilling new holes in the hull. Legislation is urgent and essential. Indeed, Europe has a detailed plan to ban all Pfas, and with strict time limits on transitions to safe alternatives. But now Brussels says that, instead, it intends to exclude these chemicals from consumer products only. These account for barely one-fifth of all Pfas emissions, so banning them would only slow the rate at which they accumulate in water, soil and human tissue. Such a partial ban would be a short‑sighted capitulation to commercial interests and a free‑market ideology that opposes all regulation. Even when we halt the Pfas locomotive, we will be cleaning up this mess for decades to come.

2024-03-15T16:58:38Z,EU approves watered-down human rights and supply chain law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/15/eu-approves-watered-down-human-rights-and-supply-chain-law,"EU countries have slashed the scope of a law to make companies hunt down human rights abuse and environmental harm in their supply chains. The EU’s corporate sustainability directive, which was agreed in December but nearly scuttled after a minor coalition partner in the German government withdrew its support, was approved by member states on Friday after a month-long search for compromise and further lobbying from France and Italy. Lara Wolters, a Dutch MEP with the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) grouping who led negotiations for the European parliament, said the new law would help “stop businesses from looking away from very real human misery and destruction” but criticised member states who “persistently delayed” the adoption of the agreement. The Belgian government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, thrashed out a compromise that limits the number of companies expected to comply. The new agreement applies to companies with more than 1,000 employees, up from 500, and a net turnover of €450m (£385m) – triple the amount previously agreed. Environmental groups estimate the changes will exclude 70% of the companies the law was meant to cover. EU governments have “killed two-thirds of the law” and the impact that it could have had, said Uku Lilleväli, a sustainable finance policy officer at WWF. “The EU countries endorsed the much-needed due diligence law, but at what cost? We’re left with bare bones, with an already weak framework that now covers only a fraction of all large companies.” The rules, which must be voted on in the European parliament before they come into force, provide a framework for communities to sue EU companies for human rights abuses and environmental harm in their supply chains. But efforts to water down the rules mean fewer companies will have to set targets to cut pollution and adopt climate transition plans than previously agreed and will have more time to comply. Member states also gutted a provision that would force companies to offer managers financial incentives to hit climate goals. Aurélie Skrobik, a corporate accountability campaigner at Global Witness, said it was an affront by national governments but a relief that there was a law at all. “This law is a shadow of what it should have been – and what negotiators agreed in December.” Opponents of the law argued it would place too big a burden on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), who secured extra support in the final agreement, and would raise the potential for legal challenges. Markus Beyrer, the director general of lobby group BusinessEurope, said the new rules added “unparalleled obligations” and imposed harsh sanctions on companies that would expose them to litigation. “SMEs, even though they are theoretically out of the scope of the directive, will be negatively affected as they make up the largest part of value chains,” he said. The Chinese chamber of commerce to the EU said in a post on X that the law “could be very concerning” and warned of possible trade disruptions and cost increases. “We call for urgent clarification, and the EU should refrain from erecting market barriers that hinder non-EU producers.” Industry groups had found support in the German Free Democrats party, which opposed the law after having previously agreed to it. It sparked a public fight within Germany’s governing coalition of the centre-left Social Democratic party and Greens. “If we break our word after having pledged our support in Brussels, we risk losing the trust placed in us,” said the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, in February. The German government abstained on the vote on Friday, which only secured enough votes after Italy threw in its support. Campaigners decried the 11th-hour horse-trading as undemocratic. Anaïs Berthier, the head of the Brussels office of environmental law campaign group ClientEarth, said corporate pressure and political games had “butchered” an opportunity to revolutionise how business is done in the EU. “This disrespect for the rule of law is an unsettling trend that we are witnessing across several environmental laws still being approved,” she said. “It’s a worrying sign of things to come in the run-up to the EU elections.”",European Union; World news; Corporate social responsibility; Environment; Human rights; Europe,World news
2025-04-10T15:00:43Z,NSW solar farm to supply almost half the energy needs of major gas company,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/11/nsw-solar-farm-to-supply-almost-half-energy-needs-of-major-gas-company,"A major industrial gas company in Australia will shift its power use away from fossil fuels and instead meet nearly half its electricity needs across three states from solar. BOC, owned by global gas and engineering company Linde, supplies speciality gases to large manufacturers, industry and oxygen to hospitals. Under a 10-year deal, BOC – a major energy user – will draw enough electricity from the New England solar farm in New South Wales to meet 45% of its power needs across NSW, Victoria and Queensland. An agreement signed with renewable retailer Zen Energy and generator Acen Australia is expected to cut BOC’s Australian emissions by 40% by 2035. BOC’s shift to renewables follows a similar commitment by Rio Tinto, and comes as the federal Coalition is campaigning for increased access to more fossil gas. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Theo Martin, the managing director of Linde South Pacific, which oversees BOC’s Australian operations, said the agreement was a “substantial initial step forward” that would support Linde’s global target to reduce direct and electricity-related emissions. Martin said BOC had struck “a very competitive commercial rate” with Zen Energy. “We are absolutely on a mission to meet those emissions targets,” he said. The switch to solar would also benefit BOC’s customers by reducing the carbon intensity of industrial gases, Martin said. Anthony Garnaut, Zen Energy’s CEO, said attractive pricing under long-term contracts, customer demand for green products and investor scrutiny of corporate sustainability commitments were driving the shift to renewable power. “This is the transition to renewable energy in action and at scale,” he said. In March, mining company Rio Tinto signed a 20-year agreement to buy solar and battery capacity for its Gladstone aluminium operations. Hugh Sheehan, from Climateworks Centre, said major industrial companies were huge energy users – consuming roughly 44% of Australia’s energy and 40% of its electricity annually – which played a significant role in how the country’s electricity was managed. “The decisions they make on where their power comes from are on a totally different scale to residential and small businesses,” he said. He said companies such as BOC and Rio Tinto were acting in their best interests, seeing the economic opportunities and future-proofing themselves in a net zero future economy.",Energy; Energy; New South Wales; Queensland; Victoria; Gas; Renewable energy; Fossil fuels; Australia news,Environment
2025-01-29T15:10:04Z,EU launches ‘simplification’ agenda in effort to keep up with US and China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/29/eu-launches-simplification-agenda-in-effort-to-keep-up-with-us-and-china,"The EU executive has announced “an unprecedented simplification effort” to cut regulations and boost innovation in an attempt to reverse Europe’s economic decline and better compete with China and the US. In her first major policy announcement since starting a second term as the European Commission president last month, Ursula von der Leyen outlined policy proposals intended to boost Europe’s flagging economy. The plans, in a document titled the Competitiveness Compass, respond to a hard-hitting report from the former Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, who warned that the EU risked “a slow and agonising decline” without urgent action. The document reaffirmed the EU’s 90% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2040, which von der Leyen has promised to enshrine in law. However, the commission president said the EU had sometimes imposed “complex” and “partly contradictory” requirements on companies, an apparent reference to laws passed during her own first term. She said the simplification agenda matched the objectives of the EU’s green deal “because we have to speed up. The more complex [the legislation], the slower [to meet the climate targets].” European business, she added, had sent a very clear signal that it faced “too much complexity” and “administrative procedures are too cumbersome”. She promised an “unprecedented simplification effort” that she said would reduce administrative costs for companies by 25%, and by 35% for small and medium-sized enterprises – assuming the commission’s proposals are adopted and followed. The commission will next month unveil “far-reaching simplification” covering the corporate sustainability reporting directive, which entered into force in 2023, and the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which will affect companies in a staggered timeline from 2027 and 2029. The directives oblige companies to report their impact on society, the environment and human rights, but businesses have complained about the high costs and time-consuming demands of gathering the data. However, campaigners at the Climate Action Network said the commission had taken “a dangerous misstep by framing regulation as one of the primary obstacles to competitiveness”. The Competitiveness Compass document set out von der Leyen’s economic agenda for the next five years, with measures targeted at boosting green tech, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. It promised “AI factories” that would allow startups and researchers to train and develop AI models. A separate AI strategy will aim to boost that technology in sectors including manufacturing, automotive and financial services. Looking to one of Europe’s traditional industries, it promised “possible flexibilities” to help carmakers facing fines for failure to meet 2025 emissions reduction targets. Von der Leyen will meet car industry leaders on Thursday for a “strategic dialogue” with the sector that is struggling to adapt to the technological shift in the face of fierce competition from China. The EU executive chief said the EU’s business model for the past 20-25 years had relied on “cheap labour from China, presumably cheap energy from Russia” and “partly outsourcing security”, but “these days are gone”. Echoing the Draghi report, she said Europe had a static industrial model, “with too few startups emerging with new disruptive technologies”. The former president of the European Central Bank highlighted in his report that no EU company with a market capitalisation over €100bn had been set up from scratch in the past 50 years, while all six US companies with a valuation above €1tn had been created in this period. In a note to clients on the current “do or die moment”, Eurasia Group’s managing director for Europe, Mujtaba Rahman, said von der Leyen’s intervention was Brussels’ “most ambitious push” for deeper EU economic integration since the eurozone crisis. But, highlighting the challenge of winning support from the EU’s 27 member states, he said “success is far from certain”. BusinessEurope, the pan-European employers’ association, called for urgency in delivering “meaningful changes for companies in their daily operations”. But the European Trade Union Confederation said that a mooted “28th regime” – EU-wide laws on labour, tax and insolvency that firms could choose to follow instead of national law – was a “recipe for disaster” that risked undermining employment legislation. Bas Eickhout, co-president of the Greens in the European parliament, said his group was concerned that the compass was “too narrowly focused on CO2 reduction alone and not on protecting nature”. He warned the commission against reopening sustainability laws: “We support simplification as a tool to make people’s lives easier, but not as a byword for deregulation aimed at gutting environmental regulations.”",European Union; Europe; World news; US news; China; Business,World news
2025-02-26T16:36:39Z,EU reveals plans to hit climate goals by helping dirty industries clean up,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/eu-climate-goals-dirty-industries-clean-industrial-deal,"The EU executive has insisted it will stay the course on its climate goals, while setting out plans to help Europe’s most polluting industries reach the green transition and watering down environmental reporting demands on companies. Publishing its “clean industrial deal” on Wednesday, the European Commission said it had a plan to help polluting industries, such as steel and cement, make the switch to the net zero emissions future, as well as boosting clean tech companies, such as firms making electric vehicle charging points. The commission also published a plan aiming to bring down energy bills for businesses and consumers, as well as controversial proposals to relax environmental reporting requirements on small and medium-sized businesses. In 2019, before the pandemic, when there appeared to be a broad global consensus around the need for climate action, the EU launched the green deal, a landmark set of laws aiming to transform energy use and set the course to net zero emissions by 2050. But criticism of the rules has grown, against a backdrop of soaring energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and intensifying competition from heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Now the clean industrial deal reaffirms the EU goal of cutting emissions by 90% by 2040, and unveils 40 different measures to speed up the green transition, including faster permits for windfarms and other infrastructure, and changing public procurement rules to favour clean tech made in Europe. “We think that the clean industrial deal is Europe’s business plan to tackle the climate crisis,” said Teresa Ribera, the European Commission executive vice-president in charge of the green transition. Ribera, the most senior socialist in a centre-right-leaning commission, rejected criticism that the EU was reversing course. “We are not deregulating,” she said. “On the contrary: we are coming to the implementing phase.” The commission said it would create a new industrial decarbonisation bank with €100bn (£83bn) in new and repurposed public funds, which it said could indirectly leverage €400bn from the private sector. It outlined a bigger role for the European Investment Bank, including in the provision of guarantees to grid component manufacturers, allowing them to increase production. Experts say hundreds of billions in global investment is needed to build vast networks of electricity grids to hit climate goals. Ribera, who also leads on competition policy, promised changes to the EU’s state aid rules by June to accelerate renewable energy and industrial decarbonisation. But the Climate Action Network Europe said there was “no concrete plan to mobilise genuine additional finance” and “little to turn ambition into action”. The new European Commission, which took office in December with a red-tape-cutting agenda, simultaneously published details on relaxing environmental reporting and due diligence rules for small companies, a far-reaching rethink of laws only agreed in 2023 and 2024. The commissioners presenting the proposals argued they were not weakening Europe’s green transition, but encouraging businesses to join in the transition and adjusting to a new geopolitical reality. “Europe knows how to reform itself,” said Stéphane Séjourné, the commissioner in charge of industrial strategy. “We don’t have a chainsaw,” he added, referring to the power tool that the Argentine president, Javier Milei, recently gave Elon Musk as a symbol of slashing red tape. “But we have competent people leading the charge.” The commission suggested a two-year freeze of its corporate sustainability reporting directive, which entered into force in 2023, while it pursues detailed consultations on exempting small businesses. Similarly, officials said the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which requires companies with more than 1,000 employees to assess the environmental and human rights impacts of their products, would be delayed by one year, while the commission tries to lighten the load on smaller companies. While SMEs are already exempt from the directive’s requirements, many say they will be caught in burdensome rules because they supply larger companies. While business groups broadly welcomed the plans, the European Sustainable Investment Forum said the move created “legal uncertainty” and harmed those who had already prepared reports or taken steps to comply. Anna Cavazzini, a German Green MEP who chairs the European parliament’s internal market committee, said the due diligence directive was being turned into an empty shell and “environmental crimes and human rights violations won’t be prevented”. Christian Ehler, the energy and industry spokesperson for the centre-right EPP group, said further simplification of environmental legislation “must not be a taboo” and “we have to consider whether some [other] environmental legislation from the past mandate is adequate”. The red-tape-cutting agenda has also been extended to the EU’s carbon-border adjustment mechanism, which requires companies importing steel, iron, aluminium and other polluting products into the bloc to pay a carbon tariff, levelling out price differences with EU producers. The commission said it would exempt the smallest importers from the levy, a measure it said would affect 90% of importers, about 190,000 companies, while still covering 99% of emissions. The clean industrial deal was published alongside an “affordable energy action plan” that aims to save €260bn a year by 2040. Environment campaigners welcomed initiatives to reduce bills and hasten electrification, but expressed alarm at a proposal to fund the building of liquefied natural gas export facilities abroad. The Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Lorelei Limousin said the proposal neglected other measures that could bring fossil fuel imports down rapidly, such as cutting energy waste. “This commission is vague on cutting energy waste while, to appease Trump, wants to invest in polluting gas infrastructure overseas that will keep Europe hooked on this expensive and dangerous fuel for decades.” The director general of BusinessEurope, Markus Beyrer, said he was encouraged that the commission had listened to industry, but called for swifter action, saying it was unlikely the measures would be enough to lower short-term energy costs.",European Union; Green politics; European Commission; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Steel industry; Construction industry; World news; Europe,World news
2025-06-05T11:00:08Z,Companies that spinelessly follow Trump's cuts to DEI will pay a heavy price | Miriam González Durántez,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/trump-uk-europe-cutting-dei-diversity-equality,"Organising a women’s networking event in the US has become an act of defiance. Companies with equality-driven agendas risk losing government contracts. Some are receiving McCarthy-like letters asking them to confirm that they have no diversity policies. Activities designed to support women, including healthcare research, are being threatened, and companies are backtracking on former commitments. Women’s networking events, the gathering of diversity data and targeted training are being questioned. And some companies are requesting that charities focused on women and girls consider changes to their programmes in order to navigate the current climate. The one I founded, Inspiring Girls, has already been asked to “include men as role models”. This anti-diversity wave isn’t just a social backlash to the many excesses of wokeness – it is politically orchestrated and driven. It crystallised in 2021, when the senator Josh Hawley devoted his entire keynote speech at the second National Conservatism Conference to “reclaiming masculinity”, calling for boys (not girls) to be taught competitiveness, strength, honesty and courage – as if those were only male values. Since then, the movement has reached the highest offices of power: the White House is its headquarters and its commander-in-chief is Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who promised last year to tackle “anti-white racism” if Trump won a second term. The anti-diversity brigade has no shortage of money or allies: several “tech bros” (whether out of conviction or FOMO) have joined in – as have tech venture capitalists and other Maga financiers. These are men who operate in fields dominated almost exclusively by other men and who wield enormous wealth and influence, yet they often cast themselves as victims. They hide their anti-diversity stance under the disguise of meritocracy. On the progressive side, there is a movement claiming that it is actually boys – particularly white working-class ones – rather than girls who are “in crisis”. It is led by the American Institute for Boys and Men, which last week received a $20m grant from Melinda French Gates. They argue that boys lag behind girls in education and employment. It is true, of course, that many of the manufacturing jobs that many young men used to rely on are vanishing due to automation and tech (ironically, for the benefit of mostly male tech moguls). Unfortunately, however, this well-meaning movement is fuelling the anti-diversity brigade’s narrative – because they can now claim that even progressives admit it is white men who are suffering. The Trump administration has not yet imposed specific obligations on businesses to withdraw diversity programmes beyond companies who have contracts with the government – including, now, some companies across the EU, but many are taking spontaneous actions. Some companies are doing so because their diversity policies were just for show, while others are simply acting out of fear. The trend is clear: many are eliminating references to diversity and equality from their websites and in their reporting; others are reneging from aspirational targets, stopping data-gathering on recruitment and promotions, and dismantling training programmes. Some of the companies that are backtracking have headquarters in the UK or Europe. And many of the US tech companies and funds that are leading the diversity backlash have subsidiaries and offices on this side of the Atlantic. Their actions are in straightforward conflict with the letter and the spirit of British and EU legislation on equality, such as EU corporate sustainability reporting rules or equal opportunities and equal pay directives. And yet the equality ministries in the British and other European governments – and in the European Commission – have remained largely silent. Most equality ministries and agencies are led by herbivorous politicians and officials who favour performative programmes over meaningful action. Confronting Trump is far too scary for them, which is why they have not set the limits of what companies can and cannot do, whether specifically or in general guidelines. Over time, it is possible the anti-diversity movement will yield some positives, as it could drive companies who continue to believe in diversity towards more meaningful, effective and data-based policies. Besides, in a litigation-led country such as the US, it is only a matter of time before the courts impose some limits on government-led anti-diversity intimidation. When they do, the backlash against companies that have acted spinelessly will have its own consequences. But the UK and the rest of Europe cannot be passive spectators waiting for the pendulum to swing again. Our equality authorities should counteract Trump’s raid on diversity by providing clear official guidance to companies on what they can and cannot do – it is their legal and moral duty to do so. America First should not mean America Everywhere when it comes to the fundamental principles of diversity, equality and inclusion.

2025-07-07T10:19:42Z,Like looking in a mirror: how HR data and AI can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility,https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/how-hr-data-and-ai-support-corporate-social-responsibility,"Businesses have had to get to grips with a range of new criteria in recent years that reflect more socially conscious goals, impacts and metrics. These are often lumped together under the acronym ESG, which refers to environmental, social and governance factors. They might incorporate these criteria for regulatory purposes or simply to better manage their business risks – whether it’s physical risks from the impact of climate breakdown, financial risks, or risks to their reputation. When it comes to ESG, the environmental and governance factors have typically been more measurable. You can count your carbon emissions and you can measure how much waste you produce. Similarly, you can set up governance frameworks and follow best practice. But the S part of the acronym has always been trickier to quantify. This is partly because of a lack of objective and comparable data. Likewise, social factors have often been regarded as subjective and malleable – contingent upon changing social attitudes and individuals’ personal lived experiences. They also vary from company to company and across geographies – taking in everything from diversity and pay disparities to relationships with stakeholder groups, corporate stances on contentious issues and volunteering. Organisations often don’t know where to start, even if they want to do the right thing. But despite being difficult to get a grasp of, social responsibility can’t be ignored. Companies now need to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements, such as the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and European sustainability reporting standards. Moreover, they might also have to meet the requirements of their own business partners in their supply chains, who may stipulate social disclosure and reporting. They also need to think about how they are viewed by potential new hires. Younger people, in particular, increasingly want to work for businesses that align with their own values. Social responsibility is therefore part of being an employer of choice. While it can be confusing terrain to navigate, data can provide clarity. As the adage goes: what gets measured, gets managed. Given that so many social criteria relate to the welfare of a company’s employees, having a robust and dynamic HR platform can help. These platforms provide companies with a wealth of objective data, from deeper insights into the diversity of their workforce to pay gaps at different management levels and social responsibility initiatives. Steve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at software company Sage, says high-quality HR data can be a bit like looking in the mirror for a business. It can really help you understand what your culture means, what you stand for as a business, where you’re going, and what you need to do to get there. “This really helps when you are trying to attract and retain the best people,” he notes. This can make it easier for businesses to do everything from meeting disclosure requirements to demonstrating community engagement. Of course, all this data still needs to be sifted in order to generate useful insights. Kaustubh Sevak, a principal solutions consultant at Sage, says businesses have often struggled with this. “Traditionally, companies will take all of this data, and it’ll take a team of analysts a week to actually come up with some insights or nuggets on what that data actually is.” Now, he says, companies can take advantage of what Sage calls a “workforce intelligence offering”. “This is where AI and machine learning-led statistical analysis is really powerful, because it’s bringing those insights to HR at the click of a button. HR practitioners can look at whatever data points are important to them in the jurisdiction that they want to restrict it to, and in a couple of clicks they get real-time insights.” This is particularly important when it comes to dealing with different disclosure requirements across different countries or geographical territories. It also enables multinational businesses to integrate data from different territories with different HR policies. There are many other ways that a high-quality HR platform can make it easier for businesses to comply with disclosure requirements. They can provide transparency about company policies, and also the methodology companies use to measure its performance against ESG criteria – which is particularly important given that some ESG reporting regulations require information about how the data was calculated. Moreover, a good HR platform can provide all this required data in one place that’s easy to access and collate. Lampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at Sage, notes how the company’s all-in-one HR and payroll platform, Sage People, can combine HR data insights with responses to employee surveys. “You can use Sage People to gather data on the social side of things and share it with whoever needs it,” he says. “You might, for example, ask staff if enough is being done to support wellbeing or volunteering, or you could look at the backgrounds of new hires – and this could be reported or shared with regulatory bodies.” Data can also be used to help companies improve their own performance and reach their internal social objectives. One Sage People customer has incorporated social mobility data into KPIs (key performance indicators). The idea here is that you can cascade a top-level goal down the organisation and use data to see how employees are contributing to achieving it and what more needs to be done. Sekliziotis emphasises that this is very much a two-way flow of information. “You could also communicate the sort of social responsibility programmes you are undertaking and ask staff if they’re interested in participating, or report on community collaboration.” Another benefit of the platform is that this communication can be targeted. For instance, it can often make sense, if volunteering news is sent to those closest to the communities it takes place in. “[Employees] can even book volunteering days on the system so that the company knows you’re not booking a day’s holiday and that you’re working in your local foodbank,” says Sekliziotis. An organisation can learn from this data and use it to make improvements. For example, it can look at programmes it has instituted and see what the takeup is. Watmore says that this can be useful when it comes to making comparisons across different parts of a business or across different regions and territories. “Comparative data is useful, but you sometimes need to use it to recognise that all data should be comparative,” he notes. “You can use software to slice and dice it into different regions – and the richer the data is, the more powerful this becomes.” Discover more about how HR data can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility",,Empowering Your Employees
2024-11-14T06:00:04Z,"Shell’s successful appeal will not end climate lawsuits against firms, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/14/shell-successful-appeal-will-not-end-climate-lawsuits-against-firms-say-experts,"A court ruling in favour of Shell does not spell the end of climate litigation against companies, legal experts have said. The oil and gas company celebrated on Tuesday when it won an appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court. In 2021 a lower court ruled that Shell must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world, and led to a growing trend of lawsuits against corporations. However, the Dutch court of appeal ruled that, while Shell did have a “special responsibility” to cut its emissions as a major oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Milieudefensie, the NGO that brought the claim, was disappointed with the ruling because it rejected its key demand. However, the lawyer Roger Cox said he could see a number of important points to build on in the NGO’s legal battle against large polluters. “The court makes it abundantly clear that not only countries, but also companies, have a responsibility to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement,” said Cox. Thom Wetzer, an associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, believes this leaves the door “wide open” for future litigation against corporations in the Netherlands and beyond. The appeal court found no solid basis on which to order Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by the end of the decade. Shell successfully argued that the target was based on a global average and did not take into account the fact that the company did not sell the most polluting fossil fuel, coal. Nor was the court persuaded by Milieudefensie’s suggestions of more tailored emissions reductions for oil and gas. But the court agreed in principle that it was able to order companies to meet absolute emission reductions. Joana Setzer, an associate professor at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said this laid the basis for future claims, particularly once the EU set clear pathways for emission reductions in particular sectors. Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at Grantham, said he believed scientists had an important role in this. “Research in this field is advancing rapidly to bridge the gap between global emissions reduction goals and specific actionable targets.” The court stressed that business environmental rules were getting tougher. Both the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and its later corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDDD), which was finalised earlier this year and takes effect from 2027, impose climate-related obligations on companies such as Shell. According to Wetzer, the original Shell ruling was an important catalyst in changing the political landscape, “which led business to support the CSDDD codification in an attempt to gain legal certainty”. Setzer said these rules provided a more robust framework for holding corporations accountable but the court made it clear that they were not exhaustive. “This creates space for litigants to argue that companies must go beyond baseline regulatory compliance to fulfil their human rights and environmental responsibilities.” The court affirmed that corporations had responsibilities to respect human rights. More than 20 legal cases are examining this issue in relation to climate change, and Fred Kelly, a senior associate at law firm Peters &amp; Peters, expects the judgment to prompt more. Another point of contention was the extent to which companies should have to cut emissions from their suppliers and customers, also known as “scope 3” emissions. The court accepted Shell’s arguments that the specific target Milieudefensie had requested might not contribute to global climate efforts, because any oil or gas it chose not to sell may simply be sold by another company. But Wetzer said that this left the door open for legal claims if companies did not have, or failed to adhere to, more direct scope 1 and 2 emissions. It may even leave room for more nuanced scope 3 claims focusing on fossil fuel production. Although it would not impose a specific obligation on Shell to cut its emissions, the court said it was “reasonable to expect oil and gas companies to take into account the negative consequences of a further expansion of the supply of fossil fuels for the energy transition also when investing in the production of fossil fuels”. It said that Shell’s plan to develop hundreds of new oil and gas fields despite the International Energy Agency having warned against investments in any new fossil fuel extraction “may be at odds with this”. Wetzer said he saw this as a “strong hint” that Shell’s fossil fuel exploration and development should have limits, while Setzer anticipated that the ruling could inspire more project-specific cases. “The court’s critique of Shell’s new fossil fuel investments aligns with the argument that such projects are fundamentally at odds with the Paris agreement,” said Setzer. “Project cases, like the legal challenge to the Rosebank oilfield in the UK, are increasingly paving the way for courts to demand that emissions from fossil fuel use be fully considered before approving high-emitting projects.” Companies are not off the hook, said Wetzer. “Although the pathway to injunction-based cases of the Shell type succeeding may be a bit longer and bumpier than some might have hoped, it is definitely there. So, as before, companies should act in anticipation of this norm being enforceable or face significant legal risk.”",Climate crisis; Shell; Environment; World news; Law; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Greenhouse gas emissions,Environment
2025-06-26T04:00:50Z,"EU rollback on environmental policy is gaining momentum, warn campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/26/eu-rollback-on-environmental-policy-deregulation-european-green-deal,"The European Union’s rollback of environment policy is gaining momentum, campaigners have warned, in a deregulation drive that has shocked observers with its scale and speed. EU policymakers have dealt several critical blows to their much-vaunted European Green Deal since the end of 2023, when opinion polls suggested a significant rightward shift before the 2024 parliamentary elections. Environment groups say the pace has picked up under the competition-focused agenda of the new European Commission. The most striking examples are the “omnibus” packages that water down sustainable finance rules, some of which have been put on hold even before they came into force, and which member states proposed diluting further on Monday. The European Commission has promised more simplification measures to “radically lighten the regulatory load” on people and businesses. In the first six months of the new European Commission mandate, the EU also delayed a law to stop deforestation in supply chains by one year, gave carmakers two extra years to meet pollution targets and downgraded the protection status of the wolf. Environmental NGOs have found themselves in the crosshairs of a funding freeze they argue undermines democracy. The political tensions reached a high this week after an anti-greenwashing law was seemingly killed in the final stages of negotiations. The warnings of green backsliding come amid a global slump in efforts to cut pollution. In the UK, the government has faced growing political resistance to its target to hit net zero by 2050. In the US, Donald Trump has begun his second term with a series of attacks on environment agencies and policies as he seeks to promote fossil fuels. “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!” he told the US Department of Energy in a social media post on Monday. “And I mean NOW!!! Green groups say similar – albeit less sensational – shifts are under way in Brussels, which boasts some of the most ambitious rules to clean up a polluting economy. “There has been a radical change in political priorities – and this came before Trump was even close to election in the US,” said Marco Contiero, Greenpeace EU’s agricultural policy director. Bold green policies from the EU’s executive body have typically been watered down as they pass through protracted negotiations with other institutions. Critics say ambition is now being lost at the top while resistance is growing stronger throughout the legislative process. After farmers’ protests swept across Europe last year, lawmakers and member states nearly killed off a nature restoration law that EU institutions had already negotiated. It was the first sign of open revolt against the Green Deal that the centre-right president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, had put forward in 2019 after student climate protests. “The fact that the Green Deal became the poster child of the first von der Leyen Commission was received with surprise by civil society, industry, and lobbies,” said Contiero. “In a very similar manner, so has her decision to radically change her approach.” In mission letters to commissioners in September, von der Leyen set targets to reduce administrative burdens by 25% for all companies and by 35% for small- and medium-sized enterprises, with a “one in, one out” principle to ensure that new rules displaced existing ones. The Commission also promised to fight “gold-plating” measures, in which member states add their own rules that go beyond what the EU requires. The push to cut red tape has been led by the European People’s party (EPP), the largest group in parliament and the political home of 15 of the 27 commissioners, including von der Leyen. Its shift in tone has increasingly led to it siding with far-right forces. The cancellation of the anti-greenwashing law this week came after EPP and far-right lawmakers separately wrote to the European Commission to withdraw the bill. The EPP later celebrated the bill’s withdrawal as “a win for European companies”. Tiemo Wölken, a German MEP from the centre-left S&amp;D grouping who led negotiations of the proposal, said: “The Commission obviously wanted to fulfil the wishes of the right, and this is what is so scandalous. The EPP is again working with the far right to get rid of Green Deal files, but are pretending they are still in the middle and working with pro-European democratic forces.” The Commission has said it is pursuing an agenda of simplification rather than deregulation, and that its focus on competitiveness does not contradict the environmental aims of the Green Deal. It has also put forward plans to green industry, such as the Clean Industrial Deal, which have been celebrated as driving the energy transition in the EU forward. Paul de Clerck, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said the scale of the cuts in the first omnibus proposal in February showed that the simplification argument was “basically bollocks”. The Commission’s plans postpone corporate sustainability reporting requirements by two years and reduce the number of companies in its scope by 80%; delay corporate due diligence rules by one year; remove a requirement to conduct in-depth impact assessments; scrap a civil liability clause that would make it easier to sue companies; and exclude about 90% of businesses from the carbon border adjustment mechanism. Member states on Monday proposed reducing the scope even further. De Clerck said: “This is highly relevant because it’s the first proposal under the simplification agenda that’s been put forward and … it’s not just weakening it a little bit, it’s slashing it. The heart of the proposal has basically been taken out.” Political support for environment rules has dried up in several wealthy economies in the past year, even as the energy transition gains pace and an overwhelming majority of people say they want governments to cut pollution faster. European businesses have long complained of complex rules that hamper innovation and make it harder for them to compete with foreign companies. “The Green Deal often overlooked challenges like high energy costs or lengthy and complex permitting procedures,” said Markus Breyer, the director general of the industry association BusinessEurope. “The current focus on competitiveness reflects a more balanced and pragmatic approach that better aligns climate goals with economic realities.” Critics counter that failing to quickly transition to a clean economy will jeopardise economic prosperity in the medium term, as well as saddling individuals and governments with the cost of climate damages. Contiero said the EU would be “crushed by larger blocs such as the US and China” if it continued to play by 20th-century rules. “Investing in the Green Deal means decoupling economic growth from the use of natural resources – that was the essential element that made an awful lot of sense for the 21st century,” he said. “Abandoning such a critical approach will take away the competitive advantage that Europe could have had.”",Green politics; European Commission; European Union; Green economy; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Europe; World news; Biodiversity; Wildlife; Environment,Environment
2025-08-09T08:00:02Z,Charging ahead: will the UK’s new electric vehicle grant work for you?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/09/uk-subsidies-electric-cars-ev-market-eligible-models,"Is it time to go electric? The UK car industry certainly thinks so and is readying for a surge in demand as a new subsidy scheme cuts the price of some electric cars by up to £3,750. With purchase prices – not to mention range anxiety – contributing to weak consumer uptake, the government grants are designed to bring the upfront cost closer to a petrol car. Making them cheaper will also give “thousands more drivers access to savings of up to £1,500 a year in fuel and running costs compared to a petrol car”, officials say. Robert Forrester, the chief executive of the car dealership group Vertu Motors, says: “With the average new electric vehicle now costing close to £49,000, the market has drifted away from the everyday motorist. “This grant helps correct that, opening access to a wider range of customers by making sub-£40,000 EVs more appealing and financially viable.” The scheme The £650m electric car grant (ECG) is a reboot of a previous state-backed money-off scheme to incentivise drivers to switch, before a ban on the sale of new fully petrol or diesel cars and vans from 2030. There are two tiers pegged to how green the manufacturing process is. The greenest vehicles in “band one” qualify for a £3,750 discount while for “band two” vehicles the figure is £1,500. All eligible vehicles must have an RRP below £37,000. The grant only applies to new cars. The good news is that consumers don’t have to fill in any extra paperwork when they make a purchase. It is the manufacturer that applies for the grant, with the allocated funds deducted from the car’s list price. Tom Jervis, the consumer editor at Auto Express, says that while the grant is aimed at EVs costing under £37,000 “price alone isn’t enough”. “Eligibility also depends on manufacturer commitment to emissions targets, the environmental impact of the battery and production process, and where the car and battery are built,” he says. “It is based on lifecycle carbon costs, meaning the country of assembly and battery production play a major role.” The price and environmental conditions attached to securing a grant mean that some well-known brands, including Tesla, are not part of the scheme. To qualify the manufacturer must have a science-based target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. These are verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, an independent body that assesses corporate sustainability plans. Vehicles made in countries where the electricity grid is more reliant on fossil fuels will get a higher score than those made in one powered by renewables or nuclear. This focus on emissions essentially excludes vehicles made in China with its reliance on coal-fired power stations. Which cars are eligible? Although the scheme was launched formally in the middle of July, the full list of qualifying cars is still some way off. That’s because manufacturers need to apply to be considered for funding. This week, the government announced the first. On the list are 19 models from four carmakers: Citroën, Renault, Nissan and Vauxhall. They include the Citroën ë-C3 – Auto Express’s 2024 car of the year – Renault Megane, Nissan Micra and Vauxhall Grandland Electric. They are now available at the band two discount of £1,500 each. The Department for Transport (DfT) has a dedicated page on the gov.uk website which it is updating on a rolling basis with the list of approved vehicles. It says it expects to approve more models over the coming weeks. The £37,000 cut-off point narrows the choice significantly in a market where about 70% of new EVs cost over £40,000. It rules out upmarket models, including the UK’s bestselling EV, the Tesla Model Y, and every other Tesla on sale. No Audi, BMW or Mercedes EV would now be eligible either. The scheme’s design also favours European over Chinese-built cars. “Countries with high-carbon electricity, like China, are penalised in the grant calculations, meaning Chinese-built EVs like the MG4, BYD Dolphin, and Leapmotor models are expected to only qualify for the £1,500 tier – if they qualify at all,” says Jervis. “South Korean brands like Hyundai and Kia are in a grey area – reliant on fossil-fuel-heavy grids but potentially meeting other sustainability metrics. Their eligibility will likely vary by model.” He adds: “The scheme is unapologetically tilted in favour of European production with cleaner assembly and battery footprints, and this has given many manufacturers confidence that they will qualify.” The latest Nissan Leaf, which is being produced at the Japanese manufacturer’s Sunderland plant, is thought to be a shoo-in for scheme qualification when it arrives in showrooms later this year. Auto Express has compiled a list of the 52 cars its writers think could qualify if they meet the sustainability criteria. A recent poll by online marketplace Carwow found that four in 10 drivers thought the scheme excluded too many of the EVs now on sale. The objective is to make budget EVs more attractive to the public as opposed to executives who lease them, or acquire them as company cars, or through salary sacrifice schemes. Carwow’s Iain Reid says: “Crucially, the grant applies to both outright purchases and leasing deals, making electric vehicles more accessible to a wider range of private drivers.” Discounts by carmakers If you have your heart set on a car marque unlikely to make the cut the good news is that the scheme has triggered a wave of price cuts by manufacturers who don’t want to be left behind. The Chinese brand Leapmotor has, for example, launched what it calls a leap-grant, with adverts that pose the question: “Why wait for the government?” It has cut the price of its cheapest model, the To3, by £1,500 to £14,495 and is billing it as the “UK’s most affordable 5-door electric city car”. It has also cut the price of its C10 SUV by £3,750, bringing it down to £32,750. Other manufacturers have taken action to make sure models come under the price threshold for the scheme. Jervis says: “Both the Vauxhall Grandland and Renault Scenic were slightly above the cut-off when the grant was first announced, but the entry point for the Scenic range has dropped by £200 and the Grandland by £400 to put both electric SUVs at £36,995. “Getting the entry models under £37,000 is crucial for brands, as that brings the entire lineup using the same battery into eligibility.” He says Chinese carmakers GWM Ora and MG have also cut prices by up to £3,750, “likely because they fear they won’t qualify – in order to stay competitive. Volvo, Hyundai and Kia all launched offers too, and we are likely to see more brands follow suit over the next few weeks.” Buy now or wait? With the scheme scheduled to run until 2027–28 – or until the funding is exhausted – early signs point to strong demand. Carwow’s Reid says: “Traffic to our EV grant information pages surged 160% immediately after the announcement. The government’s previous plug-in car grant, which ended in June 2022, helped increase electric car sales by 70% within a year. Our advice is to start researching and test-driving now. On average, the car-buying journey takes around 190 days, so being prepared means you can act fast once the grant applies to your chosen model. There’s a definite first-mover advantage and today’s mix of official and brand incentives may not stick around for long.” Now is a “very good time to go and buy an electric vehicle”, says Vertu Motors’ Forrester. “It’s coming at a time when we are, for the first time, seeing cheaper electric vehicles on the market.” He adds: “I think there’ll be a limited number [of cars approved for grants] because a lot of manufacturers don’t think they will comply and are discounting to overcome the competitive disadvantage. Whether you get a grant or not, doesn’t really matter, does it? The price has come down.”","Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Motor finance; Motoring; Consumer affairs; Consumer spending; Money; Economics; Ethical and green living; Motoring; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions",Environment
2024-11-18T10:40:46Z,"For the first time in its history, we could be looking at a genuinely rightwing European Union | Alberto Alemanno",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/18/european-union-right-wing-ursula-von-der-leyen-eu-commission-hard-right-parties,"Many observers breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when the mainstream, pro-EU alliance – of centre-left, centre-right and liberal parties – held on to its majority in the European parliament elections. These parties, which have governed Europe for the past four decades, are to endorse Ursula von der Leyen’s new European Commission by the end of the month, with the declared goal of making the European economy greener, more competitive and more secure. Yet behind this business as usual account of EU political power lies a different, less reassuring reality. Von der Leyen’s commission has not even taken office yet, but already the far right is punching well above its weight. And it will be emboldened by the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The new European parliament, which has the job of endorsing the Von der Leyen 2.0 commission, is the most right wing in EU history. More than half of its members are from Von der Leyen’s centre-right European People’s party (EPP) and from far-right groups that include the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), which brings together Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s party with more extreme far-right parties such as France’s (Reconquête) and the Sweden Democrats. There is also the Patriots for Europe (PfE) group, co-led by Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orbán, and the even more extreme Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN), dominated by Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland. The same is true for the other two main institutions that share executive power in Europe. More than half the members of the incoming EU commission (each proposed by one member state) and the EU council are from the right. This rightward shift in the balance of power is unprecedented and could mean the end of the centrist majority that has governed Europe since the EU’s creation. While Von der Leyen made public pledges in her first term to stick to the centre of politics, the incoming commission may be tempted to look to the right of the traditional EPP conservative bloc to pursue its political objectives. Why is this? Coalitions in the EU parliament have historically been built issue by issue, and no commission has ever relied on a predetermined parliamentary majority during its five-year mandate. This means that votes from the far right will probably offer a way for Von der Leyen to get some of her most conservative policies over the line, while maintaining the veneer of respectability provided by mainstream EU parties’ support. Since the incoming commission is neither politically committed nor accountable to its pro-EU mainstream alliance, the door remains open to cooperation with the far right. The combined strength of the three far-right groups (ECR, PfE and ESN) adds up to 187 of 720 seats in the parliament. This makes them a potent new ally for the EPP. In addition, the EU council, which is made up of heads of state, is dominated by 14 national governments led or supported by the right or far right, and they could force the commission to depart from its stated priorities. For a taste of what may be to come, we only need look to earlier this year, when Von der Leyen, who was then outgoing commission president, capitulated to farmers’ protests – supported by the far right – and ditched the green deal. Since then, a clear pattern to de-green EU policy has emerged. First came the pushback against the combustion engine ban, which requires all new cars to have zero CO2 emissions from 2035, followed by the delayed implementation of deforestation regulation, the watering down of the corporate sustainability directive and the postponement of rules to make the common agricultural policy more environmentally friendly. The mainstream’s silent appropriation of the hard-right agenda is clear from Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party securing a vice-presidency of the EU parliament, along with several parliamentary committee chairs and potentially one EU commissioner. It’s true that Orbán’s PfE and the even more extreme Sovereignists remain officially excluded from joining forces with mainstream EU parties under the so-called cordon sanitaire – an unwritten agreement among centrist parties to exclude fringe forces on either end of the political spectrum. However, this did not prevent the EPP voting in September with all far-right groups on a resolution recognising Edmundo González as Venezuelan president. In fact, the firewall against the far right that operates across Europe has already been breached in the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden, where governing coalitions are made up of conservatives and far-right politicians. Several EPP leaders have had extensive contact with hard-right MEPs aligned with Meloni over the past year, and Von der Leyen has embraced Italy’s offshore deportation centres. In addition, the EPP refused to sign a declaration supported by the socialists, greens, liberals, and the left to keep the far right “at bay” at every level. This rang alarm bells, which are getting louder by the day. All the nominated commissioners were interviewed over the past two weeks at a public hearing of the European parliament to see if they are up to the job. It could reject the entire slate of candidates. However, this is unlikely to happen, as it would significantly delay the new EU Commission’s entry into office. MEPs should not miss the opportunity to ask Von der Leyen – and her appointees – for clarity on one important question: which political majority will she rely on and respond to over the coming five years? A far-right majority of pro-Trump conservatives and formerly fringe actors, or mainstream political forces such as the socialists, liberals and greens? Her actions over the past few months only point in one direction. Welcome to the new Europe.

2024-09-26T12:00:02Z,America’s first ‘carbon positive’ hotel comes to Denver – but do its climate claims stack up?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/26/first-carbon-positive-hotel-populus-denver-climate-claims,"Travelers to Denver, Colorado, will soon have the opportunity to spend the night in what promises to be “the first carbon positive hotel in America”. So say the creators behind Populus, a new 265-room, stylish, yet climate-conscious luxury hotel in the heart of the city. Set to open in mid-October, the building is a striking addition to the city’s skyline – a sleek, three-corner structure built to resemble a grove of aspen trees, with each window shaped like the tree’s iconic “knots”. Its climate claims, too, are equally provocative. The hotel’s creators have promised to overcompensate for their emissions by a factor of 400% to 500%, through a combination of low-carbon construction, eco-friendly operations and a huge tree planting campaign throughout Colorado. But when accounting for all of the waste, energy consumption and transportation of goods required of a luxury hotel with two restaurants – not to mention the fact that buildings alone account for 39% of greenhouse gas emissions – will your $300 to $500 purchase of a room at Populus really help fight climate change? “There are a lot of layers to this,” says Joel Hartter, a University of Colorado Boulder environmental studies professor who specializes in corporate sustainability. “On paper, it looks great. But it would take a lot of research to verify those claims.” These days, claims of “carbon neutrality” from giant corporations such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Walmart, IKEA, Microsoft and many more are commonplace. But often, that merely means using their deep pockets to purchase “carbon credits” –paying for reforestation or renewable energy projects to offset carbon emissions – which have often been discredited and been found to actually worsen the climate crisis. Populus goes one step further in its boast of being “carbon positive”, not just offsetting the hotel’s carbon footprint but actually taking out far more carbon than it puts in – a promise few businesses would dare to make, for both financial and publicity reasons. As a term, however, “carbon positive” can be linguistically confusing (“carbon negative” would be literally more accurate), and with no clear definition of what “carbon positive” means, there are no metrics by which to determine its validity. Jon Buerge is the president of Urban Villages, the sustainable development company behind Populus. He defines carbon positive as “sequestering more carbon out of the atmosphere than would ever be emitted over the lifetime of the project”. But just how much CO2 emissions can you attribute to any one project? Hartter admits it’s a challenge. “You have to account for several factors: direct emissions from the hotel itself, such as HVAC systems and company vans; emissions from purchased electricity that powers the building, including lighting, heating and cooling; and indirect emissions, like the transportation of goods, the carbon footprint of construction materials, waste disposal and guest travel. In this case, you must also consider site preparation, building materials, supply chains and everything brought into the hotel – from beds and furniture to TVs. You also have to think about the timescale over which offsetting occurs,” he explains. “It’s complex, and this is what many of the world’s largest companies are currently grappling with.” Buerge is eager to unpack all the ways that Populus has reduced its carbon footprint both through the construction of the building – using recycled materials, low-carbon concrete and only 100% renewable energy in its operations. “These goals led to some pretty unique approaches to hospitality,” says Buerge. “We decided not to have any onsite parking. One hundred per cent of our food products are sourced locally, and all food waste will be turned into compost and returned to those same farms.” He says the hotel also utilized eco-friendly materials such as beetle-kill wood, fly ash concrete (which emits far less carbon than traditional concrete, yet has never been used in a commercial building before) and leather made from reishi mushrooms. “We’ve talked a lot about biophilic design, resembling nature,” says Buerge of the hotel’s interior. “It’s made to resemble a walk through the woods.” However, it’s their promise to plant one spruce tree in Colorado for every guest that stays at Populus that their carbon positive balance sheet hinges upon. A decades-long beetle epidemic has destroyed millions of acres of trees throughout the US west, contributing to outbreaks of wildfires and devastating whole ecosystems. In pursuit of removing carbon from the atmosphere via new trees, Buerge collaborated with the US Forest Service, who directed them toward beetle-resistant spruce trees. Buerge says they have already planted 70,000 spruce trees throughout Colorado’s National Wilderness Preservation System to offset emissions accrued in the building process of the hotel, with another 20,000 to be planted this year. “We’re not just buying carbon credits, we’re not even just planting trees,” he says. “We’re reforesting Colorado forests.” Jay Arehart, an architectural engineering professor at University of Colorado Boulder, has been following the Populus project for a long time and is impressed with its creators’ approach to a low-carbon development and the legitimacy of their ambitious offset goals, which he says are very rare in commercial real estate, since the construction of buildings comes with such a high carbon price tag. “It’s a great pilot program that could definitely set a precedent,” he says. “When thinking about net-zero goals that companies might have – or are forced to have – this is a project we could point to as evidence that it can be done.” While Hartter is cynical about companies over-relying on carbon offsets – it’s “like eating KFC every day, then paying someone in Florida to eat vegetables”, he says – he is optimistic about Urban Village’s new hotel. “They’re doing the right things: table-to-farm foods, solutions for waste, lining the sidewalks with trees, which will reduce heat.” But, he warns, failure to live up to their claims could come back to bite them. “Millennials and gen Z often align their values to their pocketbooks, and their brand loyalty is based on a company’s sustainable values,” he says. “I really hope Populus’s aims stand up beyond just marketing.”",Environment; Colorado; Architecture; Climate crisis; Carbon offsetting; Carbon footprints,Environment
2025-02-04T12:00:04Z,‘The last drops of our water’: how a mine left some of Peru’s poorest high and dry ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/04/the-last-drops-of-our-water-how-a-mine-left-some-of-perus-poorest-high-and-dry,"A chilly breeze passes along the shore of Lake Contonga, 4,400 metres up in the Peruvian Andes. Julio Rimac Damian, from the nearby village of Challhuayaco, points to the mud under his feet. “All this used to be covered with water,” he says. A canal running from the lake that is supposed to carry water to lowland villages has also run dry. Damian says the water began to disappear two years ago when a mining company started exploratory drilling in Peru’s highlands. “This is a tragedy for us,” Damian says. “We depend on these waters.” Behind Lake Contonga lies one of the biggest zinc mines in the world: Antamina. The open-pit mine, which also produces copper, silver, lead and molybdenum, is operated by a multinational corporation owned by the huge mining companies BHP Billiton, Glencore and Teck Resources as well as the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi. Glencore, a key shareholder based in Switzerland, plays a dominant role in global mineral markets, while BHP is the world’s biggest miner. Antamina has been given the go-ahead by the Peruvian government to expand zinc extraction in the area, even though the Andean mountain ranges are classified as extremely vulnerable to the climate crisis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More than half of Peru’s glaciers have melted over the past 50 years due to global heating. Meltwater from the glaciers is the main water source for the people of the Andes, but is already in short supply. Since 2014, Peru’s zinc production has increased and the value of exports has risen by nearly 60%, according to the ministry of energy and mines. The country has the world’s fourth-largest zinc reserves, traditionally exploited for the automotive and construction industries. However, the new zinc boom is fuelled by the surge in demand for green energy technology. Zinc is used to produce batteries, solar panels and windmills as it protects them from corrosion. Demand for it has recently soared, especially in the wind energy sector. According to the International Energy Agency, the green transition is driving “unprecedented growth” in the minerals market. Although zinc is not yet at the top of the market, it is expected to see one of the biggest rises among green minerals. In 2022, the market price of zinc hit historic highs – $4,500 a tonne (£3,650). The World Bank considers zinc to be one of the most important minerals for climate action and predicts demand will increase by 200% by 2050. Sabina Grund, at the International Zinc Association (IZA), says: “The future of the zinc industry in the green transition looks very bright. In Europe, we expect a significant increase in zinc demand.” Peru is the world’s second-largest producer of unrefined zinc after China. In 2023, most of Peru’s zinc was exported to China, the US, South Korea and Spain. In 2023, the Antamina mine, partly owned by Glencore, produced almost 36% of Peru’s zinc, according to Peruvian customs records. Much of Europe’s zinc is refined at three large smelters: the Glencore-owned Asturiana de Zinc smelter in northern Spain, Nyrstar in Belgium and the Swedish-owned Boliden Kokkola in Finland. Peruvian zinc imported to Europe to produce low-carbon technology is mined in areas already vulnerable to the climate crisis. In October 2023, the Peruvian congress declared a state of emergency due to drought linked to the El Niño weather fluctuation. The situation was particularly bad in the Andes, where zinc mining is concentrated. Studies show that mining can exacerbate the climate crisis in glacial areas, as dust pollution can accelerate the melting of glaciers by absorbing more heat. In Chile, mining-waste ponds and road construction have exacerbated the shrinking of glaciers. The industry also uses large amounts of water and experts say mining poses the greatest risk in areas with the least water, including Peru. “In the case of Antamina, the concession has been established in such a risk zone, as it is surrounded by key water reserves,” says Karem Luque, a Peruvian biologist specialising in human and environmental health. “Water supplies are heavily affected already in the exploration stage. Drilling holes of 100-150 metres in the ground interrupts the natural courses of water that feed principal rivers.” The zinc-mining industry could reduce its environmental impact by increasing recycling, say experts. Only 29% of the world’s zinc is recycled, due to inadequate recovery systems because of a lack of economic incentives. *** Mining has caused other kinds of environmental damage and pollution elsewhere in Peru. “We are talking about chronic exposure of local people to different kinds of contaminants and toxic substances through air, soil and water,” Luque says. Evidence of contamination can also be found at the Antamina zinc mine. Between 2008 and 2023, the company was sanctioned over 67 environmental incidents. These included exceeding permitted limits for pollution and failing to prevent leaks from wastewater ponds. Antamina says the company has identified the problems to avoid further environmental impacts from the mine. “None of the water bodies in the San Marcos district will be affected,” the company’s representative says. The Peruvian authorities have classified San Marcos as a high-risk area due to its high concentration of heavy metals. Even though it is the district surrounding Antamina, the source of the heavy metals is defined as “unknown”. In January 2024, a health and environmental emergency was declared across the region and several other districts. Residents say that last year the health authorities measured concentrations of heavy metal in water sources near the mine. The results have not yet been published. Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy metal released into the environment as a by-product of zinc extraction; exposure to high levels in water can cause cancer and other diseases. Antamina has also been questioned by the Áncash regional health authorities about allegations made by the environmental organisation Natura and residents of Huarmey about the high levels of arsenic among people living in the port, where the company stores zinc before export. The company says the presence of heavy metals “is not related to their operative processes”. The Guardian has seen the results of urine analyses of 100 residents living near the port carried out in 2023; only two of them were within permitted levels. Several samples taken from children had arsenic levels at 10 to 15 times above the permitted limits. The exact sources of contamination are “not known”. In September 2024, the Áncash regional government put forward a plan to find the sources of high levels of heavy metals, especially arsenic. Luque says transporting zinc to the port and storage facilities are probable sources of arsenic, as pollution builds up in the air and soil. Antamina’s representative says these results “alone are not sufficient to identify the nature of exposure or the source” of arsenic, adding that their copper and zinc concentrates arrive at Huarmey port “through a hermetic underground pipeline and its conditions are monitored in real time”. Peru’s Environmental Assessment and Oversight Agency (OEFA) did not respond to requests for comment about how it monitors heavy metal levels in the Huarmey port area. Last year, the EU’s corporate sustainability due diligence directive was adopted but the bloc has no binding mechanisms to hold companies accountable for the environmental impacts of zinc production. Emily Iona Stewart, who heads EU relations over transition minerals at the environmental advocacy group Global Witness, says: “The current regulations are broad and only apply to the largest companies. They also do not pressure companies to make changes downstream in the production chain.” Stewart says the directive needs significant advancements to genuinely improve transparency and environmental practices in supply chains. Currently, responsible zinc production falls under a voluntary scheme run by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Zinc Mark, issued by Copper Mark. Being listed as an LME brand requires companies to follow a responsible sourcing policy, which includes implementing the OECD due diligence guidance. Nicole Hanson, head of sustainability at the exchange, says: “The LME’s ultimate action … is to suspend or de-list the brand from our approved brands list.” She adds: “We did have to take this action this year for many of our brands.” The European smelters Asturiana de Zinc and Boliden Kokkola, which imported Peruvian zinc in 2023, belong to the LME brand list. The list only covers smelters and refiners of zinc metal; companies extracting zinc ore or manufacturing finished zinc products are not subject to similar control. Nyrstar said it had “solid policies and due-diligence practices in place” as part of “actively pursuing” LME’s responsible sourcing practices and had been awarded the Zinc Mark for four of its six zinc smelters. Mitsubishi said Antamina met international and local standards, “considers coexistence with the local environment and communities as one of its top management priorities” and addressed issues in a timely manner. The Guardian asked nine key European green technology manufacturers about the origin of the zinc they use in production. Only three companies replied, but they refused to comment on the origin of their zinc. *** In the Andean highlands, the morning sun is reflected in a green sign that stands out in the landscape. “Antamina mining area: no trespassing or animal grazing,” it reads. Julio Rimac Damian says he does not oppose mining but is disappointed by how the company treats local people and the environment. “The company just says to us that the lake is drying because of climate change,” he says. Elva Cotrina Espinoza, a smallholder from Challhuayaco, shares the same view. “It is becoming increasingly difficult to earn a living from agriculture. Fertiliser prices are sky-high and there is hardly enough water,” she says. “We wish the company would at least give us some economic support. There is a desperate need for an irrigation canal, but the company never shows up here.” In the department of Áncash, where the Antamina mine is located, the poverty rate reached 25% in 2023, a 16% rise on the year before, and nearly 68,000 people in the region live in extreme poverty. Many local residents are aware that Glencore made $4.3bn profit for its shareholders that year. “The mining profit does not end up with the communities,” says Damian. “Instead, the company wants to take out the last drops of our water.” This article was amended on 21 February 2025. An earlier version stated that the Zinc Mark assuring responsible production was issued by the IZA. In fact it is issued by the Copper Mark.

2024-10-31T12:00:18Z,‘You can’t even wash your hands’: is a global industrial hub responsible for the destruction of Mexico’s Atoyac River?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/31/you-cant-even-wash-your-hands-is-a-global-industrial-hub-responsible-for-the-destruction-of-mexicos-atoyac-river,"On the outskirts of Puebla in central Mexico sits an area on the Atoyac River known as Nueva Alemania, or “New Germany”. Between two factories, under-construction houses pepper streets with names such as Frankfurt, Hamburg, Kiel, Hanover and Berlin. New Germany is part of a broader region, an industrial district covering about 4,000 square kilometres that has been a hub for Mexican and global multinationals – notably German conglomerates – since the 1960s. Spanning 47 municipalities in the state of Tlaxcala and 22 in the state of Puebla, it is home to 1.1 million people. Running through the area is the Atoyac River. But it is not a river that the community is proud of. “People used to wash clothes as the water was crystal clear, and they even bathed in the river,” remembers María Ocotlán, a Mexican snack shop owner on Munich Street. “Now, you can’t even wash your hands. The deterioration has been going on for 20 years.” The Upper Atoyac basin is one of 30 regions identified as being in a state of socio-environmental and health emergency in Mexico, polluted by sewage and waste from homes, farmland, and, above all, factories. Now, the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has promised to clean up the Atoyac – as well as the Lerma, Santiago and Tula Rivers – as one of the 100 priorities of her recently sworn-in government. But to meet her commitment, Sheinbaum, a former climate scientist, will have to confront multinational companies accused by campaigners of harming the river. Since 2021, a coalition of Mexican and international NGOs and experts has been denouncing New Germany – and especially the German multinationals – for the environmental devastation of the Atoyac, blaming “the pollution left by transnational corporations such as Volkswagen, Bayer, BASF and Thyssenkrupp, among others” for “leaving its mark on the territory and people’s bodies”. In October 2023, the National Council of Science and Technology (Conahcyt), a public body of the Mexican government, acknowledged in a report that the region’s pollutants posed severe threats to public health. The report showed that the mortality rate from chronic kidney diseases among people aged 15 to 49 in Tlaxcala regions within the Upper Atoyac basin was almost five times higher than the national average. High mortality rates from acute leukaemias in individuals under 19 were also more common in the southern part of the basin, particularly in Puebla and Tlaxcala, where the levels of metals and arsenic in the river are significantly higher. “Over the last decades, the inhabitants of the Upper Atoyac basin have witnessed the constant increase of industrial settlements such as the arrival of Volkswagen in 1965, the creation of the Independencia Petrochemical Complex in 1969 or the installation of the Audi company in 2016, among others,” says the document. “The region witnessed an economic development of apparent prosperity, but the organisation of global mercantile processes that privileged the profitability of transnational companies promoted health, social and environmental ‘externalities’ with serious effects for local communities.” The report noted: “The scientific evidence presented in this first report demonstrates that these high [mortality] rates are caused by exposure to toxins and polluting processes from industries located in the region. The automotive, electrical, chemical and textile industries have the highest pollutant emissions.” Alejandra Méndez, who directs the Fray Julián Garcés Centre for Human Rights and Local Development, has spent the last 20 years denouncing the pollution caused by Mexican and foreign multinationals settled in the industrial district. “The smell is terrible: toxic, sweet but spicy at night. It makes people dizzy or vomit,” she says, referring to the region where VW and Pemex, the Mexican state-controlled oil company, have been since the 1960s. In 2011, local communities filed a complaint with the Mexican National Human Rights Commission. That led to a recommendation in 2017 urging the state governments of Puebla and Tlaxcala to implement measures to guarantee their right to a healthy environment. From 2015 to 2017, the federal environmental prosecutor’s office (Profepa) conducted 945 inspection visits, leading to the closure of 27 industries for mishandling hazardous waste. It also initiated legal actions against 38 municipalities over their responsibility for the pollution. From 2022 to mid-2023, the prosecutors enforced another 13 closures, mainly in San Martín Texmelucan and Puebla. Last year, the Mexican secretariat of environment and natural resources, along with the National Water Commission (Conagua), released a report acknowledging that out of 18 locations along the Atoyac River in Puebla and Tlaxcala, only one was found to be unpolluted. *** According to the non-municipal wastewater treatment plants inventory, 219 companies discharged wastewater into the Atoyac River basin every day in 2022. Although multinationals from several countries pour their waters into the Atoyac, many of the biggest are German. Last year, Puebla was the leading Mexican exporter to Germany, moving goods worth $3.66bn (£2.82bn). A report from Mexico’s Secretariat of Economy on foreign direct investment (FDI) showed that from January to June, it received $942m worth of German investment, second only to Mexico City, with $1.45bn in investments. Conahcyt says that the heavy metals, metalloids, organic-synthetic compounds, and pesticides dumped in the Atoyac by industry are the reason behind the high rates of diseases related to pollution among the local population – rates that surpass Mexico’s national average. “According to data from the pollutant release and transfer register , the area with the highest emissions is the Zahuapan area, a sub-basin of the Atoyac River located in Tlaxcala,” the report says. “In this sub-region, there are important chemical and other industries of various kinds that are also highly polluting.” Another report, this time from the Public Registry of Water Rights, says in Puebla alone, BASF extracts approximately 1,750 cubic meters of water a day and discharges almost 194,000 cubic meters of wastewater annually directly into the Atoyac River. BASF says it operates its Puebla site “in full compliance with local and federal laws and upholds a strong commitment to environmental stewardship across all its locations”. The company highlights that since its establishment, the Puebla facility has operated a wastewater treatment plant 24 hours a day as part of its commitment to safe production for people and the environment, and has held the Clean Industry Certificate, issued by Profepa, since 2015. “We operate in alignment with local and federal laws that apply to us and with the Corporate Target Introduction of Sustainable Water Management,” says BASF. Volkswagen’s car assembly plants, also sitting next to the Atoyac, have extracted 1.5m cubic meters of water annually since May 1996, the exact volume of annual residual discharges the company reports to have made since 2004. In response to inquiries about the wastewater in the Atoyac, the company says it complies with “all the measurements required by applicable Mexican regulations”. Bayer says its production plant in Tlaxcala is dedicated to biofungicides, “with no chemical products produced on-site”. The company says it has undergone inspections by the Mexican authorities, including Conagua and Profepa, and has not received any sanctions. The Tlaxcala’s facility, says the organisation, does not discharge wastewater directly into the Atoyac River, but “pre-treated wastewater” in accordance with the state water and sanitation commission of Tlaxcala, which is responsible for its final discharge. “Bayer has maintained an open-door and transparency policy, informing the community, authorities, and all interested parties about its high standards of environmental protection, as well as its wastewater treatment process,” the company says, adding: “The site complies with all applicable regulations and with the company’s global international standards.” Thyssenkrupp says it is “not aware of any complaints regarding the health of the local population, nor have any inspections been carried out by the Federal Environmental Prosecutor’s Office”. The company adds that wastewater “is treated in water treatment plants and monitored by the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with officially established limits” and reiterates that it follows “company-wide standards”, such as the german supply chain due diligence act and the principles of compliance with human rights and environmental due diligence. *** Campaigners say that in the past 60 years, Mexico has made political decisions based on achieving economic growth, not environmental consequences. Rodolfo Omar Arellano-Aguilar, a researcher on ecology and natural resources at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, says that Mexican legislation allows high pollution levels and does not specify criteria to verify who is polluting. “Industries must keep their pollutants below certain levels, but those limits are absurdly high,” he says. “Despite that, discharges are carried out into common drains, making it impossible to know who is responsible.” In addition to facing increasing pushback from federal authorities and affected communities in Mexico, the German and other European corporations blamed for damaging the Atoyac basin will soon be under greater scrutiny from the EU. In April 2024, the European parliament approved the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, a new regulation strengthening European companies’ responsibility for environmental practices beyond EU borders. The directive came despite two years of lobbying by industrial groups and efforts by German officials to water down the directive’s scope, “seeking to diminish the law’s potential impact”, according to the Corporate Europe Observatory. “German business lobby groups have done their utmost to use the German law as a lever to keep European ambitions in check,” says Friends of the Earth. At the final vote in Strasbourg’s last plenary session before the EU election, MEPs approved a text that entered into force in July and will affect companies with more than 1,000 employees and an annual turnover of more than €450m (£376m). The German conglomerates in the Atoyac will fall within the scope of the EU regulation from 2027 onwards, when they will be obliged to integrate due diligence into their business policies to comply with the directive. BASF publicly welcomed the new regulations, while Bayer joined a group of companies that publicly condemned German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s manoeuvres to water down the directive. Finnish Green MEP Heidi Hautala, the directive’s “shadow” rapporteur, says these companies no longer opposed the new directive “partly because of the concessions agreed between member states”. “In some ways,” she says, “we are in the direction they wanted to go.” Journalismfund Europe supported this story",Pollution; Rivers; Global development; Globalisation; Mexico; Americas; World news; Water,Global development
2023-12-06T00:01:55Z,"Air France, Lufthansa and Etihad ads banned for misleading claims",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/06/air-france-lufthansa-etihad-ads-banned-misleading-claims-advertising-environmental,"Adverts from Air France, Lufthansa and Etihad have been banned by the UK’s ad regulator due to concerns they have misled customers about the environmental impact of air travel. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned three adverts identified in July using artificial intelligence that suggested flights operated by leading airlines were sustainable. One Google ad by Lufthansa said consumers could “fly more sustainably” with the airline, while another from Air France said the company was “committed to protecting the environment”. A third by Etihad offered potential customers “total peace of mind”, mentioning their environmental advocacy. All three were banned from appearing again for breaking rules on misleading advertising and environmental claims. In each case, the ASA said the ads could not corroborate their environmental claims, because the UK ad code required such absolute claims to be “supported by a high level of substantiation”. The ruling, published on Wednesday, upheld the complaints against the airlines on the grounds they gave a misleading impression of the impact of air travel on the environment. “We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims,” read the ruling against Etihad. It is the second time this year that Lufthansa and Etihad have fallen foul of UK marketing rules. Lufthansa, which promised it would stop using the slogan “fly more sustainably”, said a paid-for Google ad did not provide space for a full explanation of “green fares” but that consumers could follow a link for more information supporting its ad claims. Etihad said after receiving notification of the complaint, it had removed all references to “environmental advocacy” from its Google adverts in the UK. Air France-KLM did not respond to the ruling. Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions and continues to rise, driving global heating. Despite industry efforts to use carbon offsetting, cleaner fuels and more efficient planes to mitigate the impact of flying, it continues to be a significant source of greenhouse gases. Leo Murray, the director of innovation at the climate charity Possible and co-author of Badvertising: Polluting Our Minds and Fuelling Climate Chaos, said: “It is fantastic to see the UK’s de facto advertising regulator becoming more confident and proactive in dealing with dishonest corporate sustainability claims like this one, and we applaud their growing use of AI to cast the net much wider than has been possible in the past.” However, he added: “As the ASA explicitly notes, there is no such thing as environmentally friendly air travel, and our own work shows that meeting our climate commitments means overall levels of demand for flying must fall, and fast.” Air France, Lufthansa and Etihad were contacted by the Guardian. Lufthansa said it regretted “the Google advertisement in question lacked the explanation of the further basis for the statement ‘fly more sustainable’” and that it regularly informed its customers, stakeholders and the public about its responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of flying. An Etihad spokesperson said the company was proud to have been awarded environmental airline of the year in 2022 and 2023 in the Airline Excellence awards, and would continue to take bold and innovative steps to make flying more sustainable. Miles Lockwood, the director of complaints and investigations at the ASA, said environmental claims by any business needed to be substantiated. “Our rules make it clear that any green claims in ads need to be supported by robust evidence,” he said. “That includes any general claims, such as ‘environmentally friendly’ or ‘sustainable’ – broad, absolute statements like this need to be justified with a high level of evidence. Flights still emit large amounts of carbon and other non-carbon emissions and so it is misleading to give an impression to consumers that flying is better for the environment than it is in practice. “We’re focused on ads in this and other high carbon-emitting sectors and what they’re saying about their overall environmental impact,.” Others brands that have had ASA bans for making misleading and unsubstantiated environmental claims in recent years include Ryanair, HSBC and the energy companies Esso and Shell.",Advertising Standards Authority; Environment; Business; Air pollution; Air transport; Airline emissions; Airline industry; World news; Advertising; Media,Media
2024-05-30T13:00:47Z,"Legislation, AI and the Ganni playbook: 10 takeaways from the Super Bowl of sustainable fashion",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/may/30/legislation-ai-and-the-ganni-playbook-10-takeaways-from-the-super-bowl-of-sustainable-fashion,"May is a big month in fashion. The Met gala, often described as the Super Bowl of fashion, sees celebrities arrive at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York wearing outfits so elaborate that ascending the stairs often requires assistance. The Global Fashion Summit, which takes place later in May, sees sustainable fashion experts and designers descend on Copenhagen for what could be called the Super Bowl of sustainable fashion. At the three-day conference, delegates’ outfits are scrutinised far less than ideas, innovations and new technologies aimed at reducing fashion’s ever-growing carbon, waste and water footprints. This year, on its 15th anniversary, the lack of progress towards industry-wide change dampened spirits. But, from fast fashion brands committing to circular business models, to advice on how to decouple carbon emissions from revenue growth, there was much to discuss. Here are 10 key takeaways: 1. It’s time for legislation Fashion’s emissions are still growing. “The global goals are not on track,” said the founder and former CEO of the Global Fashion Summit (GFS), Eva Kruse. She was speaking at a panel described by its moderator, Vanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic of the New York Times, as “the OG summit gang”. “I had no idea how slow this would go,” Kruse continued. “I thought at some point we would become obsolete, but we’re still here talking about the same things.” Her conclusion: “We have to call in legislation. It’s on us.” Her calls for regulation were echoed across sessions. The European Union’s extended producer responsibility scheme, which comes into force on 1 January 2025, is likely to be the first of several steps towards legislative accountability. The legislation will have an industry-wide impact because of the global nature of fashion’s supply chains. Plus, with legislative acts also being discussed in France, California, New York and Australia, it is clear that a line is being drawn. Regulation is coming and businesses must figure out how it will affect them. 2. Primark and H&amp;M are committed to some rental, resale and repair There was a little hope in the shape of the Fashion ReModel project, which was launched at the summit by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF). It sees a coalition of fashion businesses including Primark, Reformation and the H&amp;M Group (which owns Arket, Cos and Weekday) commit to replacing a portion of their revenue stream from selling new goods with income from circular business models: rental, resale and repair. At the moment, these make up 3.5% of the global fashion market, but the EMF says that, by 2030, there is the potential for these models to take up 23% of the market and be worth $700bn. 3. It is possible to grow a business and reduce carbon emissions This may sound too good to be true but Ganni, the favourite brand of Danish It girls, announced to a home crowd that it had achieved a 7% absolute reduction in carbon emissions compared with 2021, while seeing annual sales growth of 18%, proving it is possible to decouple revenue from carbon. It is a formula that, apparently, with the right expertise, can be replicated by other businesses. The Ganni co-founder Nicolaj Reffstrup has co-authored the Ganni Playbook with journalist Brooke Roberts-Islam laying out how. While full of detail on the challenges and financial cost, he kept things more topline at the summit. When asked what advice he had for other businesses looking to decarbonise their supply chains, he said, simply: “Just do it.” 4. Brands need to put their money where their mouth is The slow progress of change is, according to Peder Michael Anker-Jorgensen, who is on the board of Global Fashion Agenda, which organises the summit, down to a lack of financial commitment towards sustainable solutions from brands. He said: “1.5% to 2% of operating income is going into research and development.” Despite paying lip service to sustainability: “The money’s not where the talk is.” According to Christine Goulay, the founder of consultancy Sustainabelle, fashion’s investments pale in comparison to those by other industries. A recent report found electronics companies spend 10% to 15% of sales on research and development and pharmaceutical and biotech companies spend 20% to 30%. 5. Brands need to be more transparent The fashion industry is famous for working behind closed doors and guarding its secrets. Consensus across the forums was that these isolationist tendencies have hampered progress towards sustainability, which is dependent on overhauling interconnected supply chains. “If each one is just looking after his own small garden without industry collaboration, we’ll never get the results,” said Attila Kiss, the CEO of Gruppo Florence, a group that represents luxury production facilities in Italy. 6. The perspectives of garment workers from the global south are still lacking Panels were often made up of people who represented the corporate or consumer end of fashion businesses, rather than the farmers and manufacturers who produce fibres and clothes. It speaks to who gets to have a seat at the table. “When we talk about garment workers, farmers, tannery workers, we need those people to be in the conversation – not just spoken about in abstract,” said Emma Hakansson, the founding director of Collective Fashion Justice. In one instance, a representative from the Cambodian workforce, Athit Kong, joined a panel via video due to the difficulties of traveling to Copenhagen. “The [summit] needs to take proactive steps to engage worker communities and representatives and, where necessary, provide sponsorship and support with visas,” said Olivia Windham Stewart, an independent business and human rights adviser, who moderated the panel. “Otherwise it will just be a forum for industry to tell their side of the story.” 7. AI isn’t the solution One thing driving fashion’s environmental impacts is the sheer volume of products that are never worn, a result of the time lag between orders, production and retail. Artificial intelligence is often cited as a solution, but Dr Ahmed Zaidi, the CEO of AI platform Hyran Technologies, said that, without overhauling fashion’s manufacturing processes to be more agile and responsive to consumer demand, “using AI [as a solution] is like attaching a jet engine to a broken process”. So if anyone thought AI was going to be able to fix our broken system, think again. 8. Collaborations with Indigenous communities are moving forward Despite fashion’s reliance on the natural world for its most luxurious materials, the Indigenous and local communities who are caretakers of 80% of the world’s biodiversity have long been excluded from corporate sustainability conversations. But there is hope in the shape of a new guide. A collaboration between the NGO Conservation International and luxury group Kering to help brands partner with Indigenous communities, it was sparked by 2022 research from Textile Exchange that revealed only 5% of the of 252 fashion brands surveyed consult Indigenous people on their biodiversity plans. According to Dayana Molina, an activist and Indigenous designer at fashion brand Nalimo, it is a first step to “push forward to make fashion that is cooperative, collaborative and fair”. On a separate panel, Naiomi Glasses, a seventh-generation Diné (Navajo) textile artist and designer who collaborated with Polo Ralph Lauren on a collection, said she would like to see “more brands embrace telling more stories like mine … The power of collaboration is really beautiful because there are so many stories embedded in craft and it lets us show how Indigenous cultures are still here and still thriving.” 9. Another next-gen material is here to rival synthetics More than $500m was invested in next-gen materials in 2023. From mushroom leather to spider silk and viscose made from coconut water, innovations in the material space are often heralded as the future of fashion. But the challenges of producing them en masse at a competitive price often come as a cold shock to innovators. Nevertheless, there is a new kid on the block. New York-based Bloom Labs is making materials that feel like cotton and silk while being as functional as polyester, all from protein-rich biomass waste, including pre-consumer discarded wool and upcycled down from the bedding industry. 10. Fashion must lead or be led “Nobody in their right minds would design a system like this,” said former CEO of Unilever, Paul Polman, of the fashion industry’s take, make, waste model. He described making fashion sustainable as “the biggest business opportunity of the century”, rounding off his keynote speech with a line that would be repeated by speakers on many panels to come: lead or be led. • This article was amended on 30 May 2024 to correct the name of the representative from the Cambodian workforce.

2023-11-07T05:00:02Z,Drinks firms face EU-wide complaint over plastic bottle recycling claims,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/07/drinks-firms-face-eu-wide-complaint-over-plastic-bottle-recycling-claims,"Big drinks companies are misleading customers with claims that their plastic water bottles are fully recycled or recyclable, according to consumer groups who have issued a formal complaint to the European Commission. The Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC) said claims that water bottles from brands owned by Coca-Cola, Danone and Nestlé are “100% recyclable” or “100% recycled” are misleading because recycling rates are far lower in practice and bottles contain items that cannot be made from recycled material. The consumer rights group, which represents national groups across Europe, also said green imagery on bottles gave the “false idea” of environmental neutrality. There is no guarantee that a plastic water bottle will be recycled, said Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC. “This greenwashing must stop.” Drink bottles are among the most common forms of plastic polluting European beaches. In a year, the average European drinks around 118 litres of bottled water, according to the BEUC, 97% of which is thought to come in bottles made from plastic. But the amount that gets made into new bottles depends only partly on factors that the company or the customer can control. Other factors include the systems used to collect, sort and recycle the bottles, as well as technical limits and rules around what materials can be used to package food and drink. The BEUC has lodged a complaint with the European Commission over the phrase “100% recyclable” because a consumer cannot assume their water bottle will be recycled. Across the EU, about half of PET bottles are recycled, according to estimates from Zero Waste Europe. The BEUC has also targeted the phrase “100% recycled” because bottle lids in the EU cannot be made of recycled materials. It also said that labels are rarely made from recycled material. Last week, a report from campaign groups ClientEarth, ECOS and Zero Waste Europe found rates of plastic bottle recycling were improving, but that a fully circular system does not exist. “The idea of used bottles simply becoming new bottles over and over again may be appealing to companies and consumers alike, but it does not reflect the outcome for PET-based bottles in Europe,” the authors wrote. The EU has cracked down on greenwashing as corporate sustainability claims have grown. In September, the European parliament and council agreed on new advertising rules banning generic sustainability claims like “climate neutral”, “natural” and “eco” unless backed up by proof of excellent environmental performance. There is a lot of concern about plastic pollution and a lot of confusion about recycling, said Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer with ClientEarth, which supported the BEUC challenge. “Consumers are just tired of greenwashing, generally, and really want information they can count on.” The BEUC has the power to issue external alerts – formal complaints about suspicious business practices – to the commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network. The commission cannot fine traders who are found to have breached advertising rules but national authorities from EU member states may choose to do so. Nestlé said: “We work hard to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use; to lead investments and support packaging circularity alongside partners, and to communicate clearly with consumers who want to make informed choices. Nestle has reduced its amount of virgin plastic packaging by 10.5% since 2018, and we are on track to get to one-third less virgin plastic by the end of 2025.” Coca-Cola said: “We care about the impact of every drink we sell and are committed to growing our business in the right way. We’re working to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use, and we’re investing to collect and recycle the equivalent of the packaging we use. We only communicate messages on our packaging that can be substantiated, with any relevant qualifications clearly displayed to enable consumers to make informed choices.” Danone said: “We strongly believe in the circularity of packaging – and will continue to invest and lead the campaign for better collection and recycling infrastructure alongside our partners. We have also made real progress on our journey to reducing single-use plastic and virgin plastic use in parallel (-10% in absolute since 2018).”",Recycling; Environment; Waste; Plastics; Coca-Cola; Business; Nestlé; Food & drink industry; European Commission; Europe; World news; Consumer affairs,Environment
2023-03-22T00:28:14Z,You’ve got to start somewhere: simple ways to make your business more sustainable,https://www.theguardian.com/griffith-mba-lead-a-better-world/2023/mar/22/youve-got-to-start-somewhere-simple-ways-to-make-your-business-more-sustainable,"For many businesses, the road to sustainability is paved with good intentions. After all, a sustainable business model can actually translate to long-term financial success for your business, even if you’re operating a small-to-medium enterprise. It’s no longer a case of “get woke, go broke”. These days, you could be doing your bottom line a disservice if you don’t take the leap. However, transitioning to a truly sustainable business model without affecting your product, culture or customer relations is a complex process that’s challenging in many ways. How do you put sustainability at the core of your business’s mission? The Guardian asked four current students and graduates of Griffith University’s MBA program – ranked the world’s most sustainable MBA – for guidance on rising to this vital challenge. Rachell Hansen, carbon neutral project lead More than a decade in the public service and not-for-profit sectors gave Rachell Hansen an appreciation of the complexity of the climate crisis and the myriad ways it affects our lives. The birth of her first child solidified her drive to embark upon a purpose-driven career that would make a difference in her community and to the future of our planet. At the moment, that’s helping the government organisation that she works for achieve carbon neutral status. Hansen believes there’s power in knowing where you’re at from a sustainability perspective before investing time and money into projects and initiatives that might not shift the dial in the ways that you’d hoped. She recommends engaging with carbon footprint measuring programs, which can help your business establish a view of emissions over time. “The proof is in the pudding,” she says. “It gives you indications of where your pain points are. “And when you start to know and understand the intricacies and the granularity of that information, you can really start to create a strategy and a carbon reduction management plan for your organisation. But more importantly, you can also even identify unique opportunities that maybe haven’t been explored before.” Ronan Clinton, senior sustainability program manager Ronan Clinton is working in a job that didn’t exist when he first became interested in sustainable business practices more than a decade ago. But the initiative taken by people like him to integrate sustainability into their work has resulted in these types of roles becoming commonplace inside the world’s biggest companies. Undertaking Griffith’s sustainability-focused MBA has only made Clinton more motivated to keep pushing the boundaries. Forging his own career path in sustainability has shown Clinton that many businesses fall down at the first hurdle: knowing where to start. “There’s a general consensus that climate change and social wellbeing and economic growth are all complex issues that don’t necessarily have one single solution or outcome,” he says. “You need to look at it holistically across … the pillars that sit within your organisation.” But don’t panic: the rapid evolution of sustainable business practices is such that an entire industry has sprung up around helping businesses get started, and Clinton encourages all business leaders to ask for help from outside sources. “Leadership talks around sustainability and the impact your organisation can have … [can] create a greater awareness,” he says. Clare Burns, corporate sustainability academic Clare Burns describes herself as an “accidental academic”. She completed an MBA through Griffith when she was ready to take the next step in her corporate consulting career. Inspired by the course’s content, Burns strayed from her corporate career to complete a PhD focused on corporate sustainability. She worked as a part of the academic team in Griffith’s Department of Business Strategy and Innovation – a role that allowed her to share and apply MBA principles in a bigger-picture way. There are few people better qualified to help businesses on their sustainability journeys. Burns says it’s rarely practical challenges that prevent businesses from meeting this moment. Rather, it’s a clash of mindsets that can really hinder progress on sustainability. How do you get everybody on the same page? Education is paramount, she says, to circumvent the short-termism of traditional financial models and stakeholder management, particularly where upper management is concerned. “Being open to learning from and working with a broader range of stakeholders will be helpful in terms of really meaningfully addressing corporate sustainability,” she says. “I want [directors] to have confidence that they’re doing the right thing and asking the right questions within the organisation to start making change.” Pamela Caspani, urban designer Sustainability is a cause close to the heart of urban designer Pamela Caspani. While she enjoyed the work she did for much of her career, she felt there was potential to make a bigger impact. The Griffith MBA opened up opportunities to pursue personal goals and remedy what she sees as a lack of women and creatives in leadership positions. “Urban designers and planners have always been at the forefront of [sustainability],” she says, noting that that doesn’t necessarily translate to C-suite representation. For that reason, Caspani believes seeking out expertise from all corners of your business – especially the “extremely knowledgeable” junior staff moving through the ranks – is key to building an authentically sustainable business. “I think the business leaders are the ones that really need to be influenced and if you get the opportunity to influence them or be one of them, that’s where you have more of an opportunity to make significant change,” she says. The lesson? Don’t be so quick to dismiss the people who bring non-traditional perspectives. Their passion could well be the missing piece in your sustainability puzzle. Make it matter.

2023-05-08T09:00:03Z,‘Lack of vision’: UK green energy projects in limbo as grid struggles to keep pace,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/08/uk-green-energy-projects-in-limbo-as-grid-struggles-to-keep-pace,"“If the government had a consistent well-thought-through vision, this would have been absolutely obvious,” says Harald Överholm. The chief executive of the Swedish solar firm Alight is one of many frustrated renewable energy developers hoping to build green energy projects to power Britain’s homes and businesses with affordable, clean electricity. The catch? These projects could be forced to wait more than a decade for a chance to connect to the UK’s electricity grid, as Britain suffers the longest backlog in Europe. Windfarms, solar arrays, and battery projects are stuck in gridlock for up to 15 years as the UK’s electricity grid struggles to keep pace with the appetite for more clean energy – including a car factory being forced to wait until 2037. The delays threaten to undermine decades of work to attract the investment needed to support the UK’s clean energy ambitions, and risks derailing Britain’s progress towards legally binding climate targets. So how did a country so eager to boost its renewable energy supply fail to foresee this bottleneck? Överholm blames the government for failing to anticipate the upgrades Britain’s electricity grid would require to support a deluge of green projects. “It’s sad when national governments lack that vision.” To date, his company has plans to build a 70MW ground-mounted solar farm, and smaller rooftop solar projects for industrial energy users. There are many opportunities in rooftop solar, he says, but he wouldn’t pursue these further until there is change. “We’re observing what’s going on. For now, it’s hopeless,” he says. Överholm has joined a growing chorus of renewable developers calling for urgent reforms to the queueing system for renewable energy projects while work is undertaken to modernise the grid, from its giant transmission cables to the sprawl of pylons and local distribution networks. David Kipling, the chief executive of On-Site Energy, which develops renewable energy projects for big companies, said demand on the grid was “growing exponentially” with each new corporate sustainability pledge. “The grid just isn’t ready for it. You could argue that it’s negligence,” he says. “[The government has] been speaking about climate action for over a decade now, so you would have to assume that they knew what would be required.” In the past, National Grid – the FTSE 100 company tasked with operating most of the UK’s electricity networks – needed to provide connection points for fewer, larger power plants. Today, a far larger number of small, renewable energy projects are mushrooming up across the UK to meet rising demand for electricity from homes and businesses. The momentum behind new renewable energy developments is expected to build as UK demand for electricity is forecast to rise by about 50% by 2035. Homes are expected to swap gas boilers for electric heat pumps, and combustion engine vehicles for electric cars. Each new renewable energy project requires a new connection point, which in turn require grid reinforcements and more powerful local substations. At the same time, giant offshore windfarms call for big infrastructure investments in transmission to transport electricity from miles off the north-east coast to densely populated areas in the south. The UK has the longest queue to connect to the electricity grid of any country in Europe. There are about 200 gigawatts worth of electricity projects waiting for a grid connection, according to research by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, or enough to power 150m UK homes. Many are speculative applications from projects that are unlikely to move ahead. But the “first come first served” rules of grid connection mean many viable projects that could move ahead at speed are stuck. Kipling says many of the projects he is developing for leading UK companies are caught in this backlog. One big car manufacturer hoping to cut emissions from its factory by connecting a 5MW solar array to its site has been told they would need to wait until 2031, and would need to pay a £9m connection fee. A second car manufacturer seeking a connection for 14MW of solar capacity would need to wait until 2037. “The vast majority of our customers are watching as their sustainability plans are effectively put on hold,” Kipling says. It’s also a drag on economic growth as the UK struggles to tackle its productivity crisis. Another customer, a bakery employing 800 people, has been told it will need to wait until 2027 to connect a 1.5MW solar project to its site. This saddles the company with higher energy costs for the next four years on top of the £2m cost to connect. The energy industry is baying for reform. Earlier this week, MPs on the Commons environmental audit committee opened an inquiry into how to ease the backlog of solar projects waiting to connect to the grid that “could seriously jeopardise net zero Britain”. Energy Networks Association (ENA), which represents grid operators, said there was “a real sense of urgency to this challenge. The industry has received 164GW of new connection requests in the year to October 2022 alone. That’s around three times the capacity of our grid today.” The ENA’s suggestion is to adopt a “first ready, first connected” model that would prioritise projects with planning permission and financing in place over projects still in development. Kipling argues that projects that serve big employers – such as manufacturers – should also be given priority. Regardless of how the queue is reformed Överholm says National Grid will require more people and resources to make sense of the backlog. National Grid said it agreed that “significant reform is needed across policy, regulation, and the energy industry to speed up the connections process across all networks. “Collaboration between Ofgem, government and the industry is critical to drive the necessary reform at the pace needed to deliver net zero.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said ministers and officials “recognise the challenge of connection delays, and we want to go further and faster”. It has promised an action for grid connections this summer. It can’t come soon enough for renewable energy developers. “No one can hold a project for even two or three years – let alone a decade,” Kipling says.",National Grid; Business; Energy industry; Utilities; Energy; Renewable energy,Business
2023-10-10T09:00:36Z,"Corporations are paying for worker abuse audits that are ‘designed to fail’, say insiders",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/10/corporate-auditing-foreign-workers-abuse-claims,"Before he began the interviews, Ahmed swept the room for cameras and recording devices. He then invited the workers in, one by one, spending about 10 minutes talking with each. They were employed at a factory in the Middle East that supplied goods for a major American company – and it was Ahmed’s job, as an outside auditor, to uncover any labor abuses. Often, before he could even ask a question, the staff members hastened to assure him that they were happy with their jobs. Their eagerness made him suspicious. As Ahmed coaxed answers out of one worker, a security guard at the factory, a different picture emerged. He said he had worked 26 days straight, with long hours, no days off and no overtime pay. He was scared – if anyone found out he was talking honestly, he might lose his job. When Ahmed scrutinized the attendance and pay records the company provided him, he found they had been falsified, in part because security footage showed the man was truly enduring a grueling schedule. The names of all the workers were missing from attendance records, making it impossible to decipher whether hours and wages were fair. Ahmed was upset but not surprised. He’s audited this same company more than 50 times across the region, and estimates that in at least 10 cases he found some form of labor abuse. They included signs of forced labor, such as confiscated passports so workers weren’t able to leave the country. He was rarely able to take action. In this instance, he informed a manager at the factory that it had failed to comply with basic labor standards. In response, the manager told him to change the finding. The audit needed to find that the company was free of labor abuses, he said to Ahmed, otherwise it might lose business. “I was very disappointed,” Ahmed says, adding that the factory did not invite him back for a follow-up assessment and that he suspects it hired a different, more compliant auditor. US companies “use audits to pretend that they are protecting people but actually they’re just doing business and trying to minimize cost as much as they can”, according to Ahmed. American and European firms with overseas operations have turned to auditing firms, like the one Ahmed works for, to investigate conditions at their factories and produce an assessment sometimes known as a social audit. But insiders and observers say auditing companies are failing at their job, and are part of a broader system focused less on safeguarding workers than protecting companies – and their bottom lines – from costly public relations scandals. Labor abuses persist in the global operations of many big companies, as an investigation published today by the Guardian US, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, NBC News and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism has revealed. In interviews with the reporting partnership, nearly 100 workers describe an array of unfair and repressive labor practices within the Persian Gulf footprints of Amazon, McDonald’s, Chuck E Cheese and the InterContinental Hotels Group. Ahmed and another auditor interviewed for this story did not observe the abuses alleged by these 100 workers. In their work as auditors, however, they have witnessed what they say are similar human rights violations by other US companies and their suppliers. And they say they have little power to stop them. “Since 2016 I’ve been scrutinizing the audit industry, and I’ve read about 80 social audit reports and I’ve not seen one that inspires confidence,” says Aruna Kashyap, associate director on corporate accountability at Human Rights Watch. “If I was working for a company and designing its due diligence I would be extremely worried if my company was relying on these types of audits as a monitoring tool.” The Guardian is using pseudonyms for the auditors interviewed in this story, and is not naming their employers or clients, to protect them from professional consequences. We confirmed their identities in a professional auditing registry and validated details they shared about the auditing industry with experts. While Ahmed says not all companies are as careless as the goods company – a handful take audits more seriously – he’s uncovered poor conditions at a variety of American companies’ footprints in the region. But there’s not much he can do about it. “If I raise a forced labor case in a factory in the Middle East that’s working for American clients, I will find a lot of [pushback] from the client about this case, trying to minimize the severity of the finding,” says Ahmed, adding that while there are a small number of American companies that seem to respect audits, most “try to put the auditor under pressure to not raise such cases”. Corporate efforts to combat forced labor, like auditing, “are failing because they are designed to fail”, says Genevieve LeBaron, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada and the author of Combatting Modern Slavery: Why Labour Governance Is Failing and What We Can Do About It. Labor abuses aren’t just predictable, they’re lucrative, she says. “Corporations amass huge profit from depending on those business models in their supply chains.” In response to the labor practices documented by the reporting partnership, a representative from McDonald’s said the workers’ accounts are “extremely troubling” and Amazon said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” workers weren’t treated better. The InterContinental Hotels Group and the Chuck E Cheese brand’s parent, CEC Entertainment, both say they take fair treatment of workers seriously. An opaque industry provides cover for corporations The auditing industry emerged in the 1990s after a series of damaging revelations about American firms using sweatshop labor abroad. By 2020, it had reached an $80bn valuation. Dozens of firms perform hundreds of thousands of audits each year of labor, environmental and safety practices for many Fortune 500 companies and a host of smaller corporations. But the industry has come under fire in recent years. “A vast majority of the social audit industry is so opaque that it doesn’t build trust with workers and their representatives and the lack of transparency is also fertile ground for the worst malpractices to thrive unchecked,” says Kashyap. After interviewing 20 former and current auditors and dozens of industry experts, Kashyap concluded that auditing companies often don’t operate independently or transparently, acting more frequently as a way for brands to burnish their image than to keep workers safe. Kashyap found that pressures to save money – many international brands require suppliers to hire and pay for audits themselves – contributed to rushed assessments. Interviews with workers usually occur at their workplace, sometimes within earshot of management, she found. Even if audits were more diligent, Kashyap says, there is little legal requirement for companies to act on their findings. “It’s a report that’s dropped into a corporate blackhole and no one knows what’s in it or how these reports improve workers’ lives,” she says. A 2021 analysis of more than 40,000 social audit reports across multiple countries by Sarosh Kuruvilla, a professor at Cornell University, found that almost a third of audits were falsified, with data about working hours and pay either partly or entirely falsified. Kuruvilla’s research even showed the rise of a parallel cottage industry that advises factories on gaming the audit system. Coaching companies in China guaranteed a “100% pass” if suppliers used their services, he found. They offered workers training on how to reply to auditors, and advised keeping two sets of record books, one with actual information about things like overtime and wages, and another with false data purged of records of underage workers or low wages. The real books, the consultants advised, should be sealed in boxes in workplace locations where auditors wouldn’t go. The consultancies also boast about software that falsifies data – with one advertising that “one month’s audit data of a factory that has more than one thousand people can be generated in just thirty minutes”. “It is surprising that the audit consulting industry is so open about offering these services,” Kuruvilla writes. “It seems impossible that global buyers that use local auditors would not also be aware of these services and the sophistication these [consultants] have when it comes to falsifying audit information and managing the audit process.” Some auditors themselves feel trapped in an ineffective system. “Ultimately everybody wants money in the industry; nobody is working for the sake of betterment of workers – that is all bullshit. Everybody is here to make money,” says Arjun, an auditor who has worked in India for 15 years assessing companies exporting goods to the United States and Europe. Auditors like himself are often overworked and underpaid, he says, and unable to do much when they suspect working conditions aren’t what they seem. Arjun says US firms are profiting from an unreliable audit system and the mistreatment of workers within their supply chains. “US buyers focus more on pricing and money,” he says. “They are never really bothered about what is going on in the industry; they just want a showcase report to be published on their website. They are not really interested in resolving the problems.” Recent research by Human Rights Watch has criticized two of the most well-known audit companies, Amfori and Sedex, for their lack of transparency, including a failure to make public the results, company names, locations or dates of audits. A Sedex spokesperson did not provide data on the overall number of problems discovered by its auditors at overseas factories, though they pointed to case studies on the company’s website. And they said that more than 1,500 worksites in the US resolved more than 8,500 issues identified in its audits. The Sedex spokesperson said that while the company makes recommendations to the firms it audits, it does not “set requirements or have regulatory powers”. “While we encourage buyer members to follow best practice and take effective action, we do not assess members on whether they do this or have visibility of their due diligence activities outside of our solutions,” the spokesperson said. Amfori did not respond to requests for comment. Toothless US regulations The weaknesses of the auditing industry are important because legal protections for many overseas workers are scant, experts say. While there is limited regulation of what US companies make abroad if those products are also sold within the US, there is even less recourse for products that are manufactured abroad and sold abroad. An American company could potentially be criminally liable for trafficking overseas under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its ensuing reauthorizations, but human rights advocates have struggled to use it to protect workers or punish companies. One of the key laws aimed at addressing abuses in American companies’ overseas operations is California’s 2010 Transparency in Supply Chains Act. Any retailer or manufacturer that does business in California, and has worldwide gross receipts of over $100m, is subject to it. Similar laws have been passed in the United Kingdom, Australia, France and other countries around the world. The act mandates that companies must publicly outline their efforts to stop trafficking, including whether they are performing audits of their suppliers. Yet detractors have noted that the law was watered down, after it faced stiff opposition from industry groups when it was being crafted. It focuses less on stopping companies from using forced labor than on publicly declaring their efforts to do so. The law does not criminalize or create civil liability for companies that use forced labor. “The law only requires that covered businesses make the required disclosures – even if they do little or nothing at all to safeguard their supply chains,” a guidance from California’s attorney general’s office, helmed by Kamala Harris at the time, stated. Other attempts to regulate the overseas operations of US companies have too many loopholes and weaknesses, many labor trafficking experts say. “It is scandalous how much power has been afforded to multinational corporations, American brands, to dictate the terms of their own complicity because they have lawyers to say they checked all the boxes and are human trafficking compliant,” says Elena Shih, an assistant professor at Brown University and the author of Manufacturing Freedom: Sex Work, Anti-Trafficking Rehab, and the Racial Wages of Rescue. A new European Union proposal appears to have more teeth. The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive requires companies to identify risks of human rights abuses in their supply chains – including large American companies that do business in Europe. Unlike most of its predecessors, however, the directive subjects companies found in violation to sanctions such as fines. And crucially, victims of labor abuses can seek compensation. Labor experts say the success of this directive will hinge on its being paired with robust enforcement mechanisms, as well as stronger protections for unions, as opposed to practices like auditing. For Arjun and Ahmed, continuing to do this work takes a mental and physical toll they’re not sure they can endure permanently. Arjun struggles, however, to know what he’d do otherwise. Most of his job experience is in auditing. Ahmed says he feels a responsibility to document the reality of conditions in the factories he audits, even in the face of companies that are indifferent to the results. “It’s very stressful – I try to push as much as I can to figure out the welfare of the people during the audit time,” says Ahmed. “I’m trying to use the limited tools I have to improve people’s lives.”",Amazon; McDonald's; InterContinental Hotels; Middle East and north Africa; E-commerce; Hospitality industry; Food & drink industry; Human rights; Law; Business; World news; US news; Human trafficking,Technology
2022-12-29T12:00:19Z,Why environmental disaster victims are looking to European courts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/29/why-environmental-disaster-victims-are-looking-to-european-courts,"Between 2004 and 2007, the villages of Oruma, Goi and Ikot Ada Udo in Nigeria were polluted with oil from infrastructure built by Royal Dutch Shell. More than 15 years later, in late December, the company finally agreed to pay four farmers and their communities €15m in compensation and install a leak detection system after a court in the Netherlands ruled that Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was liable and the parent company had a duty of care. The legal battle has been so long that all the original claimants have died and Shell admits no liability under the settlement. But Milieudefensie, the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth that fought the case, says it shows “large-scale polluters all over the world that they can no longer get away with destructive practices”. Many big European companies operate abroad and until recently it was difficult to hold them to account for environmental damage they may have caused. But victims are finding European courts increasingly open to considering their cases – and finding in their favour. In November, a Dutch court ruled that it had the authority to hear a claim for compensation brought against the Oslo-based aluminium producer Norsk Hydro and its subsidiaries over pollution in northern Brazil. It was a welcome decision for the thousands of Indigenous people and descendants of slaves who are suing the company for harming their local environment and public health, although Norsk Hydro “strongly denies” their allegations. The Norsk Hydro decision was the third in a string of jurisdictional successes last year led by the law firm Pogust Goodhead. Communities lost to damage caused by salt mines in northern Brazil also secured the right to sue the petrochemical company Braskem in the Netherlands, while victims of the Mariana dam disaster began making their claim against mining giant BHP in December after the UK’s court of appeal gave them permission to pursue class action. These followed landmark UK court rulings that Vedanta Resources could be sued for the activities of its subsidiary in Zambia and that Shell might owe a duty of care to Nigerian citizens for alleged environmental damage and human rights abuses by its Nigerian subsidiary. Vedanta has since settled with the local community, but the other companies targeted in these lawsuits stress that the courts have not yet judged the cases on their merits. Nonetheless, Tom Goodhead, the global managing partner of Pogust Goodhead, says European courts are increasingly becoming the gatekeepers of environmental damage caused by large corporations. “It’s one of the fastest developing areas of law. As well as the UK, there have been cases in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Sweden. There’s quite a considerable movement to try to hold companies accountable in the courts of their domicile.” The most promising new piece of legislation to do this is the French duty of vigilance law, which requires all large businesses headquartered in France and international corporations with a large presence there to set out clear measures to prevent human rights violations and environmental damage. The first case to test the law was filed against the French energy company TotalEnergies in 2019 over its huge oil project in Uganda and Tanzania. French and Ugandan NGOs claim the company’s environmental oversight plan for the controversial East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline did not comply with the law. After a court hearing in December, they are now waiting for a ruling. TotalEnergies deems its vigilance plan to be “effectively in place” and says it has made sure its Ugandan affiliate has implemented the action plans necessary to respect the rights of local communities. “The law on duty of vigilance is very clear that it covers violations or risk abroad, so there shouldn’t be a challenge about that,” says Juliette Renaud, a senior corporate accountability campaigner with Amis de la Terre, the French arm of Friends of the Earth and one of the NGOs involved. “But still we don’t know how the judge will interpret the law.” Even if the NGOs succeed in getting a court order against TotalEnergies, they anticipate difficulties in getting it implemented in foreign territory. A similar law comes into force in Germany in January, although lawyers say it is considerably weaker. The EU, too, is trying to pass a corporate sustainability due diligence directive, but member states have been accused of trying to water it down. As a result, many lawsuits filed in Europe rely on more established legislation. Amis de la Terre and the French anti-corruption NGO Sherpa, supported by the Environmental Investigation Agency, recently began legal action against Perenco for pollution allegedly linked to the group’s oil activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The lawsuit, which follows years of investigation by the NGOs with Congolese civil society and a successful “pre-trial” action aimed at lifting the veil on the company’s operations, is the first aimed at trying to prove the civil liability of a French company for environmental damage abroad. Rather than money, campaigners want the company to repair the damage and stop it from happening again. Perenco did not respond to a request for comment. “It was a battle – and will be a battle in the court – to show how it is involved in activities in the DRC that led to these environmental damages,” says Renaud. “Lawyers bringing the case do not only have to show that there is pollution and that it is linked to oil activities, but also why the French company is responsible and liable for them.” European courts are also increasingly being asked to decide whether companies headquartered there are responsible for the effects of their carbon emissions abroad. The Peruvian farmer Saúl Luciano Lliuya’s bid for compensation from RWE in Germany, in particular, is being carefully watched as it could set a precedent for future climate litigation. And corporations are starting to be held to account for the impacts of their supply chains at home and abroad. Goodhead says there is growing legal awareness among the public. “A lot of civil society organisations are informing communities of their rights to seek redress out of the country. You don’t just have to accept what a particular company is giving you or not giving you in the country in which you live.” European NGOs being the public face of a lawsuit can sometimes shield people on the ground from negative repercussions. No Congolese organisation is formally named in the Perenco lawsuit, for example. But Renaud says it is important that European organisations and lawyers work closely with the affected communities or local civil society organisations on these kinds of claims. “We need the legitimacy to act. Our partners on the ground are the ones collecting the evidence, and have daily links with the affected communities that can tell us how things evolve on the ground.” There is also a risk that companies could respond to the risk of litigation by sheltering behind sophisticated corporate structures or subsidiaries. Soon after a Dutch court ordered Shell to cut its global emissions, the energy company moved its headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK. “There is that concern,” says Goodhead. “But it’s a tradeoff, isn’t it? Because companies enjoy the security of the Dutch legal system or the English legal system, if they want to enforce their rights.” In an increasingly globalised world, companies are finding they cannot always hide the activities of their subsidiaries behind a corporate veil. “Companies will still try to – and, of course, there will be scenarios where they may be able to – get away with it, but it’s becoming more difficult,” says Goodhead.",Environmental activism; Pollution; Environment; World news; Law; European Union; Europe; Shell; Netherlands; Oil; Energy; Fossil fuels; Oil and gas companies; Oil,Environment
2022-02-06T23:01:37Z,"World’s biggest firms failing over net-zero claims, research suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/06/amazon-ikea-nestle-biggest-carbon-net-zero-claims,"Some of the world’s biggest businesses are failing to live up toclaims they will hit net-zero emissions targets, according to research that suggests they will cut their carbon emissions by only 40% rather than the 100% cuts claimed. Household names such as Amazon, Ikea, Nestlé and Unilever are among the companies named as showing little substance to their claims that they will cut emissions drastically. Thomas Day of NewClimate Institute, who compiled the report, said that taken in aggregate, the efforts of the 25 companies studied would make little impact. “It is not clear these reductions take us beyond business as usual,” he said. “We were very disappointed and surprised at how much room for improvement there was [among the companies studied]. Companies need to be much more transparent about these goals.” Near-term targets were of particular concern, he added. The report showed that the companies surveyed would only cut their emissions by about 23% on average by 2030, falling far short of the figure of nearly halving in the next decade that scientists say is needed to limit global heating to 1.5C. “It’s short-term action that’s the most important thing, in the climate crisis,” he said. Many are relying on carbon offsetting for a large portion of their projected cuts. Carbon offsetting is the controversial practice of paying for projects that reduce carbon dioxide – usually by maintaining forests or growing new trees – to compensate for greenhouse gases emitted elsewhere. Many of the companies studied have made much of their public claims to environmental sustainability. “Some companies I had expected more from, given their very positive perception, such as Ikea, Unilever and Nestlé,” said Day. The Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor, by NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch, scored companies on criteria including their targets, how much offsetting they planned to use and the reliability of those offsets, as well as progress on reducing their own emissions, and how transparent they were in their target-setting and corporate reporting. None of the 25 companies rated were judged to achieve a high standard according to these benchmarks. Among those showing “low integrity” were Amazon and Ikea, while the 11 companies that ranked worst in the study, showing “very low integrity”, included E.ON and Nestlé. The over-use of offsetting was one of the main reasons most companies were marked down, said Day. Offsetting is increasingly popular among companies seeking to burnish their green credentials, and is set to become even more so through a new standards body. Critics say that many offsetting projects have been found to be of doubtful value, and some have been fraudulent. Forestry also makes a poor substitute for immediate emissions cuts as carbon emitted into the atmosphere today begins to heat the atmosphere now and continues to do so for at least a century, while trees take decades to grow and store carbon absorbed from the air. Proponents counter that with deforestation rampant across the world, preserving existing forests is one of the most important ways of tackling the climate crisis. Day said using offsetting tended to obscure whether companies were making genuine progress on cutting their own emissions, or hiding behind offsets to achieve a notional net zero. “It’s better practice not to offset – it’s more transparent and constructive,” he said. “Companies should not be claiming they are net zero by 2030 unless they are reducing their emissions by 90% by then.” He was also concerned at the apparent poor quality of some of the offsetting projects that companies were using. “If they insist on offsetting, at least it should be with carbon credits that have more integrity,” he said. An Amazon spokesperson said the company had a goal of reaching net-zero carbon by 2040: “We set these ambitious targets because we know that climate change is a serious problem, and action is needed now more than ever. Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our original target.” An E.ON spokesperson said: “In our view, [the report] is not only methodologically incorrect, but its results are misleading. E.ON’s carbon footprint is based on the principles of the globally applicable greenhouse gas accounting standard. E.ON was again included in the A List by CDP [the Carbon Disclosure Project] for its climate reporting in 2021.” A spokesperson for Ikea said: “While Ikea has achieved much already, such as breaking the link between decreasing our absolute emissions while increasing business growth, we have plans in place to address our remaining complex challenges, such as the climate footprint of the materials used in the Ikea range.” Benjamin Ware, the global head of climate delivery and sustainable sourcing at Nestlé, said: “We welcome scrutiny of our actions and commitments on climate change. However, the report lacks understanding of our approach and contains significant inaccuracies. [Our] climate roadmap has been validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative [a corporate sustainability body]. The work that went into it is rigorous and extensive.” A spokesperson for Unilever said: “While we share different perspectives on some elements of this report, we welcome external analysis of our progress and have begun a productive dialogue with the NewClimate Institute to see how we can meaningfully evolve our approach.”",Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Deforestation; Carbon offsetting; Amazon,Environment
2021-10-14T12:00:50Z,Corporations are pledging to be ‘water positive’. What does that mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/14/water-positive-pledge-corporations,"One of PepsiCo’s largest food manufacturing plants sits in the perennially water-stressed Valley of Mexico watershed, which provides water to 21 million people in Mexico City and its surrounding suburbs. The aquifer running below the city is so drastically depleted that the metropolis is sinking as the water table falls, and the pipes that bring water in from far-off rivers and lakes are in disrepair. “The city cannot provide the water that we need, so we truck it in,” said Roberta Barbieri, vice-president for global sustainability at PepsiCo. It’s an expensive solution to an intractable problem – the water shortage is not sustainable from either a human or business standpoint. So PepsiCo has promised to decrease its water consumption in the region and replenish what it uses. By treating wastewater on site, for example, the factory can reuse 80% of the water it draws from the tap or the truck. “We’re pushing to get that close to 100%,” Barbieri said. The efforts are part of the company’s “water positive” commitment to put more water into areas where they operate than they take out. The last year has seen a flurry of such promises from large corporations. Microsoft, Facebook and Google have all pledged to replenish more water than they use in their direct operations by 2030. BP has set a target year for 2035, and Gap for 2050. These pledges are coming at a time of huge pressure on global water resources, exacerbated by the climate crisis. More than 1.7 billion people live in river basins that are being depleted by overuse, and the UN predicts a 40% shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030. The impacts of the water crisis on business are increasingly clear – threatening semiconductor production in Taiwan, scuttling plans for a brewery in Mexico and sending investors competing for water rights in the Colorado River basin. “Sustainable water supplies are not a given any more,” said Kirsten James, director of water for the corporate sustainability non-profit Ceres. Water-positive pledges aim to help companies align with UN goals for people to have adequate access to clean water while also securing their own water supply. It’s a question of reputation, too, said Colin Strong, manager of corporate water stewardship at the World Resource Institute. Businesses working in areas of water scarcity don’t want to be viewed as making the problem worse. But while experts say it’s encouraging to see corporations making commitments on water, some are concerned that these voluntary pledges can lack precise definitions and accountability mechanisms. What does ‘water positive’ mean? There is no formal definition for “water positive”, said Strong, and companies’ plans differ in detail and scope. What differentiates water positive from just saving water is the focus on areas where water security is a problem and overcompensating for consumption in those places. “Water security is a hyperlocal issue,” said Simon Fischweicher, head of North American corporations and supply chains for the environmental nonprofit CDP. Once companies have identified areas where water scarcity is an issue, they then look for ways to cut back on water and make up for what they are using. “The goal is not to use the minimum amount of water, it is to minimize the negative impacts associated with the use of water, and those impacts can vary greatly,” Strong said. PepsiCo’s snack factory in Mexico City is one of 99 manufacturing facilities the company owns in high water risk areas. The company has a range of strategies that it says will reverse its impact on the strapped watershed. For instance, after water is run through the lines and tanks to switch from Pepsi to Mountain Dew at one Mexico City bottler, it is treated to drinking-safe standards, then trucked nine miles to the company’s factory in the Vallejo Industrial Zone, where it’s used to wash potatoes to make Sabritas chips. The project has cut freshwater demand at the Sabritas plant in half, according to PepsiCo. The company also finances environmental restoration work in other parts of the watershed, where the Nature Conservancy is planting native coniferous trees to protect waterways. “We’re not making new water – because nobody can do that – but what we can do is go upstream and partner with local NGOs … to restore the natural system that’s been degraded, largely by human influence,” said Barbieri. Microsoft, Google and Facebook have or are building wastewater treatment plants at some of their offices to recycle water for flushing toilets and watering plants. Most of the tech companies’ water use, however, goes to cooling equipment in their data centers, some of which are located in drought-prone regions of the American west and south-west. Google started using reclaimed wastewater nearly a decade ago at its data center in Douglas county, Georgia. Microsoft is now doing the same in Washington state, Amsterdam and Dublin. It is also testing waterless cooling systems, such as dunking computer servers into fluid that boils off the heat they generate, or sinking data centers into the ocean, to release heat into the seawater. Like PepsiCo, these companies fund the work of non-profits and local utilities to improve the health and resilience of local watersheds. Projects include removing water-hogging invasive plant species, buying up farmland to assume and retire its water rights, capturing stormwater to help replenish depleted underground aquifers and reforesting areas destroyed by wildfires. Facebook has invested in 14 restoration projects in high water stress areas where it has data centers, which it estimates will replenish 3.2bn liters of water (in 2020, it sent 3bn liters to its data centers). Last year the company said it restored about 2.3bn liters. To ensure the math checks out on any given pledge and the benefits are sustained, publicly disclosed monitoring and interim milestones are critical, James said: “We can’t have a commitment way out in 2050 and then just cross our fingers that it’s going to be met.” BP’s pledge requires the company to reach 20% of the way towards water positive in 2025. PepsiCo, Microsoft and Gap track yearly progress by responding to CDP’s standardized water security survey as well as including water in annual sustainability reports. Hoping for a waterfall effect To truly keep from draining the planet’s limited supply of fresh water, companies need to look beyond their own operations, to their supply chains, James said. That’s particularly important for industries that are historically large polluters and rely heavily on natural resources, such as agriculture, food and beverage, fashion, semiconductors and mining. “For most companies the majority of their impact is in their supply chain,” said Strong. Some companies do have broader plans. PepsiCo includes company-owned as well as third party owned manufacturing plants in its 2030 water positive goal, and says it has increased water-use efficiency by 14% across its agricultural supply chain in high water risk areas. Corporate commitments to being water positive “are good and important on paper”, said Michael Kiparsky, director of the Wheeler Water Institute at University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, but there’s much more companies can be doing. “If these corporations are really, really serious about water, then they would throw their clout behind supporting attempts to improve governance of water,” Kiparsky said. That might be policies around water rights, guaranteeing safe drinking water or improving infrastructure such as pipes and treatment plants. “I do not think that these companies are engaging in greenwashing,” Kiparsky said, “but there is so much more they could do for water if they are really serious about it.”",Environment; Business; Water; Pepsico; Food & drink industry; Technology sector; Facebook; Microsoft; Climate crisis; Drought,Environment
2021-11-27T13:00:04Z,‘It’s critical’: can Microsoft make good on its climate ambitions?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/27/its-critical-can-microsoft-make-good-on-its-climate-ambitions,"When the UN’s landmark climate report was released in 2018, calling for urgent and unprecedented changes, Microsoft executives were told to “commit it to memory”, said Elizabeth Willmott, who leads the company’s carbon program. “And so we did.” The report warned the world must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 in order to avert catastrophic climate change. To achieve this, not only must the emissions released by countries and companies be dramatically curtailed, but billions of tons of carbon dioxide must be sucked out of the atmosphere. These findings directly informed Microsoft’s climate policy, said Willmott. In January 2020, the company announced that it would be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 it would have removed from the atmosphere all the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975. By making this pledge, the company joined a small group of businesses, including Ikea and the software company Intuit, committed to going further than net-zero. Microsoft is often ranked as a leading business on climate action. Its policies – from making it easier for people to repair their devices to launching software to help companies measure and manage carbon emissions – have been praised for going beyond the company’s own operations to the footprint of its suppliers and customers. “Being a large, well-known brand, and putting a stake in the ground, talking publicly for years about the importance of climate change, is really critical,” said Simon Fischweicher, head of corporations and supply chains for the environmental non-profit CDP North America. However, Microsoft has also been criticized for actions that appear to contradict its bold rhetoric on climate, including membership of trade associations that lobby against climate legislation, contracts with oil and gas firms and donations to politicians who obstruct climate policy. These connections make it “complicit” in efforts to push against climate action, said Bill Weihl, a former sustainability executive at Google and Facebook and the founder of the advocacy group ClimateVoice. Scaling up goals Microsoft has been operating as a carbon-neutral company for nearly a decade, a feat it has achieved through buying carbon offsets as well as securing renewable power directly from clean energy companies and installing onsite renewable energy, such as solar panels at its offices. Since 2012, Microsoft has also implemented an internal carbon fee, currently set at $15 a metric ton, making business units pay for emissions related to their operations and electricity, as well as from business air travel. “The money gets collected and spent,” said Willmott, whose carbon management team uses the money to fund initiatives such as buying clean energy and carbon offsets. “I have to pinch myself regularly because that was something we dreamed about and didn’t think was actually going to happen.” It’s a “powerful mechanism”, says Fischweicher, to push a company to think more deeply about the impact of its activities: “To pay a fee, you start to think about: ‘What can I do to reduce that so I have more money in my budget?’” But the company has recognized that much more is required to tackle the climate crisis and the plan to go carbon negative was a big step up in ambitions. Microsoft has laid out milestones for reaching the target. By 2025, it aims to reduce the emissions from its direct operations to “near zero” through gains in energy efficiency and using 100% renewable energy. By 2030, it has committed to reducing by at least 50% its direct emissions and those from its supply chain. The company’s supply chain – more than 58,000 suppliers provide everything from office furniture to the metals and plastics used in its products – makes up the bulk of its emissions. Last year, the company implemented a carbon reporting requirement for suppliers and it extended the internal carbon fee to cover supply chain emissions. But in order to remove more emissions than it produces, the company will rely heavily on carbon removal projects. These include nature-based initiatives such as funding reforestation projects, but the company is also pinning its hopes on technology. Microsoft is investing $1bn to support emerging technology that can reduce, capture and remove carbon from the air. As part of this, the company has invested in and purchased carbon removal from Climeworks, which operates the world’s largest direct air capture plant, in Iceland, removing CO2 from the air and trapping it in rock underground. In 2020, Microsoft removed 1.3m metric tons of carbon through a range of initiatives from nature based programs to carbon capture technology. However, these projects face obstacles. Relying on forests and soil to trap endless amounts of carbon is increasingly difficult in the face of worsening wildfires, pests and changes in land use. And carbon removal technology is not anywhere near the scale needed. There are 19 direct air capture (DAC) plants in operation globally, capturing just over 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. The International Energy Agency has estimated that reaching net zero by 2050 would require the world to scale up DAC to capture more than 85m tons each year by 2030 and around 980m tons a year by 2050. It’s a challenge that Microsoft is grappling with. The number and type of projects currently available is “far short of what we need”, said Willmott. By 2030, the company estimates, it will need to remove 5m to 6m tons of carbon. This means the technology will need to be considerably scaled up to meet Microsoft’s demands alone, she said, “and that’s to say nothing of the fact that there’s a real spike in corporate demand”. It’s not just the amount of viable carbon capture projects that’s lacking, Willmot said; there’s also a quality issue. The industry doesn’t fully distinguish between avoided emissions and those that are actually removed from the atmosphere, she said. More robust quality standards would go a long way to making sure “it’s not quite a wild, wild west that it is today”, Willmot said. “[Microsoft is] opening up new conversations about historical emissions without having all the answers,” said Aoife Brophy, departmental research lecturer in innovation and enterprise at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School. “Leaders on climate need to acknowledge the complexity of the problem and be transparent about the fact that there are not always clear solutions.” Microsoft’s focus on historical emissions could also help spur a deeper conversation, she said, about “responsibility for the past, and may lead to much better ways to think about issues like climate justice that have not yet been adequately addressed by companies”. A wider influence The modern corporate sustainability movement requires companies to also consider their impacts on customers, peers and society more broadly. This shift in perspective, said Fischweicher, “is a really critical turning-point moment … because what you’re also talking about is shifting your business model overall”. To Microsoft’s critics, this means the company should reconsider its work with oil companies. The same week that Microsoft made its carbon-negative announcement, it sponsored an oil conference in Saudi Arabia. A 2020 Greenpeace report digging into tech companies’ work with the oil and gas industry – such as providing software to support fossil fuel extraction – found that its contract with ExxonMobil “could lead to emissions greater than 20% of Microsoft’s annual carbon footprint”. The company also spent about $200,000 during the 2020 US election cycle supporting politicians with a history of climate denial. And this October, Microsoft – along with other corporations – was criticized by the watchdog group Accountable.US for its membership of trade organizations with a history of fighting climate crisis legislation, including the Business Roundtable and the US Chamber of Commerce. Most recently, these groups have lobbied against climate legislation included under Joe Biden’s reconciliation bill. “I feel really strongly that we need to be able to work with everyone to make this transition to a low-carbon economy in the future,” said Willmott, responding to these criticisms. “I really think it’s important not to villainize any particular sector, or villainize any particular entities, but rather really work hard from within to shape the journey.” Weihl, whose organization ClimateVoice is calling on Microsoft and others to devote one-fifth of their lobbying dollars to climate policy in 2021, remains skeptical. “Companies are putting their narrow self-interest ahead of actually addressing the climate crisis at scale,” he said. “Silence and unwillingness to publicly distance themselves [from these groups] is not neutrality, it’s complicity.” Whether it’s Microsoft’s customers and affiliations or the type of work it does, experts agree the company’s size and political heft as well as its position within trade groups give it immense power – and it’s all about how the company chooses to use it. “Tech companies shape how we engage with the world, and the information we see on a daily basis,” said Brophy. “We need to think of impact beyond measuring emissions and consider ways in which technology can be used to create change across different systems.” Microsoft’s climate commitments are laudable, she said, but ultimately success will require collective action. “The biggest challenge is that Microsoft’s goals cannot be achieved by Microsoft alone,” said Brophy. “But that’s exactly what we need to see companies across industries doing more of: coming out and being bold, recognizing that they need to be systems leaders.”",Environment; Business; Technology sector; Microsoft; Computing; Technology; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Carbon offsetting,Environment
2021-11-04T10:00:32Z,The dark secrets behind big oil’s climate pledges ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/dark-secrets-big-oil-climate-pledges-greenwashing,"JPMorgan Chase won glowing headlines last year when the global investment bank unveiled a commitment to counter the climate crisis. The press amplified JPMorgan’s message – sometimes in JPMorgan’s own words. Fortune published a commentary article trumpeting the bank’s plans to “tackle climate change”. Six paragraphs into the piece, the writers noted they worked for the investment firm. (They were actually its top executives.) The bank waited months to detail its plans. In May, it finally outlined its goals: JPMorgan would not pressure oil companies to lower their emissions. Instead, the firm would encourage them to become more efficient. They would focus on their “carbon intensity”. That metric has become a favorite of banks, oil companies and other big businesses. They’ve balked at requirements to cut overall climate pollution. But “carbon intensity” pledges have given companies a framework to keep investing in dirty fuels, while also expanding into pollution-capturing technology and cleaner energy. “They love the metric,” said Jeanne Martin, senior manager of banking standards at ShareAction, a non-profit focused on responsible investment. “They have committed to reducing intensity and financing to the oil and gas sector. But that doesn’t ultimately mean they will reduce oil and gas activities. It may actually increase at a faster rate.” Such “greenwashing”, experts say, allows companies to downplay the scale of the climate crisis – and continue contributing to the problem. “It’s the next five or 10 years that will determine our collective futures,” said Andrew Logan, oil and gas director at Ceres, the non-profit that advocates for corporate sustainability. “It’s probably safe to say that there is no company – certainly in the financial sector, or heavy-emitting sectors – that has a fully defensible plan when it comes to meeting the scale and scope of the urgency of the climate challenge.” World leaders are starting to find the gap between corporate rhetoric and action too glaring to ignore. Historically, oil and gas companies have been top sponsors at international climate meetings, hosting events and prominently displaying advertisements with their climate goals. That is beginning to shift. The UK, host of this week’s landmark climate summit in Glasgow, will limit participation by companies unless they have a “credible short-term action plan” to ratchet down emissions. But in the run-up to this year’s negotiations, oil companies are blitzing social media with advertisements about their climate pledges. In a Facebook ad campaign launched this month, ExxonMobil promises to cut pollution from drilling. It plans to do that by reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon over the short term. That will lower the “methane intensity” of its operations – but it ignores the emissions from customers burning the fuel itself. “The fossil fuel companies feel the heat and feel the pressure to do something about this, if they want to remain the main provider of energy,” said Yamide Dagnet, the director of climate negotiations at World Resources Institute. Royal Dutch Shell announced last week it will cut its absolute carbon emissions in half by 2030. But the commitment pertains only to the company’s internal climate footprint, not the much larger share of emissions that occur when its fuels are burned for energy. The timing of the announcement is also notable, as it comes on the heels of a Dutch court ruling earlier this year that Shell must slash its emissions 45% by 2030. Most other fossil fuel companies – and the banks that finance them – continue to find alternatives to promising outright emissions reductions. A net zero goal signals a company aims to offset its emissions by adding cleaner energy projects to their portfolios, or attempting to capture carbon dioxide and stop it from entering the air. But these goals can be so narrow as to be meaningless. Beau O’Sullivan, senior communications campaigner at the global social activist group Sunrise Project*, said fossil fuel companies were “inoculating themselves from bank and shareholder pressure by making these net zero commitments”. BP has the most aggressive decarbonization plans in the sector, according to an analysis by the global energy research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie. The company aims to be net zero for its operations and upstream production by 2050 and to halve its carbon intensity by then. It has slashed its budget for oil exploration, and it’s the only oil giant that has promised to cut production over the next decade. But the devil is in the details – or the lack thereof. BP declined to comment on why it has excluded a large portion of its emissions in its net zero commitment, choosing not to calculate emissions from its more than 20% stake in the Russian company Rosneft. Rosneft explores for oil and gas in some of the most remote regions, including in ecologically vulnerable Siberia and the Arctic. The company’s lobbying also conflicts with its climate message. In 2020, BP left three associations because of their climate positions. But it is still a member of the American Petroleum Institute, which has lobbied against electric vehicle tax breaks, methane regulations and drilling restrictions in the Arctic. BP in a March 2021 report said it is working with API and other associations to move “on important issues such as support for the Paris Agreement, regulation of methane, carbon pricing and the role of climate science”. These greenwashing campaigns benefit more than just the oil companies. Banks are increasingly under pressure to drop their financing of fossil fuels. To defend their continued investments, they’re pointing at oil companies’ climate pledges. “We’re now at a point where the very largest investors in the world, the investors who are the biggest shareholders in high-emitting companies, see climate change as a real threat to the financial health of whole sectors,” said Miguel Jaller, the vice-chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis. Jaller was the lead author on a white paper that found intensity targets can play a role in emissions reductions, but aren’t a one-size-fits-all tool. “Ultimately, climate change is an absolute problem that requires absolute reductions in emissions,” Jaller said. Banks have begun to commit to shrink the carbon footprint of their own operations, including from powering their office buildings. But their biggest contributions to global heating are in the oil and gas companies they finance. Few have weaved in climate commitments with their financing strategies, although they are beginning to now. The world’s 60 largest banks financed nearly $4tn in fossil fuel projects between 2016 and 2020, according to a March report from a coalition of climate organizations including the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Sierra Club, BankTrack and more. That total includes lending, equity issuance and debt underwriting. JPMorgan is the largest financier of oil and gas projects in the world, according to the report. The US-based bank poured $51bn into the sector just in 2020. JPMorgan announced in May of this year that it would revise its lending portfolio to be more sustainable. “We are the first large US bank to lay out concrete targets that help meet the goals of Paris – climate change is a critical issue and we want to be part of the solution, advancing sustainable and inclusive growth,” a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement. But JP Morgan’s benchmark is built around carbon intensity. The bank could finance more drilling without breaking its pledge. The bank wants oil and gas companies to cut their operations emissions intensity 35%. It’s asking for much less from their oil and gas products – like natural gas for electricity and oil that is turned into gasoline for vehicles. For those, the bank wants a 15% reduction in intensity by 2030. JPMorgan has said it will “work with clients to address end-use emissions, including by shifting to lower-carbon fuels and exploring other business diversification strategies.” The main lower-carbon fuel is natural gas. If a fossil fuel company increases natural gas production enough, it could offset its emissions progress. It could keep its intensity metric lower while still increasing its overall emissions. “They really took a page out of the oil industry book, when it comes to talking about their goals,” said Jackie Fielder, digital and communications coordinator at Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition committed to ending the financing of fossil fuel companies. “They talked in terms of carbon intensity. So that’s completely compatible with increased emissions.” On the ground, JP Morgan’s financing has powered some of the most controversial fossil fuel projects. It funded TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink, a fracked-gas pipeline that in 2020 leaked in Wet’suwet’en Territory. It also financed Cheniere’s Corpus Christi natural gas export facility, as well as Enbridge, which is building the Line 3 pipeline. A JP Morgan spokesperson said the bank focuses on helping clients “transition to the low-carbon world”, and supports climate policies like a carbon tax. But, the spokesperson added, the bank believes the world still needs oil and gas. “The solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels,” the bank’s spokesperson said. *Sunrise Project is a Floodlight supporter.",Oil and gas companies; Climate crisis; Fossil fuels; Business; Energy industry; Environment,Environment
2021-04-21T19:45:18Z,Super League died but the cartel lives on: ‘back to normal’ will simply not suffice | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/apr/21/back-to-normal-will-simply-not-suffice-the-super-league-12-need-to-be-punished,"Those of you with a taste for these things will have noted the irony: a competition designed to eliminate promotion and relegation in perpetuity somehow managed to shed half its teams in a single evening. One by one the scions of the European Super League fell, like spurned pastry chefs in a televised baking competition: first the prize flans of Chelsea and Manchester City, then the rest of the English clubs late on Tuesday night, then Atlético Madrid and the two Milan clubs on Wednesday morning. Farewell then, Super League. You promised a leaner, more tightly focused vision of football, and you achieved it by launching and shelving an entire tournament within three days. Naturally there is a tendency towards schadenfreude here, the urge to rejoice and revel in this triumph of popular will over the cold hand of Big Commerce. The principal protagonists have been humiliated. Ed Woodward at Manchester United has already paid for the fiasco with his job. The Juventus chairman, Andrea Agnelli, was forced to bury his pet project on live television. Even JPMorgan Chase, the investment bank that was funding the venture, has paid a price: its corporate sustainability rating has been downgraded by Standard Ethics from “adequate” to “non-compliant”. And then there have been the apologies: the stony-faced supplications from executives begging for forgiveness from the very same people they had so recently ignored. “I want to apologise for the disruption I caused,” the Liverpool owner, John W Henry, said in a pre-recorded video, as if this had all been some giant misunderstanding, like changing the wifi password, or accidentally ordering a lewd birthday cake. In a culture hooked on the drug of public shaming, maybe it’s tempting to regard this as punishment enough. We have listened. We will reflect. This is a learning moment for all of us. Anyway: as you were. This was certainly the vibe emanating from Uefa on Wednesday, with the president, Aleksander Ceferin, magnanimously welcoming the rebels back into the fold and making a plea for “unity”. And given the sheer chaos of the past few days, the emotional exhaustion of fans who feared their bond with the game might be severed for ever, the thirst for closure will be strong. After all, football has a remarkable capacity for amnesia. There is always a next thing: another story, another scandal, another round of fixtures to pick over. But there are multiple reasons why “back to normal” simply will not suffice here. This idea, this specific scheme, may have died a death. But the cartel lives on, and so do the circumstances that created it. They will come again. Maybe not this season, or even this year, but some day. And when they do they will have learned a thing or two. They will have learned that if you’re going to announce a 15‑club breakaway, it might help to have those 15 clubs lined up in advance. They will have learned the importance of a PR strategy, or even just a steady stream of distraction and disinformation to wrongfoot and divide their opponents. They will have learned that it might not be the best move to send the 74-year-old Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez on to television to speak at length about the desires of young people. This breakaway may have crumbled. The next will be no laughing matter. Unless we do something about it right now, when the big clubs are at their weakest and most penitent. We can quibble over what an appropriate penalty might be for an aggressive coup attempt on the entire global game, but one thing is certain: European football’s dirty dozen must not simply be allowed to slip back into their domestic routines or resume their residency of Uefa’s top club competitions (now handily skewed even more favourably in their direction). Now, above all, is the time to get vindictive. Points deductions, suspensions, expulsions, eye-watering fines, transfer embargoes: none of this should be taken off the table at this stage. A two-year ban from European competition for all 12 clubs would be a good start (even if Arsenal seem well equipped to impose their own exile). In the medium term Uefa should look at reversing its ill-advised reforms of the Champions League that were driven in large part by the threat of a big-club breakaway. Now that threat has been extinguished, there is simply no rationale for an expanded 36-team group stage with extra fixtures for the continent’s elite. To leave it in place would be to reward the breakaway clubs for their sedition. On a wider level the response must be led by government and governing bodies, whose inaction has allowed deep inequalities to develop within the game: between the elite clubs and those further down the pyramid, between the big five leagues and the chasing pack, between the owners of clubs and the men and women who support them. The prime minister has certainly talked a good game on tighter regulation and giving fans a greater say over how their clubs are run, perhaps even enforcing a Bundesliga‑style fan ownership model. But for a government far more concerned about chasing the next headline, talk is currently all that 11 years of Conservative government has produced. And really, what’s required here is not simply legislative but cultural change, a realignment of football’s toxic addiction to private equity, venture capital and the dogma of perpetual growth. It has been both heartwarming and maddening to witness the gradual disintegration of Gary Neville on Sky Sports over the past few days, the apoplectic fury of a man who has only just realised that billionaires like making money. Heartwarming because his impassioned opposition to the breakaway league gave the resistance a resonant rallying point. Maddening because his tone of shock belied the fact that he has had a front-row seat to the past three decades of carnage. Like, you were in the room when the Glazers walked in. You witnessed the rise of the petro‑billionaires first-hand. What part of this, exactly, surprises you? In a way, Neville’s elegant outrage is emblematic of the wider awakening that seems to have occurred over the past few days: a common recognition that for millions around the world, the game no longer works for us. It happens; we watch it; we write or talk about it afterwards; we may even have been entertained. But any sense of pride or ownership in the process has been steadily eroding for years. Broadcasters determine the fixture list, and little digital lines determine whether goals exist or not, and macroeconomics determine who wins the trophies, and faceless billionaire owners determine who gets bought and loaned and hired and fired, and what your stadium looks like, and what to charge you for the privilege of visiting it. None of this is new. What is new is the energy and vigour of the past few days, the strange convulsive energy that has galvanised football in the face of this existential threat. Something appears to have stirred in us since Sunday night: a clarity of thought, a breadth of purpose, a reminder of what we love and cherish most about this stupid game. A realisation that even in the age of the billionaires, football can be more than a pointless forum of bickering and banter. Imagine if the coalition of fans and players and politicians and media that fought back the Super League could be harnessed in the cause of anti-racism, or greater competitive balance, or a more accountable ownership model, or an end to the stockpiling of young players, or genuine pressure on Qatar and its soiled World Cup. Remember this anger. Remember how the Glazer family and Sheikh Mansour and Roman Abramovich and John W Henry and Stan Kroenke and Joe Lewis made you feel. Remember how, in the face of almost unimaginable wealth and power, in the midst of a pandemic, a broad base of “legacy” football lovers united in resistance. A better game is within our grasp. A better world is possible. We cannot waste this time.",European Super League; European club football; Business; Finances; Football politics; Football; Sport,Football
2020-07-28T05:00:15Z,We are entering an era of pandemics – it will end only when we protect the rainforest | Peter Daszak,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/28/pandemic-era-rainforest-deforestation-exploitation-wildlife-disease,"In late 2013, in the village of Meliandou in rural Guinea, a group of children playing near a hollow tree disturbed a small colony of bats hiding inside. Scientists think that Emile Ouamouno, who later became the first tragic “index” case in the west African Ebola outbreak, was likely exposed to bat faeces while playing near the tree. Every pandemic starts like this. An innocuous human activity, such as eating wildlife, can spark an outbreak that leads to a pandemic. In the 1920s, when HIV is thought to have emerged in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, scientists believe transmission to humans could have been caused by a bushmeat hunter cutting themselves while butchering a chimpanzee. In 2019, we can speculate that a person from south-west China entered a bat cave near their village to hunt wildlife for sale at the local wet market. Perhaps they later developed a nagging cough that represents the beginning of what we now know as Covid-19. Now, a growing human population, ever-encroaching development and a globalised network of travel and trade have accelerated the pace of pandemic emergence. We’re entering a new pandemic era. Most pandemics begin in the emerging disease hotspots of the world; the edges of forests in regions such as west Africa, the Amazon basin and south-east Asia. Tropical rainforests are home to a rich diversity of wildlife, which in turn carry an array of viruses. We know far more about these animals than we do about the viruses they carry. An estimated 1.7m viruses exist in mammals and birds (the origins of most pandemics), but less than 0.1% have been described. They spread to millions of people each year; though they often don’t cause noticeable symptoms, the sheer volume means that plenty can. Before humans became an agricultural species, our populations were sparser and less connected. A virus infecting a hunter-gatherer might only reach family members or perhaps a hunting group. But the Anthropocene, our new geological epoch, has changed everything. A great acceleration of human activity has dramatically altered our planet’s landscapes, oceans and atmosphere, transforming as much as half of the world’s tropical forest into agriculture and human settlements. About one-third of emerging diseases are the product of these rapid changes in land use, as people are pushed into contact with wildlife they would once have rarely encountered. The viruses that emerge, such as Zika, Ebola and Nipah, include the latest of our foes, Covid-19, transported from the altered rural landscape of China to a city near you. Human activity has created a continuous cycle of viral spillover and spread. Our current approach is to wait for outbreaks to start, and then design drugs or vaccines to control them. But as we’ve seen with Covid-19, this approach isn’t good enough: while we wait for a vaccine, hundreds of thousands of people have died, and millions have been infected. By the time the US produced sufficient doses to vaccinate against the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, the virus had already infected about a quarter of the people on our planet. If we are to prevent future pandemics, we will need to reassess our relationship with nature, blocking each step in the chain of disease emergence. This should begin with reducing the rampant consumption that drives deforestation and wildlife exploitation. We’ll also need to remove viral-risk species from wildlife markets, crack down on the illegal wildlife trade and work with communities to find alternatives. We should be putting more pressure on industries that harvest tropical timber and wildlife products, rewarding corporate sustainability and legislating against overconsumption. Consumer-led campaigns against palm oil, for example, have had a ripple effect on sustainability. In a recently published paper, a number of scientists, myself included, laid out the economic case for preventing the disease spillover that leads to pandemics by reducing deforestation and the wildlife trade. We estimate that the annual costs of programmes to reduce deforestation and the wildlife trade and build pandemic surveillance in disease hotspots would be $17.7–26.9bn, more than three orders of magnitude smaller than the current estimate cost of Covid-19 economic damages, of $8.1-15.8tn. Our costs include the collateral benefits of carbon sequestration by reducing forest loss. While the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the global economy, our current trajectory could see the cost of future pandemics rocket into the tens of trillions. As we rebuild our economies after the coronavirus pandemic, rather than returning to the system of unchecked consumption that brought us Covid-19, we have an opportunity to green our economies. Centuries of environmental exploitation have put us in a fragile position on this planet. While some may balk at the costs of avoiding environmental breakdown, or fail to understand the value of preserving a species of butterfly, frog or fish, most of us recognise that Covid-19 has brought death and economic misery on a global scale. Once we accept that human activity is what led to this, we may finally be empowered to escape the pandemic era. • Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics",Epidemics; Coronavirus; Infectious diseases; Ebola; Sars; Aids and HIV; Deforestation; Conservation; Environment; Trees and forests; Science; World news,Opinion
2020-06-16T06:16:43Z,‘Tick-a-box approach’: fears Australia’s efforts to tackle modern slavery risk being derailed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/16/tick-a-box-approach-fears-australias-efforts-to-tackle-modern-slavery-risk-being-derailed,"Australia’s efforts to tackle modern slavery are at risk of being thrown off course because the government’s newly appointed expert panel is dominated by business interests, according to campaigners and legal advocates. Labor’s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, said it was hard to understand how the government could comprehensively address modern slavery with an advisory group “that contains no representation from the groups who work directly with workers who are working in slavery or at risk of slavery”. The group – set up to advise the government on how it implements the new modern slavery laws – has five permanent members. These are the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the Law Council of Australia, and the Global Compact Network Australia – a network that brings together companies and other groups that have signed up to the UN’s corporate sustainability initiative. Unions and civil society groups are not represented. Last month the government announced 10 further appointments after a call for nominations, including representatives from Telstra, Bunnings, Ausbil Investment Management, Lendlease Corporation, the Country Road Group and David Jones. Academics are also among the new appointees. Michele O’Neil, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the advisory group was “incomplete and ill-informed without workers’ voices at the table”. Keren Adams, a legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said she was concerned about “the total absence of representation by either trade unions or civil society organisations but really any organisations that are working on the ground with people who are meant to be affected by these laws”. “The laws will be driven by the very companies that are supposed to be regulated by the new legislation,” she said. “If Australia wants to be seen as a world leader on these questions, it needs to be making sure it’s actually hearing from people working with communities and people who are affected. Otherwise it may go completely down the wrong course.” Adams said the Covid-19 pandemic had thrown supply chains into disarray and heightened the risk of worker exploitation, given that there has been a massive increase in orders of some products including gloves, while other sectors have had orders cancelled leading to job losses. She said Australia’s Modern Slavery Act – passed in 2018 – was only “a small first step” and “pretty light-touch legislation”, and she hoped it would be toughened up with penalties when it was reviewed at the three-year mark. “There’s a lot of self-regulation by businesses. If you don’t even have oversight in terms of people advising the government who have the interests of workers front and centre, I think there’s a real risk that businesses are going to be able to get away with a tick-a-box approach.” The Modern Slavery Act will require Australia’s largest businesses – those with annual consolidated revenue of more than $100m – to publish annual statements on the steps they are taking to address modern slavery in their supply chains and operations. Carolyn Kitto, the national co-director of Be Slavery Free – a coalition of community and civil society groups working to end modern slavery – pointed to the Australian Border Force’s guidance material on modern slavery. The document encourages businesses to collaborate with civil society organisations and workers and their representatives “to strengthen your entity’s response to modern slavery”. “If the minister’s own guidance material says this is how you find a good way forward, it would be prudent to take the advice for his own committee,” Kitto said, adding: “The risk of [the expert advisory group] being too business-dominated is the business is always seeking to reduce the compliance that may be necessary, but when the voices of civil society and workers are included they tend to change their mind. “Likewise, if this was only a civil society group, the civil society group would come up with options that may not work for business. That’s why it needs to have representation across the board.” Jason Wood, the assistant minister for customs, community safety and multicultural affairs, has described the group as “a world-leading initiative that brought together key experts with practical knowledge and expertise in combating modern slavery”. But Keneally wrote to Wood on Monday to raise “significant concerns” about what the expert advisory group would be able to achieve without representation from civil society organisations and unions. “From the seventy applicants, not a single appointment has been made from those who are working directly with workers at risk of modern slavery,” she said in her letter to Wood. The senator called on the government to broaden the group’s membership, echoing the approach it took during the pandemic. An Australian Border Force spokesperson said the government wanted to ensure the Modern Slavery Act drove “long-term change” and feedback from businesses was “vitally important”. The spokesperson argued the advisory group complemented the existing national roundtable on human trafficking and slavery, which included the ACTU and civil society groups. Labor called for a debate on “the Morrison government’s incompetence” over the issue in the Senate late on Tuesday, prompting Coalition senators to denounce “political point-scoring”. The Modern Slavery Act’s reporting obligations are expected to affect roughly 3,000 companies. Some reporting deadlines have been delayed due to the pandemic.",Australian politics; Kristina Keneally; Australia news; Labor party; Australian trade unions; Business; Modern slavery,Australia news

The complex and interconnected challenges of building an equitable society and economy that meets the needs of nine billion people while living within our finite planetary resources is likely to require a different kind of leadership in business and politics.

2018-11-11T17:10:08Z,Addison Lee drivers challenge clients to uphold UN pledges,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/11/addison-lee-drivers-challenge-clients-to-uphold-un-pledges,"Taxi drivers are ramping up a campaign for better pay and union recognition from Addison Lee by challenging the company’s major corporate clients to uphold commitments signed under a UN accord obliging them to use ethical suppliers. Deutsche Bank is the first of the taxi company’s clients to be approached by union representatives who have also pointed out that its own “vender code of conduct” obliges it to recognise the right to collective bargaining, and minimum and prevailing wages and benefits. They plan to write to the UN secretary general asking for the bank to be kicked out of the UN Global Compact, which is billed as the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. Signatories commit themselves to upholding universal principles including human rights and labour. Other companies using Addison Lee, such as KPMG and Credit Suisse, are also likely to be challenged as part of a new tactic by trade unionists in the frontline of the battle over gig economy jobs. “We think it is outrageous that these companies brandish these great codes of conduct as a way of enhancing their reputations,” said James Farrar of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. “But if it means nothing in Britain then how can we expect it to be respected in a developing country with already low levels of respect for the rights involved?” A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said it worked with various private car hire companies in the UK and had only a small share in Addison Lee’s turnover. “Our contracts with Addison Lee as well as the agreed rates are in line with current market standards in the industry. We have engaged with Addison Lee on the issues and they confirmed to us that they comply with all relevant legislation,” she said. A spokesperson for Addison Lee said: “Addison Lee Group takes its responsibility to provide a fair and flexible environment for its 5,000 driver partners very seriously. As a result, earnings are at a record high and over 60% of drivers said they were likely or very likely to recommend working for Addison Lee in our most recent driver satisfaction survey. “In common with most of the private hire and taxi industry, the majority of our drivers are self-employed.” The development comes against the backdrop of an ongoing issue between Addison Lee and drivers taking passengers to and from Luton airport, where the concession for operating services was sold to the company by Luton council in 2016. The union is advocating on behalf of Addison Lee drivers who saythe company has been insisting on increased commissions on fares – up to 35% in the case of drivers servicing Luton airport. Vehicles rentals have increased to as much as £270 a week while drivers working 70 hours a week are earning less than £5 an hour, according to the union. Frank Field, the MP and chairman of the work and pensions select committee, is to write to Luton council and Addison Lee to express his concerns after taking evidence from more than two dozen drivers.",Trade unions; Business; Deutsche Bank; United Nations; Road transport; Transport; Banking; European banks; Europe; UK news; World news; Gig economy,Politics
2019-02-19T06:00:06Z,How the world got hooked on palm oil,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/19/palm-oil-ingredient-biscuits-shampoo-environmental,"Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there grew a magical fruit. This fruit could be squeezed to produce a very special kind of oil that made cookies more healthy, soap more bubbly and crisps more crispy. The oil could even make lipstick smoother and keep ice-cream from melting. Because of these wondrous qualities, people came from around the world to buy the fruit and its oil. In the places where the fruit came from, people burned down the forest so they could plant more trees that grew the fruit – making lots of nasty smoke and sending all of the creatures of the forest scurrying away. When the trees were burned, they emitted a gas that heated up the air. Then everybody was upset, because they loved the forest’s creatures and thought the temperature was warm enough already. A few people decided they shouldn’t use the oil any more, but mostly things went on as before, and the forest kept burning. This is a true story. Except that it is not magic. The fruit of the oil palm tree (Elaeis guineensis), which grows in tropical climates, contains the world’s most versatile vegetable oil. It can handle frying without spoiling, and blends well with other oils. Its combination of different types of fats and its consistency after refining make it a popular ingredient in packaged baked goods. Its low production costs make it cheaper than frying oils such as cottonseed or sunflower. It provides the foaming agent in virtually every shampoo, liquid soap or detergent. Cosmetics manufacturers prefer it to animal tallow for its ease of application and low price. It is increasingly used as a cheap raw material for biofuels, especially in the European Union. It functions as a natural preservative in processed foods, and actually does raise the melting point of ice-cream. Palm oil can be used as an adhesive that binds together the particles in fibreboard. Oil palm trunks and fronds can be made into everything from plywood to the composite body of Malaysia’s national automobile. Worldwide production of palm oil has been climbing steadily for five decades. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled, from 15.2m tonnes to 62.6m tonnes. By 2050, it is expected to quadruple again, reaching 240m tonnes. The footprint of palm oil production is astounding: plantations to produce it account for 10% of permanent global cropland. Today, 3 billion people in 150 countries use products containing palm oil. Globally, we each consume an average of 8kg of palm oil a year. Of this, 85% comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where worldwide demand for palm oil has lifted incomes, especially in rural areas – but at the cost of tremendous environmental devastation and often with attendant labour and human rights abuses. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, a country of 261 million people. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinos and orangutans – driving them towards extinction. Yet consumers are often unaware they are even using the stuff. Palm Oil Investigations, which dubs itself “the palm oil watchdog”, lists more than 200 common ingredients in food and home and personal care products containing palm oil, only about 10% of which include the telltale word “palm”. How did palm oil insinuate itself into every corner of our lives? No single innovation caused palm oil consumption to soar. Instead, it was the perfect commodity at the right moment for industry after industry, each of which adopted it to replace ingredients and never turned back. At the same time, producing nations view palm oil as a poverty-reduction scheme, while international finance organisations view it as a growth engine for developing economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has pushed Malaysia and Indonesia to produce more. As the palm industry expanded, conservationists and environmental organisations such as Greenpeace started to raise the alarm about its devastating effects on carbon emissions and wildlife habitat. (However, it is not impossible to produce palm oil sustainably, and several organisations certify sustainable producers.) In response, a backlash against palm oil has developed: last April, the supermarket Iceland pledged that it would cut palm oil from all its own-brand foods by the end of 2018. In December, Norway banned imports for biofuel production. But by the time awareness of palm oil’s impact had spread, it was so deeply embedded in the consumer economy that it now may be too late to remove it. (Tellingly, Iceland found it impossible to fulfill its 2018 pledge. Instead, the company ended up removing its branding from foods containing palm oil rather than removing palm oil from all of its branded foods.) Determining which products contain palm oil, let alone how sustainably it has been sourced, requires an almost supernatural level of consumer consciousness. In any case, greater consumer awareness in the west will not have much impact, given that Europe and the US account for less than 14% of global demand. More than half of global demand comes from Asia. It was a good 20 years after the first alarms about deforestation in Brazil that consumer action slowed – not stopped – the destruction. With palm oil, “the reality is that the western part of world is [a small share] of palm oil consumption, and the rest of the world doesn’t give a shit”, said Neil Blomquist, managing director of Colorado-based Natural Habitats, which produces palm oil in Ecuador and Sierra Leone to the highest level of sustainability certification. “So there’s not much incentive to change.” * * * Palm oil’s world domination is the result of five factors: first, it has replaced less healthy fats in foods in the west. Second, producers have pushed to keep its price low. Third, it has replaced more expensive oils in home and personal care products. Fourth, again because it is cheap, it has been widely adopted as cooking oil in Asian countries. Finally, as those Asian countries have grown richer, they have begun to consume more fat, much of it in the form of palm oil. Widespread adoption of palm oil began with processed foods. In the 1960s, scientists began to warn that butter’s high saturated fat content may increase the risk of heart disease. Food manufacturers, including the British-Dutch conglomerate Unilever, began to replace it with margarine, made with vegetable oils low in saturated fat. By the early 1990s, though, it became clear that the process by which the oils in margarine were made, known as partial hydrogenation, actually created a different kind of fat – trans fat – that was even unhealthier than saturated fat. The Unilever board of directors saw a scientific consensus forming against trans fat and decided to get rid of it. “Unilever was always very conscious of the health interests of consumers of its products,” said James W Kinnear, a Unilever board member at the time. The switchover happened suddenly. In 1994, a Unilever refineries manager named Gerrit van Duijn received a call from his bosses in Rotterdam. Twenty Unilever plants in 15 countries needed to remove partially hydrogenated oils from 600 fat blends and replace them with trans-fat free components. The project, for reasons Van Duijn can’t explain, was called “Paddington”. First, he needed to figure out what could replace trans fat while maintaining its favourable properties, such as remaining solid at room temperature – a necessity for inexpensive butter substitutes as well as manufactured goods such as cookies. In the end, there was only one choice: oil from the oil palm tree – either palm oil (extracted from the fruit) or palm kernel oil (from the seed). No other oil could be refined to the consistency needed for Unilever’s various margarine blends and baked goods without producing trans fat. It was the only alternative to partially hydrogenated oils, Van Duijn told me. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were also lower in saturated fat than butter. The switch at each plant had to occur simultaneously – the production lines couldn’t handle a mixture of the old oils and the new. “On a certain day, all these tanks had to be emptied of trans-containing components and refilled with trans-free components,” Van Duijn said. “Logistically, that was quite a nightmare.” (Purchasing additional tanks would have been too expensive.) As Unilever had sometimes used palm oil previously, a supply chain was already up and running. But it took six weeks for the raw material to be shipped from Malaysia to Europe, and Van Duijn had three months to make the switch. He started to buy more and more palm and palm kernel oils, arranging for the shipments to be trucked in to the various plants on schedule. Then one day in 1995, with trucks queued up outside Unilever plants across Europe, it was done. It was a moment that changed the processed food industry forever. Unilever was the trailblazer; after Van Duijn organised the company’s switch to palm oil, virtually every other food manufacturer followed. In 2001, the American Heart Association issued a statement declaring that “the optimal diet for reducing risk of chronic diseases is one in which saturated fatty acids are reduced and trans fatty acids from manufactured fats are virtually eliminated”. Today, more than two-thirds of palm oil goes into food. Consumption in the EU more than tripled between Project Paddington and 2015. That same year, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave food manufacturers three years to get rid of all trans fats from every margarine, cookie, cake, pie, popcorn, frozen pizza, doughnut and biscuit sold in the US. Virtually all of it has now been replaced with palm oil. * * * For all the palm oil that now goes into food in Europe and the US, Asia uses far more: India, China, and Indonesia account for nearly 40% of all palm oil consumed worldwide. Where they once cooked with soya oil, palm oil has replaced it. Growth has been fastest in India, where an accelerating economy has been another factor in palm oil’s newfound popularity. One of the commonalities of economic development, across the globe and throughout history, is that a population’s consumption of fat grows in lockstep with its income, and the subcontinent has been no exception. Between 1993 and 2013, Indian per capita GDP expanded from $298 to $1,452. Over the same period, fat consumption in rural areas grew by 35% and in urban areas by 25%, and palm oil has been a major ingredient in this escalation. Government-subsidised “fair price shops”, a food distribution network for the poor, started selling imported palm oil in 1978, mainly for cooking; two years later the 290,000 shops were unloading 273,500 tonnes. By 1995, Indian imports of palm oil had climbed to nearly 1m tonnes, reaching more than 9m tonnes by 2015. In those years, the poverty rate fell by half while the population climbed by 36%. But palm oil is no longer just used for home cooking in India – today it is a big part of the country’s growing junk food industry. India’s fast food market grew 83% just between 2011 and 2016. Between them, Domino’s Pizza, Subway, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts – all of which use palm oil – now have 2,784 stores in the country, according to reporting by the Nation. Packaged-food sales spiked 138% over roughly the same period; for pennies, you can buy dozens of packaged snacks containing palm oil. Palm oil’s versatility is not limited to food. Unlike other oils, it can be easily and inexpensively “fractionated” – separated into oils of different consistencies – which disposes it to multiple uses. “It has a tremendous advantage because of its versatility,” said Carl Bek-Nielsen, chief executive director of United Plantations Berhad, a Malaysia-based palm oil producer. Not long after the processed food business discovered the magical properties of palm oil, industries as diverse as personal care products and transport fuel would also begin using it to replace other oils. But just as trans fats were chosen for perceived benefits, only to turn out to be worse than what they had replaced, palm oil was initially adopted in large part for its perceived environmental friendliness. As palm oil became more widely used in food the world over, it was also replacing animal products in cleaning products and personal care items such as soap, shampoo, lotion and makeup. Today, 70% of personal care items contain one or more palm oil derivatives. Historically, soap often came from animal tallow, and shampoo, which originated on the Indian subcontinent, was first made with plant-based surfactants (a substance that acts as a detergent, emulsifier or foaming agent). Later, synthetic ingredients came into favour, with animal tallow joining them in the 20th century. In the 1980s, the personal care industry started to notice a consumer preference for “natural” ingredients, which “a lot of consumers figured was synonymous with plant-based rather than animal-based”, said Chris Sayner, vice-president for corporate sustainability at Croda, a chemical company. Croda’s customers started asking if it could come up with plant-based surfactant formulations without tallow. Just as Van Duijn had discovered at Unilever, the composition of palm oil and palm kernel oil made them the perfect substitute. Manufacturers looking for alternatives found that palm and palm kernel oils contain the same set of fat types as tallow. No other alternative could provide the same advantages across such a wide range of products. “Alternate sources [to tallow] were looked at,” Sayner recalled. “Palm and palm kernel oil dropped in as the replacement.” Sayner believes that the BSE outbreak of the early 1990s, when a brain disease among cattle spread to some people who ate beef, triggered a larger shift in consumption habits. “Public opinion, brand equity and marketing all came together to move away from animal-based products in more fashion-oriented industries like personal care.” Companies across Europe and the US that Croda supplied started to make the switch. The change from animal-based fats to palm oil came with a certain irony. In the past, when tallow was used in products such as soaps, a byproduct of the meat industry – animal fat – was put to good use. Now, in response to consumers’ desire for ingredients perceived as more “natural,” the makers of soaps, detergents and cosmetics have replaced a local waste product with one that must be transported thousands of miles and that causes environmental destruction in the countries where it is produced. (Although, of course, the meat industry comes with its own environmental harm.) “What’s better environmentally than using a byproduct that exists on your doorstep?” Sayner asked. A similar thing happened with biofuels – the intent to reduce environmental harm had unintended consequences. In 1997, a European commission report called for increasing the percentage of total energy consumption from renewable sources. Three years later it cited the environmental benefits of biofuels for transport, and in 2009 adopted the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), which included a 10% target for the share of transport fuels coming from biofuels by 2020. Unlike in food and home and personal care products, where palm’s chemical makeup makes it the perfect alternative, when it comes to biofuel, palm, soybean, rapeseed and sunflower oils all perform equally well. But palm has one big advantage over these rival oils: price. The EU policies “created an unprecedented market for the uptake of palm oil,” said Kalyana Sundram, CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, a trade group. Legislative attempts in the west to curb the environmental harm of fossil fuels – the US adopted its own biofuel mandate in 2007 – had severe environmental consequences in less developed countries, contributing significantly to global warming. EU palm oil imports shot up 15% the year after the RED, reaching an all-time high, and 19% the year after that, as biofuel use tripled in the EU between 2011 and 2014; palm oil’s share of biofuel raw material leapt fivefold in that period. Half of the EU’s palm oil now goes to biofuel, double the share prior to the RED. Sustainability criteria were later added – although Oxfam and others have criticised their effectiveness – and earlier this month European commissioners proposed new limits on biofuel crops tied to deforestation. But the damage had already been done. * * * The oil palm is blessed with many attributes that have helped it on its path to dominance. It is perennial and evergreen, enabling year-round production. It is exceptionally efficient at photosynthesis for a perennial tree, and requires less preparation of the soil than other sources of vegetable oils, reducing costs. It can succeed in soils that can’t sustain other crops. Most importantly, it gives the highest yield per acre of any oilseed crop – almost five times as much oil per acre as rapeseed, almost six times as much as sunflower and more than eight times as much as soybeans. Boycotts of palm oil will only lead to its replacement by other crops needing far more farmland and likely more deforestation. “The cost of production is far less than any compared [comparable] vegetable or animal fat,” said Sundram, of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council. “Industry is simply palming off the benefits to the consumer.” For decades, palm’s production advantage went unrealised, until a Scot named Leslie Davidson instigated perhaps the most significant innovation in the industry’s history. Davidson had come to British Malaya in 1951 at the age of 20 to work on a Unilever plantation. Four years later, the company transferred him to Cameroon. The oil palm originated in west Africa, and had been introduced from there to Malaysia in 1875. In Cameroon, Davidson noticed that insects resembling rice weevils surrounded palm fruits. In Malaya, the plantations were employing hundreds of people to hand-pollinate the flowers, yet pollination occurred more efficiently in Cameroon. When Unilever sent Davidson back to Malaya (now Malaysia) in 1960, he told his bosses he thought the Malaysian industry was going about pollination all wrong, and that insects were the natural pollinators of oil palm. “They told him to mind your own business and don’t get involved,” said Carl Bek-Nielsen, who knew Davidson. In 1974, Davidson became vice-chair of Unilever International Plantations Group. He recruited three entomologists, led by the Pakistani scientist Rahman Syed, who travelled to Cameroon to investigate. Eventually Syed determined that Davidson’s hunch was correct: a particular species of weevil was pollinating the oil palm trees, and Davidson received permission from the Malaysian government to import some. On 21 February, 1981, 2,000 Elaeidobius kamerunicus were released at Unilever’s Mamor estate in Johor. Results were seen immediately, with no adverse effects, and the pollinating weevils were distributed across Malaysia. The following year, the country saw an increase in yield of 400,000 tonnes of palm oil and 300,000 tonnes of palm kernels. The new pollination technique was a key factor in palm oil’s growth. As yields climbed, and the cost of labour to manually pollinate the trees was more efficiently deployed for picking the fruit, there was an explosion in the volume of land devoted to oil-palm plantations. Davidson had radically changed the future of Malaysia and Indonesia. But the changes wouldn’t have occurred without pushes from policymakers in both countries. “We’ve seen a lot of effort from both governments into supporting the sector because it’s an easy way to develop the economy,” said Raquel Moreno-Peñaranda, research fellow at United Nations University’s Institute of Advanced Studies in Tokyo, who studies agricultural systems and advises governments. Malaysia’s minister of primary industries, Teresa Kok, told the European Palm Oil Conference in Madrid in October: “Palm oil is synonymous with poverty eradication.” Malaysia began its programme to boost palm exports as a means of poverty reduction in 1961, four years after independence from Britain. Rubber had been a key crop, but with prices falling, the government initiated a programme to replace rubber plantations with oil palm. In 1968, Malaysia provided palm oil producers with a series of tax breaks. Industry subsequently invested heavily in milling technology to extract the oil from the fruit. In the early 1970s, fractionation was developed, expanding the applications of palm oil for both food and other uses. More recently, plantation owners have found profitable uses for waste such as empty fruit bunches, palm fronds, palm fruit peels, and palm kernel shells. Mill effluent that was once dumped into nearby streams now produces electricity. These new revenue streams reduce planters’ risk by providing income even when palm oil prices are down (such as right now), and have helped them face headwinds such as the increasing costs of labour and fertiliser. But the push for increased palm oil production has not only come from inside Malaysia and Indonesia. World Bank policies in the 1970s encouraged the Indonesian government to expand palm among small farmers. The 1998 economic crisis in Asia shattered exports of manufactured goods from the region, but commodity exports, which were sold in dollars, “came in like a life vest in rough choppy seas,” Bek-Nielsen recalled. The IMF’s bailout package for Indonesia required that it generate revenue by cultivating natural resources and erase export taxes the government had imposed to keep prices low at home. The measures further incentivised expansion of palm plantations. Alongside the IMF, private finance has helped boost production: Dutch banks alone provided more than $12bn in loans to Indonesian palm producers in the years 1995-99. * * * The short-term benefits to plantation owners and labourers, producer-nations’ governments and financiers have come with enormous long-term costs to the global climate. Forests destroyed for oil palm plantations are among the most carbon-rich in the world. When they are burned, that carbon is released. Palm oil now accounts for 13.7% of Malaysia’s gross national income and is Indonesia’s top export. In October, at the European Palm Oil Association meeting in Madrid, government officials from the two countries trumpeted the successes in poverty reduction they had achieved thanks to palm oil (though growers in Indonesia, at least, have disputed these claims, calling on government and industry to do more for farmers independent of the big plantations). Officials further insisted that deforestation was being halted and sustainability achieved, even as another speaker told the attendees deforestation had actually increased in some areas over the previous decade. (In September, Indonesia’s president signed a three-year moratorium on new palm-plantation development.) Commodity-producing countries need only answer to their buyers, though, while those buyers must respond to consumers. In 2004, the environmental NGO Friends of the Earth UK released a report detailing deforestation rates from palm-oil production. As the outcry spread, and concern rose among producers that the continued deforestation would become a risk to their reputations, the World Wildlife Federation that year convinced a small number of palm growers, manufacturers and retailers to establish the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. A decade later, most of the major users of palm oil had committed to production the RSPO deemed “sustainable” and 19% of global product was certified as such by the organisation. But the Environmental Investigation Agency, an offshoot of Greenpeace, three years ago found RSPO to be “woefully substandard” and “in some cases … colluding … to disguise violations”. (RSPO responded in a statement that it “takes very seriously the claims contained in the EIA report, and welcomes it as an opportunity for intensifying this dialogue, and further [improving] its certification system.”) It is extraordinarily difficult to make sure that palm oil is being sustainably produced. A single palm oil mill – there are hundreds in Malaysia alone – can buy fruit from a multitude of suppliers, and with all its formulations and derivatives, palm oil has one of the most complicated supply chains of any ingredient. Even when the sustainability certification system is working as it is supposed to, environmentalists have criticised such programmes. For instance, a product can earn a “certified sustainable” label even if 99% of the palm oil it includes came from freshly deforested land. The RSPO says having less strict certification criteria encourages participation, the hope being that manufacturers of retail products will ramp up to higher levels once they see they can sell certified palm oil for a higher price. Before the European Palm Oil Association meeting, RSPO’s head of European operations, Inke van der Sluijs, admitted that “very few companies do [the highest level of sustainability certification] because of the complexity and length of the supply chain”. RSPO is widely viewed by environmentalists as the most robust of several certification systems and encourages manufacturers to use RSPO-certified oil. Nevertheless, half of certified-sustainable palm oil isn’t sold as sustainable: until a sufficient number of consumers are willing to pay the higher price for certified palm oil, little will change. Moreover, the vast majority of palm oil is traced only as far as the mill where it’s processed, not to the field where it’s produced. Eyes on the Forest, a coalition of Indonesian NGOs that includes the WWF – the same organisation that spurred palm oil certification – said in a 2016 report that “mill traceability [on its own] wastes time and money without offering a solution to the issues of illegal product entering the supply chains”. There is now a growing effort to deploy technology to trace each bunch of fruit to a field and farmer, which would finally ensure new deforestation isn’t occurring to produce palm oil. The other hope for halting deforestation for palm is increasing yields, the idea being that if more oil can come from existing plantations it will obviate the need to expand the planting area into biodiverse forest. Rajinder Singh, leader of the genomics group at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, a government agency, has been identifying genetic signatures associated with certain traits so high-yielding palms can be selected and land isn’t wasted on trees that don’t produce much. The best plantations currently yield around six or seven tonnes of oil per hectare, but Singh said, “we’ve seen individual palms that can give almost double” the amount of oil compared to common strains. As trees reach the end of their productive life of 25-30 years, they could be replaced by more prolific strains. But even doubling yields won’t meet the near-quadrupling of demand expected by 2050. There is no easy solution. Replacing palm with other oils will only accelerate deforestation, since none of its competitors boast anywhere near its yield per unit of land: palm accounts for 6.6% of cultivated land for oils and fats, while delivering 38.7% of the output, according to the European Palm Oil Alliance, an industry group. Colombia is aggressively pursuing palm oil development in areas formerly devoted to illegal crops such as coca, but it has a lot of catching up to match Asia’s output. Palm oil has become ubiquitous because it is the perfect ingredient for a number of growing industries, the perfect export for developing economies, and the perfect commodity for the globalised economy that links them. Wealthy consumers are capitalising on the cheap labour and valuable rainforest that developing nations have in abundance and are willing to part with at a discount to accelerate their economic growth. But that model isn’t sustainable. If things continue, the forests and their creatures will be gone, and the cost of labour will increase as some workers move up the economic ladder and realise there are better things they could be doing than picking fruit. Palm oil producers and consumers will be left with nothing. Products that are sustainable are those produced and consumed locally; when buyers are able to witness the production process, they will demand that it occur in line with their values. When it’s out of sight, it’s difficult to get enough of them to care. Changing that may require more than a little magic. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This piece has been edited to correct the attribution of a report, to “Eyes on the Forest, a coalition of Indonesian NGOs that includes the WWF”, rather than to the WWF alone.",Palm oil; Environment; Indonesia; Malaysia; World news; Wildlife,News
