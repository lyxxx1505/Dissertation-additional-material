2024-07-31T04:00:14Z,"Hidden cost of UK workplace sickness rockets to £100bn a year, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/hidden-cost-of-uk-workplace-sickness-rockets-to-100bn-a-year-report-finds,"The hidden cost of rising workplace sickness in the UK has increased to more than £100bn a year, largely caused by a loss of productivity amid “staggering” levels of presenteeism, a report warns. Analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) shows the cost of staff sickness has grown by £30bn a year to £103bn in 2023. The annual bill was £73bn in 2018, its study found. Most increase in cost to businesses (£25bn) was because of lower productivity, with employees not fully functioning in the workplace because of an illness, injury or other health condition. The rest of the cost increase (£5bn) was owing to employees taking more sick days. Employees now lose the equivalent of 44 days of productivity on average because of working through sickness, up from 35 days in 2018, according to the IPPR. Staff lose a further 6.7 days taking sick leave, up from 3.7 days in 2018, the report says. Workers in the UK are among the least likely to take sick days, especially compared with other OECD and European countries, experts said. They are more likely to turn up at work while sick. The enormous impact of presenteeism, where staff are unable to perform to the best of their abilities and are more likely to make mistakes, is causing a significant loss in productivity, the IPPR found. Dr Jamie O’Halloran, a senior research fellow at the IPPR, said: “Too often, UK workers are being pressured to work through sickness when that’s not appropriate – harming their wellbeing and reducing productivity. This can be because of a bad workplace culture, poor management, financial insecurity or just weak understanding of long-term conditions among UK employers. “Our demonstration of a ‘hidden’ productivity cost of working through sickness should catalyse a change in approach. We should strive to make sure the work we do is good for our health, that we have the time to recover when we need it, and to ensure businesses both contribute to and benefit from population health. This would protect workers, boost profits and deliver growth.” With the right support in an appropriate job, people with some health conditions can benefit from good work, the report said. But when compelled to work despite being ill employees lose out. Presenteeism can slow their recovery, increase the risk of getting sicker later, and spread infectious illnesses to others – all lowering productivity. This is bad for business and bad for staff, the IPPR concluded. Tina Woods, the founder and chief executive of Business for Health, said: “The cost of employee sickness to businesses is staggering, especially the productivity loss of people working through their sickness.” Working through poor health is more common among those from marginalised ethnic groups, people in lower quality jobs and staff lacking formal qualifications. Black or Asian employees are twice as likely to work through sickness compared to those who are white British, the IPPR said. The study, the final interim report from the cross-party IPPR Commission on Health and Prosperity, urges ministers to clamp down on businesses that harm health and incentivise firms that improve the health of their workforce. Kieron Boyle, the chief executive of the Impact Investing Institute and IPPR commissioner, said: “Businesses and investors increasingly see health as an asset, not a cost. This report is a blueprint for their role in creating a healthy and prosperous economy for everyone.” Last year a separate report from the IPPR Commission on Health and Prosperity found long-term sickness, with people out of the labour market, had become a “serious fiscal threat” to the UK. It said the number of people out of the labour market because of sickness was at an all-time high of 2.6 million, warning “there is no road to prosperity for this nation without tackling the tide of sickness head-on”. A separate study recently found that mental health training for line managers could save companies millions of pounds in lost sick days every year. Organisations offering managers mental wellness training experienced better customer service, improved employee retention and recruitment, and reduced long-term sickness absence, according to the study published this month in the journal Plos One. The findings showed mental health training was associated with better business performance and may “hold strategic business value for companies”. Prof Holly Blake, from the University of Nottingham, who led the study, said: “Mental ill health at work is costly to organisations in terms of sickness absence and lost productivity. “To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that training line managers in mental health is linked to better business outcomes. This is an important finding that strengthens the business case for why employers should invest in mental health at work.” About one in six people in the UK experience mental health challenges in the workplace, with 12.7% of all sick days attributed to mental ill health.",Health; UK news; OECD; Work & careers; Business; Workers' rights; Society,Society
2023-01-27T14:00:55Z,Jim Chalmers says May budget to have ‘much bigger focus’ on tackling entrenched disadvantage,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/28/jim-chalmers-treasurer-may-federal-budget-2023-focus-disadvantage,"Treasurer Jim Chalmers has revealed he will use the May budget to spearhead “a much bigger focus” on entrenched disadvantage in Australia’s most vulnerable communities to ensure people have better pathways to economic participation. Chalmers told Guardian Australia’s politics podcast he was working with the social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, on a new package that would “identify some of the most vulnerable communities in our country, work out how to empower local leaders and pool our resources and make a meaningful difference to some on the entrenched disadvantage that’s in our country”. The pre-budget signalling comes as Chalmers has penned an essay for the Monthly advocating what he terms a new “values-based capitalism” for Australia. Chalmers says the Albanese government’s core mission is to “redefine and reform our economy and institutions in ways that make our people and communities more resilient, and our society and democracy stronger as well”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The 6,000-word essay, to be published on Monday, argues economic inclusion is fundamental because it buttresses democratic stability in an age where populism and autocracy is on the march. To help combat a slide away from liberalism, the treasurer flags future co-investment with philanthropists and the private sector in “place-based initiatives where communities have the genuine input, local leadership, resources and authority to define a new and better future, especially for kids”. Chalmers says his values-based capitalism is predicated on partnership between the public and private sectors rather than antagonism, and requires a renovation of institutions and regulatory frameworks so that capital can be deployed both for private profit and “public value in the for-purpose economy”. The treasurer says the private sector remains key and central to achieving sustainable growth. Chalmers detects “a genuine appetite among so many forward-looking businesspeople and investors for something more aligned with their values, and our national goals”. In an era where public investment is constrained by resurgent inflation and high debt, Chalmers says the government intends to pursue co-investment models in more areas of the economy, having already launched initiatives deploying Australia’s reserve of superannuation savings to expand the pool of affordable housing, and accelerate the rollout of clean energy. Chalmers says he wants to expand the opportunity for “impact investing” across the social purpose economy – meaning the aged care, education and disability sectors. In addition to pursuing social policy objectives, Chalmers says the government will press ahead with overhauling existing finance architecture, creating a “new taxonomy” to help investors “align their choices” with the government’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. This new regime, Chalmers says, will help clean energy businesses gain enough finance to grow, while helping regulators “stamp out greenwashing”. He says the planned overhaul will apply initially to climate related investments, but could be extended in time to boost Australia’s biodiversity goals. The treasurer told Guardian Australia’s podcast addressing entrenched disadvantage was “a decade long passion” grounded in growing up in Logan – an outer urban area with pockets of socioeconomic disadvantage and the area he represents as a federal parliamentarian. Chalmers said the best way to “shift the needle” was to “find out where those challenges are most acute”. “I have always thought if I get a crack at a job like the one I have now, and I know Amanda [Rishworth] and others think the same way … the best way to shift the needle on entrenched disadvantage is to go where it is most prevalent,” the treasurer said. “There’s a lot of great work going on around the community, in the philanthropic sector and in other places. We want to show some leadership here if we can … [and] this is something I care deeply about. “You think about an unemployment rate of 3.5% – there are still people who are not accessing the opportunity of an economy that is creating the fastest jobs growth for the first six months of the Albanese government of any government on record.” Asked whether keeping the Morrison government’s stage three tax cuts was consistent with his aspiration for values based capitalism, given the package makes Australia’s tax system less progressive, Chalmers said the May budget would align with Labor values. “I think what matters is what we do right across the budget”. He said looming energy price relief would be targeted to Australians on fixed payments and low incomes. “That’s a demonstration of our values,” he said.",Australian politics; Australia news; Jim Chalmers; Australian economy; Inequality,Australia news

Chalmers made the observation on Wednesday while leading a round of consultation with the investment community about a new framework for disclosing climate-related risk. The treasurer participated in a round table convened by the Australian arm of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment initiative. In his new essay published by the Monthly on Monday, the treasurer signalled he wanted to expand the opportunity for “impact investing” while pressing ahead with regulatory reforms, including a “new taxonomy” to help investors “align their choices” with the government’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The treasurer said a renovation of institutions and regulatory frameworks was essential to allow capital to be deployed for private profit and “public value in the for-purpose economy”. He advocated a form of “values-based capitalism” predicated on partnership between the public and private sectors rather than antagonism. Chalmers said in the essay the private sector was “key and central to sustainable growth, and there’s a genuine appetite among so many forward-looking businesspeople and investors for something more aligned with their values and our national goals”. While Chalmers’ views are not hostile to the fundamentals of capitalism and align with mainstream analysis by regulators and sections of the business community, the essay has triggered a barrage of hostile commentary in Australia’s two national newspapers, the Australian and the Australian Financial Review. Chalmers addressed the controversy during Wednesday’s meeting with investors. He noted: “The investors represented here, and the broader investment and business community, don’t just support values-based capitalism – you’ve driven it. “This is not some leftwing fringe idea. It’s about better designed and better informed markets and more cooperation between investors and governments to modernise our economy and deepen and broaden our industrial base, powered by cleaner and cheaper energy. “Your enthusiasm and determination to drive Australia towards an appropriately ambitious sustainable finance agenda is one important example of this but not the only one.” Chalmers said the reforms the government was pursuing in climate-related risk disclosure and financial market transparency aligned with what investors and lenders had been championing for “years”. He said the reforms were intended to provide guardrails and policy stability to ensure markets were well informed and capital could be unlocked for productive investments. Chalmers noted while a “minority” of market participants were intent on clinging to “some sort of outdated ideology”, the government would pursue “a forward-looking, internationally aligned, sustainable finance agenda born out of economic opportunity and contemporary necessity”. Appearing separately at the National Press Club, Labor frontbencher Tony Burke was asked by a reporter whether he could define values-based capitalism “in your own words”. Burke said the arguments Chalmers had made in the new essay were consistent with the values “in the mission statements of major companies”, including members of the Business Council of Australia. Burke said there had been a “rush” in commentary to castigate the treasurer’s analysis, but he advised some of the critics to “look at what a whole lot of major companies put in black and white as the principles that they espouse as mattering”. “It’s a lot more than bottom line and for government to be backing those concepts is right and proper and I’m really glad that Jim’s written the essay.”",Australian economy; Australian politics; Australia news; Jim Chalmers; Business,Business
2023-02-05T05:46:36Z,Jim Chalmers says it’s absurd to expect him to copy Paul Keating as critics lash values-based capitalism essay,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/05/jim-chalmers-says-its-absurd-to-expect-him-to-copy-paul-keating-as-critics-lash-values-based-capitalism-essay,"Jim Chalmers has declared it is “absurd” to think the Albanese government in 2023 will be a photocopy of the Hawke and Keating governments in the wake of a sustained backlash against his new essay championing values-based capitalism. The treasurer says the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his summer think piece, published by the Monthly last month, is out of step with sentiment in the investor community and also reveals a disconnect between some opinion leaders in Australia and cutting-edge economic policy analysis overseas. Chalmers used a speech to a Labor-aligned thinktank on Sunday to outline his policy agenda for the opening of the new parliamentary year, confirming he would release a tax expenditure statement later in the month, a review of the Reserve Bank of Australia in March, and an intergenerational report and a wellbeing framework later in the year. With parliament to sit on Monday in the first session after the summer recess, Chalmers said he was pursuing “important steps” on sustainable finance, a “new focus” for the Productivity Commission, work on regulating crypto and payments, while pursuing a housing accord with the housing minister, Julie Collins. He said high inflation would be the government’s main economic focus, and his priorities in the May budget would be providing cost-of-living relief, growing the economy in a more inclusive and more sustainable way, and repairing the budget to enable more generous social policy spending, including on Medicare and aged care.

The treasurer signalled in the 6,000-word piece he wanted to expand the opportunity for “impact investing” while pressing ahead with regulatory reforms, including a “new taxonomy” to help investors “align their choices” with the government’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. On Sunday, Chalmers characterised the backlash on the opinion pages of national newspapers as, largely, “hyperventilating from the usual suspects – some with such intensity it seemed they might spontaneously combust” – although he joked the attention was likely better than “being ignored”. During a question and answer session on Sunday at the Chifley Research Centre conference, the treasurer said “there’s a contrast between some of that coverage and what you pick up in investor circles”. “People get into habits. I think people get into a habit of what their views are, and some habits were formed some time ago. That is not the case in the investor community and the international community, so I think there is a bit of a disconnect there.” Some of the criticism portrayed Chalmers’s support for values-based capitalism as a departure from Labor’s policy approach in the 1980s and 1990s. But the treasurer said the Albanese government would not be a facsimile of past Labor governments because the current government had to rise to meet contemporary challenges rather than mimic the shibboleths of the past. “My view about the changes of the last 40 years is there is much to commend, particularly in the Australian context, particularly when it comes to the Hawke-Keating legacy,” Chalmers said on Sunday. “But our job now is to make our own way in the 2020s, in this defining decade.” He said the “same things that worked for Paul in 1983 are not going to be the same things I reach for in 2023”. Chalmers said people expecting he would be a carbon copy of Keating as treasurer was “as absurd as someone saying to Paul when he fronted up to the Treasury for the first time 40 years ago and saying what we need to do is a photocopy of Ben Chifley’s policies as treasurer 40 years earlier. “You can believe in markets, you can believe in the important role of the private sector as I do … but what we need to do is a much better job of working out how do we better design and define and inform our markets so that we get the right kind of economic outcomes but also, ideally, outcomes that align with our values and our society.”",Jim Chalmers; Australia news; Australian politics; Australian economy; Labor party,Australia news
2022-11-26T07:00:20Z,Rich nations have promised to pay for the climate crisis – but will they? |  Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/26/rich-nations-climate-crisis-cop28-gordon-brown,"On Sunday, loud cheers from Sharm el-Sheikh greeted the announcement of a new initiative – the global loss and damage fund – to right historical wrongs by compensating climate-hit developing countries. This breakthrough brought back memories of another, the £100bn a year agreed at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit to help poor countries mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. That money has never fully materialised. If our 13 years’ experience of the £100bn fund that never was is anything to go by, eulogies of praise will soon turn into allegations of betrayal. The president of next year’s Cop28 will have to answer for yet another fund without funders. Far from the loss and damage fund narrowing the credibility gap on climate action, it is likely to bridge nothing if money fails to flow from rich to poor. The last decade has been a history of promises made and broken. Before Covid, the cost of financing the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was $2.5tn a year. Now, post-Covid, and with the price of fighting floods, firestorms and droughts – and the debt burden of low-income countries – dramatically escalating, it is $4tn annually. Set against an official development assistance (ODA) budget of only $179bn a year and $130bn on offer mainly in multilateral loans, the SDGs represent yet another unanimous but unfunded pledge of the international community. To make matters worse, the British development aid budget has now been cut from 0.7% of our national income to 0.5% for years ahead, and already our overall contribution to meeting all our climate and development targets is down from the promised £16bn to just £11.5bn. But there is a way forward if we are to meet our goals. About $2tn (£1.75tn) will be needed each year by 2030 to help developing countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions. This could be paid for, if necessary, by raising global taxes like the airline levies pioneered by France and the UK. As the pathbreaking Bridgetown declaration, inspired by the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, recommends, $100bn of special drawing rights (the international money issued by the IMF) should immediately be redistributed from rich to poor countries, with half going to finance green projects. President Macron’s June summit on climate finance should cancel the unpayable debt of low-income countries in return for those countries taking action on the climate. For those who can pay, debt repayments should be varied in the event of climate disasters. Public funds will never, as Bridgetown recognises, be enough, so it is vital that every pound, dollar and euro of aid is used to generate other sources of support. Mobilising private finance was the centrepiece of a seminal 2015 report from the IMF and the development banks. Governments, it proposed, should put in place the right incentives to encourage private finance to invest in climate breakdown and development. Indeed, the SDGs’ funding needs could be met if we mobilised just 1% each year of the $400tn financial assets held by banks, institutional investors and fund managers. Yet despite billions in pledges, good intentions and a flood of press releases publicising socially responsible environment, social and government projects, too little private investment is yet in play, leading to allegations of greenwashing. Pioneered by Ronald Cohen, impact investing, where corporate outlays are measured not only in risk and reward but in socially beneficial results, has the potential to fund clean energy, renewables and mitigation and adaptation. But this will almost certainly require legislation for impact-weighted accounting, so that alongside profit and loss, companies itemise in monetary terms the real-time social and environmental benefits of their activities. But all this will take time, and climate finance is needed urgently. It should be kickstarted immediately by transforming the World Bank into a global public goods bank. The international development association is the arm of the bank dedicated to the lowest-income countries. By borrowing on the strength of repaid loans, it can unlock more than $100bn in additional capital. Merging this with the bank’s facility that aids middle-income countries could then quadruple the bank’s capital base. Even more funds could be generated through the innovative use of guarantees offered to the regional development banks by the richest countries, and the Asian Development Bank is already planning to fund climate projects securing guarantees from European governments. If deployed across all multilateral banks, an initial $10bn in grants, some raised from global philanthropists, matched with $60bn of guarantees, could be used to raise a total of $270bn to support the transition to net zero, and, overall, our regional and international institutions could soon be investing not just billions but a trillion dollars each year. And funds could be guaranteed on a sustained basis if the world’s richest countries agreed to share the burden fairly, based on their capacity to pay. While this is a proven model, used in 1966 in an attempt to eliminate smallpox, today only $7bn of UN financing (for peacekeeping) and just $1bn of health financing (to pay 25% of the current World Health Organization budget) is currently raised through a burden-sharing formula. All the rest comes through passing around a begging bowl. A world addressing an existential challenge should not have to rely on charity. An action plan for Cop28 that requires donors to contribute to climate finance based on their capacity to pay – and, in the case of loss and damage, based on historic liability for greenhouse gas emissions – should be the starting point for the next round of climate finance. Adequately funding our global goals for the first time would be something to really cheer about. We have the means and the knowhow. What we now need is the political will.

2022-02-20T16:30:08Z,From human rights to recycling bins: how can you define ‘ethical investing’?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/from-human-rights-to-recycling-bins-how-can-you-define-ethical-investing,"Companies are facing increasing consumer and shareholder pressure to ensure the investments they make are ethical. But how do they define what’s ethical? Broadly, ethical investment is on the rise. According to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA), about $1tn of the $2.24tn in managed funds is classified as responsible. That’s not just because Australians are becoming more aware of the impact their investments can have, but also because responsible or ethical investment is really starting to pay. Sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially conscious businesses are often making essential contributions to our future. Through superannuation, banking and shares, people are actively putting their funds into such ventures. Unfortunately, there’s no uniform indication of what constitutes “ethical”. There’s also no regulation to clarify what ethical investing is as a basic standard. So you need to navigate the marketing. Ethical screening is generally conducted by fund managers and financial advisers. So, for example, in the case of an ethical superannuation fund, the fund’s managers will establish their ethical expectations and screen prospective companies based on this. Similarly, an ethical financial adviser will have a broad view of what they deem ethical, while also taking their clients’ specific needs into account. If you are investing independently, it will be up to you to decide what’s non-negotiable and what’s acceptable. To give you an idea of how the big superannuation funds and ethical investment firms decide what’s ethical and what’s not, here’s a list of the ways their investments might be screened. It’s still not foolproof, but it’s a start. Negative screening The negative screening process involves putting companies through assessments to find out if they’re invested in things that people broadly deem unethical. If they produce an addictive product or service (tobacco, gambling), they’re unlikely to get over the ethical hurdle. Likewise, if they engage in poor labour practices, they can be struck off the list of potential investment. Negative screening is a good place to start when deciding what you will and won’t invest in. If you are staunchly opposed to tobacco, obviously you won’t want your investment portfolio to include a company that makes cigarettes. Positive or ‘best-in-class’ screening This involves seeking out companies that have good social and ethical values, such as a zero-carbon-emissions policy, a gender-diverse board and exemplary treatment of staff in the production of goods and services. In essence, they turn a profit by doing the right thing. Ideally, they do everything right, but depending on who’s screening, they might only need to meet one or a handful of items in the criteria to make the cut. Companies that perform well in a positive screening process often make a tangible difference to environmental or social outcomes. And, in a perfect world, they’re a good investment too. This might include sectors such as healthcare, education and renewable energy. All super funds, managed funds and exchange-traded fund managers will do a form of screening, but the screens vary and therefore you may also need to apply your own ethical lens to see if it’s a good fit. Minimum standards or ‘norms-based’ screening This approach uses the minimum standard of company, government or international standards. The minimum standards depend on which filter they’re put through. So, for example, they may be subject to assessment based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. These principles are based, in part, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles cover topics such as: • Human rights (non-compliance in human rights abuses) • Labour (recognition of the right to collective bargaining and elimination of compulsory labour and child labour; elimination of discrimination) • The environment (precautionary approaches to environmental concerns, environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies) • Anti-corruption Depending on the fund, or financial product, specific screens will be applied. For example, Verve Superannuation applies a specific gender equality screening. This might be important to you. Alternatively, if you seek vegan and animal-friendly investments, you’d be looking for a specific screen layer. Ethics are personal, and therefore no one broad screen is likely to fit your ethical goals. Sustainability investing This is a specific environmental approach, and it means actively seeking out funds or investment opportunities in clean-water programs, renewable energy, infrastructure, recycling, waste management and more. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing ESG covers environmental, social and governance screening principles. If this is the screen you’re using, you might need to dig a bit to see just how good a company’s governance is. That can mean a fair amount of time and effort on your part: reading company reports, understanding the financial situation and continuing to keep track of the company’s activity once you’ve invested. Because ESG covers these sweeping, general areas, it makes it possible for businesses to claim they’re meeting the ESG criteria when, in fact, it’s a regular business where people are paid the nominated award wages and there’s a recycling bin next to the printer. Perhaps they report on sustainability during their annual general meeting, but potentially there’s little real change being driven. That’s not to say there aren’t companies with a great commitment to ESG, but you need to be comfortable with where they sit on what is a massive spectrum. Impact investing If you choose impact investing as a key screen, you’re ultimately looking to see physical results from your investment. That might come in the form of improved transport and infrastructure, schools or hospitals. Equally, the impact might be improved social outcomes locally or internationally. Either way, you’ll seek to get a return on investment while hopefully being able to see an actual result. If you’re unsure where to start, an ethical financial adviser could help you establish a strategy. The cost of personal advice can be prohibitive, which means you may have to do your own research. The first step might be to call your superannuation fund and find out where your money is invested. If they can’t tell you, look for funds that can provide more transparency, so you can consider the contents of the portfolios and how they align with your values.

The star was Tina Turner. “As the American pop legend belted out Simply the Best,” write authors Simon Clark and Will Louch, “guests sipped vintage champagne served from an ice bar that was melting slowly into the Arabian sand on the beach, fire dancers performed and cigar rollers flown in from Cuba handed out their aromatic wares.” The host of the party was Arif Naqvi, founder of Abraaj, a private equity fund that managed nearly $14bn and had stakes in a hundred companies. Its investors were treated to oratory from Bill Clinton, the former US president, and dinner with Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon. Arif’s promise to give capitalism a conscience seduced western governments and billionaire Bill Gates. But it was all a lie, a fairy tale. In their gripping new book, The Key Man, British journalists Clark and Louch tell how Arif helped himself to the private equity group’s money, pocketing $780m, half of which is still missing. The account raises questions over whether “impact investing” and “stakeholder capitalism” are less about poverty alleviation for the world than guilt alleviation for the Davos elite. “Arif was very early on in presenting himself as an impact investor,” says Clark, 45, via Zoom from Britain. “Impact investments emerged after the global financial crisis as a movement. You’ve got capitalists who are saying that they can invest profitably and at the same time they can address social issues like ending poverty or fixing climate, and that was what makes the Abraaj story really stand out from other financial crime stories. “Bernie Madoff was saying to investors, give me your money, I’ll give it back to you and more because I’m going to invest profitably, and the ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ was doing the same thing. Abraaj went a step beyond that, saying to investors, give me your money, I will make you profits and, at the same time, we will end poverty in the developing world. In order to do that, he wasn’t just making an investment pitch. He was making a pitch in terms of how he could provide public goods: he could do something for the common good of the world.” The Key Man’s opening chapter, The Boy from Karachi, begins with the young Arif at home in Pakistan, spellbound by watching the 1969 moon landing and deciding that the whole world is his stage. He was relatively well off, attending Karachi Grammar School, but did not belong to the wealthiest echelon. He excelled and went on to study at the London School of Economics, then worked for companies such as Arthur Andersen and American Express. Eventually he moved to the financial trading hub of Dubai and founded Abraaj in 2002. With hustle, showmanship and ostentatious philanthropy, along with a willingness to work in countries seen as risky due to corruption, this “silver-haired man of soft bearish charm” became a poster boy for stakeholder capitalism. His associates included Gates, Prince Charles and then secretary of state John Kerry. He sat on boards at the United Nations and Interpol. He was the subject of glowing profiles in the New York Times and Forbes magazine. And he pitched himself to western governments which, stung by the financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement, were hungry for ways to show they cared. Louch, 30, recalls: “Barack Obama travelled to Cairo and made an amazing speech about healing the US’s relationship with the Muslim world. A key part of his pitch was to use entrepreneurship and American style capitalism to help end or tackle the issues with unemployment that maybe were linked to terrorism there. “Arif heard this speech and went to Washington. He took on board what the US government was looking for and then basically presented himself as being someone that could help administer the Obama administration’s vision for resolving a lot of the social issues there by investing in businesses, by creating jobs, by growing the economy. “I think in total the US government pledged over $500m to Arif’s firm for which he – and this is something that’s not necessarily always mentioned in the grand speeches that Arif was giving – would earn significant management fees for investing government money in the region.” Arif built numerous contacts in Washington amid discussions about a Marshall Plan for the Middle East for which he would manage the funds. Clark adds: “So there was this convergence of public and private policy. It was part of a global trend, globalisation, and Arif was bang in the middle of that. “By going to Davos every year and networking there in Washington and London and elsewhere, he built this incredible network and, because of where he comes from and his ability, he was seen as a person who could be the key man in terms of delivering profits and policy outcomes for western investors and governments.” The authors chronicle how Arif flew on a Gulfstream jet with a personalised tail number, M-ABRJ, sailed on yachts and compared himself to the mythical adventurer Sinbad. He owned a sprawling estate in Oxfordshire, fixed up the local cricket pavilion at great expense and lavished more than $348,000 on a dinner at Davos attended by then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif. But something did not add up. Abraaj was spending more than it earned and secretly moving money around to plug holes in its balance sheet. Clark explains: “If you raise a one billion dollar health care fund for building clinics and hospitals in Africa and South Asia, as Abraaj did, then you have to just use that one billion dollars for building and buying hospitals. “But Abraaj would call money from investors – including Bill Gates who put $100m into this fund and gave confidence to others to put money in as well – and say we’re going to buy or build a hospital in Nairobi or Karachi or Lahore and the money would be sent by the investors. Then Abraaj would siphon it out of the fund and put it into a central pot where they were mixing all of their monies together and spend it on whatever their priority was like salaries, or loans coming due, or the previous investment because they used their money for something else so to keep them quiet let’s use this money instead, which is a Ponzi-like situation. “That’s where they really came undone and because their finances were not disclosed to the public and were not being properly disclosed to investors, they were able to hide this financially dire situation for years, until it came unstuck at the end of 2017.” Finally, in late 2017, Andrew Farnum, an executive with the Gates Foundation, raised the alarm and demanded to see bank records, wondering why the money was not being invested in hospitals as promised. After a tipoff from a whistleblower, Clark and Louch, reporters for the Wall Street Journal based in London, broke the story that investors were investigating Abraaj for mismanaging their money in early 2018. The firm collapsed with $385m unaccounted for. Arif was arrested at Heathrow airport, charged by the US government with fraud and money laundering. He is currently out on $19m bail, living in South Kensington, wearing an ankle tag and awaiting extradition. He denies wrongdoing. But his downfall raises broader questions about stakeholder capitalism and whether it can truly be a tool to combat poverty or the climate crisis – or is merely another smokescreen for the super-rich to pursue even more wealth. Louch insists: “I think the message absolutely isn’t that stakeholder capitalism is a myth. The book shows, and other examples in the financial system today show, that it can be a good thing tackling some of the biggest issues that we have today. “One of the takeaways from this book is that a lot of very wealthy men – largely men – meeting in Davos once a year are probably not alone going to be the people that have the answers to this problem. A more inclusive conversation involving other members of society, not just people that have lots of money and power and influence, is probably the way that stakeholder capitalism would actually maybe ever work.” Clark concludes: “It’s great that capitalists say they want to help make the world a better place, but citizens and investors need to be able to see exactly how they’re going about that so that everyone can verify whether or not they are doing what they say. There is an absolute need for a more inclusive conversation about the global economy in general and about poverty alleviation in particular. “It should become as unacceptable for a group of wealthy people to talk about poverty alleviation as it is for a group of men to talk about gender equality. In order to get a reality check and ground this conversation about impact, there is a need for the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of impact investing to be included in the discussion about how, where and when to deploy capital to produce these outcomes. Otherwise, it’s likely to end up at best as a PR stunt and at worst as a fraud.” The Key Man is out now",Books; US news; Culture; Business,Books
2021-02-22T17:50:58Z,AllianzGI warns it may vote down big payouts if firms have cut jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/allianz-warns-it-may-vote-down-big-payouts-if-companies-have-cut-jobs,"Companies that are handing generous pay packages to executives while taking government aid, reducing dividends or cutting jobs during the pandemic could face a shareholder backlash, according to a Germany-based asset manager. Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI), which manages €582bn (£503bn) worth of assets, said it could use its shareholder powers to vote against pay awards during the upcoming annual shareholder meeting season. It said it would scrutinise “generous pay proposals on a case-by case-basis whenever companies received substantial direct state aid, substantial layoffs were recorded or dividend cuts happened … as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The policy echoes warnings by the Investment Association, an industry body that said last April that companies that received government Covid support should cut executive pay and consider clawing back bonuses from bosses. Many of the UK’s largest companies have tapped emergency support schemes including business rates relief and government-backed Covid loans during the pandemic. AllianzGI said it would not penalise companies for using government furlough schemes, which have helped cover employee wages during the crisis. It will also give companies a pass if they were forced to cut or cancel dividends by regulators, saving the UK’s largest banks from a potential backlash. AllianzGI’s global head of sustainable and impact investing, Matt Christensen, said: “The Covid crisis marked a turning point for society and businesses alike; however, companies are affected in different ways. Some received state aid and their business will continue to be affected negatively over the longer term. In these cases AllianzGI expects boards to deal responsibly with taxpayers’ money and we do not see scope for substantial payout to management, if any. “Other companies decided to forego dividends to save capital. Again, Allianz Global Investors expects boards to act responsibly and align shareholder experience with that of management.’” AllianzGI revealed on Monday that it rejected 49% of pay votes put forward for shareholder approval last year, even before its new policy was introduced. The main reason for voting against remuneration plans was that corporate payouts were not tied to “robust and challenging” targets, and that companies were not transparent enough about the criteria. In the UK, AllianzGI voted against 12% of pay proposals last year, down from 20% in 2019. It was among the 30% of shareholders who voted against Ocado’s pay report last May, over a pay rise and £88m bonus for the online grocer’s directors. The asset manager was also among the shareholders representing just over 67% of the stock at the retailer’s annual meeting who failed to back the remuneration report in June, when the company made a late change to its pay plan and handed an additional £1.6m to its outgoing chief executive, Dave Lewis, and £900,000 to its finance director, Alan Stewart.",Executive pay and bonuses; Business; Corporate governance,Business
2020-10-13T12:52:23Z,Mark Carney says banks should link executive pay to Paris climate goals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/13/mark-carney-says-banks-should-link-executive-pay-to-paris-climate-goals,"Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said banks should link executive pay to climate risk management, as part of efforts to align the finance industry with Paris climate goals. Speaking at the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative roundtable on Tuesday, the former central bank boss said lenders should – at the very least – be transparent over whether or not pay is being tied to climate targets. He said banks must “have some interim objectives and targets that are disclosed. Ideally a governance process that’s clear in terms of … specific board-level governance and responsibility around managing climate risks and opportunities. Ideally, [there should be] some compensation link to that as well, or at least disclosure about whether it is there or not.” While a number of major banks have announced net-zero climate pledges in recent months, few have made explicit commitments about how executive remuneration might play a part in keeping lenders accountable. HSBC and Wall Street giant JP Morgan both revealed climate pledges last week. HSBC committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, linked to the loans and services it provides to clients. It came days after JP Morgan made similar pledges, saying it would push clients towards aligning with the Paris agreement, which is meant to limit temperature rises to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Barclays announced plans to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050 earlier this year and Lloyds committed to halving the amount of carbon emissions it finances through personal and business loans by 2030. Neither HSBC nor Lloyds were immediately able to confirm whether executive pay was linked to their climate targets when contacted by the Guardian on Tuesday. JP Morgan said the bank would be announcing its methodology in the spring, and that it has not ruled out linking pay to climate pledges. NatWest Group confirmed that decisions on pay for its top executives – including chief executive Alison Rose – do take climate targets into consideration. The bank has pledged to fully phase out coal financing by 2030 and is aiming to “at least halve” the climate impact of its lending activity by the end of the decade. Barclays’ annual report shows that reducing global carbon emission is one of 16 criteria that helps determine around 20% of executive bonus pay. However, Johan Frijns, director of BankTrack – an organisation that monitors the financial sector – said executive pay was just one way that bankers should be encouraged to avoid a climate catastrophe. “It would be a severe mistake to try to steer bank decision-making on reducing their climate impact solely through getting the right financial incentives or disincentives in place for individual bankers. “If internal motivation to stop financing climate destruction were that shallow we wouldn’t stand a chance. That said, tying executive pay to, say, delivering a credible phase-out plan from the fossil fuel industry, or achieving a steep decline in financed emissions, may well knock a few heads together,” Frijns said. Carney is himself a former Goldman Sachs banker, having worked at the Wall Street firm for 13 years before moving into central banking, first as deputy and then governor of the Bank of Canada, before taking the top job at the Bank of England in 2013. He left in March just before the Covid-19 crisis hit the UK. Carney was one of the world’s best-paid central bankers with remuneration of £882,885 including pension benefits and a housing allowance from the Bank of England during the last financial year. He recently joined Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management as vice-chair and global head of environmental, social and corporate governance and impact investing.",Executive pay and bonuses; Climate finance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Environment; Mark Carney; Corporate governance; Banking; Financial sector; Business; UK news; United Nations; Paris climate agreement; COP 21: Paris climate change conference 2015; Cop26; World news; Fossil fuel divestment,Business
2020-08-26T19:06:03Z,Davos has become a schmooze-fest for sponsors and celebrities,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/aug/26/davos-has-become-a-schmooze-fest-for-sponsors-and-celebrities,"It would be wrong to say the Davos organisers completely missed the threat of a global pandemic. At the World Economic Forum’s event in January 2019 attendees could have read a 20-page report, in collaboration with the Harvard Global Health Institute, that now reads excellently. It concluded: “Although rarely emphasised in businesses’ risk considerations, recent work on pandemics quantifies how massive the potential economic losses from infectious disease outbreaks can be and how they can extend far beyond the original outbreak’s footprint”. Very good, but did any of the corporate chiefs at Davos that year do anything in response? One suspects 99% didn’t read the document. Davos, for all the worthy studies that may happen behind the scenes, has primarily become a schmooze-fest. It is a networking and sponsorship event in which politicians and business leaders move from think-ins on global inequality to champagne receptions (on other people’s tabs, naturally) without skipping a beat. Even the “business leaders” description is too generous: the financial services industry, and its interests, is vastly over-represented. Coronavirus has forced the cancellation of next January’s event but, rather than rethinking its entire approach, the WEF seems determined to get the same show on the road as soon as possible. They’ll do it in the summer instead. A period of reflection would be better. A plush ski resort is entirely the wrong place for this event. And, to maintain any credibility, the WEF has to stop counting success in terms of how many sponsors and celebrities it can attract. As the prescient pandemic report showed, the WEF is capable of highlighting risks that escape day-to-day attention. Concentrate on that stuff. Use this opportunity to ditch the circus. New Look’s proposal could have landlords huffing and puffing Rents are falling fast in retail-land but here’s a proposal that suggests the bottom remains a long way off. New Look would like to rip up its conventional fixed-term leases on 402 stores and move to turnover-based rents instead. The landlords would get between 2% and 12% of a store’s revenue for three years, which, at the bottom end of the range, ain’t much. The effect would be a hefty cut in New Look’s rental bill. For its other 68 stores, the chain would prefer to pay no rent at all, thanks very much. If New Look’s offer-cum-demand, which is as aggressive as any from a retailer of its size, sounds like one landlords would refuse instantly, think again. The company stands a fair chance of winning the 75% approval it needs from creditors. That is because New Look isn’t merely gambling that its landlords don’t have better options; it’s run the numbers. The turnover ratios have been calculated, on a store-by-store basis, to reflect rents that a new tenant might be able to negotiate in today’s battered market. Thus New Look doesn’t fear being kicked out of many premises and is happy to give landlords greater powers to try their luck. The logic even applies with the proposed zero-rent premises: the landlord would risk having to pay business rates on an empty shop. From the point of view of the landlords, it will feel terribly unfair. New Look signed its leases willingly and half its problems stem from the excess debt that it has been carrying since 2005, a legacy of private equity ownership. On the borrowing front, New Look’s bondholders are formally writing off £440m, but that’s little consolation for the property owners. The landlords will huff and puff and may yet extract a few concessions. Ultimately, though, one doubts they’ll tip New Look into administration, threatening 11,000 jobs. The new reality is that flexible turnover-based rents can be a useful compromise in a crisis. What the landlords should really fear is the calls for lower rents from stronger retailers than New Look. Those demands are arriving already, and more will follow. The retail property market is only moving in one direction. Carney’s venture into responsible investing is a surprise Mark Carney’s first post-Bank of England move is a surprise. The former governor is joining asset manager Brookfield to launch an “impact investing” fund. What’s Brookfield? Well, the Toronto-based firm has its roots in property but these days its empire spans $550bn of assets of various types. Socially-aware investing, however, is a relatively new adventure for Brookfield. It has some renewable energy assets, but one can think of more obvious places for Carney to pursue his interest in responsible investing, “one of the greatest financial opportunities of our lifetime,” as he puts it. One hopes he is there to do more than sprinkle a little marketing stardust.",Davos; Mark Carney; New Look; Retail industry; Business,Business
2019-04-10T17:07:41Z,How women can invest more ethically | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/10/how-women-can-invest-more-ethically,"Your article on why women need to start investing to exercise more control over their futures (Why finance is a feminist issue, G2, 9 April) contains much sound advice. However, it neglects an important consideration. If, as Emilie Bellet explains, women are “looking more at where we want to be in 10, 20 or 30 years’ time”, then we also need to think hard about the kind of future our money is going to support. Many women – and men – would be horrified to think that the price for their own security is increased uncertainty and instability across the world, as many funds continue to rely heavily on the fossil fuel and extractive industries. Even so-called ethical funds are often only undertaking basic negative screening, for example ruling out pornography, weapons, tobacco and gambling, but with very little to say on climate risk. The real bottom line is that there is no money to be made on a dead planet. Happily, this can be a win-win situation. Increasingly, fund managers are recognising the risk of the “carbon bubble” and are starting to shift their own funds. And evidence is growing that over the long term, sustainable investments can outperform the broken business-as-usual market. But this shift won’t happen without ongoing consumer pressure on the financial sector. An influx of motivated women into this space presents an excellent opportunity. At Friends of the Earth we have been campaigning for fossil fuel divestment and corporate accountability for many years. Through our innovation work we are currently piloting a new peer-led programme for women who want to take control of their finances, but in a way that supports their vision for a safe and liveable planet.

2020-04-09T07:00:39Z,Cash reward: how your small loan can make a big difference,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/nonprofit-microfinancing-poverty-good-news-loans,"When Typhoon Haiyan laid waste the central Philippines in 2013, Bernadeth Cabusog was one of the many people whose lives were turned upside down. Her smallholding was wrecked and with it, her family’s main means of provision. “It was the hardest time of our lives,” she recalls. “All our vegetables were destroyed. We really needed some help.” Cabusog took the advice of a neighbour in her village in rural Cebu province and approached Lamac, a local agricultural co-operative. Lamac lent her around $450 to replant her crops of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes, allowing her to defer half of its repayment until she was back on her feet again. “I was just so thankful that they were there to help me. I felt like God had a purpose for me after all,” she says. Seven years later, Cabusog has just repaid her fifth loan of $1,900, which went towards fertiliser and other farm equipment, to Lamac. She sells her produce through the co-operative and employs two people. Some of the money will help fund the wages of more workers she plans to hire this year. While her loan was administered by Lamac, the funds came from Lendwithcare, one of several nonprofit microfinance sites where small investors can help entrepreneurs in developing countries by crowdfunding loans. Millions of people in developing countries depend on microloans to raise the funds to grow a business or just stay afloat in hard times. And thanks to digital platforms, smartphones and free-moving global capital, growing numbers of people in the rich world are using their money to lift others out of poverty. In the decade or so they have been around, nonprofit microlenders have become big business. Kiva, the Silicon Valley-based market leader, has around $158m (£120m) invested by 639,000 lenders to more than 400,000 borrowers, according to its 2018 figures. More modestly but no less impressively, Lendwithcare has lent £27m in total to 127,000 borrowers. Its recent funding targets include a baker in Ecuador looking to replace a mixer, an embroiderer in Pakistan seeking to stock up on cloth, and a taxi rider in Rwanda hoping to purchase a new moped – the kind of small individual ventures that can make a big difference in poor communities. Critically with Kiva and Lendwithcare investors cannot make a profit – so once funding targets are met, the sites can forward on the microloan interest-free. When (and occasionally if) the loan is paid back, lenders are free to withdraw their initial investment – but most end up returning it to a new project. Microfinance was conceived as a solution to world poverty by offering people in developing countries reliable access to loans and other financial products. But, 15 years since the idea caught hold, the question that perpetually dogs the sector is whether it actually works. By some measures, extreme poverty appears to be falling. According to the most recent UN estimates, in 2015 10% of the world’s population lived at or below the World Bank’s extreme poverty line of $1.90 a day – down from 16% in 2010 and 36% in 1990. But how much of this trend can be attributed to the effects of microfinance? The microfinance sector has grown into a financial behemoth, with overall loans in 2018 estimated by the World Bank at $112bn to 120 million borrowers. But Dr Philip Mader, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies who has looked at the sector extensively, says that, while microfinance has created more financial products in developing countries and encouraged generosity from the rich world, there is no clear evidence that microloans do, on average, lift people out of poverty. “There are always going to be exceptional individuals for whom a loan was a single breakthrough factor, but most people just aren’t natural entrepreneurs,” says Mader. “They’re doing this to get by, and at the end of next year, they’re going to be where they were before. Some people are going to be worse off as well. Loans are risky. That’s important to consider.” It’s a point acknowledged by Ajaz Ahmed Khan, the senior microfinance adviser at Care International, Lendwithcare’s umbrella organisation. “I’ve been involved in this sort of world for 30 years, but I’ve never been convinced that any one thing is a panacea,” he says. “Poverty is far too complicated for one simple intervention to remedy everything.” Kiva is the slickest of the microfunding websites, offering a mind-bogglingly glossy catalogue of projects sorted into different categories, countries and attributes, all illustrated with backstories and pictures. It’s clear that this sense of connection between lender and borrower is a big part of the urge to invest. But the reality is often a lot messier – something that may not initially be obvious to the lender. In fact, like Cabusog and Lendwithcare, borrowers and crowdfunding sites connect via local partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) who do the essential work of assessing creditworthiness and administering loans. To pay for that, most MFIs charge interest to borrowers, often at wildly varying rates. Furthermore, many lenders have been surprised to find the money being crowdfunded on Lendwithcare or Kiva is often already in the borrower’s pocket, lent by a local MFI long before the loan target has been met. There are good practical reasons for this, explains Kathy Guis, Kiva’s director of partner investments. “Often borrowers have urgent financial needs, for example, to purchase perishable goods for resale,” she says. “So for entrepreneurs to wait two or three months for Kiva to send that money to the [MFI] partner just wouldn’t actually be useful.” Still, the reality is that in many cases a lender’s individual investment is simply going towards a partner MFI’s general portfolio, rather than directly to the loanee. Both Kiva and Lendwithcare do spell this out in the small print on their sites, Kiva in particular having been accused of not being clear enough about this in the past. It’s just not quite as straightforward as you might first think. In the end, though, does this really matter? Goldie Chow, Kiva’s director of impact, says that a sense of connection is key to the urge to lend. “Kiva is a platform to democratise impact investing,” Chow says. “When you come on the website, it looks very simple, it looks very clean and very easy. But the fact of the matter is that to manage the $150m of loans that we do every year, we have to have really onerous systems and levers and monitoring processes in place.” While the work carried out by local MFIs is generally necessary and cost-consuming, the malpractice of some operators has also cast a shadow over the industry. A recent Guardian investigation into a microfinance programme run in Sierra Leone by Brac, the world’s largest NGO, found its staff were failing to fully explain loans to borrowers, or ensuring they could afford the payments. Separately, a report last year by Licadho, one of Cambodia’s leading human rights organisations, highlighted numerous cases of MFIs preying on borrowers. It detailed widespread reckless lending practices from local credit officers in offering loans to clients who were clearly unable to repay them, and who were then pressured to sell land to clear debt. It also revealed that at least a million Cambodian borrowers had been forced to offer their land or homes as security to MFIs. Kiva and Lendwithcare both say they take stringent measures to avoid exposure to such bad practice. Khan says that Lendwithcare’s MFI partners tend to be NGOs and co-operatives and its due diligence visits typically last seven to 10 days, including full policy and procedure reviews. “Sometimes, despite all the research and country visits, we decide not to proceed,” he says, highlighting recent visits to Tanzania, Guatemala and Egypt as examples. On its website, Kiva says it will not partner with organisations that charge unreasonable interest rates, and that it requires field partners to fully disclose their rates. “Kiva only partners with organisations and microfinance institutions that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved,” it says. If rogue MFIs are often perceived as the problem, would it be possible to do without them? Around 2006, Julia Kurnia had that very thought while working for a small NGO in Senegal, when she saw first-hand how expensive microloans could be for borrowers. “We had started a microfinance bank and hired a loan officer,” she recalls. “He would have to travel to the villages and collect money. That was very expensive relative to the small size of loans. But even though we tried to be as frugal as we could – I was there as a volunteer – we could never get the operating cost below about a third of the value of the loans.” The result was that Kurnia founded Zidisha, a peer-to-peer lending service that cuts out the middleman altogether by utilising cheap mobile phone money transfer services to connect borrower to lender directly. Borrowers pay a 5% fee to Zidisha to cover its operating costs, but that’s it. Since it was founded in 2009, it has lent around $16.7m to more than 380,000 members. Zidisha uses algorithms to assess potential borrowers for default risk and for possible fraud: “That’s the main problem we have to solve as an internet service that doesn’t have people on the ground,” says Kurnia. She admits the absence of an MFI to mediate could result in a higher risk of default, though she says Zidisha offers a guarantee to lenders of up to $1,000. The traditional microlenders think that harnessing big data will be the key to lowering the cost of borrowing in the developing world. Kiva is using blockchain technology in Sierra Leone to create an online ID database so that loan applicants outside the formal banking system can prove their credit history, and it hopes to extend the system to other countries if successful. “From the outside looking in, many people assume there’s minimal economic activity in the unbanked world,” says Kiva’s chief strategy officer, Matthew Davie. “In fact, there’s a very active financial sector. The problem is all the activity in that sector never gives you credit when you move on to formal financial services.” Still, the question remains: does microfinance really achieve the objective of lifting people out of poverty? As with the differing models of loan disbursement, the answer is complicated. “Broadly speaking, I’d agree that it’s hard to prove,” says Khan. He points out that Lendwithcare tries to supplement its loans with a range of other financial services including savings and training, so that the impact is not just focused on loans. Over the past five years, Lendwithcare has tried to measure the impact of its work in collaboration with the University of Portsmouth. It has found that in Pakistan, for example, household income for the low-income families it supports has risen by 30.7% since 2015. The results look encouraging – but even here, Khan says they should be treated with caution as Akhuwat, its MFI partner in Pakistan, charges no interest on its loans in accordance with Islamic practice. “The results in Zimbabwe, where the economic situation is difficult, were very mixed,” he admits. In the end, philanthropic investing in this form is only one in a range of options open to people wanting to help alleviate poverty – and that includes just giving money to needy individuals or to good causes. “There is no one thing that will help everyone living in poverty find a way out,” says Kiva’s Guis. “Cash transfers are right for some people, loans are right for others. Where I find the argument for Kiva’s approach strongest is that we’re tapping into money that is not earmarked for charitable giving.” As Mader points out, people need to consider what they want to achieve. “If people want to give directly to someone, there’s a website called givedirectly.org. If they want to make sure that somebody is working hard to have a chance at poverty reduction and development, but only after having repaid interest to an intermediary lender, then yes, use Kiva. “I don’t want to fault anyone for giving a loan. But I’m fascinated by how well Kiva and others have managed to sell the idea that the best way to do this is by funding individual entrepreneurs via loans, rather than working for broader community-based change.” In the Philippines, Bernadeth Cabusog is already planning for her next loan. She hopes to use it to concrete a track on her land, and to buy a motorcycle which would considerably reduce the time she spends travelling to and from the credit office in town. “Every day I see the difference,” she says. “Before the loans, everything was so hard. Now, we have a comfortable life.” • Graham Snowdon is deputy editor of Guardian Weekly This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

2019-02-28T07:00:44Z,Anand Giridharadas: 'What wealthy people do is rig the discourse',https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/28/anand-giridharadas-interview-winners-take-all,"On the same day that Anand Giridharadas announced that he would be joining Time as an editor at large, I had the opportunity to talk with him about antiracism and America. A political analyst for MSNBC and author of the 2018 bestselling book Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World, Giridharadas assesses the relationship between philanthropy and antiracism in an era of growing wealth among elite changemakers. Our wide-ranging conversation meandered from Malcolm X and Cedric Robinson’s idea of racial capitalism to “ruling-class dance moves”. One of the most important arguments you present in Winners Take All is that the commonsense language we unwittingly or reflexively employ with respect to social transformation often prevents us from expanding the parameters of acceptable debate. And so I am interested to hear a bit more about why you chose to include the term “elite” in the title of your book as opposed to, say, “ruling class” or “plutocrat”? How do these linguistic choices reflect your analysis of the problem? I think there are a lot of different ways to cut the definition of “ruling class”. And depending on where you cut it, the nature of the problem – the nature of the crime – is slightly different. It is absolutely a problem that the top 20-25% of America has done well while the bottom 75-80% rest has not. If you cut it that way – at 20%, for instance – then we’re talking about an upper-middle-class secession from American life brought on by policies like the mortgage tax credit, property tax as the method of funding public schools, and Nimby housing policies. However, this isn’t where I think the heart of the problem is located. Most of the graphs you pick up show a pretty significant spike in inequality and capture when you start getting into the 1% or .01%. And this is where you see people making private, bottle-service public policy – that is, policy that has almost no public benefit other than to make society work well for the wealthy. Claiming tax deductions for private jets when so many people can’t afford daycare is an example of a rigged system. What I was interested in exploring in Winners Take All is the way in which elites at the very top use the conquest of language, of culture and of our common sense to cement their role and social position. On the theme of philanthropy and philanthrocapitalism, you have written that “generosity is not a substitute for justice”. That is, perhaps generosity ought not to be the taken-for-granted barometer of social progress. In the spirit of racial justice, I am reminded that Malcolm X once said: “If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there’s no progress. If you pull it all the way out that’s not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made … They won’t even admit the knife is there.” Can you describe the processes by which social and political power sustains and legitimizes itself through appeals to “generosity”? What I am trying to do is to take on this pervasive societal habit of automatic gratitude and praise for elites who engage in various forms of do-gooding, whether that’s impact investing or social enterprise or philanthropy or any modality that falls within the “doing well by doing good” paradigm of change. This is the kind of change that allows you to stand on someone’s back while saying you’re helping them. My book is a book about moves. It’s a book about ruling-class dance moves, if you will. There are certain dance moves that have been very effective at making us think that members of the ruling class are not the problem that in fact they are. One popular dance move is using generosity to obscure one’s own complicity in injustice. You commit an injustice and then rely on generosity on a much smaller scale to cover it up. This is the most obvious move. This happens often enough that when you see an act of plutocratic generosity you should at a minimum be skeptical. This isn’t the only move, though. Another move is simply altering our collective conversation about what change is. The Stanford sociologists Aaron Horvath and Walter Powell show that these hyper-elites are very successful at changing the conversation. They’re good at making certain approaches to change look bad and making others look better. For example, elites often make charter schools look better than they are or make unions look worse than they are. Or elites might introduce a new concept like “resilience”, a concept that sounds great but that is actually just about adjusting to societal crappiness rather than fixing it. What wealthy people do is rig the discourse. I think philanthropy is a Band-Aid on a bleeding tumor. To be sure, there’s blood, and the Band-Aid helps with that. But the Band-Aid is inadequate to the underlying problem. To stretch the metaphor further: the Band-Aid may give you a false sense of confidence that the problem is being handled. In an age of extraordinary generosity from plutocrats, we are at risk of forgetting that the same class of people are also undermining the greater good every day and on an ongoing basis. The problem with philanthropy is that it depends on and trusts the voluntarism of the people with the most to lose from change to be our changemakers. I don’t think philanthropists are all horrible people. This is not about individual morality. That is hardly the point. This is about whom you trust to play a leadership role in deciding what the common good is, what our policy priorities should be, and how we make the world better. In so many ways, we have outsourced the betterment of our world to people with a vested interest in making sure we don’t make it too, too much better. I’m going to give an example that may sound extreme to some people: what we often do today would be analogous to if we had gone around to plantation owners in Alabama in the 1800s and asked them to lead organizations advancing racial justice. It’s impossible. They can’t be the ones to do it. I recently read that only 7% of philanthropic dollars are awarded to groups and organizations that specifically serve people of color. Does this figure surprise you? Is the solution here to make would-be philanthropists more racially literate or should we rather strive to build an antiracist future that does not accommodate philanthropy? Or maybe the premise of my question is unfair? There are two different answers, and they are in tension with one another. First, I don’t think we should count on the richest and most powerful people in the world – most of whom are white – to play any kind of leadership role in dismantling white supremacy. To the extent that people and organizations put philanthropic dollars to work on issues of racial justice, we need to set a new norm: money should not buy any decision-making power, especially when it comes to racial justice work. Here’s an idea I heard during a recent discussion group I attended: a person who will remain anonymous said that non-profits that depend on philanthropic grants should form a pact, whereby they would all agree to just post the work they do on their websites, along with wire-transfer instructions. That’s it. This changes the game. It basically says: “Hey, we don’t fundraise. We don’t take you on trips. We don’t cater to you. We don’t do PowerPoints in your office. We don’t come in and talk to your relatives and clip the wings of our diagnosis, so that you feel more comfortable. You just see the work you like and you wire us money. We’re not putting your name on anything and you don’t get to shape the initiative.” Others who actually work in the field will be more knowledgable than me on the practicality of such an idea. But if something like this pact were to be done, racial justice organizations could play a leading role in coming up with a strong statement or manifesto declaring the era of fundraising to be over: “You can send us money, but you get zero say.” The second piece of the answer is that we should be solving way fewer of these problems through philanthropic giving in the first place. We should be living in a world in which people can’t make as much money as they do right now and profit to a cruel degree on the labor of poor people, mostly black and brown, and then turn around and be able to throw coin at them. This type of change is only achievable through policy. So when Elizabeth Warren proposes a wealth tax in part to fund universal childcare, her motivation is to achieve broad-based justice for many people without putting the ruling class in a leadership position. And if the ruling class doesn’t like it, they are free to choose any country on earth that offers them a better deal. I am a patriot. I don’t think they’re going to go anywhere. All these billionaires who threaten to take the next plane to Singapore if we tax their 10 millionth dollar at 70% or we take 2% of their wealth in a wealth tax – I think they’re all bluffing and I’m willing to play poker with any one of them. I want to continue to talk about the relationship between capitalism and race. Cedric Robinson, author of Black Marxism, often used the term “racial capitalism”. Robinson’s basic argument was that capitalism sprouted from a certain type of feudal European order that was already infused with what we would now term “racism” or, at the very least, racialism. This basically means that we can’t fully understand capitalism’s contours without a deep understanding of its racist underpinnings. What do you make of this? And can you say more about how “the elite charade of changing the world” is, in part, a race project, or a project that sustains racial hierarchies? One of the things I found dispiriting after the Trump victory was a tribalism of diagnosis. There was a weird dynamic where some people thought his support was all based on economic anxiety. Others rightly pushed back, by saying: “You know, Trump actually won affluent voters.” Those who rightly pushed back emphasized the role racial resentment played. Sometimes to their own detriment, though, this camp cast every Trump voter as an avowed racist. I don’t think this is accurate. What is inarguable is that racism was not a dealbreaker for any Trump voter. The way I see it, the supremacy of race and the supremacy of capital are richly entwined. Today, you have multiple sensations of theft afflicting the American public. One theft – the one I think is genuine and real – is the plutocratic theft. It is absolutely the case that the 1% has stolen the future from the great majority of Americans and has rigged the system. There is a second widespread sensation of theft – the sensation of a demographic theft. It’s a feeling among white people and men – in particular, white men – that their country is being taken from them. Of course, it’s a worry of losing something one never should have had in the first place. It’s not actually a theft. However, the sensation of that theft is real. Too many of us dismissed that and said: “Get over it,” as opposed to saying: “If so many of you are feeling this way, then we actually have a national problem.” Educating others not to blame the wrong people or policies for what they’re feeling is part of the work. Hoping millions of people will get woke on their own time isn’t idealism; it’s a dangerous fantasy whose consequences we are now digging out of.",Race; Inequality; Philanthropy,Opinion
2018-03-15T07:00:16Z,What to do with those divested billions? The only way is ethics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics,"Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years – boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers – ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as “socially responsible investment”, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about £300m a year was considered “socially responsible” investment; today it is, by one estimate £23bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (£60tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors – and the wider public conscience – are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business – cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. “I would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else’s misery,” explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year’s Schroders’ Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. “While profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,” said Jessica Ground, Schroders’ global head of stewardship. “But investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.” UBS’s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don’t want or can’t afford to pay for them. “It’s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you’d like to be treated,” says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing ‘bad’, or actively doing ‘good’. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices – also covering weapons and women’s progress – were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons “impact investing” – where investors actively seek out companies doing good – is a “force to be reckoned with”. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes’s £170,000 increased in value by 26% last year – notably more than conventional investments. “It started driven by values, it’s now definitely [driven] by value,” says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a “no brainer”. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years – reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were bêtes noires of ethical investors – tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced – by regulators, investors and public opinion – to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. “This is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,” says Andy Howard, Schroders’ head of sustainable research. “This is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.” In the meantime, says Hughes: “If I’m investing into a company that’s helping the environment, or helping women, I’m happy with that. That’s all you can ask of anyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

2018-01-13T09:00:01Z,I was Mark Zuckerberg's mentor. Today I would tell him: your users are in peril,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/13/mark-zuckerberg-tech-addiction-investors-speak-up,"I am a tech investor, and Facebook is by far my largest investment. Still, for the past 15 months I have been pushing Facebook to sacrifice near term profits. The reason? I want them to address the harm the platform has caused through addiction and exploitation by bad actors. Government watchdogs barely regulate the technology sector in the United States, so investors like myself have a big role to play. I was once Mark Zuckerberg’s mentor, but I have not been able to speak to him about this. Unfortunately, all the internet platforms are deflecting criticism and leaving their users in peril. Zuckerberg’s announcement on Wednesday that he would be changing the Facebook News Feed to make it promote “meaningful interactions” does little to address the concerns I have with the platform. Thankfully, I am not the only investor demanding Facebook keep users safe. On Monday, two major investors in Apple sent an open letter criticizing the company for not doing enough to protect children from the negative aspects of smartphones and social media. This is a potential game changer. The players are combining two corporate governance strategies in ways that may be harder to resist than traditional strategies. Corporate governance is a murky area. Boards of directors are the first line of corporate governance. They are supposed to act as a check on management, and sometimes they do. More often, boards are handpicked by CEOs and frequently act as a rubber stamp. An example is the Weinstein Companies, where the board turned a blind eye to the alleged sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein. In theory, shareholders should have a large voice through their rights to approve the board of directors, the auditors, and changes in corporate policy. One of the two parties to the Apple letter, the California State Teachers Retirement System (Calstrs), is a $222bn pension plan with large stakes in many public companies. Calstrs has historically tried to influence companies through its voting choices. That doesn’t work often, as the vast majority of shareholders support management when they vote. As a result, CEOs and boards have gradually eroded shareholder rights for decades, to the point where technology leaders like Facebook, Google, and Snap are entirely controlled by their founders. The erosion of shareholder rights led to the emergence of a kind of activist investor, which use aggressive public actions to force management to change its behavior. This tactic works often enough that the activist category has grown in recent years. The other party to the Apple letter, Jana Partners, is a very successful activist investor. Jana is a hedge fund, which means they can “go long” on stocks they think will go up and “sell short” stocks they think will go down. Another constituency with the power to influence corporate governance is customers. In the case of internet platforms, the customers are advertisers. To date, advertisers have stuck with the major internet platforms. Users can have significant influence on internet companies, but only if they stop using the platform. More than 2 billion people worldwide use social media; two-thirds of them use Facebook every day. A scary percentage of smartphone owners exhibit signs of addiction. They can’t quit. The final constituency that matters is employees. In knowledge businesses like Facebook and Google, employees have far more power than they realize. We saw this in the case of Uber, where the board and shareholders ignored alleged malfeasance for many years, and only made changes after a blog post by a former employee, Susan Fowler, about the company’s toxic management culture caused an employee rebellion. So far, the employees of the other platforms have remained loyal to management, despite a tsunami of bad news. The investors who wrote to Apple have an opportunity to change the game. Calstrs represents teachers, so protecting children from internet addiction is a core mission. It has huge voting power and a willingness to use it. Jana has formed a new fund to do social impact investing, bringing the hedge fund model to that world for the first time. If investors like Jana and Calstrs apply activist and hedge fund techniques to drive social change – rather than maximize stock prices – the results could be dramatic.",Facebook; US news; Smartphones; Apple; Silicon Valley; Mark Zuckerberg; Social networking; Technology,Technology
2019-02-07T14:05:33Z,Fightback against the billionaires: the radicals taking on the global elite,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/07/rutger-bregman-winnie-byanyima-anand-giridharadas,"Rutger: Winnie, why did the comments you and I made about billionaires and taxes at Davos go viral? Why do things seem to be changing right now? Winnie: Why did we go viral? I think we said things that people have wanted to hear, especially on a big stage where powerful politicians and companies are represented. And they are rarely said. People go there and speak in coded words and praise themselves and spin out the stats that suit them, but for once we spoke plainly about the challenges that people face. R: I saw some interesting stats today from Gallup that suggest that since the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of people in the US have wanted the rich to pay more taxes. There are signs that there is a profound shift in the public mood. W: I don’t know whether the left has been sleeping, but there has been a dominant narrative that has remained quite unchallenged in the media. This narrative suggests that there is no connection between the super-rich and abject poverty, that you can keep getting richer and richer, and this has nothing to do with people getting poorer. And it wasn’t always like that, people in the past have known that maximising at the top means you are depriving somebody else further down. It’s empowering for people to hear that truth being put on the table again. Anand: The idea of the narrative is so important. I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power; it’s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it’s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it’s ever been. Never mind the fact that we’re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires – as long as they are doing good things, we don’t ask what else they do; as long as they are giving back, we don’t ask how they made their money. It’s like a mafia deal: no questions asked. R: I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you’ll find that they’re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. A: How did the billionaires pull this off? How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years? W: I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it’s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: “Wait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.” R: There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest. A: I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language – words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats’ bidding. One is “win-win”. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win – in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others. W: Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It’s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems. A: A couple more examples. Take “thought leader”. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don’t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don’t expect. Another instance is “doing well by doing good”: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as “social impact” and “social venture capital” and “impact investing”. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like “power” and “justice” and “dignity”. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes. W: I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term “climate justice”. You can talk about “climate change”, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer “climate action”, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don’t place the responsibility where it lies. R: I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals; almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes – or at least doesn’t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn’t working. And that’s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity; homophobia; racism; the establishment. But you also need to know what you are for. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn’t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed. Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I’ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the “end of history” was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy – win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that’s not traumatised by the cold war. I’ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, “Oh that sounds like Venezuela” – Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: “Whatever.” A: I’ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I’ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I’ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this “There is no alternative” talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it’s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy. I think we need to really claim this mantle of humanism because it’s not only for people on the left. It is for everyone who does not want to be gaslit by the pretensions of the private-jet set. I really sense, even with people on the right, that there is anger about monopolies, political corruption and crony capitalism. There is anger about companies that talk a big game about belonging to communities, but actually make their decisions based on factors that have nothing to do with those communities. What we have yet to see is political leadership that is able to speak to those not only belonging to the left but also to that 10 or 20% of the folks on the right who are also against plutocracy, even if they may like markets. Such people may like business and may like the idea of making £100,000 with their own barber shop one day, but they don’t like Amazon being the only retailer in the US, they don’t like Facebook controlling democracy and abetting ethnic violence. R: One thing I’ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn’t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to. One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty – there’s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology – it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn’t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It’s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around. W: Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don’t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people – they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires’ tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: “x-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses”. We use that kind of language – it’s emotive, it has an impact on people. A: In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language. R: Here’s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That’s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven’t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I’ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It’s “venture capitalism for the people”, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can’t get around it. A: I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta‑Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: “Part of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.” And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories. W: Stories are my biggest weapon. Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly. R: I’m 30 years old. I’ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals – those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. W: I hope that’s true. R: I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, “Oh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride – all the trains are good.” But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable. W: Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm? A: My view from the US, and I bet it’s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can’t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can’t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can’t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft. The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that’s not a theft at all, it’s a wave of rising equality; it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to divert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others – they are the ones who stole the dream from you. And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened. Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen? R: If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: “Somewhere like Sweden.” Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn’t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it’s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: “We should not allow them to define us.” The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together – black, white, men, women, that doesn’t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don’t allow them to divide us. W: We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it’s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I’m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. A: I do feel tremendously hopeful, which is strange because my country has the most dangerous leader it has ever had, and things are very fractured around the world. I was recently in Britain in the House of Commons when they took that chaotic vote [on Brexit] a couple weeks ago, so it may seem strange to be hopeful. But there are cycles in history, and I believe we are at the natural end of a 40-year cycle, defined by the religion of money, defined by the veneration of entrepreneurs and markets. And instead of just saying, “That’s wrong”, I think it’s more empathetic to ourselves as a society to say that the last 40 years has been an experiment, an era defined by entrepreneurs as heroes, markets as gods – just as a century ago there was the industrial revolution and the first gilded age, a time of great fortunes. I think we are living in the death pangs of an era that has done tremendous good, but has also done tremendous harm, that has lifted a lot of people out of poverty, but also put the planet in mortal jeopardy. And I feel hope that another era has to follow this era because that is how history works. As well as the death pangs, there are birth pangs right now. I believe that after the age of markets will come the age of reform and the age of solidarity. • Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.
