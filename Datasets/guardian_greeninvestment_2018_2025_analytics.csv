2024-11-12T05:00:48Z,"UK has ‘huge opportunity’ to lead on green investment, Starmer says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/12/uk-has-huge-opportunity-to-lead-on-green-investment-starmer-says,"Britain has a “huge opportunity” to get ahead of other countries in the race for green investment after the election of Donald Trump as US president, Keir Starmer has said, as he arrives in Azerbaijan for the Cop29 summit. Trump’s election victory last week has cast doubt on global efforts to tackle climate change, which the president-elect has called a “hoax”. But as the most senior world leader attending the summit in Baku, Starmer said the global political turmoil could benefit the UK economy. Asked about Trump’s position on the climate crisis, Starmer said: “The climate challenge is something that we have got to rise to and that’s why I’ve repeatedly said we’ve got to show leadership. “But I do think it’s more than just an obligation, it’s a huge opportunity. The UK has a huge opportunity to get ahead here when it comes to renewables – that’s why I’m encouraging as much investment as I can when it comes to carbon capture, when it comes to hydrogen, when it comes to offshore wind.” He added: “There’s a global race on now to be the global leader on this. I want us to be in the race and I want us to win the race.” Starmer arrived in Baku on Monday evening as one of only two G7 leaders to attend the summit, alongside Italy’s Georgia Meloni. Several other developed countries have been engulfed by political uncertainty, including Germany, where the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is facing a confidence vote, and France, where president Emmanuel Macron lost a parliamentary election earlier this year. This year’s climate conference has also been overshadowed by last week’s US presidential election result, given that Trump has promised to pull the country out of the Paris climate agreement for a second time. During the campaign, the incoming president called climate change “a big hoax”, and condemned Biden’s package of green subsidies as the “green new scam”. British government officials believe that if Trump begins to unwind the Biden-era incentives it could drive international investors to other countries, with the UK hoping to capture much of that money. As part of that effort, ministers announced on Monday evening they would give offshore wind developers an extra £27m for every GW of capacity they create to help build up the supply chain. The money will be paid on top of the subsidies developers already get as part of the government’s auction process. The government is also launching a new financial instrument to be launched on the London Stock Exchange, allowing international investors a fast and easy way to put money into the UK green industry. Starmer told reporters on Monday: “Look where investors are putting their money – they are choosing to put it into renewables because they know that’s where the next big opportunity is.” The prime minister stopped in Paris on his way to Baku, where he spent the morning at a Remembrance Day event alongside the French president, Emmanuel Macron. He told reporters afterwards that he had used a bilateral meeting with Macron to discuss Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion, which European leaders fear Trump will no longer be willing to fund. Donald Trump Jr, his son, posted a picture of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, over the weekend with the caption: “POV: You’re 38 Days from losing your allowance”. Starmer said after his meeting in Paris: “I’ve always said that we support Ukraine for as long as it takes, and we’re stood by that.” He would not say however whether the pair had discussed trying again to persuade the outgoing president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles against Russian territory – one of Zelenskyy’s key demands. When he arrives in Baku, Starmer will spend much of his time talking about climate finance, with this year’s Cop being badged as an opportunity to talk about private investment into green industries. “Now is the time for the private sector to start paying their fair share in relation to these commitments,” the prime minister said, as he promised to hit Boris Johnson’s target of spending £11.6bn on international climate finance between 2020-21 and 2025-26. On Tuesday, he will announce how much the government plans to cut carbon emissions by 2035. The Climate Change Committee has recommended the UK cut its emissions by 81% from their 1990 levels, though the country is already behind a separate target of cutting them 68% by 2030. Starmer’s trip to Baku is one of several foreign visits he is making over the autumn, with the prime minister expected to have spent 22 days out of 77 outside the country since the start of September. The prime minister defended his foreign travel on Monday, saying it helped further his two main priorities: the economy and immigration. Those priorities present a narrower vision of his government’s ambitions than the five missions he set out before the election. But they are also the two main reasons voters in the US say they voted for Trump.",Green economy; Climate crisis; UK news; Keir Starmer; Politics; Cop29; Environment,Environment
2025-05-18T06:00:26Z,Revealed: European ‘green’ investments hold billions in fossil fuel majors,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/18/revealed-european-green-investments-hold-billions-in-fossil-fuel-majors,"European “green” funds holding more than $33bn of investments in major oil and gas companies have been revealed by an investigation, despite fossil fuels being the root cause of the climate crisis. Some of these investment funds used branding such as Sustainable Global Stars and Europe Climate Pathway. Over $18bn was invested in the five biggest polluters: TotalEnergies, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP. These topped a 2023 Carbon Majors ranking for oil and gas production among shareholder-owned firms. Other investments by funds following EU sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) included those in US fracking company Devon Energy and Canadian tar sands company Suncor, the investigation by Voxeurop and the Guardian found. Investors claim that holding a stake in a company allows them to influence the firm’s pursuit of climate goals. However, no major oil and gas producer has plans consistent with international climate targets and many companies have weakened their plans in the last year, according to a report from Carbon Tracker in April. The investment firms with the biggest stakes in fossil companies in their green funds were JP Morgan, BlackRock and DWS in Germany. The investment companies have not breached the SFDR rules, which do not explicitly rule out some fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said change was needed to avoid people being misled. “For a fund claiming to be ‘green’, holding investments in major fossil fuel companies should be a red line,” said Giorgia Ranzato, sustainable finance manager at Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E). “Since oil majors are not contributing meaningfully to the energy transition, any investment in such companies by a green fund is essentially greenwashing. To effectively combat this, T&amp;E and other organisations advocate for a meaningful review of the SFDR. “It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies,” said Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute. A BlackRock spokesperson said: “BlackRock’s funds are managed in accordance with their investment objectives, that are clearly disclosed in each fund’s prospectus and on BlackRock’s website. Our sustainable funds are managed in line with applicable regulations governing sustainable investing. For investors that have decarbonisation investment objectives we offer a range of products that provide such exposure.” After being contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for asset manager Robeco said its Sustainable Global Stars fund would remove “sustainable” from its name. A spokesperson said the fund had a 20% better CO2 footprint than the market index and that the firm had “productive and intensive engagement” with TotalEnergies. The investigation analysed the ownership in the last quarter of 2024 of the publicly traded fossil fuel companies listed in the Carbon Majors report, using the London Stock Exchange Group Data &amp; Analytics platform. It found $33.5bn held by green funds in 37 large fossil fuel companies. The fossil fuel investments were in funds regulated under SFDR rules, specifically articles 8 and 9, which respectively deal with the promotion of “environmental or social” goals and “sustainable investments”. More than 480 investment companies had these types of investments, which included stocks in fossil fuel companies. The investigation also found more than $1bn of shares in the five fossil fuel giants in funds using green keywords in their title in March 2025: A Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) fund called Europe Climate Pathway had $88m invested in Shell, BP and TotalEnergies. In total, LGIM held $210m in “green” funds. The Robeco Sustainable Global Stars fund had $40m in TotalEnergies. Overall, Robeco held $207m in these funds. Another fund, a State Street product called World ESG had $43m in combined investment in all five of the oil majors. ESG is a label for funds promoting environmental, social and governance goals. In total, State Street Global Advisors UK held $243m in the “green” funds. The financial institutions with the biggest fossil fuel stakes in their article 8 and 9 funds and those using green keywords were JP Morgan Asset Management and its UK subsidiary with $3.2bn, DWS in Germany with $2.2bn and BlackRock Investment Management UK and BlackRock Advisors UK with a combined $1.7bn. The SFDR regulations were not originally intended to be used in marketing but the classifications have been used to showcase a financial product’s environmental credentials. This has remained the case even after the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) called for sweeping reforms to tackle greenwashing and published tighter guidelines in August 2024 for the use of sustainability and ESG-related terms in fund names. The new guidelines include “transition” funds, where managers should demonstrate the investments are on a “clear and measurable path to social or environmental transition”. The deadline for application of the new guidelines is 21 May. BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management announced in March and April respectively that they would remove words such as sustainable and ESG from some fund names. Campaigners said they could have acted sooner. JP Morgan, DWS, LGIM and State Street all declined requests to comment. The guidelines are not legally binding but from 21 May national financial regulators will be able to require companies to report publicly whether their products comply with the rules and could choose to sanction any guideline breaches. Paul Schreiber at Reclaim Finance said: “We need strict rules that ban investments in companies developing fossil fuels from any fund with an ESG-related description. This is precisely what the SFDR failed to do. In this context, the review of the regulations must include strict fossil fuel exclusions covering all fund categories.” An Esma spokesperson said: “Our focus is on supporting [national authorities] to implement the current guidelines, as they are only becoming applicable to existing funds on 21 May. In the future, if needed, we will evaluate the possibility of changes to the guidelines together with competent authorities, also bearing in mind potential developments in the review of the SFDR.” TotalEnergies has said the company supports the objectives of the Paris Agreement and that its strategy is consistent with a global temperature rise of less than 2C. Shell declined to comment, while other fossil fuel companies did not respond to requests for comment.

2024-11-14T07:00:05Z,Leading British actors call on chancellor to boost green investment in pensions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/14/actors-call-on-chancellor-to-increase-green-investments,"Leading British actors including Mark Rylance, Olivia Colman, and Benedict Cumberbatch have called on the chancellor to increase investment in clean energy by reforming pensions. Members of the performing arts union Equity have written an open letter to Rachel Reeves before her Mansion House speech on Thursday asking her to make “smart, strategic reforms” that could unlock £1.2tn from the pensions sector for growing clean energy and infrastructure in the UK. Other notable signatories include Stephen Fry, Jodie Whittaker, Paapa Essiedu, Alex Lawther, Freddie Fox, Ritu Arya, Will Attenborough, Leila Mimmack and Tom Burke. The letter celebrates Equity moving its £130m pension scheme to a fund with extensive fossil fuel exclusions. “This progress isn’t just good for our planets and our pockets – it’s hugely popular, too,” the signatories say. “Research, by Make My Money Matter, shows that just one in five people in the UK believe their retirement savings should invest in fossil fuel developers. By contrast, two-thirds of all British pension holders want their scheme to invest in clean energy. “The appetite is clearly there to put our money into companies offering solutions to the climate and nature crises we face. Now we need to harness the extraordinary, untapped potential of our pensions to build a safer world.” Reeves is expected on Thursday to propose an overhaul of the UK’s pension funds in order to unlock billions of pounds of investment. The letter encourages the Labour government to follow through on a key manifesto pledge of requiring financial institutions to adopt science-based plans for limiting global heating. Equity says this means pension funds, banks and insurers could no longer do business with companies expanding fossil fuels. The letter also asks the government to update fiduciary duty law, so that acting in savers’ “best interests” means taking the impacts of climate change and damage to nature into account. Rylance said: “When we change, the whole world changes. Divesting from businesses and practices which are not harmonious with life on Earth is, I believe, an essential step for all of us to consider.” “Pensions are a powerful driver in society. I do not want this time of enormous challenge for all life on our planet to become a story of force, dictatorship, fear and war. Let us change the story by changing ourselves as a union of artists and choosing life over profit.” Equity’s move marks the culmination of a campaign first launched in 2017 by Attenborough and Mimmack to ensure union members’ savings were aligned to sustainability, which was backed by a number of British film and television stars including David Harewood and Maxine Peake. Equity said an estimated £88bn of UK pension savers’ money was invested in fossil fuel companies – about £3,000 for each pension holder. It said the union’s new default fund would not invest in companies involved in thermal coal, or those making more than 10% of their revenue from oil and gas. The process of moving artists’ money away from fossil fuels took several years because funds that exclude oil, gas and coal have in the past been considered higher risk, it added. Attenborough and Mimmack said they were “now looking to our political leaders to back us up”. Equity’s general secretary, Paul W Fleming, said: “Equity’s members have power because they act together as a collective. The climate crisis is a problem built by capitalism, and capitalism alone won’t fix it.” “That’s why we need unions like Equity doing all they can to push for change, whether in negotiations with producers over Green Riders, or leveraging our members’ pension investments against fossil fuel extraction. We can push the bosses who made this crisis to play their part in the green Industrial Revolution we need.”",Pensions industry; Pensions; Fossil fuels; Acting; Mark Rylance; Olivia Colman; Benedict Cumberbatch; Culture; Television & radio; Fossil fuel divestment; Money; Environment; Investing; Business,Business
2025-07-15T14:00:21Z,Climate groups call for UK wealth tax to make super-rich fund sustainable economy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/15/climate-groups-call-uk-wealth-tax-make-super-rich-fund-sustainable-economy,"A growing number of climate groups are campaigning for the introduction of a wealth tax to ensure the transition to a sustainable economy is not done “on the backs of the poor”. Last week campaigners from Green New Deal Rising staged a sit-in outside the Reform UK party’s London headquarters as part of a wave of protests targeting the offices, shops and private clubs of the super-rich across the UK. The Pay Up campaign – backed by more than 20 civil society groups including Friends of the Earth, the National Education Union and Tax Justice UK – is calling on the government to bring in a series of wealth taxes as an alternative to spending cuts. It is one of a number of campaign initiatives focused on overhauling the tax regime being run by climate groups who say the revenue from the ultra-rich could fund investment, restore crumbling public services and help tackle the climate emergency. “Fixing our broken tax system so that it finally taxes those who earn their income from assets and wealth at the same rates as the majority of the population, who earn their money from work, is the fair thing to do,” said Hannah Martin, a co-director of GND Rising. “We must tax the booming fortunes of the super-rich to rebalance our economy and fund investment in our communities, our schools, libraries as well as much-needed climate action.” The campaign aims to highlight the growth in extreme wealth held by individuals and corporations in the UK. It calls on the government to introduce a 2% tax on assets over £10m, shut down tax loopholes and increase the tax paid on property and shares so that capital gains tax is equal to income tax. It is also urging the government to stop using public money to bail out big polluters such as failing water companies and fossil fuel firms. Tax experts at the Tax Justice UK campaign group say a 2% tax on wealth above £10m would raise £22bn every year, and the other tax changes advocated for by GND Rising could raise an additional £50bn in a single year. Martin said: “Climate campaigners are calling for wealth taxes because we have been told for years that ‘there’s no money’ to tackle climate change. But we can see along with the public there is enough money and it is being hoarded by the super-rich and polluting corporations. We need to unlock that wealth to tackle climate change and the cost of living crisis, and that means focusing on the government’s tax policies to win that change.” There has been a growing clamour for a wealth tax in recent months from some economists, thinktanks and trade unions. In recent weeks prominent Labour figures including the former leader Neil Kinnock have added their voices. Opponents, the super-rich and their advisers and supporters, have raised concerns that such a move would result in the ultra-wealthy leaving the country, a narrative that has been amplified by a blizzard of news stories over the past year. However, experts say there is no evidence of a mass millionaire exodus from the UK, with the overall number of millionaires and billionaires having risen steadily over the past two decades. At the same time most people are faced with stagnating wages, rising living costs and decimated public services. Zack Polanski, who is standing to be the new leader of the Green party, agreed there should be a wealth tax to ensure the ultra-wealthy – who are also the largest emitters – pay their fair share to tackle the climate crisis. He argued that under the current plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050 the poorest in society were being asked to “step up to tackle the climate crisis”. “This is an emergency,” Polanski said. “The government have a series of choices – and right now they are choosing to subsidise dirty and dangerous parts of the economy like aviation, oil and gas. They should instead ensure that the greenest option is always the cheapest. How dare they say there’s no money left at the same time they also refuse to tax the super-rich?” GND Rising’s Pay Up campaign staged a day of action last week during which more than 200 young people targeted sites connected to Britain’s ultra-wealthy, including the billionaires Jim Ratcliffe of Ineos, the Reform treasurer Nick Candy, and the founder of Bet365, Denise Coates. It said it intended to step up its campaign for a fairer tax system over the summer. Martin said climate action “must speak to the reality of people’s lives and their anger at the inequality they are seeing in their communities”. “The climate crisis and economy inequality are two sides of the same coin, because it’s the same broken system making billionaires richer, fuelling the climate crisis, and leaving working people to pick up the bill.” She warned that unless climate campaigners showed that climate action was “also about fixing inequality and the cost of living crisis, we risk our demands being dismissed as a ‘nice to have’ by politicians, ignoring the very real pain people are facing, and opening up our agenda to attacks by climate deniers like Reform”.",Green politics; Climate crisis; The super-rich; Tax and spending; Politics; Environmental activism; Protest; Reform UK; UK news; Environment,Environment
2025-02-05T13:56:49Z,Norwegian firm lobbying to open Rosebank oilfield halves green investments,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/norways-state-oil-firm-lobbying-to-open-rosebank-oilfield-halves-green-investments,"The Norwegian oil company fighting to open a giant new oilfield off Shetland has cut billions of pounds from its green spending plans in favour of producing more fossil fuels. Equinor set out plans on Wednesday to halve its investments in low-carbon energy while producing more oil and gas, becoming the latest in a line of fossil fuel firms to backtrack on its green promises. Norway’s state oil company told investors it would cut spending on renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies from a planned $10bn (£8bn) to $5bn over the next two years. The green budget cuts will slow the growth of its low-carbon energy business, which includes some of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, to 10-12 gigawatts (GW) . Its previous target was 12-16GW. It also plans to produce 2.2m barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2030, which is 10% higher than its previous plans. The company hopes to fuel this growth with barrels from Britain’s biggest untapped oilfield at Rosebank in the North Sea – despite a landmark court ruling that the government’s decision to approve the project was unlawful. The Rosebank project has spurred debate over whether or not the Labour government can successfully pursue its green agenda while delivering economic growth. The party came to power with the promise to end new North Sea oil and gas exploration licences while respecting existing ones. However, climate campaigners have piled pressure on ministers to block the development of Rosebank, which received its licence in 2023, by refusing it a final consent permit to produce oil under a new regime that will be finalised in spring. The uncertainty has laid bare a rift in the government between the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has described the licence issued to Rosebank as “climate vandalism”, and Treasury officials eager to jump start the UK’s economic growth through multibillion pound investments from the private sector. Equinor has claimed that Rosebank will require £8.1bn of total direct investment over the lifetime of the field, of which 78% will flow to UK companies. It is also expected to create 1,600 jobs at the peak of its construction and about 450 UK jobs over its operating life. Equinor will also pay tax to the Treasury for the barrels of oil it sells from the field. Equinor has said it will continue to develop the field while working with the UK government and regulators to move the project forward under a new consent process. The Oslo-based company revealed plans to water down its green investments after Shell and BP signalled to investors that they would backtrack on their green spending plans to exploit volatility in the global oil and gas markets. BP is widely expected to confirm it has dropped a target to cut its oil output in the next five years, and revise its green energy targets, at its investor day later this month, in an attempt to revive its lagging share price by creating a “simpler, more focused, and higher-value company”. French oil company TotalEnergies said on Wednesday it would trim low-carbon energy spending by 10% to $4.5bn after its net profit slumped by 26% in the 2024 financial year to $15.8bn. It was still the company’s third-highest results on record, according to its chief executive, Patrick Pouyanné. Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, which campaigns against fossil fuels, said it was “no surprise” that Equinor was retreating from its “deeply inadequate global renewables targets”. “Having spent huge amounts on marketing, sponsoring newspapers and events, to try and persuade the British government and public that it is a responsible oil company committed to the transition, Equinor has finally laid bare that it cares more about profits than anything else,” Khan added.",Oil; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Norway; Commodities; Business; Europe; World news; Green economy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable energy; Environment; UK news; BP; Shell,Business
2025-03-06T16:14:20Z,BP cuts boss’s pay by 30% after company misses profit targets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/06/bp-cuts-bosss-pay-by-30-after-company-misses-profit-targets,"BP cut the pay of its chief executive after a chastening year in which the British oil company missed profit targets and ditched its green investment strategy as it came under pressure from a US-based activist investor. Murray Auchincloss’s pay decreased by 30% to £5.4m for 2024, according to the company’s annual report published on Thursday. While his basic salary rose from £1m to £1.45m, the failure to hit targets in categories such as profit, cashflow and safety meant the variable element of his pay slumped from £3.4m to less than £1m. Auchincloss announced a “fundamental reset” of BP’s strategy last month after it reported lacklustre financial performance in 2024, posting annual profits of $8.9bn (£7.9bn), down from almost $14bn in 2023. On the eve of the profits announcement it emerged that the activist investor Elliott Investment Management had built up a stake and was pushing the company to overhaul its strategy. Auchincloss has since confirmed plans to cut more than £4bn from low-carbon investment plans, saying that optimism about the pace of the green transition had been “misplaced”. While BP’s adoption of green targets went to a shareholder vote in 2022, the strategic volte-face will not be put to a vote, according to an agenda published on Thursday that outlined resolutions to be decided on at BP’s annual meeting next month. Follow This, a Netherlands-based group of green activists who have stakes in oil companies, criticised the decision, saying BP had indicated at the 2022 meeting that it might offer a new vote in 2025. “BP’s disregard for shareholders will not sit well with a sizable number of investors who want the company to continue their transition,” said the chief executive of Follow This, Mark van Baal. “Apparently, BP is afraid of its shareholders.”/ The abandonment of green investment targets will also affect how executive bonuses at BP are calculated this year, according to the annual report. In 2024, 10% of executive pay was linked to profits from the company’s “transition growth” plans, of which 80% was made up of low-carbon projects. “Reflecting the focus of our strategy, we have removed the transition growth engine growth measure,” the company said. Instead, it will increase the portion of the bonus linked to free cashflow and operational reliability. This would not have made a difference in 2024 because BP failed to hit targets in any of these three categories. However, improved financial performance next year would yield a higher bonus, without having to hit transition targets, although 15% of executive variable pay will still be linked to reducing carbon emissions. Despite the fall in Auchincloss’s overall pay, campaigners at Global Witness, which investigates environmental and human rights abuses, said the BP boss’s £5.4m pay was “obscene” and pointed out that it was 143 times the average UK salary. “While households worry about their energy bills amid a soaring cost of living crisis, BP’s boss is lining his pockets with a fat-cat paycheck,” said the group’s head of fossil fuels campaigning, Alice Harrison. “People have every right to be furious. It’s obscene that climate-wrecking oil firms continue to gouge the market for billions in profit and then hand millions to their executives off the back of our misery.” Auchincloss’s fellow FTSE 100 CEO, the Rolls-Royce boss, Tufan Erginbilgiç, also took a pay cut last year. Rolls-Royce’s annual report shows that his total remuneration dropped to £4.11m in 2024, down from £13.6m in 2023. The decline was due to Erginbilgiç having being handed £7.5m of shares when he joined Rolls-Royce in 2023 as compensation for remuneration forfeited at his previous employer.",BP; Energy industry; Oil; Executive pay and bonuses; UK news; Climate crisis; Environment; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; Rolls-Royce; Business,Business
2024-08-27T13:00:38Z,‘I was frustrated’: The woman who told Labour it didn’t need to spend £28bn on green investment,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/27/i-was-frustrated-the-woman-who-told-labour-it-didnt-need-to-spend-28bn-on-green-investment,"At the start of this year, among the snowy Swiss slopes of the Davos business get-together, Rhian-Mari Thomas was ready to make an elevator pitch to the UK’s future chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The chief executive of the Green Finance Institute (GFI) – a government-backed body that helps create and promote pro-environment financial products in the UK – had grown increasingly concerned about Labour’s £28bn green investment pledge. The party should not have even considered using that much taxpayer cash, Thomas argued. Instead, it should engage with private investors who were already keen to pour money into big green projects. “I was very frustrated,” Thomas recalls, “and I said as much.” Her pitch to Reeves was that the GFI should help steer Labour’s vision for a national wealth fund, ensuring it came at a lower cost to the public purse. She told the then shadow chancellor that Labour needed the finance industry “in the room, to actually identify what exactly the obstacles are and where government money can be most impactful”. Not long after, the £28bn pledge had been cut in half and soon Thomas was chairing Labour’s national wealth fund taskforce, convening heavy hitters such as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, alongside the chief executives of Aviva, NatWest and Thomas’s former employer, Barclays. It led to the creation of the £7.3bn fund, launched just days after Keir Starmer’s landslide election victory in July. It was a professional coup, and a vindication of Thomas’s decision in 2018 to leave banking for a role more aligned with her green roots. Raised in Cardiff in the 1970s, Thomas was heavily influenced by her parents’ efforts to minimise their carbon footprint. The family stopped eating red meat in response to cattle farming practices across the Amazon, and her father – an economist and university lecturer at Cardiff business school – shunned the family car in favour of the local bus. “A lot of people in our neighbourhood thought he’d lost his driving licence,” Thomas says. In her early teens, Thomas set up paper recycling at her high school on Barry Island and led a campaign to reduce the use of harmful chlorofluorocarbons found in the hairsprays that held up the gravity-defying hairstyles of the 1980s. She left home to study physics at the University of Bath, followed by a PhD at Trinity College Dublin. But by the time she was looking for her next challenge, Barclays’s investment bank had come knocking. “All this was new to me,” Thomas says. “I didn’t know the difference between an investment bank and a post office.” But Barclays Capital – then led by Bob Diamond, later to become the bank’s chief executive – was on the hunt for recruits with master’s and doctorate degrees, and offered a whopping one-off payment of £4,000 to students who performed well on its psychometric tests. “This was like riches beyond Croesus at the time,” she says. She was soon navigating leveraged finance and private equity deals. After the credit crunch, she shifted into retail and corporate banking, and later became chief commercial officer at the bank’s credit card division, Barclaycard. But by 2016, Thomas had hit a wall. She had watched as dozens of countries signed the Paris agreement the previous year in an effort to limit global heating. She wanted to do more. “I was just thinking, ‘is this really the best use of my energies, and the expertise and everything I’ve learned to do so far?’” Thomas realised that sustainability debates were too divorced from business concepts – and that the City would change only if there were a credible financial incentive. “For something to take off within a profit-led organisation, it needs to be generating profit,” Thomas says. “And for something to be sustainable, it also needs to be commercial.” In 2017, she launched a green banking council through Barclays that was credited with creating the first green mortgage product, offering customers discounts on more environmentally credible properties. Over time, she acquired a formal role as Barclays’s first head of green banking. “It really wasn’t a question any more. This was obviously what I was going to have to do with the rest of my career,” she says. So when the UK government and the City of London Corporation launched the GFI in 2018, Thomas knew her next move. Under her leadership, the institute has advocated new finance products such as local climate bonds and green rental agreements, and established an environment-friendly mortgage training programme. The GFI has also pushed for government guarantees to back developers’ investments in carbon capture technology, and the creation of special loans which investors start repaying only when green infrastructure – such as electric vehicle charge points – comes into use. If we want firms to stop making money from polluting industries, they need credible alternatives, Thomas argues. “People who work in the City are not stupid people. And if they can see an opportunity to make profitable, risk-adjusted returns for their organisations … they will do those trades all day. So you’ve got to ask yourself, why is that not happening? And it’s a very lazy narrative to say it’s not happening because these people are evil.” But Thomas is “not an apologist for the banks”. “If I felt that going around criticising the banks was the most impactful way of achieving that, I would do that,” she says. “Obviously, I wish they would move faster.

2024-02-08T19:26:14Z,Labour cuts £28bn green investment pledge by half,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/labour-cuts-28bn-green-investment-pledge-by-half,"Labour has cut its green investment plans by half, ending weeks of speculation and confirming the biggest and most controversial U-turn of Keir Starmer’s leadership. In a move that prompted an angry response from environmental groups, unions and some in the energy sector, Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, jointly announced they would slash the green prosperity plan from £28bn a year to under £15bn – only a third of which would be new money. It ended a protracted internal battle within Labour over the policy, with some senior officials urging Starmer to stick to his green commitments and others warning it would be an electoral liability. While intended to shield against repeated Conservative attacks on the scale of borrowing required, the climbdown infuriated environmental campaigners, who said it would push up costs in the long term and make it harder for Labour to reach ambitious green targets. The Unite union said Labour risked “outsourcing their policymaking to the Conservatives”, while the energy industry’s trade group said it was concerned about the reduced ambition for “the future of our sector in the UK”. Speaking to reporters in Westminster, Starmer said: “We will not reach the £28bn – the £28bn, therefore, is stood down and we focus on the outcomes. We want to get to that place because at the moment all you are ever asked about is the size of the cheque and we want to have an argument about the outcomes, which is what matters.” He added: “We announced the £28bn two and a half years or so ago, when interest rates were very, very low. Since then, Liz Truss crashed the economy and other damage has been done. [Interest rates] are now very, very high – interest on government debt is already tens of billions of pounds a year. “We’ve always said we have to be within the fiscal rules and fiscal rules come first.” Labour announced the £28bn spending plan in 2021, as Reeves promised to be the UK’s “first green chancellor”. She said at the time the money would be spent on battery manufacturing, hydrogen power, offshore wind, tree planting, flood defences and home insulation. Since then the party has come under increasing attack over the plan, as Starmer and Reeves struggled to explain how they could stick to the spending commitment and keep a separate promise to cut government debt levels in the long term. The Guardian revealed last week that Starmer had decided to scale back the plan after lengthy internal discussion and heavy lobbying from aides, such as Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s campaign chief, who said sticking to it would be an electoral liability. Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, had pushed back against diluting the plan. There was even speculation, denied by his team, that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming the U-turn. Starmer had continued to cite the £28bn target as recently as Tuesday, telling Times Radio it was “desperately needed” for the party’s mission of achieving clean power by 2030. On Thursday, he told reporters he no longer believed this was needed. Instead, Labour would spend just over £4.7bn a year, on top of £10bn of green schemes it says the government has already committed to. About half of that money would come from changes to the government’s oil and gas windfall tax, with Labour planning to raise the rate from 75% to 78% and extend it until the end of the parliament. The other half would come from new borrowing. The biggest cuts have been to the party’s home insulation scheme. Labour had previously promised to spend up to £6bn a year insulating 19m homes over a decade. Under the revised plans Starmer and Reeves intend to spend just £6.6bn over the parliament – an average of £1.3bn a year. The cuts will mean the party reducing its targets for the number of properties it can insulate. Starmer said Labour now intended to insulate 5m homes over the first five years of government, and that it would take as long as 14 years to reach the 19m target. Other schemes, including a £7.3bn national wealth fund and an £8.3bn national energy supplier called Great British Energy, will remain, in an effort to meet the clean power pledge. Reeves said: “Something had to give if we were going to be within our fiscal rules and to achieve clean power by 2030. We have got to get on with the national wealth fund and GB Energy, and so we have scaled back our ambition on warm homes.” Labour’s U-turn dismayed many green campaigners, who said their energy targets would be difficult to hit without the promised level of spending. Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said Starmer had “caved like a house of cards in the wind”. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said Labour had “turned its back on the people who most urgently need these essential upgrades – the many millions of low-income households suffering from living in poorly insulated homes”. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said the issue was less the actual sum spent than “the signal it sends”. She said: “The party has been engaging constructively with business over recent months, but retaining the confidence of the market is dependent on not making U-turns that damage the UK’s investability.” A number of Labour MPs simply expressed relief that the policy had been decided. One shadow cabinet minister said: “The policy is the main thing. To put a number on it was always a hostage to fortune with a flatlining economy and a government spending all that it has.”",Labour; Green politics; Keir Starmer; Politics; Environment; UK news,Politics
2024-03-07T06:00:03Z,"Budget fell far short on UK green investment, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/07/budget-fell-far-short-on-uk-green-investment-experts-say,"Opportunities to revive the UK’s flagging economy by boosting green industry were missed in one of the least green budgets of recent years, experts have said. Several said this failure to recognise one of the fastest-expanding areas of business – the net zero economy grew by 9% in key areas last year, while the rest of the economy was stagnant, according to CBI estimates – would drag down the UK in the short and long term. Alasdair Johnstone, of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “At a time when the US and EU are competing over investment in clean industries, there was little here to attract investment.” He said this could prove costly, pointing to forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that found instability in the Middle East could drive up energy costs again, leading to a need to borrow fresh billions on top of the government debt already accrued in combating the current gas crisis. “Speeding up the deployment of renewables, the insulation of homes, the rollout of heat pumps and the uptake of electric vehicles would boost our energy security,” Johnstone said. None of these received much attention in Wednesday’s budget. Instead, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, opted to freeze fuel duty for a 14th year running, a move likely to benefit richer people and do little for those on low incomes. Rail prices have risen annually over the same period, and Jürgen Maier, a former chief executive of Siemens in the UK and a strong advocate of HS2, who is now advising Labour on a green industrial strategy, said the move sent the wrong signal. “It sends the message that we want you to drive your petrol and diesel cars,” he said. “Where are the incentives to get people back on public transport?” Hunt, a self-described green Tory before he became chancellor, flourished a few minor measures with a green tinge. There was £120m for the green industries growth accelerator initiative, to be spent on emerging low-carbon technologies; a £270m push for zero-carbon aviation and road vehicles; a £1.5bn extension of the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas to 2029; more money for offshore wind developers, to encourage them to bid to build new projects after previous offshore wind auctions failed; and slightly higher duties on business class flights. Advocates of new nuclear power were buoyed up by the next phase of the competition to select a small modular reactor design, and the purchase of the Wylfa and Oldbury sites for potential new reactors, to be bought from Hitachi for £160m. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “This is a pivotal moment for the future of nuclear in the UK and should mark the beginning of new projects at these sites. The success of ramping up nuclear capacity for energy security and net zero rests a great deal on whether we develop at these sites and others.” Also missing from Hunt was any detail on the government’s proposal, aired in December, for a carbon tariff on imports. The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is intended to level the playing field for UK companies that are investing in cutting their greenhouse gas emissions, by penalising imports from countries with high emissions. Judith Richardson, the head of sustainability at the consultancy Argon &amp; Co, said: “It was hoped that the budget would give much-needed clarity over the UK’s plans to implement the CBAM. However, this opportunity was missed and businesses are still largely in the dark.” It was the lack of a clear strategy for combining the need to reach net zero by 2050 with the growth opportunities offered by low-carbon technologies that most dismayed green economists. Esin Serin, a policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics, said: “The budget unfortunately fails to offer the kind of changes that would unleash public and private investment and drive sustainable growth … We pointed out that an additional £26bn a year in public investment is needed towards the sustainable economy to drive improvements in productivity and growth. The budget falls far short of this.” Ed Matthew, a campaigns director at E3G, said: “This government has no credible plan for growth. Uncertainty on how the UK will decarbonise industry, homes, power and transport has led to chronic under-investment. This is compounded by a lack of green tax breaks, low levels of public investment and not having a long-term net zero investment plan. The UK economy is flatlining and this budget will fail to bring it back to life.” Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said: “This budget confirms once and for all that the Sunak government has given up when it comes to making Britain a clean energy superpower. There was no ambition, no vision, no commitment. “Where there should have been a plan to build the future in Britain, the inevitable consequence of five more years of the Conservatives will be higher bills, energy insecurity, and jobs going overseas. After 14 years of Tory failure, only Labour can make Britain energy-independent with Great British Energy, our new publicly owned energy company, and our national wealth fund to invest in good jobs across our country.”",Green economy; Budget 2024 (spring); Green politics; Environment; Politics; UK news; Budget,Environment
2024-02-08T19:36:00Z,How Labour ditched its flagship £28bn green investment pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/how-labour-ditched-flagship-28bn-green-investment-pledge,"Labour has ditched its pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, blaming the Conservatives for “crashing the economy”. The policy, the main component of Labour’s green prosperity plan, has been at the centre of a public and private struggle since it was announced, with factions inside the party arguing against moves to water it down. The plan has now been drastically scaled back to under £15bn a year, only a third of which – just over £4.7bn a year – would be new money. Below are some of the key moments leading up to this point. 27 September 2021 Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, pledges to become the UK’s first “green chancellor” and invest £28bn a year for the rest of the decade, in front of cheering Labour members at the party’s conference in Brighton. 23 September 2022 Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget leads to what is later estimated to be a £30bn fiscal black hole, setting the scene for a recalibration of Labour’s own spending plans and pledges. 9 June 2023 Labour scales back plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry. Citing the poor economic backdrop and interest rate rises since the Truss mini-budget, Reeves delays plans for a green prosperity fund to start in the first year of a Labour government. December Discussions within Labour about scaling back the £28bn plans increase amid fears the Conservatives will use the policy as a central line of attack in the general election campaign. But sources also express concern about how a Labour government would improve economic growth without the green plan, and whether it could leave Keir Starmer open to charges of “flip-flopping” by the Tories. 31 January 2024 A pushback against plans to water down the pledge gathers pace among leading economists and business experts. Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens and a figure advising Labour on transport and infrastructure, describes £28bn a year as an “absolute minimum”. 1 February 2024 The Guardian reveals that the £28bn a year pledge is to be ditched. Asked 10 times on Sky News if she backed the target, Reeves refuses to use the number at all, saying instead: “The importance of economic and fiscal stability … will always come first.” Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, says the figure remains an ambition but it is unclear “if we can get there”. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, all but confirms a day later that the commitment is going. 6 February Starmer says in a Times Radio interview that the pledge to spend £28bn a year is “desperately needed”, as he reopens the issue and supporters view his comments as a recommitment. The Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant says a day later: “On the £28bn, we are not scaling back. We intend to deliver that.” 7 February Bryant, the shadow culture minister, says in a morning interview that Labour will spend £28bn. Hours later, after prime minister’s questions in parliament, a Labour spokesperson tells reporters the party is committed to “£28bn, subject to the fiscal rules and subject to what the government leave on the table”. 8 February Labour confirms the party does not now believe it will be able to meet the commitment of £28bn a year in its green prosperity plan, blaming the Conservatives for “crashing” the economy, and what it described as the government’s plan to “max out the country’s credit card”. Instead, Labour “reconfirms” its commitment to policies under the plan to create jobs and cut bills. It says the policies would represent £23.7bn of investment over the course of the next parliament, funded in large part by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, with the remainder coming through borrowing within its fiscal rules.",Labour; Green politics; Rachel Reeves; Keir Starmer; UK news; Politics; Environment,Politics
2024-02-07T18:52:01Z,Starmer to announce scaling back of £28bn green investment plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/07/keir-starmer-to-announce-scaling-back-of-28bn-green-investment-plan,"Keir Starmer will announce on Thursday that he is scaling back Labour’s £28bn green investment programme, in his biggest policy U-turn since becoming party leader. Senior Labour sources have told the Guardian that Starmer will finally confirm the party is no longer planning to spend £28bn a year on environmental schemes, given the economic uncertainty caused by the Conservative government. It follows weeks of uncertainty about the policy as competing factions within Starmer’s senior team pushed him to keep the pledge or ditch it. Starmer has insisted for several weeks that he still intended to meet the pledge, which was first made in 2021 as part of a promise that Labour would be the greenest government in history. But doing so has become far more difficult since it was made, given that the worsening fiscal outlook has left less room to borrow more without long-term debt levels going up. Some shadow ministers have urged Starmer for months to drop the target, arguing that it plays into Conservative attacks about Labour’s fiscal credibility. Others have warned that doing so will only accentuate the feeling among many voters that Starmer cannot be trusted to stick to his word. It is the latest in a series of major policy reversals since he became Labour leader, including dropping a promise to scrap university tuition fees and to impose higher rates of income tax on top earners. Recent media briefings by shadow ministers have led to speculation of a split between Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Reeves was asked repeatedly about the pledge in an interview with Sky News last week but failed to mention the £28bn on 10 separate occasions. Starmer on the other hand had used the figure as recently as this week, when he told Times Radio: “We want to have clean power by 2030 … That’s where the £28bn comes in, that investment that is desperately needed for that mission.” Labour sources said last week that the pledge was now “dead”, an assessment that was bolstered by comments from Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, that the target would now “move around”. Party officials have previously indicated they would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as previously announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company. The opposition also intends to spend up to £6bn a year on a home insulation scheme, although that also remains subject to the party’s most important fiscal rule – to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output by the end of the five-year period. The £6bn plan triggered a separate row on Wednesday after an official government analysis claimed it would actually cost double that. Labour said this was “nonsense”, saying it had never claimed all the money would come from central government. But some experts warned that even with the kind of private investment Labour says it can bring in, it will not be able to hit its target of insulating 19m homes in a decade. The row over the insulation scheme helped highlight the broader questions around the party’s overall green investment plans. In recent weeks, senior Conservatives have claimed that sticking to the £28bn figure would mean a probable tax rise. Those attacks have worried some around Starmer, including Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s director of campaigns, and Pat McFadden, the party’s campaigns coordinator. McSweeney recently warned shadow ministers about the possibility that Labour could slump in the polls in the final weeks before an election if the party makes promises it is not able to fully defend. While scaling back the green prosperity plan has been under consideration for some weeks, dropping the £28bn annual target, unveiled with great fanfare by Reeves at the Labour conference in 2021, is politically risky for Starmer and his team. Sunak accused Starmer on Wednesday of being a serial flip-flopper. In comments that were otherwise overshadowed by his controversial remarks about trans people, the prime minister said: “It is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on.”",Keir Starmer; Labour; Green politics; Energy; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-01-05T11:59:20Z,Starmer downgrades £28bn green investment target to an ‘ambition’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/05/keir-starmer-28bn-green-investment-target-ambition,"Keir Starmer has downgraded his target of spending £28bn a year on green investment schemes in the next parliament to an “ambition”, in the latest sign of the Labour leader backing away from his flagship green policy. Starmer said on Friday he wanted to reach the £28bn figure by the second half of the parliament if Labour won the next election, but could not guarantee that he would be able to do so. His comments are the clearest admission yet that Labour is willing to spend less if it means keeping its promise to get debt falling as a proportion of economic output. Speaking during a listener phone-in on LBC radio, Starmer said: “[The £28bn plan] is subject to our fiscal rules, it’s an ambition. One of the rules is that debt has to be falling as a percentage of GDP. “I’m confident. We’re talking about where we might be in 2027. So being a careful and cautious former lawyer, I know that the world can change. Four or five years ago, we didn’t know we were going to hit Covid or Ukraine. I’m confident that we can get to that figure [but] in the end, the fiscal rule comes first.” Asked by LBC’s Nick Ferrari whether the figure was a pledge or a “gold-plated ambition”, Starmer said: “It’s a confident ambition.” The Labour leader has put green investment at the heart of his policy pitch to voters, promising to decarbonise Britain’s power sector by 2030. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, announced in 2021 that this would be achieved in part by the government spending £28bn a year until 2030 on technologies such as battery power and electric vehicles. In recent months, however, Reeves and Starmer have dialled down the ambition of the plan. Reeves announced last year a Labour government would only hit the £28bn target in the second half of a parliament, and would borrow less to avoid missing its fiscal targets. Starmer said on Thursday that the party would not borrow the full amount of money if it meant missing the debt target, but appeared to leave open the possibility he would tax more or find the money from other parts of government spending. His comments on Friday appear to confirm, however, that he is happy to miss the spending target to protect the debt rule. Labour has said it will take into account the £8bn the government has already pledged towards green schemes, leaving it to find an extra £20bn by the end of the parliament. Economists estimate that at the end of the current five-year period there is room to borrow an extra £13bn while still having debt falling as a proportion of GDP. Labour insists that once it gets into government the “headroom” will grow because of its pro-growth policies. If that does not happen, however, it will mean the party only has enough space to fund about two-thirds of its plan. Party officials are locked in talks over how they should present the reshaped green investment programme to voters as Starmer embarks on a national tour of British towns talking to voters. Some believe he should be more explicit about dropping the £28bn figure altogether, while others say doing so would leave him open to accusations that his promises cannot be trusted.",Keir Starmer; Politics; Green economy; Environment; UK news; Green politics; Labour; Government borrowing; Business; Economics,Politics
2023-11-22T16:19:14Z,Autumn statement leaves UK lagging on green investment,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/22/autumn-statement-green-investment-energy-climate-environment,"Jeremy Hunt began his autumn statement with a boast about the new oil and gas licences that the Conservatives had granted, implying that doing otherwise would have been a “short-term decision”. But for environmental experts listening in, his autumn statement represented little more than short-term fixes and tinkering at the edges of one of the most critical challenges a modern government has to face. Other major economies including the US and the EU have shaped their fiscal policy around the green transition, recognising that fossil fuels are the energy source of the past, and that those who first create a fully decarbonised economy are more likely to reap the financial rewards. They have each committed billions. Hunt’s response? A £960m investment by 2030 for a new “green industries growth accelerator” programme. On this, BusinessGreen’s James Murray said: “The support will be welcome, but two things to note: the funding won’t come online until 2025; and the support is orders of magnitude smaller than what is on offer in the US and EU. £960m to support five different clean tech sectors is not really going to move the dial.” The consensus by environmental groups is that the UK will not, at this rate, catch up with the rest of the world on green investment. Peter Chalkley, director at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, described Hunt’s measures as inadequate. He said: “With the US, EU and China already powering ahead, does this risk looking too little, too late? The government will likely need to do more in the coming months to calm investor nerves.” Though Hunt promised to “turbo-charge” growth and “build domestic sustainable energy”, the reality is that the economy will not grow when so many constraints are placed on the energy systems of the future. Planning restrictions still prevent onshore wind from being built, there are plans afoot to further curtail solar on farmland, and no new offshore wind projects were successful during the last Contracts for Difference auction. Meanwhile, the grid is failing to expand at the rate required for decarbonisation. Hunt in his speech promised to “speed up access to the National Grid”, but it remains to be seen whether this can be achieved at the required pace. Planning is a huge issue for new renewable energy projects, and Hunt promised that councils would be forced to refund companies who do not get a speedy response to their applications. While this will be welcomed, it does not address the fact that so many green energy projects get refused. There was also no mention of energy efficiency and insulation, despite the fact that energy bills are a huge concern for millions, and that energy efficiency is seen as one of our most vital tools for emission reduction. Chalkley said: “The chancellor had nothing to say on energy efficiency. Many had been calling for a stamp duty rebate for those who invest in upgrading their homes. Coupled with the PM’s recent row-back on requirements for landlords to provide warm, insulated homes, this leaves many families colder and poorer. This will seem particularly painful as Ofgem is set to announce another increase in energy bills tomorrow.” These measures have failed to impress climate experts. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK,said: “Today, we needed to see bold leadership and a big vision for a green industrial strategy, but all we got was tinkering at the edges. These small reforms will do nothing to tackle the scale of the problems our economy and climate face. The US, EU and China are already light-years ahead of us in supporting investment in green technology, and investors have been left ‘shaken’ by our government’s recent U-turns on net zero. This statement has done nothing to change that.” Labour’s economic offering promises to invest £28bn a year in the green economy, and freeze annual energy bills with a windfall tax, though shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves barely mentioned the climate in her response to the autumn statement. Some Labour MPs would like to see a more ambitious environmental agenda; the Green New Deal Group, which is co-chaired by Clive Lewis, MP for Norwich South, and counts Labour MPs Zarah Sultana, Nadia Whittome and Debbie Abrahams among its members, today published ideas for its alternative budget, which include bringing energy and water companies into public hands and funding local authorities to insulate and decarbonise all homes, as well as higher taxes on the wealthy to fund more green investment. These tax plans are heard elsewhere too: 19 respected groups including Greenpeace, the New Economics Foundation, Christian Aid and Patriotic Millionaires UK acknowledge the outsized contribution the wealthiest in society make to global heating and have asked for a range of measures that would ensure the wealthiest individuals and big corporate polluters pay their fair share, including a wealth tax of 1%-2% on assets over £10m that could raise up to £22bn a year. But these progressive tax plans are so far falling on closed ears. Taxing the wealthy was far from Hunt’s agenda today, and it remains to be seen whether Labour will be brave enough to attempt it.",Autumn statement 2023; Energy; Renewable energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; UK news; Jeremy Hunt,UK news
2024-01-05T06:00:26Z,Labour’s energy advisers warn against watering down £28bn green investment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/05/labour-energy-advisers-warn-against-watering-down-28bn-green-investment,"Labour’s independent energy advisers have warned the party against watering down its £28bn green spending plans in advance of its promise to create a zero carbon electricity system by 2030. Experts at the climate thinktank Ember, which provided the independent analysis underpinning Labour’s green targets, said growing international competition for low-carbon investment from the US and EU could leave the UK lagging in the global race for low-carbon energy. The research has shown that Labour’s ambitious plans to break Britain’s reliance on gas power plants, which provided more than 30% of the UK’s electricity last year, was technically possible within this decade. But the thinktank’s analysts said cutting back on spending plans would move Britain in “completely the wrong direction”. The 2030 goal would require big investments in clean energy infrastructure. Under the plans, wind and solar would make up about 70% of the electricity mix in 2030, while 30% of the UK’s electricity would come from a mixture of other low-carbon sources including new nuclear reactors, other renewables and hydrogen. Harriet Fox, an energy and climate analyst at Ember, said: “What I would say is that now is not the time to pull back on investment, when the rest of the world is starting to gear up. It’s completely the wrong direction. With the US and the EU now vying for the attention of green energy companies the UK does not want to be left behind.” Labour cast doubt on its plans to remove virtually all carbon emissions from the UK’s electricity system by the end of the decade, five years ahead of the government’s existing plans, after admitting that economic pressure on public spending could mean that its earlier £28bn promise was not sacrosanct. Sources within the party have argued that this spending target was designed to achieve more than a virtually zero-carbon power system by 2030 by creating homegrown green jobs and boosting local supply chain companies. The 2030 target could still be achieved with lower public spending by overhauling the UK’s regulatory and planning systems to help private sector investment to play a bigger role, one source said. Some of the biggest barriers to the UK’s green energy targets hinge on significant hurdles in the UK’s planning system, which has slowed the pace at which green projects can connect to the power grid. The Labour party also accused the government of overseeing an “energy security disaster” last year after it failed to attract any new investors to a key offshore wind subsidy auction. Investments in big green energy projects and grid infrastructure are expected to lower household energy bills in the long term by making cheap renewable energy more available. Research by Ember found households could save £300 a year on energy bills by 2030 by running a 98% zero carbon electricity grid. “The investment that a government makes now, will pay for itself in the future,” Fox said. “It will be paid back through lower energy bills because the greener our energy system becomes the cheaper it will be for the consumer. Investment today, will only be beneficial in the long run.”",Energy; Energy industry; Labour; Green politics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable energy; Business; Environment; UK news; Politics,Environment
2024-02-01T19:39:04Z,"Labour to ditch £28bn annual green investment pledge, party sources say",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/01/labour-to-ditch-annual-green-investment-pledge-party-sources-say,"Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are ditching Labour’s flagship policy pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, party sources have said. The sources said the party would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as already announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company, and a mass home insulation programme. But it will in effect cut its green ambitions by about two-thirds, given that the previously announced schemes are set to cost just under £10bn a year by the end of the parliament. The change, after a spate of recent government attacks portraying the £28bn figure as a likely tax rise, has been pushed for by key figures around Starmer including Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s director of campaigns, and Pat McFadden, the party’s campaigns coordinator. In a series of media interviews after speeches by Reeves and Starmer to a conference in London attended by hundreds of business executives, the shadow chancellor was repeatedly asked about the £28bn figure and declined each time to back it. Asked 10 times during an interview with Sky News, Reeves said of the plan: “I think what people need to know is that the fiscal rules are the most important thing for me … I know the importance of economic and fiscal stability and that will always come first.” One shadow minister said: “The £28bn is definitely going as a figure. It will be changed to specific outcomes linked to specific investment, rather than being a random figure to be allocated at a later date.” In a sign of how Starmer is likely to frame the decision, the source added: “It was always meant to be formally allocated before the general election, so this isn’t such a major departure really. It’s being firmed up, not dropped.” While scaling back the green prosperity plan has been under consideration for some weeks, dropping the £28bn annual target, unveiled with great fanfare by Reeves at the Labour conference in 2021, would be politically risky for Starmer and his team. Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, and his team still argue strongly for sticking with £28bn for environmental and political reasons. Senior Labour sources insisted, however, that Miliband had signed up to the idea of dropping the £28bn figure while sticking to the schemes that had already been announced. Polling released on Thursday by More in Common found that among people planning to vote Labour, the £28bn pledge is the second most popular potential manifesto promise, just behind abolishing tax breaks for private schools. Of the 3,000-plus panel, 79% said they thought the next government should increase investment in tackling the climate crisis, with two-thirds saying this should be a priority. Luke Tryl, of More in Common, said: “Labour might think that they are demonstrating fiscal prudence by dropping the £28bn climate investment, but our research shows that the investment remains a high priority for Labour voters and ditching it could well backfire.” Another source of frustration for many MPs has been the incremental abandonment of the target, with the risk that voters will think Labour has dropped it only because it has become a source of Tory attacks. One shadow minister said: “Good to drag this out as long as possible – very clever people.” The move comes after Reeves told the business conference that Labour would not raise corporation tax above its current rate of 25% during the next parliament. A day earlier she said the party would not reinstate a cap on bankers’ bonuses if it wins the next election.",Labour; Keir Starmer; Rachel Reeves; Green politics; Renewable energy; Energy; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-02-02T16:55:51Z,Senior MP all but confirms Labour has dropped £28bn green investment target,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/02/senior-mp-confirms-labour-has-dropped-28bn-target-for-green-investment,"A senior Labour frontbencher has all but confirmed the party has ditched its commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment, prompting warnings that the UK risks falling behind other nations in initiatives to tackle the climate crisis. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour would decide how much to spend on environmental programmes once it got into government, depending on the individual schemes and the state of the economy. Jones told Sky News: “The number that we will get to, if we are in government, will be subject to two things. “Firstly, it will be subject to the state of the economy. We know we’re going to inherit a bad economy from the Conservatives, but we have plans to turn that around, and of course, we hope to be successful doing that. But it will also be subject to case-by-case business cases that, if I’m the chief secretary to the Treasury in the next Labour government, I will have to sign off.” While one Labour official argued this was not a definitive ditching of the commitment, first set out in 2021, the comments mark the first time a shadow minister has publicly acknowledged the party is no longer targeting £28bn. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that the party leader, Keir Starmer, had decided to drop the commitment, which had become a totem of the party’s green ambitions but also a subject of repeated attack from the Conservatives. Jones said the amount spent “will depend on what the types of projects are, what the types of partnerships are with the private sector, and also our ability for the market, for our country, to deliver on those projects”. “The number will move around just as a matter of fact,” he said. “It will depend on the strength of the economy – we will only invest when it’s affordable – but also on a case-by-case basis working with the private sector.” Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, also later talked down the centrality of the £28bn target. Speaking during a visit in East Lothian with the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, she said: “It’s not about just throwing a figure out there willy-nilly, and saying we’ll just put that in. It’s got to be part of applying to our fiscal rules.” While insisting that Labour “want to ramp up to £28bn”, Rayner said that the party would not be hemmed in by “arbitrary” numbers. “We don’t even know what the public finances are going to be like,” she said. “We’re not just going to throw money out there.” Party officials have been discussing for weeks what to do about the £28bn commitment, which has been steadily scaled back since the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unveiled it. Last year, Reeves said the target would be hit only in the second half of the parliament, and then only if the party could fulfil its economic promise to have debt falling as a share of economic output by the end of a five-year period. However, Andrew Simms, the director of the New Weather Institute thinktank, said a lack of ambition over such investment risked a UK “trapped with polluting, expensive, unhealthy and increasingly inefficient infrastructure, in everything from housing to transport and energy systems”. He said: “It means Britain will fall behind other nations and be more vulnerable to extreme weather events, energy price volatility and the health threats of global heating. “Worst of all, it will be a false economy, because the costs of not investing are catastrophically higher than climate-proofing the economy in a way that also pays for itself by lowering bills, creating jobs, raising air quality and improving environmental wellbeing.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the demise of the £28bn figure meant “Labour will fail to clarify for voters what they really stand for”. She said: “They risk leaving the door wide open for the EU, US and China to overtake us in the global green tech race. And they will provide few assurances about how high bills, freezing cold homes, toxic air pollution, and unreliable public transport aren’t just here to stay.” In recent weeks Starmer has continued to stick by the £28bn target, even while downgrading it from a “pledge” to an “ambition”.",Labour; Green politics; Environment; Politics; UK news; Green economy,Politics
2024-01-19T18:33:33Z,Labour to hold crunch talks on future of £28bn green investment plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/19/labour-to-hold-crunch-talks-on-future-of-28bn-green-investment-plan,"Senior Labour officials are to hold crunch meetings on the future of the party’s pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, amid reports Keir Starmer is preparing to ditch the entire plan. Party sources said on Friday that officials would meet in the coming days to discuss the green prosperity plan, which would see a Labour government spend £28bn on environmental schemes each year by the second half of the next parliament. A Labour spokesperson said Starmer remained committed to the plan after the Sun reported he had decided to drop it altogether. Sources have told the Guardian that the Labour leadership is still considering abandoning it if they decide it is likely to damage them in an election campaign. One said: “There are discussions going on about this at official and political levels. There are more meetings to come this week but a final decision has not been made yet.” A spokesperson for Starmer said: “We are committed to Labour’s green prosperity plan to drive growth and create jobs, including our plan to ramp up to £28bn of annual investment in the second half of the parliament, subject to our fiscal rules.” Rachel Reeves first announced the spending plans in 2021, saying it would be funded by extra borrowing and would make her the country’s “first green chancellor”. But earlier this year the shadow chancellor scaled it back, saying the party would hit its target only in the second half of the parliament – and only if it could still show debt was falling as a proportion of economic output in five years’ time. Current projections would give the party only an additional £13bn to spend on the green plan in five years’ time, although Labour officials said their plans to stimulate economic growth would give them more money to play with than currently forecast. Starmer has spent much of the past few weeks insisting he remains committed to the plan and does not intend to scale it back further. Earlier this month he told Sky News he was willing to have a public fight with the Conservatives over the idea of borrowing money to invest in the economy. Last week he told the BBC: “I am very pleased to make the case for investment in the future, and that’s why we will invest £28bn in total by the second half to the parliament, subject of course to what the government’s already assigned to put in on green prosperity, and of course within our fiscal rules.” On Tuesday the Labour leader met union leaders, where he repeated his insistence that he would not drop the green scheme. One person briefed on the meeting said union chiefs had been impressed by the strength of his commitment to the scheme. Many in the party are worried about what will happen at the next budget, when Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce more tax cuts that will eat further into the fiscal headroom. Some Labour MPs believe Starmer is preparing to drop the policy after the budget and blame it on the government. And they believe that the Conservatives are preparing to run an election campaign heavily featuring Labour’s green policies and arguing that they will mean tax rises in the future. One Labour MP said: “Starmer’s office thinks there’s an attack coming – Labour won’t cut your taxes and will spend your money on windmills.” Labour MPs will meet on Monday, where backbenchers will press the party leadership for more concrete answers on the future of the plan.",Labour; Green economy; Rachel Reeves; Keir Starmer; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-01-15T12:27:07Z,Energy from data centres could heat UK swimming pools after green investment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/15/energy-innovation-could-heat-150-uk-swimming-pools-after-200m-investment,"Up to 150 public swimming pools in the UK could be offered an innovative way to cut their energy bills by recycling heat from computer data processing centres after a £200m investment by Octopus Energy into a green tech firm. The tech startup Deep Green has already piloted using energy from processing centres to heat swimming pools, with the concept trialled last year in Exmouth, Devon. The new investment announced on Monday is likely to result in the energy solution expanded to leisure centres across the country over the next two years. Mark Bjornsgaard, the chief executive of Deep Green, said the idea could go well beyond providing energy for swimming pools. “If just 1% of the data centre demand in the UK operated on our servers, we could deploy in every public pool in the country. The backing from Octopus is the first step,” he said. “This is no longer just about pools, however. We have received interest from a wide range of other potential partners who could make use of our free heat, such as district heating networks.” Processing data generates a lot of wasted heat, which Deep Green’s scheme aims to repurpose to provide free heat for energy-intensive organisations such as leisure centres, which have been affected by soaring bills in the cost of living crisis, with many having to close or cut hours. Guardian research last year revealed England had lost almost 400 swimming pools since 2010, with parts of the country with the greatest health needs losing out the most. In Exmouth, the swimming pool was able to slash its heating bill by more than 60%. In return, Deep Green gets free cooling which provides it with a significant competitive edge over traditional data centres. Installed on-site, Deep Green data centres do not require additional grid upgrades or planning permission and can be up and running in a matter of weeks, the company says. The technique works for the data centre and the pool – the heat from the computers warms the water and the transfer of heat into the pool cools the computers. The new investment came via Octopus’s dedicated energy transition fund. Zoisa North-Bond, the chief executive of Octopus Energy Generation, said: “To tackle the energy crisis head-on, we need innovative solutions to unusual problems. By using excess heat from data centres to slash energy bills for communities across the UK, Deep Green solves two problems with one solution. We’re looking forward to rapidly rolling this out and positively impacting even more people as we drive towards a cleaner, cheaper energy future.” Bjornsgaard added: “Placing data centres within the fabric of society transforms the waste heat they produce into a valuable resource that benefits communities. “The data centre sector is rightly facing scrutiny about its growing energy demand and associated carbon emissions. Our data centres are highly energy efficient and support local communities with free heat.”",Energy; Renewable energy; Environment; Business; UK news; Swimming; Technology; Recycling,Environment
2024-02-08T16:31:00Z,CBI tells Jeremy Hunt to focus on green investment instead of tax cuts in budget,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/08/cbi-tells-hunt-to-focus-on-green-investment-instead-of-tax-cuts-in-budget,"A leading business lobby group has urged Jeremy Hunt to resist calls for large-scale tax cuts in his budget next month, saying the government needs to avoid “short-termism” and devote spending to projects that boost the economy. Adding its voice to a growing clamour for green investment, the Confederation of British Industry said pre-election giveaways at the budget should be kept to a minimum to allow for a surge in spending to achieve net zero. Speaking on Thursday at a conference in Westminster, the CBI boss, Rain Newton-Smith, said the government should increase spending on green targets from £10bn a year to £50bn a year by 2030. “There is a need for growth that is sustainable, not fuelled by pre-election giveaways,” she said. “That is predicated on a bedrock of stability. That focuses on the UK’s amazing capabilities and sets out a clear, long-term plan to make the most of them. Which we stick to. We can even call it an industrial strategy.” The Treasury is expected to have about £20bn extra to spend over the next five years when Hunt delivers his second budget on 6 March. Economic growth is expected to improve in 2024 as inflation and interest rates fall and consumer and business confidence improve, lifting tax receipts and boosting the government’s finances. Hunt could use this “headroom” to reduce government debts, offer tax cuts or ease a planned austerity drive that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said would be “more painful” than during the decade of belt-tightening under George Osborne. Conservative backbenchers have lobbied strongly for Hunt to devote any spare funds to support tax cuts in order to close a 20-point polling gap with Labour, which on current trends is on course to win majority at the next general election. Cuts to inheritance tax, national insurance, income tax and stamp duty are among the pre-election giveaways Hunt has been urged by Conservative MPs and backers to consider. However, polling suggests there is little support for tax cuts paid for by inflicting further damage to public services. Last month, the International Monetary Fund said Hunt should focus on repairing the public finances in the wake of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine to free-up funds to meet growing spending pressures, including on health and the climate crisis. Hunt has refused to back higher investment spending, though he said the IMF was right to say “untargeted tax cuts that are just crowd pleasers” were not a good idea, in a thinly veiled reference to Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget in September 2022, when unfunded tax cuts panicked financial markets and sent UK borrowing costs surging. In recent interviews with business leaders, the CBI found that one-third of firms believed their investment plans had foundered “because of UK-specific factors”. It also found that 90% of UK-owned firms “expressed a negative view about the UK as a place to invest”. Newton-Smith said: “There was a sense that without bold action, the UK’s competitiveness is slowing drifting away.” Keir Starmer has pledged to increase spending on green infrastructure, including investments in car battery plants, renewable energy and home insulation. However, he is expected to ditch a commitment to spend £28bn by the end of the next parliament. Newton-Smith’s intervention comes as the CBI attempts to reassert itself as the voice of British business after a year of turmoil. The lobby group suffered an exodus of members after revelations about sexual misconduct were published in the Guardian last spring. Newton-Smith said: “As one business leader told me, they don’t want to see tax cuts driven by short-termism, which leads to higher interest rates. They want stability so they can invest for the future. “To fund our public services with an ageing population, we must keep large-scale tax cuts off the table. “We must build resilience in our economy and society, while enabling us to play our part in mitigating climate change. And that takes investment – both public and private. “Above all, it must come from real investment in people’s skills and capabilities, in infrastructure and innovation. “In other words, it can’t come from short-termism or tinkering around the edges.”",Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Budget 2024 (spring); Jeremy Hunt; Economic policy; Economics; UK news; Business,Business
2023-08-11T10:00:34Z,Green investment boom and electric car sales: six key things about Biden’s climate bill,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/biden-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act,"The US’ first serious legislative attempt to tackle the climate crisis, the Inflation Reduction Act, is hitting its first anniversary both lauded for turbocharging a seismic shift to clean energy while also weathering serious attack from Republicans. Joe Biden hailed the bill, which despite its name is at heart a major shove towards a future dominated by renewable energy and electric vehicles, as “one of the most significant laws in our history” when signing it on 16 August last year. And the White House is trying to use the first year marker to extol it as a pivotal moment in tackling the climate emergency. “It’s the largest investment in clean energy in American history, and I would argue in world history, to tackle the climate crisis,” John Podesta, Biden’s chief clean energy advisor, told the Guardian. “With any legislation it takes time to get traction, but this is performing above expectations.” Podesta said there has been an “enormous response” in take-up for the tax credits that festoon the $369bn bill, directed at zero-carbon energy projects such as solar, wind and nuclear, grants for bring renewables manufacturing to the US and consumer incentives to purchase electric cars, heat pumps and electric stoves. Here are the key points to know about the impact of the act so far as it approaches its anniversary on 16 August: A boom in clean energy investment There has been around $278bn in new clean energy investments, creating more than 170,000 jobs, across the US in the first year of the Inflation Reduction Act, according to an estimate by the advocacy group Climate Power. The White House claims that there will be twice as much wind, solar and battery storage deployment over the next seven years than if the bill was never enacted, with companies already spending twice as much on new manufacturing facilities as they were pre-IRA. “It’s been more impactful than I or other observers would’ve thought,” said James Stock, a climate economist at Harvard University. Stock said that while the Inflation Reduction Act won’t by itself eliminate planet-heating emissions in the US, it is the “first substantive step” towards doing so and should help propagate the next generation of hoped-for clean fuels, such as hydrogen, in its 10-year lifespan. “As the tax credits are uncapped, too, we will see a lot more invested than we expected,” he said. “We could easily see $800bn to $1.2tn.” More people are buying electric vehicles The Inflation Reduction Act includes rebates of up to $7,500 for buying an electric vehicle, and this incentive appears to be paying off – EV sales are set to top 1m in the US for the first time this year. Moreover, over half of US drivers are considering an EV for their next purchase, polling has shown. This transition isn’t without its hurdles, however – there has been a shortage of key parts in the EV supply chain, many models still remain prohibitively expensive and unions have been unhappy at the lack of worker protections for many of the new plants that are popping up. Climate advocates, meanwhile, have questioned why similarly strong support hasn’t been given to public transit or e-bikes to help get people out of cars altogether. It will slash US emissions, but not by enough The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases and the Inflation Reduction Act is widely forecast to slash these emissions, by as much as 48% by 2035, from 2005 levels, according to one analysis. These forecasts have a relatively wide range of estimates due to uncertainties such as economic growth but even in the most optimistic scenario the US will require further measures if it is to get to net zero emissions by 2050, as scientists have said is imperative if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. “Even though we passed the IRA you ain’t seen nothing yet,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, in promising a fresh climate bill recently. But given the riven nature of US politics, the prospects of such legislation is remote in the near term. A more likely way to bridge the emissions gap will be a raft of regulatory actions by the Environmental Protection Agency, such as new standards to cut pollution from cars, trucks and power plants, as well as progress by individual states. “We basically need everything to go right,” said John Larsen, a partner at Rhodium group, an energy analysis organization. The IRA has so far escaped Republican cuts – but Biden is fighting to get credit The legislation was a breakthrough moment following decades of obfuscation and delay by Congress despite increasingly frantic warnings by climate scientists over global heating, with the bill itself borne from months of torturous, comprise-laden negotiations with Joe Manchin, the coal baron senator from West Virginia who held a swing vote for its passage. But the legislation has already faced the threat of repeal from Republicans, who universally voted against it, with the GOP’s first bill after gaining control of the House of Representatives this year gutting key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act. This is despite the majority of clean energy investments flowing to Republican-led districts. Biden has also faced the ire of climate progressives for somewhat undercutting his landmark moment with an aggressive giveaway of oil and gas drilling leases on public land, including the controversial Willow oil project in Alaska, and for incentivizing the use of technologies such as carbon capture that have been criticized as an unproven distraction at a time when the world is baking under record heatwaves. “Biden has an atrocious track record on fossil fuels, and that needs to change,” said Jean Su, an attorney and climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity who called on Biden to declare a climate emergency. There needs to be a “sea-change in this administration’s approach” on the climate crisis, according to Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator. “No more green lighting fossil gas projects. No more stalling on a climate emergency. Now is the time for us to live up to the full promise of the Inflation Reduction Act.” Polling shows the majority of American voters disapprove of Biden’s handling of the climate crisis and only three in 10 have heard that much about the Inflation Reduction Act at all. Such perceptions will need to be turned around if the US president is to help secure the legacy of the bill in next year’s election. “We are going at a record clip to try to address this climate crisis,” said White House adviser Podesta. “I know people want us to hurry up and I wish we could produce a net zero economy immediately but this is a global transition that’s never occurred in human history. We need to get this job done.” The IRA act has not pleased leaders in the EU who have attacked it for being “protectionist” though some have argued they should instead be investing along similar lines. Clean energy investment has gone to red states No Republican voted for the Inflation Reduction Act but most of the investment that has been triggered by the bill has been funneled into projects in GOP-held congressional districts. An emerging “battery belt” is forming in the US south, with battery and electric vehicle plants popping up in states such as Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. “The IRA has been absolutely critical for us in terms of giving market certainties to go bold and big in our investment,” said a spokesperson for QCells, a solar manufacturer that has embarked upon a major expansion in Georgia. Renewables are booming – but there’s a transmission bottleneck If the future wasn’t renewables before the IRA, it certainly is now – more than 80% of new electricity capacity this year will come from wind, solar and battery storage, according to federal government forecasts. The framers of the legislation hoped it will create a sort of virtuous circle whereby more renewable capacity will push down the cost of already cheap clean energy sources, seeding yet further renewable deployment. Solar panels may be dotting California and wind turbines sprouting off the east coast, but without the unglamorous build-out of transmission lines much of the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act may be lost. Not only is there a lack of physical poles and wires to shift clean energy from one part of the country to another, many clean energy projects are facing interminable waits, lasting several years, to be connected to the grid at all. There is more than 1,250 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity actively seeking grid connection, which is about equal to the entire existing US power plant fleet. “Something’s going to have to change to get this deployment online,” said Larsen. “Beyond that it will be about building stuff at scale, very, very quickly.”",Joe Biden; Biden administration; Environment; US politics; Democrats; US news; US Environmental Protection Agency; World news; Climate crisis,US news
2023-05-02T05:00:54Z,"Green investment funds pushing money into fossil fuel firms, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/green-investment-funds-pushing-money-into-fossil-fuel-firms-research-finds,"Investment funds branded as green or socially responsible are being used by some of the world’s largest asset managers to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in fossil fuel companies, according to a report. The research by the Common Wealth thinktank showed that the US fund managers BlackRock and State Street and the UK-based Legal &amp; General were among asset managers to use funds with an “environment, social and governance” (ESG) label to invest in fossil fuel firms. The leftwing thinktank said that despite claims that ESG funds offer a green and socially responsible option for investors, “the research shows these funds are significantly exposed to fossil fuel companies”. Between February and April this year, BlackRock, State Street and Legal &amp; General alone were found to hold $1bn (£800m) in bonds issued by fossil fuel companies in their ESG funds. Research by Sophie Flinders, a data analyst, found that more broadly ESG funds had invested more than $1.5bn in the bonds of top coal, oil and gas companies – raising questions about sustainability claims made by asset managers. ESG funds account for a small portion of the world’s assets under management, which reached $126tn in 2022, according to the data provider Morningstar. A report by the accountancy firm PwC last year said fund managers were expected to increase their ESG-related assets under management to $33.9tn by 2026, from $18.4tn in 2021. However, critics of ESG have accused the asset management industry of “greenwashing” as it seeks to attract ethical investors. Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said existing financial sector strategies failed to offer a sufficient response to the climate emergency – with the scale of investment in clean energy through ESG funds falling far short of what was needed. “The findings, though shocking, are not unexpected,” he said. “This is a feature rather than a bug from the ESG logic, which is concerned less with driving real material change in the economy, including decarbonisation, and instead is focused on managing financial risk and reducing financial impacts.” Flinders used lists of bonds compiled by the German campaign group Urgewald, before cross-checking them with data from the financial information provider Refinitiv eMaxx at a fund level to arrive at a figure for the value of ESG bonds invested in fossil fuel firms. State Street did not respond to a request for comment. BlackRock said it clearly disclosed the objectives of its funds. A spokesperson said its funds “provide investors with choice in how they make sustainable investments, whether that be in clean energy, investments that explicitly exclude fossil fuels or those that are more broadly diversified, including investments in issuers that are actively transitioning.” Legal &amp; General Investment Management said it invested in fossil fuel firms to actively encourage their transition to more sustainable energy sources. It argued that some coalmining businesses invested in renewable energy, and that with “active engagement” investors could speed up the shift away from fossil fuels. A spokesperson said: “We believe investing to support companies to make the transition to a low-carbon world will have a greater impact on real-economy emissions than simply divesting.”",Investing; Investment funds; Investments; Financial sector; Business; Money; Corporate governance; Ethical business; Ethical money; Bonds; Bonds; Fossil fuels; Environment; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Oil; Energy industry,Business
2024-03-16T06:00:05Z,Lib Dems to open conference with call to copy Biden’s tax on share buybacks,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/16/lib-dems-to-open-conference-with-call-to-copy-bidens-tax-on-share-buybacks,"The Liberal Democrats are to kick off their spring conference with a call for the UK to mimic Joe Biden’s tax on share buybacks by big corporations, as the party prepares for a further push into Conservative-held “blue wall” seats before the election. The plan, the set-piece announcement of Saturday’s first full day of the gathering in York, would impose a 4% tax on any share buybacks by FTSE-100 companies, which on the basis of the past two years of such activities would raise about £2bn annually. As a taxation idea, this would have the appeal of being most probably popular, given that critics of share buybacks say the practice – used to inflate share prices – is often done at the expense of spending on investment, and can be a way for executives to cash in on their stakes. The potential amount it would raise is also close to that which would have been gathered by Labour’s proposed ending of non-domiciled tax status, an idea partly stolen by Jeremy Hunt in this month’s budget. In a speech to the conference, the Lib Dems’ Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, is to urge the UK to follow the example of Biden, who introduced a 1% buyback levy in 2022 and has just announced his intention to raise this to 4%. The party argues that many buybacks are launched by corporations in areas such as banking, food and oil and gas, and that in the latter case the money could instead be used for more investment in green energy. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “Neither the Conservative government or Labour party have explained how they will fund public services fairly after the next election. Large corporations from fossil fuel giants to banks are making huge profits off the back of families facing soaring energy bills, mortgage payments and food prices. It is only fair that we ask these companies to pay more in tax. “This new levy would not just raise much-needed money for public services, it would encourage investment, help create jobs and boost growth including in the green industries of the future.” Even with Rishi Sunak having now ruled out a 2 May election, the conference will be heavily focused on campaign planning, including a training session for Lib Dem candidates in so-called ghost constituencies – either those without an MP, as they are newly created under boundary changes, or where the sitting Tory is standing down. The party has previously said that in so-called blue wall commuter belt target seats such as Esher and Walton in Surrey, departing incumbents – in Esher’s case, Dominic Raab – are largely absent. It says its candidate in Esher, Monica Harding, is acting like the de facto MP, opening events and holding surgeries. The training session, with the perhaps inevitable title of Ghostbusters, will give tips to other candidates on how to fill such a void, seen as a way to boost their electoral chances. “When we win seats it’s because we have proved we are the main challengers to the Conservatives, and then that we work hard,” one Lib Dem official said. “We need two groups of voters: those who want a local champion and the ones who want to get the Tories out. This covers both.” Davey, in his speech to the conference on Sunday morning, will try to go beyond this tactical focus and explain why, ideologically, people should back the party. “He will argue the case for having more Lib Dem MPs in parliament, whoever wins,” the official said. “With Labour it can feel like they are just waiting their turn to govern in the same way. We’re the party which would change the whole broken system.”",Liberal Democrat conference; Liberal Democrats; Ed Davey; Tax and spending; Business; Politics; UK news,Politics
2025-08-05T14:04:29Z,BP begins costs review as quarterly profits of £1.77bn beat forecast,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/05/bp-begins-costs-review-177bn-quarterly-profits,"The oil and gas group BP is launching a fresh cost-cutting scheme, despite reporting better-than-expected profits, as it tries to do more for its shareholders to fend off pressure from activist investors. The fossil fuel company said it would begin a fresh review of its business when its new chair, Albert Manifold, joins the board in September. BP reported a rise in profits to $2.35bn (£1.77bn) between April and June, a drop of 15% on the same period a year earlier when the company benefited from higher oil and gas prices. However, it was an increase on the $1.38bn reported in the January to March quarter, and beat analysts’ estimates of $1.8bn underlying profits. Murray Auchincloss, BP’s chief executive, said in a statement on Tuesday that the FTSE 100 company had performed well “operationally and strategically”, even though crude oil is trading at about 10% lower than it was in the first quarter. Currently trading at just under $66 a barrel, Brent crude prices are lower than last year’s average of $80 a barrel. Auchincloss added: “So far this year we’ve brought five new oil and gas major projects onstream, sanctioned four more and made 10 exploration discoveries.” Disclosing a 4% increase in the shareholder dividend to 8.32 cents in the first quarter, he said: “BP can and will do better for its investors.” The CEO said he and Manifold, the former boss of the building material company CRH who takes the reins on 1 October, had agreed to conduct a review of its businesses; this year BP revealed it would cut more than $5bn from its green investment plan. Under the embattled current chair, Helge Lund, BP invested heavily in the offshore wind industry, which has been subject to increasing costs in recent years, at the same time as its rivals took advantage of the surge in fossil fuel prices after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. BP’s latest overhaul was just six months ago, when Auchincloss promised to “fundamentally reset” the oil company’s strategy. This revamp met little investor enthusiasm and failed to increase its share price. BP’s shares are trading about 10% lower than at the time of Auchincloss’s announcement. The company is also under pressure from Elliott Management, the feared New York hedge fund known for its attempts to shake up listed companies, which has built up a stake in BP after growing dissatisfaction among shareholders over the company’s plans to curb its fossil fuel production in favour of green investments. The activist investor has been pushing BP to cut its operating expenses more aggressively and has been demanding more cost reductions. Lund’s forthcoming departure helps BP to sever ties with its botched attempt to reinvent itself as a net zero energy company, forged during Lund’s tenure and that of its former chief executive Bernard Looney. Russ Mould, an investment director at broker AJ Bell, said: “At present BP still has a modestly larger workforce than Shell – based on the companies’ respective last reported headcounts – despite being a significantly smaller business in terms of its valuation and annual revenue.” BP said this week it had made its largest oil and gas discovery of the past 25 years off the coast of Brazil at a time when it is shifting away from renewables and refocusing on fossil fuels. The company is carrying out tests at the Santos basin, which is located in deep waters. It marks its 10th oil discovery of the year and could be its largest since its discovery at the Shah Deniz gasfield in Azerbaijan in 1999.",BP; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Business; UK news; Oil; Commodities,Business
2025-04-11T06:00:01Z,Will global climate action be a casualty of Trump’s tariffs?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/11/global-climate-action-casualty-trump-tariffs,"Donald Trump’s upending of the global economy has raised fears that climate action could emerge as a casualty of the trade war. In the week that has followed “liberation day”, economic experts have warned that the swathe of tariffs could trigger a global economic recession, with far-reaching consequences for investors – including those behind the green energy projects needed to meet climate goals. Fears of a prolonged global recession have also tanked oil and gas prices, making it cheaper to pollute and more difficult to justify investment in clean alternatives such as electric vehicles and low-carbon heating to financially hard-hit households. But chief among the concerns is Trump’s decision to level his most aggressive trade tariffs against China – the world’s largest manufacturer of clean energy technologies – which threatens to throttle green investment in the US, the world’s second-largest carbon-emitter. ‘A tragedy for the US’ The US is expected to lag farther behind the rest of the world in developing clean power technologies by cutting off its access to cheap, clean energy tech developed in China. This is a fresh blow to green energy developers in the US, still reeling from the Trump administration’s vow to roll back the Biden era’s green incentives. Leslie Abrahams, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC, said the tariffs would probably hinder the rollout of clean energy in the US and push the country to the margins of the global market. Specifically, they are expected to drive up the price of developing clean power, because to date the US has been heavily reliant on importing clean power technologies. “And not just imports of the final goods. Even the manufacturing that we do in the United States relies on imported components,” she said. The US government’s goal to develop its manufacturing base by opening new factories could make these components available domestically, but it is likely to take time. It will also come at considerable cost, because the materials typically imported to build these factories – cement, steel, aluminium – will be subject to tariffs too, Abrahams said. “At the same time there are broader, global economic implications that might make it difficult to access inexpensive capital to build,” she added. Investors who had previously shown an interest in the US under the green-friendly Biden administration are likely to balk at the aggressively anti-green messages from the White House. Abrahams said this would mean a weaker appetite for investment in rolling out green projects across the US, and in the research and development of early-stage clean technologies of the future. This is likely to have long-term implications for the US position in the global green energy market, meaning it will “cede some of our potential market share abroad”, Abrahams added. Instead, countries like China are likely to divert sales of their clean energy tech away from the US to other countries eager to develop green energy, Abrahams said. “So on the one hand, that should help to accelerate adoption of clean energy in those countries, which is good for emissions, but for the US, that is future market share that we’re ceding,” she said. ‘Clean energy is unstoppable, with or without Trump’ It’s important to distinguish between the US and the rest of the world, according to Kingsmill Bond, a strategist for the energy thinktank Ember. “The more the US cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the more the rest of the world will get on with things and the US will be left behind. This is a tragedy for the clean energy industry in the US, but for everyone else there are opportunities,” he said. Analysis by the climate campaign group 350.org has found that despite rising costs and falling green investment in the US, Trump’s trade war will not affect the energy transition and renewables trade globally. It said the US was already “merely a footnote, not a global player” in the race to end the use of fossil fuels. Only 4% of China’s clean tech exports go to the US, it said, in a trade sector where sales volume grew by about 30% last year. “Trump’s tariffs won’t slow the global energy transition – they’ll only hurt ordinary people, particularly Americans,” said Andreas Sieber, an associate director at 350.org. “The transition to renewables is unstoppable, with or without him. His latest move does little to impact the booming clean energy market but will isolate the US and drive up costs for American consumers.” One senior executive at a big European renewable energy company said developers were likely to press on with existing US projects but in future would probablyinvest in other markets. “So we won’t be doing less, we’ll just be going somewhere else,” said the executive, who asked not to be named. “There is no shortage of demand for clean energy projects globally, so we’re not scaling back our ambitions. And excluding the US could make stretched supply chains easier to manage.” Countries likely to benefit from the fresh attention of renewable energy investors include burgeoning markets in south-east Asia, where fossil fuel reliance remains high and demand for energy is rocketing. Australia and Brazil have also emerged as countries that stand to gain. “In times like these, countries will be increasingly on the hunt for domestic solutions,” Bond said. “And that means clean energy and local supply chains. There are always climate reasons to go green, but there are national security reasons now too.” The challenge for governments hoping to seize the opportunity provided by the US green retreat will be to assure rattled investors that they offer a safe place to invest in the climate agenda. Dhara Vyas, the chief executive of Energy UK, the UK industry’s trade body, said: “Certainty has always been the thing that investors say they need. The UK is seen as a stable country with a stable government, but now more than ever we need to double down on giving certainty to investors.” “Investors do like certainty,” Bond agreed. “But they also like growth and opportunity, so that’s why there is some confidence that they will continue to deploy capital in the sector.” ‘The US still matters’ Although the green investment slowdown may be largely limited to the US, this still poses concerns for global climate progress, according to Marina Domingues, the head of new energies for the consultancy Rystad Energy. “The US is a huge emitter country. So everything the US does still really matters to the global energy transition and how we account for CO2,” she said. The US is the second most polluting country in the world, behind China, which produces almost three times its carbon emissions. But the US’s green retreat comes at a time when the country was planning to substantially increase its domestic energy demand. After years of relatively steady energy demand, Rystad predicts a 10% growth in US electricity consumption from a boom in AI datacentres alone. The economy is also likely to require more energy to power an increase in domestic manufacturing as imports from China dwindle. In the absence of a growing energy industry, this is likely to come from fossil fuels, meaning growing climate emissions. The US is expected to make use of its abundance of shale gas, but it is planning to use more coal in the future too. In the same week that Trump set out his tariffs, he signed four executive orders aimed at preventing the US from phasing out coal, in what climate campaigners at 350.org described as an “abuse of power”. Anne Jellema, the group’s executive director, said: “President Trump’s latest attempt to force-feed coal to the US is a dangerous fantasy that endangers our health, our economy and our future.”",Climate crisis; Energy industry; Green economy; Energy; Energy efficiency; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Commodities; Fossil fuels; Business; Environment; China; Trump tariffs; Trump administration; Donald Trump; US politics; World news; Asia Pacific; Pollution; Green politics,Environment
2024-02-08T19:40:11Z,Dropping of £28bn pledge marks a shift in Reeves’s entire economic philosophy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/scaled-back-28bn-pledge-marks-a-shift-in-reevess-entire-economic-philosophy,"When Rachel Reeves announced Labour’s £28bn climate plan in 2021, she was so confident it was the right thing to do that she issued a dire warning about what would happen if the scheme was held up or scaled back. “The greatest cost to our public finances, as well as to our planet, will be if we delay and let the costs mount up for future generations to pay,” she told a packed hall at the party conference in Brighton. On Thursday, Reeves stood alongside the party leader, Keir Starmer, in front of about 30 journalists in a draughty room in parliament and reversed all of that. The £28bn was gone, as was the reasoning behind it. “We want to bring jobs to Britain, to bring energy bills down, to boost our energy security, and also to decarbonise the economy,” Reeves told reporters. “If you don’t need to spend £28bn in doing that, that’s great.” The reversal of Labour’s central economic and environmental policy has come after weeks of agonised decision-making by Starmer and Reeves, in conjunction with Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary. Thursday’s confirmation that the policy would be cut back to half its original scale is a key moment in Starmer’s leadership and could redefine the election campaign. It also marks a shift in Reeves’s entire economic philosophy. No longer is the shadow chancellor arguing for public investment for its own sake as a way to stimulate the economy and galvanise private capital. Instead, she says she wants to achieve Labour’s green targets using as little public money as possible. The story of how that change came about in the course of just over two years is indicative of the broader shift in approach from Starmer and Reeves in that time, as they have enacted a series of U-turns in an attempt to shed the baggage they fear could weigh them down in an election contest. From determination to doubt Reeves’s initial announcement in 2021 was regarded in senior Labour circles as a triumph. The Brighton conference had been fractious until then. The party had been plagued by splits between Starmer and Miliband on the question of whether energy companies should be nationalised. Senior figures had been followed wherever they went by protesters calling for a “green new deal”. The party’s members had defied the leadership by voting for a motion calling for a “socialist green new deal”. Reeves’s announcement brought an end to all that, answering the criticisms that Labour did not have a green policy and that it did not have an economic strategy. “I am committing the next Labour government to an additional £28bn of capital investment in our country’s green transition for each and every year of this decade,” she told delegates. “I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain’s first green chancellor.” Labour stuck to the plan for many months. At the party conference a year later, Starmer announced that a significant chunk of the money would be spent on a new national energy company, to be known as Great British Energy. Other schemes included a new sovereign wealth fund to invest in green schemes and a £6bn-a-year home insulation scheme to improve the energy efficiency of 19m properties. Gradually however, senior Labour figures became nervous. After Liz Truss’s turbulent 45 days in power, Labour’s pitch to the electors was no longer to be the party of radical change, but instead to offer reassurance where the Conservatives offered turmoil. Truss’s economic plans, coupled with the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, sent interest rates on UK government debt spiking from just over 1% at the beginning of 2022 to 4.5% by the middle of 2023. Reeves was growing concerned about the economic consequences of the £28bn policy, especially after a crucial meeting she had in Washington DC in June 2023 with Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary. People briefed on that meeting have told the Guardian that Yellen warned Reeves against making the mistake the Biden administration had of announcing major new climate investments without first reforming planning laws so they could get built. Reeves came back from that trip determined to make a change. She wrote an article for the Times announcing the £28bn figure would not be hit until the second half of the parliament, and that it would only be hit if Labour could meet its promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output at the end of a five-year period. Given the forecasts at the time predicted the government could borrow only an additional £6bn a year and still have debt falling in that time period, Reeves’s announcement all but killed her original policy. Decision time And yet Labour politicians continued to use the £28bn figure, putting the party in the awkward position of defending a figure they had no intention of hitting and could not say how it would be spent. Shadow ministers and advisers began pitching their ideas for how to change the policy. Some wanted to junk it altogether. Others wanted to use the money to fund other investment schemes, such as new schools and roads. Some suggested putting all the existing spending commitments in a single bill and abandoning the rest. As those around Starmer argued over what should happen, the leader continued to defend it publicly. “‘It’s absolutely clear to me that the Tories are trying to weaponise this issue, the £28bn,” he said in January. “This is a fight I want to have … If they want that fight on borrow-to-invest, I’m absolutely up for that fight.” Privately however, Starmer was becoming convinced of the need to make a change. He, Reeves and Miliband began working intensively on a compromise which would protect existing schemes such as GB Energy and the sovereign wealth fund, but scale back the home insulation scheme and clarify that no further spending would be announced. Labour officials insisted on Thursday the three had developed the plan together, downplaying talk of a split at the top of the party. The final decision was reached jointly just days ago, they added. Some of Starmer’s advisers urged him to wait until after Jeremy Hunt’s budget to make the final decision, not least because the chancellor was promising more tax cuts which would further reduce the room to borrow. The Labour leader, however, had told shadow ministers to have their manifesto policies ready by Thursday in case of a May election, so he knew a decision would have to be taken by then. Besides, reports in the Guardian and elsewhere about the fate of the £28bn were making it increasingly hard to hold the line. “Today is the deadline for shadow cabinet teams to get their proposals in and fully funded so we can begin the next stage of the process of the manifesto,” he told reporters on Thursday. “We knew we would have to get to a decision on this around about now.” Political ramifications The eventual U-turn was met with anger among green campaigners and some MPs, including the former shadow energy secretary Barry Gardiner, who called it “economically illiterate, environmentally irresponsible and politically jejune”. And while the party has recommitted to parts of its investment schemes, important question remain. Can Labour really decarbonise Britain’s energy sector by 2030 with this level of spending? What does the reduction in the home insulation programme mean for the legal requirement to eradicate fuel poverty by 2030? Many in Labour expressed relief at the change, however. “At least we know what the policy is now,” said one shadow minister. “At least we have something to defend.” But if Labour believes it now has something to defend, the Tories insist they still have something to attack. Senior advisers to Rishi Sunak insisted on Thursday they intended to keep using the £28bn figure, arguing Labour would have to end up spending that much when they realised they might miss their green targets. “Nothing has changed,” said one. But in a sign of how Thursday’s announcement by Starmer has made life more difficult for his opponents, the Conservatives were simultaneously accusing him of enacting another “flip-flop”. “The problem is the Tories now have to decide,” said one Labour figure. “Is it that nothing has changed, or have we flip-flopped? They can’t get their attack right.”",Labour; Rachel Reeves; Keir Starmer; Ed Miliband; Green politics; Politics; Environment; UK news,Politics
2024-02-06T10:47:29Z,Starmer ‘unwavering’ over Labour green pledge despite claims party dropping it,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/06/keir-starmer-labours-28bn-green-investment-desperately-needed,"Keir Starmer has said Labour’s policy pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment is “desperately needed,” as he re-opened an issue that has become a source of tension in the party. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, were planning to ditch the pledge, party sources had said as recently as last week, while the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury all but confirmed the move a day later. However, comments from Starmer broadcast on Tuesday morning were welcomed by advocates of the pledge as a “recommitment” at a time when other senior party figures had declined to use the figure. The Labour leader said in an interview with Times Radio that he had been “unwavering” in relation to the party’s green energy plans and denied he was “scaling back” policies as this year’s general election looms. “We’re going to need investment, that’s where the £28bn comes in. That investment that is desperately needed for that mission,” he said “You can only understand the investment argument by understanding that we want to have clean power by 2030 … We need to borrow to invest to do that. “That’s a principle I believe in and I’m absolutely happy to go out and defend. And of course, what we’ve said as we’ve got closer to the operationalisation of this, is it has to be ramped up, the money has to be ramped up … and everything is subject to our fiscal rules.” Zoë Billingham, the director of the IPPR North thinktank, said on X after Starmer’s comments emerged: “It’s reassuring that ⁦@UKLabour have recommitted to their £28bn green investment pledge. It a cornerstone of meeting climate goals &amp; regional growth.” Opposition to watering down the £28bn commitment has come from across the spectrum, uniting Labour MPs from the party’s left with others in the centre, while business leaders have also thrown their weight behind it. They included Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens, the German industrial giant and major investor, who said last week that the proposed investment of £28bn a year in the low-carbon economy was an “absolute minimum”. Labour sources have said the party would keep the core mission of investing in green infrastructure, as well as already announced plans such as the creation of GB Energy, a publicly owned clean energy company, and a mass home insulation programme. But they added that the party would in effect cut its green ambitions by about two-thirds, given that the previously announced schemes are set to cost just under £10bn a year by the end of the parliament. Starmer’s language contrasted with the approach taken in a series of media interviews after speeches by Reeves and Starmer to a conference in London attended recently by hundreds of business executives, in which the shadow chancellor was repeatedly asked about the £28bn figure and declined each time to back it. Asked 10 times during an interview with Sky News, Reeves said of the plan: “I think what people need to know is that the fiscal rules are the most important thing for me … I know the importance of economic and fiscal stability and that will always come first.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; UK news; Energy; Renewable energy; Politics; Environment,Politics
2025-07-14T12:29:32Z,Ed Miliband to tell MPs who reject net zero policies they are betraying future generations,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/14/ed-miliband-net-zero-betraying-future-generations,"Ed Miliband is to explicitly call out politicians who reject net zero policies for betraying future generations in an unprecedented update to parliament about the state of the climate crisis, which he is calling “an exercise in radical truth-telling”. With Reform UK proposing to scrap all net zero measures and even questioning the science behind climate change, and the Conservatives ditching environmental targets, Miliband hopes to regain the initiative with a stark warning to MPs. In what is planned to be an annual event, the energy security and net zero secretary will make a “state of the climate” address to the Commons setting out the findings of a new Met Office-led report that says the UK is already facing extreme weather and its effects. “I feel a deep sense of responsibility to the British people to tell them the truth about what we know about the climate and nature crisis,” Miliband said. “I want this to become an annual statement where it’s an exercise in radical truth-telling about the state of the climate and nature. “I think only by levelling with people about what we know can we win people’s trust about the need for action.” The Met Office-led report spells out that with an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and an increased period of flood-causing intense rain, the UK is already very much affected by the climate crisis. Reform has pledged to scrap all net zero policies and subsidies for renewable energy. The Conservatives, who put into law the commitment to reach net zero by 2050 under Theresa May, abandoned the target this year. Miliband said his statement would be a chance for such voices to be “held to account”. He said: “When I talk about this on Monday, all parties are going to have to decide how they respond. And those who respond by saying: ‘There’s nothing to worry about, we don’t need to do anything’ – frankly it is the worst sort of betrayal of today’s and future generations. They need to be called out, and we are going to call them out. We are not going to let the shared commitment that we need to tackle this crisis disappear by default.” Miliband is routinely portrayed by political opponents and sections of the media as a climate zealot whose policies are unnecessary and will increase bills. But with polls showing a majority of Britons back current net zero policies, Miliband said this was a dangerous falsehood. “My position is the position of the vast majority of the British people,” he said. “The extremists, the ideologues, are those who would deny the problem or deny the need to act on the problem. “I think history will judge those people very, very harshly because people will look back at this moment and they will say, you knew you were in this unique generational position, which is you knew enough about the gravity of the problem on the one hand, but on the other hand, it wasn’t too late to do something about it. “People will ask who stood up and said yes, we must act, and who tried to deny the problem.” Amid his warnings on Monday that the “British way of life” as it currently exists is threatened without proper action, Miliband said he also wanted to set out reasons for hope, including a gradually growing global consensus on net zero, and the prospect of the UK being a world leader in green technologies and policies. He will also take issue with politicians who accept the broad science but argue that the world can cope simply by adapting to a changed climate. Miliband said while resilience policies were important, relying on them alone was “a complete betrayal, because then you’re essentially running up the down escalator. The problem will get worse and worse. We keep trying to adapt. It will keep costing us more, and we won’t be able to keep up.” Miliband has faced some reverses, notably Labour’s decision before the election to slash its landmark £28bn-a-year green investment plans by half. Last week he ditched a “zonal pricing” plan to charge electricity users in the south more than those in Scotland.",Green politics; Ed Miliband; Energy; Climate crisis; Reform UK; Conservatives; Labour; Politics; Environment; UK news,Environment
2025-05-22T17:48:31Z,The Guardian view on Starmer’s U-turn: change direction – or keep losing support | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/22/the-guardian-view-on-starmers-u-turn-change-direction-or-keep-losing-support,"Sir Keir Starmer’s U-turn on winter fuel payments did not just represent a policy reversal. It was the moment when the prime minister, elected on promises of national renewal, was forced to confront the political reality that his strategy had refused to acknowledge. It may also prove to be the moment he lost control. The original policy, hatched in the Treasury and defended for months, had cut winter fuel payments, worth up to £300 annually, to millions of pensioners. It was unpopular, and unnecessary. Local election losses and a looming backbench revolt over disability benefit cuts made it politically toxic. The result? On Wednesday, Sir Keir reversed course at the dispatch box – with his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, notably absent. Too little, too late: voters saw delay; activists cried betrayal. This wasn’t just a policy slip. It was a strategic, ideological and sociological misfire. The Labour leadership had convinced itself that its electoral base was composed not of university-educated social liberals and younger renters – key to its election-winning coalition – but of Reform-curious, socially conservative voters yearning for fiscal discipline and border control. That misreading, fuelled by factional folklore and backed up by the Labour MP Luke Akehurst, a key figure among the party’s centre and right, was always a mirage. Most Reform UK voters are not Labour’s to win back. They are largely embedded within a “right-Conservative” bloc, as noted by Manchester University’s James David Griffiths. Chasing them means alienating Labour’s base. That appears to be happening. Sir Keir recorded the lowest net favourability of his spell as Labour leader in May. And now, with U-turns piling up, the story has acquired another dimension: a cabinet revolt. A leak blew open the ideological rift between Ms Reeves and the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. The latter’s memo to Ms Reeves, proposing tax rises on the better-off instead of cuts to meet self-imposed fiscal rules, revealed the schism. This is not just about tax policy. It is a flashpoint in the struggle over Labour’s identity. Ms Rayner represents a politics grounded in contemporary Britain: professional, socially liberal, economically redistributive. Ms Reeves represents a cautious centrist revivalism that imagines Britain as it was in 1997. But this isn’t Blair’s Britain any more. The electorate is more middle class, more educated and more diverse. The realignment is done. Labour’s survival depends on recognising it. Labour’s centrist power brokers are fighting the last war – not against the Tories, but against Jeremy Corbyn. The party risks joining Europe’s centre-left casualties – triangulating through turbulence with a broken political compass. If Labour continues to ignore electoral bloc dynamics and strategic coalition-building, it will cede ground to both the left and the populist right. Meagre public sector pay awards suggest Labour won’t budge – yet. But its economic strategy is running out of road. A pivot is possible: towards tax fairness, green investment, a new language on immigration, electoral reform, ending austerity and rebuilding trust with the young urban voters who put Labour in power. But it should be decisive. Sir Keir must lead a government of transformation, not Tory-lite continuity. If he won’t shift course, “stepping up” may soon look just like standing in the way. The winter fuel fiasco wasn’t only a tactical error – it exposed Labour’s flawed view of the electorate. And voters, inconveniently, noticed.

The UK shadow chancellor has revealed new details about the £7.3bn green investment vehicle that Labour intends to create after the election, saying it will help create hundreds of thousands of new industrial jobs. Labour is planning to focus on the economy this week, as the campaign passes the halfway point with polls continuing to show the party heading for a landslide victory. Reeves said: “Labour’s plan for growth is about making Britain better off, with good jobs paying a decent wage being created right across the United Kingdom. “The election on 4 July is a chance to deliver on that plan and to turn our economy around after 14 years of Conservative decline. The next Labour government will work hand in hand with the private sector to bring investment to Britain’s industrial heartlands and I have been clear that our National Wealth Fund will be a crucial tool in the armoury to deliver on this ambition.” The National Wealth Fund is one of the biggest single items in Labour’s pledge to stimulate the economy and boost efforts to tackle climate change, alongside Great British Energy, its planned energy generation company. The fund will invest £7.3bn over the course of the parliament, with £1.8bn going to ports, £1.5bn to gigafactories, £2.5bn to clean steel, £1bn to carbon capture and £500m to green hydrogen. It will be given a target of attracting three times as much private capital as it invests. Labour says that alongside its home insulation plans, the fund will help create 656,500 jobs in sectors such as electricals, plumbing and engineering. Reeves will announce on Monday that it expects to receive a report on how to run the fund from its advisory taskforce, which includes the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, shortly after the election. While Labour plans to focus on its investment plans this week, contrasting them with the Conservatives’ promise of £17bn-worth of tax cuts, the party is coming under pressure to say whether it will raise taxes to help pay for them. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, on Sunday refused to deny that the party would raise council tax after the election, while Reeves is under pressure from frontbench colleagues to increase capital gains tax.",General election 2024; Labour; Politics; UK news; Economic policy; Green economy; General elections; Environment,Politics
2025-02-03T19:38:27Z,PM faces growing internal backlash over potential approval of Rosebank oilfield,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/03/pm-faces-growing-internal-backlash-over-potential-approval-of-rosebank-oilfield,"Keir Starmer is facing a growing internal backlash over the potential approval of a giant new oilfield, after Treasury sources indicated Rachel Reeves was likely to give it her backing. MPs described a “breaking point” in relations and called for Starmer to reiterate his own commitments to no further oil and gas licences. The proposed Rosebank development was given the go-ahead in 2023 but was ruled unlawful by a court last week. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has previously described the licence issued to Rosebank as “climate vandalism” – setting up a potential major clash between his department and the Treasury. Reeves is understood to be supportive of a new application for environmental consent, with allies suggesting that would not violate Labour’s manifesto, which promised not to issue new exploration licences, but not to cancel ones that have already been issued. Miliband’s department is due to publish new guidelines in late spring which could scupper any attempt by the oil companies to successfully resubmit their applications. Climate-concerned MPs are likely to make their appeals directly to Keir Starmer about the importance of being seen to stand by the party’s manifesto commitment of no new oil and gas licences. Anger is widespread even among centrist Labour MPs who have been major champions of infrastructure. It is understood the Labour Growth Group – a large influential caucus of mostly new Labour MPs who have pushed hard on announcements on housing and infrastructure – will not take a position backing Rosebank. The group did give its backing to Heathrow expansion which was announced by Reeves last week. MPs said more criticism would be forthcoming if approval was being pushed by the Treasury. “This is absolutely a line in the sand for almost everyone in the PLP. This goes specifically against what we said we were about,” one MP said. “This would be a breaking point for a lot of us,” another MP said. A third said: “We have to send a signal to workers, not just oil giants, that we know what [energy] transition really means. If we don’t build up domestic supply chains and manufacturing for renewables, oil workers will have nowhere to go. They won’t thank us for that.” A fourth Labour MP said it was important to make the case that new oilfields should not be seen as an automatic growth advantage. “You’re banking on what could potentially very quickly become stranded assets, and the profits go to private companies but it’s the public sector that will end up clearing up the mess. “That is not a good investment and I think there are some of my colleagues that sort of think that all growth is good and that’s actually economically illiterate. “The new intake are very clear. If Trump is closing his door on green investment, we should be opening the door to green investment. The Americans are going to miss out. We don’t want to.” The backlash against Rosebank would be “much much bigger” than on Heathrow, another MP said. “It says a worrying thing about our political strategy,” they said. “There was a quite clear line on all of this stuff. And then if you get panicked just by a couple of headlines in the Daily Mail, then that as a narrative feels a bit worrying.” “They can hold the line that you can make electric planes but digging up a tonne of oil really isn’t anything other than environmental vandalism,” another MP agreed. “Rosebank is fundamentally a disaster.” Five Labour MPs, including three who chair different all-party parliamentary groups on climate and renewable energy, wrote a letter to the Times on Monday, criticising the automatic link made between new oil fields and economic growth – with a veiled reminder of Labour’s green electoral platform. “Labour’s mandate is clear: the country wants a decisive shift toward a future with cleaner, more secure energy,” it said, signed by Luke Murphy, Polly Billington and Alex Sobel, Peter Swallow and Abtisam Mohamed. Another member of the climate APPG, MP Uma Kumaran, tweeted after the ruling: “Britain’s future lies in clean energy, not more oil and gas. Former shadow ministers Sarah Champion and Barry Gardiner both said the government must rule out any further development. “Approving the Rosebank operation is simply not compatible with our climate goals,” Champion said. Gardiner said it was a test whether the chancellor was “willing to abide by her manifesto commitment”. Two other key factors will be the view of Scottish Labour and the GMB trade union who are pushing hard for the development to be approved. A significant number of cabinet ministers are members of GMB. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has hinted he expects the government to honour the previous commitment to grant the licence – but a number of new Scottish Labour MPs are opposed. The Rosebank row opens Scottish Labour to criticism from all sides, as seen on Monday when voices from across the political spectrum in Scotland attacked Starmer’s “broken promises” after the new boss of GB Energy, Jürgen Maier, admitted in his first broadcast interview the prime minister’s pledge of 1,000 jobs for Aberdeen could take 20 years. Miliband’s guidelines will be the result of a consultation into how emissions caused by the burning of oil and gas extracted from energy projects will be accounted and allowed for in planning applications, stemming from the landmark Horse Hill judgment handed down last year. Oil and gas companies are lobbying for a looser interpretation. Tessa Khan, founder of climate campaign group Uplift, which brought the case against Rosebank, said she was confident the guidance would preclude the new oilfields. She said: “We think the climate case against Rosebank is watertight – there is just no way you can accept we are in a climate emergency and approve a massive new oilfield.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; UK news; Oil; Oil; Energy; Business; Environment,Politics
2023-01-12T16:32:27Z,"Sunak’s stop-start policies harming UK green investment, says net zero tsar",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar,"Rishi Sunak has been criticised by his own net zero tsar, who says the UK risks missing its green targets due to inconsistent policies and lack of commitment to pledges. In his net zero review, seen by the Guardian, Chris Skidmore said a large barrier to renewable energy was a lack of confidence in the government, which has inconsistent policy support for green energy, with measures such as Sunak’s new electricity tax. Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood, was asked by the former prime minister Liz Truss to write a review on the policy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. He was asked to find out what was working with the policy regarding not putting more carbon into the atmosphere than the UK absorbs, and to make the business case for the goal. One issue mentioned throughout the report is a lack of policy commitment. Skidmore said: “The overwhelming impression I got was we will make net zero more affordable if we are able to deliver further and faster, which requires certainty and consistency of approach. We need to de-risk investment, which will actually drive down the costs of net zero, and if the recommendations put forward by my review are followed we will create incentives to invest in renewables. “The review recognises we have fallen behind, but it sets out how we can be world-leading in these areas once again. We need to remove the barriers that are in place at the moment.” Dan McGrail, chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, said: “Sudden policy changes like the imposition of the electricity generator levy, which kicked in at the start of this year, have put investment at risk.” Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said: “Skidmore is right to demand the replacement of stop-start policies with certainty for investors.” Skidmore cited agriculture as one of the main culprits of carbon emissions, and said its share of emissions could, by 2030, grow from 12% to 30%. To encourage people to eat more environmentally friendly foods, Skidmore recommended “eco-labelling” rather than a tax or ban on foods such as red meat. He also said that farmers had been disincentivised from farming in an environmentally friendly way by the confusion around the government’s post-Brexit nature-friendly agriculture payments, and that there had been missed opportunities for nature-based solutions with most policy focused on woodlands and peatland rather than many other carbon sinks such as wetlands. In the review, Skidmore called for a stable policy environment, with consistent support for renewables, as well as a reform of the way the government financially helps renewable energy projects to make that more attractive for investors. But climate campaigners criticised the review for being unambitious and for not calling for strong policies to avert the climate crisis. Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “Whilst there is much useful analysis of the problem the review stops short of recommending the kind of muscular policies that would really drive change towards the massive growth in renewables which will be necessary. “Without a strong push from government the renewables revolution will still proceed, because the economic logic dictates it should. But it won’t happen at the pace it needs to in order to forestall some of the worst effects of climate change.” While the review says the UK needs a “rooftop revolution” for solar panels and suggests making planning decisions easier to enable this, it stops short of recommending mandates for solar panels on new builds, or more funding to encourage take-up. Parr added: “All credible scenarios of our future economy rely on renewable energy being the backbone of the future energy system, and the review should have said government needs to change the remit of the regulator to include net zero delivery, insist on solar panels being on new roofs, expand the scale of renewables contracts and rapidly lay out the location of the offshore electricity grid. Instead, the government seem like a mildly curious spectator, wondering why their aspirations aren’t materialising without ever intervening to make them happen.” The renewable energy industry has tentatively welcomed the review, with industry leaders saying it contains good ideas that should be adopted by the government. McGrail said: “If the government is looking to increase the economic benefits of the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions, Chris Skidmore’s review has some really clear easy wins. As he suggests, setting targets for new onshore wind and solar capacity would certainly increase investor confidence, as well as ensuring we can decarbonise our electricity system by 2035.” He also praised Skidmore for promoting the use of “a wide range of renewables to strengthen Britain’s energy security, including innovative technologies like floating wind and tidal stream”. He said that he would have liked the review to have told the government to take a “war room” approach to tackling grid connectivity, “with the prime minister bringing all relevant bodies together to address this urgently”. Hewett said: “We very much hope that Whitehall will embrace his call to establish a joint taskforce with the solar industry to work on a roadmap for reaching 70GW of solar [capacity] by 2035 – about four-and-a-half times what we have now. “The number-one priority of this group will have to be unblocking access to the grid – which is pushing back the completion of many large projects well into the next decade.” Polly Billington, chief executive of the UK100 group of local government leaders, said the review showed that local authorities must play a leading role in implementing policy. “This independent review confirms what UK100 has been saying for years: local authorities are the key to achieving the UK’s net zero goals,” she said. “[We particularly welcome] the recommendation to end the disjointed mess of short-term, competitive local authority funding pots. This move would help communities maximise the economic and social benefits of net zero while making the most cost-effective use of resources.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “Another day, another Conservative MP calling out the total failure of this government over many years to act with the urgency and consistency that the climate crisis demands. Chris Skidmore is right about the fact that 13 years of delay, dither and a refusal to go all-in on a green energy sprint under the Conservatives, is depriving our country of the economic opportunities climate action offers. “The tragedy is that Rishi Sunak is making things even worse. He is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age who has never understood what this report reaffirms – that going green is pro-business, pro-worker and is a vital part of growing our economy.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been approached for comment.",Renewable energy; Rishi Sunak; Greenhouse gas emissions; Green economy; Coal; Oil; Energy; Solar power; Wind power; Green politics; Environment; Conservative leadership; Politics; UK news,Environment
2025-05-16T04:00:50Z,Foreign states should not be co-owners of UK newspapers | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/may/16/foreign-states-should-not-be-co-owners-of-uk-newspapers,"‘We are fully upholding the need to safeguard our news media from foreign state control while recognising that news organisations must be able to raise vital funding,” said Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, alighting on 15% as the limit for foreign state ownership of a UK newspaper company. She is obviously right that it is harder for companies to raise money if a pool of potential capital – state-controlled sovereign wealth funds and their like – are off-limits. No wonder some media owners lobbied for a percentage higher than the 5% that was being considered by the previous government as a tweak to last year’s legislation that set the cap at zero. But she is naive if she thinks 15% will ensure “minimal risk” of foreign state influence. That is not how the world works: 15% is a hefty foot in the door. A shareholder with a stake of that size will sometimes (and, in the case of listed companies, very often) be the largest on the register. The chair of an organisation cannot simply refuse to take the phone call. If Nandy truly believes 15% is too small to make a meaningful difference, she should consider two recent examples from the world beyond state actors and sovereign funds. At BP, a mere 5% investor, the US hedge fund Elliott Management, plainly had a role in encouraging the board to perform strategic somersaults on green investment. Yes, BP’s independent board ultimately took the decision itself. But Elliott, as we saw, tried to define expectations, set a mood and generally be influential. There is also a non-state example from media-land itself – one where the objective was to secure an editorial safeguard. When the Scott Trust, the owner of this newspaper, sold the Observer to Tortoise Media last year, it took a stake in the post-deal entity to “enshrine our values in the new ownership structure”. The stake deemed sufficient to achieve that aim was 9% – not even double digits – albeit with a boardroom seat on top. Under Nandy’s plan, the secretary of state will have powers to intervene if there are reasonable grounds to suspect a State Owned Investor, as they are referred to in secondary legislation, has acquired the ability to control or influence a newspaper’s policy, for example by being given rights to appoint or remove directors. That is slippery territory. From the point of view of an autocratic regime seeking influence from the shadows, it only needs to use its shareholder access to encourage the board to smile upon the right candidate for director. Plausible deniability would be maintained; the secretary of state would struggle to pin down “reasonable grounds”. Nandy’s decision has come after the Abu Dhabi-backed Redbird IMI vehicle was blocked from acquiring the Telegraph last year. The IMI part, which would have provided the majority of the funding, is controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. Now, if parliament passes the legislation, the state-sponsored UAE entity will be able to own 15% in its own right. The outcome would be extraordinary when you consider the uproar that would follow if the UK government owned even a 1% stake in the Telegraph or any national paper. Soon a foreign state – even one as low in the World Press Freedom index as the UAE – may be able to own 15%. It is also extraordinary, as argued here at the time, that the Redbird IMI affair generated so little outrage in left-of-centre circles that normally (and rightly) deplore the lack of diverse ownership of our media and how control can be held by foreign owners. Wake up: you may not care about the Telegraph, or may even enjoy how it has been in ownership limbo, but you ought to be alarmed by the very idea of foreign states or their controlled entities being 15% co-owners of a UK media organisation. The definition of an acceptable state stake should be zero if one is serious about protecting press freedom. At a push, 5% might be a workable fudge if the government feels compelled to accommodate the cuddlier sort of passive state investor, such as Norway’s sovereign fund. But 15% should be a non-starter. MPs should block the proposal.",Press freedom; Newspapers; Lisa Nandy; Telegraph Media Group; Guardian Media Group; Business; Media; Media business; National newspapers; Politics; UK news; Newspapers & magazines,Business
2024-04-16T15:00:51Z,Albanese’s promised clean economy act has been a long time coming but it’s the right place to start | Adam Morton,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2024/apr/17/albaneses-promised-clean-economy-act-has-been-a-long-time-coming-but-its-the-right-place-to-start,"It’s taken a while to get here but Anthony Albanese is on the verge of promising what some economists and most clean energy advocates have been urging Australian governments to do for years. Or at least a version of it. The prime minister’s promised “Future Made in Australia” act is clumsily named, and the announcement last week had few details, but the idea – that the government will need to use its weight to help develop green industries if the country is to make a rapid transition from fossil fuels to a clean economy – has been a long time coming. Some of the criticism that followed has made headlines but been pretty unremarkable. It’s true that, if badly developed, an interventionist industry policy could become a money pit and create subsidy-dependent businesses. The government should absolutely aim not to do that. It underlines the importance of the decisions being made in Canberra before next month’s budget. It’s also true that leaders will need to be bold, and an overly cautious approach is unlikely to do what’s needed. The expert consensus is that there is an opportunity in this moment – as the climate crisis worsens, and as countries comparable to Australia introduce strategies to attract trillions in clean investment – to spur the new industries needed to gain a foothold in new industries and help create green jobs. It won’t last for ever at this scale. And taking it slow won’t avoid attacks on the government from people stuck on the idea that little of substance needs to change as the climate crisis rewrites the global economy. They’re going to happen anyway. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Other countries – in Europe, and Japan, Korea and Canada – are already chasing some of the trillions in global clean investment up for grabs in the decades ahead. They have mostly been reacting to what could be US$1tn in support for clean industries contained in that country’s paradigm-shifting Inflation Reduction Act. But they are also responding to the slower creep of China’s massive green investment that has, for example, given it near complete dominance of the global solar supply chain that everyone relies on. It explains why several of the countries stuck the word “security” in the name of their green industry strategies. The challenge for a resource-rich, medium-sized economy such as Australia is to identify industries in which it has a competitive advantage, and weigh how best to minimise the risks to taxpayers. It will be a while before it’s clear the extent to which the areas the government has backed to date – $2bn to kickstart a proposed green hydrogen industry, $1bn for solar panel supply chain manufacturing, and $4bn for mining and processing of critical minerals – fit into the category. Smart minds have suggested that a sensible approach would be to mostly stop exporting raw materials and instead back onshore production and refinement of products such as ammonia, iron, steel, aluminium and a variety of critical minerals. Substantially more support will be needed, probably through tax breaks and direct investments as well as cheap loans and guarantees. Consideration of how best to do this is running parallel with the equally important issue of how to ensure that people in the most fossil fuel-reliant parts of Australia are not trampled into the dust in a stampede for a clean future. We have known for years that parts of the country are likely to face a disproportionately hard future as dirty industries are inevitably phased down, and eventually out. Though often discussed, this issue has largely been ignored in national policy. It hasn’t had the same attention as the promised shift to green industry policy, but there is evidence this is changing. Last month, as the government introduced legislation to create a Net Zero Economy Authority to help manage the transition to a clean economy, it quietly posted an impact analysis that is shaping its thinking. The report assesses what will happen as at least 10 of the country’s remaining 19 coal-fired power plants shut by 2035. It estimates more than 3,000 coal power workers could lose their jobs, with spillover losses for about 900 contractors. Past experience suggests as many as a third of the people who work at coal plants could still be unemployed a year after the generator has closed if left unsupported, and that their drop in earning capacity tends to be much greater than in other closing industries. The impact on financial hardship and health can ripple through a community and become a “self-reinforcing cycle” as people find it increasingly difficult to find work and lose skills and motivation. These coal jobs are concentrated in just six regions across the country, notably Gladstone in central Queensland, the Hunter and Latrobe valleys, and Collie in Western Australia. Some of these areas are likely to benefit from new clean industries, which will mostly be regional, but it obviously won’t be a one-for-one match. The report lists three ways the government could respond: do nothing, create a pooled redeployment policy for affected workers that the owners coal plants bosses can opt in to, or introduce laws that would allow it to force the owners of coal plants and their suppliers to take part in the redeployment arrangements and support their employees to find new jobs. The latter two options would come at a public cost – almost $130m for the legislated third option – but the report argues the benefits that flowed from creating a pool of skilled workers for new employers, improving the social, health and welfare outcomes for workers and their families, and maintaining social cohesion and local identity would be significantly greater. It also found more than 2.5 times as many workers were likely to be transferred into new jobs under the option that gave the government the power to force companies to act than if it made it a voluntary scheme. The “do nothing” option, in which the future of the workers would be left to the market, was not even assessed. The implicit message is that the people affected by the historic transition under way need to be brought along for the ride, and given the help they need to get through it. As with the promised green industry policy, it’s taken a while to get here. But it’s the right place to start. • Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor",Energy; Environment; Anthony Albanese; Australia news; Energy; Australian politics; Green economy; Australian economy; Climate crisis,Environment
2025-03-11T05:00:31Z,Portugal set for snap general election as PM faces confidence vote,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/11/portugal-set-for-snap-general-election-as-pm-luis-montenegro-faces-confidence-vote,"Portugal is bracing for its third snap general election in as many years as MPs debate a motion of confidence that looks set to topple the centre-right government and trigger a return to the polls in May. Luís Montenegro, the prime minister, who heads the Democratic Alliance (AD) platform that has governed Portugal since its narrow victory in last year’s election, called the vote of confidence in response to growing questions over his family’s business activities. Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing or ethical breaches and called the vote last week saying he wanted to “to end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues”. It is all but certain to trigger a new general election as both the centre-left Socialist party (PS) and the far-right Chega party have said they will vote against the government. Between them, the PS and Chega have 128 seats in Portugal’s 230 seat parliament, while the AD has 80. If, as expected, Montenegro loses the vote, Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is likely to dissolve parliament, prompting a new election whose earliest dates would be 11 or 18 May. As the debate began on Tuesday, Montenegro accused the socialists of siding with Chega. “Today’s vote will determine whether we go to elections and whether the Socialist Party will ally with the far right to bring down the government,” he told parliament. At the centre of the allegations is Spinumviva, a data protection consultancy that Montenegro founded in 2021 but the ownership of which he transferred to his wife and sons the following year. The opposition claims that Spinumviva’s contracts with private companies – including a casino and hotel business – have benefited Montenegro. It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government. While there is no active investigation under way into Spinumviva, prosecutors have said they are analysing “an anonymous complaint” against Montenegro linked to its dealings. Portugal’s last general election, held a year ago, was triggered by the resignation in November 2023 of the socialist prime minister, António Costa, after an investigation was launched into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa – who had been in office since 2015 and who won a surprise absolute majority in the 2022 general election – had not been accused of any crime. He said that while his conscience was clear, he felt he had no choice but to step down because the “duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. The March 2024 election proved a close-run affair. The AD won 80 seats to the PS’s 78, while Chega – which is led by the former TV football pundit André Ventura – enjoyed a surge in support and increased its seat count from 12 to 50. Surveys suggest a May election could produce a similar result. The AD is polling at about 30%, slightly ahead of the PS, with Chega third on 18%.

2025-03-07T17:53:31Z,UK Treasury ‘weighs up funding cuts at GB Energy’ in blow to Ed Miliband,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/07/uk-treasury-plans-funding-cuts-at-gb-energy-in-blow-to-ed-miliband,"The UK government is reportedly weighing up the possibility of cutting planned funding for GB Energy, the state-owned company set up by Labour to drive renewable energy and cut household bills, in June’s spending review. Cuts to the £8.3bn of taxpayer money promised over the five-year parliament would be another blow for Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, after he was overruled by the government when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the expansion of Heathrow’s third runway. GB Energy, a vital cog in Keir Starmer’s plans to “supercharge” Britain’s clean energy revolution, was only given an initial £100m in October’s budget to cover its first two years. Ministers are carrying out a “zero-based review” of all government spending, which has been given additional impetus after Starmer’s pledge to boost investment in defence. One option under consideration by the Treasury is to cut £3.3bn earmarked for GB Energy to fund low-interest loans via local authorities, for projects such as solar panels and shared-ownership wind projects, according to the Financial Times. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are fully committed to the £8.3bn for GB Energy, which is at the heart of our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower and to ensure our homes are cheaper and cleaner to run.” Sources played down the likelihood of the government significantly defunding an initiative that formed an important plank of Labour’s energy strategy. One source suggested that the government might maintain the promised level of funding but “rebadge” the budgets of other green initiatives to become part of GB Energy, effectively allowing departmental cuts in other areas. The speculation will, however, reignite rumours of a power battle within Labour ranks, pitched between No 10, the Treasury and Miliband’s net zero department. Last year, before Labour’s election victory, Starmer cut its green investment plan from £28bn a year to under £15bn, in a blow to Miliband. Sources close to the government said the Treasury was now running the rule over “everything” before the spring statement this month, which is expected to show that Reeves’s headroom against her fiscal rules has been wiped out. Another source warned of a rerun of the febrile months before the autumn budget, when swirling speculation hit business confidence and investment. “GB Energy has the potential to be a real confidence booster to business. Scaling it back would damage investor sentiment and, frankly, be electoral madness. It’s hugely popular on the doorstep, especially in Scotland,” they said. Last month, GB Energy admitted that it could take 20 years to meet its pledge to employ 1,000 people, as the chair, Jürgen Maier, refused to put a date on when it would bring down energy bills. Industry sources have said GB Energy was facing a “challenging” task to find a chief executive for its Aberdeen headquarters, dubbed the oil and gas capital of Europe. Last month, the government appointed Dan McGrail, the chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, as the interim chief executive. McGrail, who is on secondment from RenewableUK, has taken an initial six-month contract and will be based in Scotland, working from GB Energy’s Aberdeen HQ. The government has said that over the next five years it expects GB Energy to employ 200 to 300 people at its Aberdeen HQ. GB Energy is now under the leadership of the former Siemens UK boss Maier, who is based in Manchester, and a five-strong team of non-executive directors based in various parts of the UK.",Energy industry; Labour; Business; Ed Miliband; UK news; Politics; Energy; Environment,Business
2025-03-26T18:08:28Z,"No mention of green issues by Rachel Reeves, but her silence comes as a relief",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/26/no-mention-of-green-issues-by-rachel-reeves-but-her-silence-comes-as-a-relief,"The climate crisis, the UK’s target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions and the green economy received not a single mention in Rachel Reeves’s spring statement on Wednesday. To green experts, this absence came almost as a relief, given that the chancellor was taking an axe to so many other aspects of public spending. There are still no guarantees that green investment will not be quietly cut in the near future. But at a time when the UK’s green sectors are growing at three times the rate of the rest of the economy, according to the CBI, ignoring climate and environment policy means missing vital opportunities. Ed Matthew, UK programme director at the E3G thinktank, said: “The chancellor has left a huge open goal by neglecting the clean economy as the primary driver for growth in the UK. While the broader economy slumped, the clean economy boomed, growing by 10% last year, creating £83bn of added value. “If the government is serious about growth, it must stop tinkering at the edges and ramp up capital investment into the clean economy – the best chance we have for economic recovery.” A host of measures – including some that Labour espoused in opposition, but which are now on the back-burner or under threat – could deliver cost savings for households and businesses, economic opportunities, and revenue for the Treasury. Insulating homes lowers bills, cuts waste, improves health and creates jobs. The government pledged £13.2bn by 2030 for a “warm homes plan” in its manifesto, but Westminster insiders suggest this spending could be under threat due to the chancellor’s “non-negotiable” fiscal rules. Owing to the way the UK’s electricity market has worked since privatisation, electricity bills are set by the marginal wholesale price of gas, which is often the most expensive energy option on the grid. This could be changed, and shifting green levies from bills to general taxation, reforming the market and updating infrastructure would also make electricity cheaper, encourage the switch to electric vehicles and low-carbon power and allow for greater efficiency. Chris Glover, director of total utilities management at the engineering firm Buro Happold, said: “We currently pay around £1bn per annum to curtail renewable energy generation when the grid cannot handle the power. “This eye-watering amount of money is simply passed on to consumers, who end up paying for both the curtailed renewable energy and the gas that replaces it.” Fossil fuel dependence has been a key factor in high inflation, according to the Treasury. But the £8.3bn promised for Great British Energy to spur the development of more renewable generation, though unmentioned by Reeves, is in question. The rural economy is also faltering: a survey this month by the National Farmers’ Union found confidence among farmers in England and Wales at an all-time low. The budget for the sustainable farming initiative, which rewards farmers for taking measures that improve the environment, such as helping to clean the air and water, and protect soils, may be cut in June. Failing to spend sufficiently on protecting the UK against the climate crisis could also prove a costly mistake, as the impacts of extreme weather are expected to worsen. Every £1 spent on flood resilience prevents about £8 of damage, of which £3 is a direct benefit to the government; a report last year from the Green Finance Institute found the degradation of the UK’s natural environment was slowing economic growth and could lead to an estimated 6-12% reduction in the UK’s economy. But those impacts are not immediate, while the fiscal rules are defined by expediency. Simon McWhirter, deputy chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, said: “The spring statement continues this government’s short-term thinking, when what we need are robust spending plans to drive long-term prosperity.”",Green economy; Spring statement 2025; Energy; Climate crisis; Energy industry; Farming; Rachel Reeves; Politics; Environment; UK news,Environment
2025-05-17T10:54:09Z,Housing and the far right: Portugal votes again but the issues remain the same,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/17/housing-and-the-far-right-portugal-votes-again-but-the-issues-remain-the-same,"Portugal will return to the polls for the third time in just over three years on Sunday to vote in a snap general election triggered by the country’s centre-right prime minister, Luís Montenegro, who is under pressure over his family’s business activities. Montenegro, who leads the Social Democratic party – the largest party in Portugal’s ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) coalition – is facing political and judicial scrutiny over a data protection consultancy that he founded in 2021 and which he transferred to his wife and sons the following year. The prime minister – who has denied any wrongdoing or ethical breaches – responded to the accusations by staging a vote of confidence in his administration in March, saying he wanted “to end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues”. But he lost the vote and a fresh election was called. The unexpected election is unlikely to drastically alter Portugal’s political landscape. Recent polls suggest a similar result to the last election in March 2024, putting the AD on about 33%, the opposition Socialist party (PS) on 26% and the far-right Chega party on 17%. Last time round, the AD won 80 seats to the PS’s 78, while Chega, which is led by the former football pundit André Ventura, enjoyed a surge in support and increased its seat count from 12 to 50. Once again, Portugal’s housing crisis has become a major issue during this latest campaign. “We’re talking about the same things we did last year,” said Filomena Martins, the deputy editor of the online Observador newspaper. “We’re talking about housing, rental costs, and the lack of housing for everyone. There isn’t enough housing for everyone because there’s not enough housebuilding. There have been some measures from this government that have helped young people get somewhere to live, but there isn’t enough housing for everyone and there isn’t enough housing that young people can afford on their salaries. It’s impossible.” Also in play are the issues of pensions, immigration, healthcare and crime and safety. Montenegro’s caretaker government was recently accused of pandering to the far right after it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants during the election campaign. But despite its efforts to push immigration up the political agenda – not to mention its massive growth at the last election – Chega looks set to find itself once again barred from any coalitions. Montenegro has maintained his veto on any deals with the party, saying: “Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons: it isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.” The small Liberal Initiative party – which could throw its weight behind Montenegro, bringing his coalition a handful of seats but leaving him well short of a majority in the country’s 230-seat assembly – has also categorically refused to do anything that would help Chega into power. The far-right party, which has promised to clean up Portuguese politics, has also been hit by a series of damaging allegations relating to some of its members. In January, Chega expelled one of its MPs from the party after he was accused of stealing suitcases at several airports. Another member of the party was caught drunk-driving the same month, while a third has been charged with paying for oral sex with an underage male who was 15 at the time. The party has returned to its attacks on Portugal’s Roma community, prompting angry protests at some of its events. Speaking earlier this week, Ventura – who has previously accused the country’s Roma population of having “a chronic problem of dependence on benefits, delinquency and violence – said he would stand up to “threats” from the Roma people. “It’s time to stop cowering and put an end to this total impunity!” he said. Ventura’s efforts, however, have been curtailed by health problems in the past few days. After twice falling ill at rallies this week and receiving hospital treatment for oesophageal spasms caused by gastric reflux and high blood pressure, he made a surprise appearance at his party’s final campaign event on Friday. Eunice Lourenço, the political editor of the Portuguese weekly Expresso, said the outcome of Sunday’s election remained distinctly unpredictable. “The polls aren’t giving clear answers: the coalition government is in the lead, but that lead is very small,” she said. “There’s no clear solution when it comes to governability. President Marcelo [Rebelo de Sousa] has said the most important thing isn’t who wins, but who can offer the best conditions to get things through parliament … We don’t know what will happen.” Last year’s general election was triggered after the socialist prime minister, António Costa, resigned in November 2023 after an investigation was launched into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa – who had been in office since 2015 and who won a surprise absolute majority in the 2022 general election – has not been accused of any crime and has gone on to become the president of the European Council.",Portugal; Europe; World news; European Union; The far right,World news
2025-02-26T18:25:13Z,The Guardian view on Spain: a progressive beacon in dark times | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-spain-a-progressive-beacon-in-dark-times,"Coverage of this week’s seismic election result in Germany focused on the disturbing rise of the far right, and chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz’s warning that Europe can no longer rely on the United States for its security. But for European progressives, there was also a third depressing takeaway: the comprehensive rejection of Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party, which recorded its worst postwar result. Across the continent, centre-left parties have been exiled from the corridors of power, while the radical right has fuelled anxieties over immigration and economic stagnation to extend its influence. There is, however, one startling outlier to this dismal trend. Last year, Spain recorded the highest growth of any major country, at 3.2%. This was achieved under a Socialist-led coalition government that has welcomed high levels of immigration as a driver of economic prosperity, and which from this year plans to offer residency and work permits to up to 900,000 undocumented migrants. In 2024, over 400,000 vacancies were filled by migrants and dual nationals, as overall unemployment figures fell to their lowest level since the 2008 crash. The case for migration in a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the European Union – forcefully made by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez – has been complemented by a commitment to generous public spending that is also at odds with the zeitgeist. Boosted by EU post-pandemic recovery funds, levels of government expenditure reached an all-time high at the end of last year. Most of the money has gone on upgrading vital infrastructure and green investment, including urban low-emission zones and subsidies for small businesses. On the European stage, too, Spain is blazing a progressive trail. As crucial negotiations over future EU spending begin, Madrid has proposed a doubling of the next seven-year budget, financed by joint borrowing mechanisms pioneered after Covid. In an era in which spending on defence risks diverting resources away from other public goods and the green transition, Mr Sánchez is right to argue that more Europe, not less, should be part of the solution. Panglossian hyperbole should be avoided. An important factor boosting Spain’s growth has been the booming tourist industry, which is creating tensions in cities and resorts hollowed out by Airbnb. A related housing crisis urgently needs to be addressed. And interpreting to what extent impressive GDP figures translate into general wellbeing is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, at a time when much of the mainstream centre-left appears to have lost faith in progressive political solutions, the Sánchez government’s achievements deserve to be celebrated. A robustly social democratic approach to economic renewal, and a recognition of what migrants can offer ageing societies, remains the best response to the rise of nationalist, xenophobic politics. When unveiling his government’s plans to make it easier for migrants to settle last October, Mr Sánchez commented: “Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations, while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations. The key is in managing it well.” It has become vanishingly rare to hear political leaders not only making such an argument but also acting on it. This may be a moment of maximum hubris for the Trumpian right across the west. But Spain continues to show that there is another way. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2025-02-26T18:12:11Z,BP blames ‘misplaced’ faith in green transition for its renewed focus on fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back,"BP has abandoned its green ambitions in favour of ramping up fossil fuel production as its boss claimed that optimism over the pace of the green transition had been “misplaced”. In a major strategy shift, the energy company will increase its investment in oil and gas to $10bn (£7.9bn) a year while slashing more than $5bn from its previous green investment plan. The radical overhaul means BP will be “very selective” about investing in low-carbon options while producing 2.4m barrels of oil and gas a day by 2030 – about 60% higher than the figure in its net zero plan set out five years ago. “Today we have fundamentally reset BP’s strategy,” said BP’s CEO, Murray Auchincloss. “This is a reset BP, with an unwavering focus on growing long-term shareholder value.” The move back towards fossil fuels represents a stark shift from the investment plan put forward five years ago by the former chief executive, Bernard Looney. He had promised to shrink the company’s fossil fuel production to about 1.5m barrels a day and make BP a net zero energy company by 2050. Auchincloss said BP would instead focus on strengthening its production portfolio by starting up 10 large-scale oil and gas projects by 2027 and a further eight to 10 projects by the end of the decade. He said: “Our optimism for a fast [energy] transition was misplaced, and we went too far, too fast.” There has been growing pressure from investors for BP to shrug off its green pledges, which initially won praise from green groups but have since been diluted as BP’s share price fell. BP has lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years while the market value of its rivals Shell and ExxonMobil has increased as they pursued greater oil and gas production. The company also faces an existential threat from the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which in recent months has amassed a stake in the oil company worth almost £3.8bn, or 5% of its shares. The New York hedge fund is widely expected to use its grip on the 120-year-old company to demand sweeping changes, including a potential breakup, to rescue its flagging market value. The dismantling of Looney’s green agenda will come alongside a plan to cut BP’s growing debt pile from almost $23bn at the end of last year to between $14bn and $18bn by the end of 2027. The company plans to sell $20bn of assets, possibly including its Castrol lubricants business, its network of service stations and the solar power developer Lightsource BP, while trimming up to $3bn from its overall investments and cutting up to $5bn in costs from across the company by the end of 2027. Matilda Borgström, a campaigner at the climate action group 350.org, said: “This move by oil giant BP clearly demonstrates why super-rich corporations and individuals, chasing short-term profit for themselves and shareholders, cannot be trusted with fixing the climate crisis or leading the transition to renewable energy we so badly need. “Pumping money into more oil and gas increases the risk of climate impacts for us all, flies in the face of legal climate targets and, with the renewables sector growing exponentially, is a big risk to the shareholders that BP is so keen to please.”",BP; Energy industry; Oil; Gas; Oil and gas companies; Fossil fuels; Business; Environment; Energy; UK news; World news; Commodities,Business
2023-09-10T05:01:42Z,UK’s net zero ambitions at risk after ‘disastrous’ offshore wind auction,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/10/uks-net-zero-ambitions-at-risk-after-disastrous-offshore-wind-auction,"Fears are growing that existing offshore wind projects could be shelved, after industry insiders warned that “disastrous” handling by the government had created a big shortfall in future renewable energy. Ministers revealed last week that no additional offshore windfarms will go ahead in the UK after the latest government auction. No bids were made in the auction, after the government ignored warnings that offshore schemes were no longer economically viable under the current system. The Observer revealed the problems last month, as the price for energy offered to developers had not taken account of rampant inflation in their costs. However, industry insiders said that inflationary pressures may even jeopardise the viability of schemes approved in last year’s auction. One such project, the multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm designed to power the equivalent of 1.5m British homes, has already been paused. The failure of this year’s auction has been fuelled by the government setting a maximum price of £44 per megawatt hour based on 2012 prices. It is similar to the price offered in the previous auction, which took place before many inflationary pressures had hit the industry and its supply chain. There are now frantic demands from some of the leading players for ministers to make a quick announcement that the maximum price for next year’s auction will be increased. Some also want help to ensure that schemes already agreed can go ahead. Industry figures had been making direct pleas to ministers since January, the Observer understands. Companies have been frustrated because increasing the price would still have left offshore wind as one of the cheapest energy sources and improved the UK’s energy security. The problems that have emerged around offshore wind are a blow to the UK’s carbon reduction pledges as the industry forms the backbone of those plans. The UK is committed to decarbonising the electricity system by 2035 and achieving net zero by 2050. It is banking on a near-quadrupling of offshore wind from about 14 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2030. Industry figures said there was now a 24GW gap “between what we think we can procure in auctions for offshore v 50GW target for offshore”. It comes amid a warning from trade unions that the UK risks losing hundreds of thousands more manufacturing jobs if it refuses to follow Joe Biden and make a significant investment in green industry. Before the start of its congress on Sunday, the TUC said that Britain’s industrial heartlands would be further hit unless the government “pulls every lever” to deliver net zero and create the right jobs to do it. It released research that it said showed about 800,000 manufacturing and supply chain jobs in automotive, steel and other sectors could be at risk if the government does not implement its own Biden-style climate plan. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is set to pump $369bn (£296bn) into climate change issues. The regions with the most jobs at risk are the West Midlands, the north west, and Yorkshire and the Humber, the TUC said. It said the jobs that could be affected by the offshoring that could follow a lack of investment by Britain included 112,400 in the automotive industry, 31,000 jobs in iron and steel and 88,200 jobs in rubber and plastics. It said almost 400,000 jobs in Britain’s supply chains could be affected. “The race to net zero is also a race for industrial revival,” said Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary. “If we move quickly we can protect and create hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the UK. But our government is stuck in first gear. While other countries are scaling up subsidies for clean technology and infrastructure, the Conservatives have yet to produce a jobs and climate-focused industrial strategy. “The UK needs to speed up to stay in the race. If we don’t want to lose jobs to other nations, we need government to stop dithering and pull every lever it has to stop our industries haemorrhaging hundreds of thousands of jobs – and kick off a British industrial revival. We must act now to safeguard our industrial heartlands and manufacturing sector.” Laurence Turner, GMB head of research and policy, said almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs may have been lost since 2010. “Our members in manufacturing face real uncertainty but ministers seem to be asleep at the wheel,” he said. “We urgently need a Biden-style response that links contracts to jobs if we are to break out of the cycle of low investment, low growth and low pay.” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “We won’t apologise for moving faster and earlier on renewable energy than many other countries, and we are glad to see that nations across the rest of the world are starting to catch up. “We have already attracted around £120bn investment in renewables since 2010 and are expected to attract a further £100bn in net zero by 2030 – powering up Britain and supporting up to 480,000 jobs. We will continue to double down on our global leadership in clean technologies, which has meant we have increased the amount of energy coming from renewables from 7% in 2010 to 42% in 2022.”",Wind power; Conservatives; TUC; Energy; Renewable energy; Environment; Politics; Trade unions; UK news; Green politics; Climate crisis; Business; Energy industry,Environment
2025-02-19T18:32:25Z,The Guardian view on defence spending: bold ideas needed to have guns as well as butter | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/19/the-guardian-view-on-defence-spending-bold-ideas-needed-to-have-guns-as-well-as-butter,"When settling wars rewards lawlessness, displaces populations and fuels lasting grievances, the result is more war. That was the former foreign secretary William Hague’s verdict on Donald Trump’s approach to peacemaking, drawing lessons from the Balkans, the second world war and the Middle East. A more insecure world will require Britain to increase defence spending. The UK currently could not sustain major troop deployments in Ukraine, undermining the idea it could provide Kyiv with “security guarantees”. This is a dilemma faced across Europe, leading the EU to see deficit-financed defence spending as the answer. In contrast, Britain remains seemingly bound by economic orthodoxy, prioritising fiscal discipline over borrowing. The UK Treasury has apparently asked unprotected public services – excluding health, education and defence – to prepare for real-terms cuts of up to 11% ahead of June’s spending review, as funds are diverted to the military. This would be a mistake. Britain’s austerity is at odds with the majority of EU states that seem ready to apply pandemic lessons to strengthen defence, counter Russian threats and reduce reliance on the US. At the Munich Security Conference, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, signalled a major fiscal shift, invoking an “escape clause” to exclude military spending from EU deficit rules – mirroring the Covid response, when the EU suspended fiscal constraints to enable stimulus spending. This is a pragmatic shift, acknowledging that the menace of a revanchist Moscow outweighs self‑imposed budget limits. Sir Keir Starmer should take note. If the Treasury funds defence by cutting existing budgets, departments like justice, local government and welfare will suffer real-terms reductions to their outlays. This would be politically unsustainable. Neoclassical economists may argue that Britain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is too high, but it remains comparable to those of France, Italy and Spain. Defence spending arguably also has a high fiscal multiplier, generating more economic activity and job creation than other expenditures. Mr Trump demands Nato members spend 5% of GDP on defence. This has forced a historic shift in EU policy, potentially setting a precedent for future deficit exemptions in green investment and industrial policy. Europe should also heed Mario Draghi’s advice: in crises, fiscal policy must drive growth and recovery. In December, the former head of the European Central Bank contrasted Europe’s austerity with US stimulus, noting that after the financial crash, the US injected €7.8tn into its economy through deficit spending, while the eurozone managed €560bn. Europe’s restrictive fiscal policy stifled growth, while the US used it far more effectively. In this volatile world, the EU and Britain must address Covid-era debt. Ongoing negotiations over EU pandemic borrowing suggest more austerity ahead – misguided, since this spending wasn’t reckless but a necessary crisis response. The ECB should absorb EU pandemic debt to prevent further austerity and boost recovery. In Britain, the Bank of England should stop selling Covid debt, as it’s raising yields and tightening fiscal conditions unnecessarily. “There are decades when nothing happens; and there are weeks when decades happen,” Lenin is often quoted as saying. The past seven days have underscored just how quickly history moves – and how swiftly governments must adapt. Europe has already begun that shift. Britain should follow.

2025-02-09T17:30:05Z,The Guardian view on interest rates: the Bank of England on its own won’t revive growth | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/09/the-guardian-view-on-interest-rates-the-bank-of-england-on-its-own-wont-revive-growth,"“It will be welcome news to many that we have been able to cut interest rates again,” said Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, last week. Plenty of mortgage holders would agree. Savers might not share Mr Bailey’s sentiments. However, he justified the cut, made despite inflationary risks, by arguing that falling worker bargaining power would see price pressures subside. Without rate cuts, the Bank warned, there was the risk of anaemic economic growth. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, backed the Bank, saying its action would “ease cost of living pressures”. That is true, but the benefits of lowering the burden of borrowing won’t outweigh the costs of Ms Reeves’ fiscal choices. She is counting on up to six base rate cuts by mid-2026 to buoy consumer sentiment. But relying solely on monetary policy is not effective economic management. The former Tory prime minister Edward Heath once mocked the then-chancellor Nigel Lawson for being a “one-club golfer” stuck in a bunker. “He doesn’t know what to do and has therefore very wisely decided to do nothing,” Mr Heath quipped. Many holes have been played on the parliamentary green since, but the critique still holds. Ms Reeves is betting that steeply declining borrowing costs will have an immediate impact on businesses and households in a way that capital investment – the core of the chancellor’s “plan for growth” – never could. Low interest rates alone won’t end stagnation. Between the financial crisis and the pandemic, the UK kept interest rates at historic lows. Yet economic growth and productivity remained lower than in the preceding decade – though Brexit didn’t help. Cheaper borrowing failed to spark robust investment and high levels of consumer confidence. The reason is that businesses and households often use lower rates to pay off debt rather than taking on new loans. This is especially true in a sluggish economy – people prefer saving over spending. As John Maynard Keynes argued, in uncertain times, firms and individuals hoard cash, undermining the intended effects of monetary easing. Even if firms face lower borrowing costs, they won’t invest unless they see demand rising. The problem isn’t access to cheap credit – it’s weak demand. Stagnant growth this year stems from insufficient fiscal stimulus. Much of the government’s borrowing is likely just offsetting capital outflows due to the trade deficit, rather than adding to private sector spending power. To boost growth, a larger fiscal deficit is needed. That could come through higher public spending. Or it might be through fiscal reliefs for, say, green investment. It could also be achieved by tax cuts targeted at lower-income households, who are far more likely to spend than save. Yet the Treasury wants public sector net borrowing to decline from 2025-26, to return “inflation sustainably to target”. This is not, as the Bank says, a concern. Constraining government spending will cut growth – growth that ministers say is their top priority. Ms Reeves’s real test comes in 2026-27 when spending cuts and tax hikes kick in to meet self-imposed fiscal rules. Labour MPs, councillors and activists must lobby her to rethink. Rather than prioritising deficit reduction, Ms Reeves should boost spending on public services and job creation – ensuring fiscal policy aids, not hinders, economic wellbeing. The last decade showed clearly that low rates alone won’t deliver growth. Without an active fiscal policy, Britain risks remaining trapped in Mr Heath’s proverbial bunker.",Economics; Bank of England; Andrew Bailey; Mortgages; Rachel Reeves; Autumn budget 2024; Interest rates; Edward Heath; Nigel Lawson; Economic growth (GDP); Trade policy; Inflation; UK news; Politics,Opinion
2024-11-18T05:00:30Z,"Be brave and impose minimum tax on world’s billionaires, urges Spanish minister",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/nov/18/be-brave-and-impose-minimum-tax-on-worlds-billionaires-urges-spanish-minister,"Spain’s economy minister has urged the world’s richest countries to “be brave” and redouble efforts to reach an agreement on a global minimum tax on the world’s 3,000 billionaires, saying recent elections have shown citizens are demanding “redistribution of wealth”. Speaking during a visit to London before the gathering of G20 leaders in Rio de Janeiro on Monday, Carlos Cuerpo said the plan had gained political momentum since the summer, when finance ministers agreed to work together to “ensure that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed”. Brazil, which backs proposals to raise an estimated $250bn a year from the world’s billionaires by ensuring they pay taxes worth at least 2% on their assets, is expected to push for formal negotiations on global wealth taxes when it hosts next year’s Cop climate summit. France, Germany and South Africa have expressed support, saying the money is needed to help climate-vulnerable nations and drive green investment. “There is this moment where you have to be brave and where you just have to do things that you are convinced are right” said Cuerpo. “There is an element here of redistribution of wealth that, if we listen carefully to the results of many of the elections that have taken place over the last years, that has been demanded by our citizens, by our population. So we have to somehow respond.” Cuerpo, an economist who led the Spanish treasury before entering government last December, was appointed as an independent minister to oversee the economy, trade and business by the socialist prime minister Pedro Sánchez. Concern in Spain over the climate crisis has reached new heights after flash floods in Valencia this month caused more than 200 deaths and extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. Among EU nations, Spain is at the sharp end of climate change. Barcelona, the country’s second-largest city, is racing to build desalination plants in order to ensure future water supplies during droughts. Despite the havoc caused by changing weather patterns, the Spanish economy is booming, with the International Monetary Fund predicting it will have grown 2.9% this calendar year – faster than all of the G7 economies including the US. The bounce is partly due to tourism, which has come roaring back after the pandemic, bringing its own complications with overcrowding and pressure on water supplies and other resources. But Cuerpo has said renewables and other green investment projects are part of the growth engine. Spain has been given €160bn in EU loans and grants to recover from Covid, and has diverted a chunk of the cash into decarbonisation. A third of its electricity last year came from wind and solar. “Investing in renewables in Spain is a factor that is driving our competitiveness up,” said Cuerpo. Another post-Covid measure has been to tighten the national wealth tax. The system in place dates back to 2011, after the financial crash, and applies to those with more than €700,000 in assets. In 2022, the Sánchez government closed loopholes so that Madrid and other regional governments could no longer opt out. Although Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, was criticised for making no mention of wealth taxes in her first budget last month, outside Britain the idea is gaining support. France’s Assemblée Nationale voted on 25 October for an annual 2% levy on those with assets worth more than €1bn. While the measure was opposed by the government, and may not survive the complex budget negotiations, it was supported by a majority of the parliament. During Covid, the world’s five richest men doubled their wealth. Donald Trump’s successful campaign to become the next US president, with a mandate to cut taxes and deregulate, has led to their fortunes increasing further. According to research by the pioneering economist Gabriel Zucman, billionaires pay an average of 0.3% tax on their wealth – a fraction of the rates paid by workers. Zucman is the architect of the global wealth tax scheme being promoted by Cuerpo and his allies in Brazil and beyond. It is based on the minimum 15% tax rate imposed on multinationals as of this year and now adopted by more than 50 countries. Supporters have said it is not necessary for every country to sign up for the idea to get off the ground. If billionaires relocated to tax havens, for example, their countries of origin could impose exit taxes. In July, finance leaders from every G20 country agreed to “engage cooperatively to ensure that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed”. When the leaders of the 20 richest nations meet in Brazil this week, they will be asked to confirm that commitment. Cuerpo said he would push to the put the plan on the agenda at the UN development finance summit in Seville next summer, and work closely with Brazil to ensure discussions are coordinated with the preparations for Cop30. For governments seeking more equal taxation, the political air cover of an international agreement could be an easier option than clashing with their most powerful citizens and armies of well-paid lobbyists. “The bigger the coordination or the larger the coordination, the easier it is to implement,” said Cuerpo. “It minimises the political capital costs”.",The super-rich; G20; Economics; Income inequality; World news; Spain; Climate crisis; Tax and spending,News
2024-02-02T18:11:31Z,Labour’s mixed messages on £28bn green pledge put it in worst of all worlds,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/02/labour-is-in-the-worst-of-all-worlds-with-confused-messaging-on-its-28bn-pledge,"For weeks, Labour officials have been locked in meetings as they try to figure out how to present Westminster’s worst kept-secret: Keir Starmer’s slow U-turn away from his pledge to spend £28bn a year on the green economy. Publicly, senior party figures insist that nothing has changed since last summer, when the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the party would spend £28bn only if the party’s strict fiscal rules allowed. But in private they admit that as it becomes clearer what kind of economy they would inherit should they come to power this year, the idea of actually hitting the target has become a pipe dream. Multiple frontbenchers and senior advisers confirmed to the Guardian this week that the target was now dead. “I can’t explain why someone in communications got stuck on the £28bn figure,” said one shadow minister. “It’s kind of meaningless if it’s not actually attached to planned investments for a purpose.” Speaking on Friday morning, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, appeared to confirm as much, saying the target would “move around” depending on economic conditions and the projects that needed funding. Officials insisted on Friday afternoon that Jones’s words did not signal an end to the £28bn “ambition”, as Starmer has termed it. But observers note that while Starmer continues to talk about the figure in public, none of the shadow Treasury team does. Asked 10 times on Sky News this week whether she backed the target, Reeves refused to use the number at all, saying instead: “The importance of economic and fiscal stability … will always come first.” Labour insiders insist there is no split between Reeves and Starmer on this key part in the party’s policy platform. “I’ve worked in split teams, this is not a split team,” said one senior adviser. Those close to Reeves point out that while Starmer is often asked about the environmental aspects of the plan, the shadow chancellor is usually asked to defend the spending. Nevertheless, some advisers, most notably Pat McFadden and Morgan McSweeney in Labour’s campaign team, want Starmer to say publicly that he is dropping the plan, while others argue that doing so would add to the impression he cannot be trusted. Officials say they are not anticipating a “clarification moment”, when Starmer would come out and say what he thinks the party is likely to borrow to fund green investment, given the state of the economy. However, if the Labour leader does decide to make a public statement on it, he would probably do so after next month’s budget. “We will see what the headroom looks like in March,” said one adviser. “There is not much we can say before that.” The problem with Labour’s current position is that the party is in the worst of all worlds. As long as Starmer continues to talk about £28bn, the Conservatives will continue to claim that Labour intends to raise taxes to pay for it, despite Reeves’s insistence this will not happen. But while the Labour leader defends what some of his most senior allies call a “meaningless” target, the party has allocated only about £10bn a year worth of projects on schemes including a publicly owned energy company and a home insulation plan. And with officials insisting these also remain subject to the party’s fiscal rules, some green activists worry they will soon be scrapped as well. Steve Coulter, head of economy at the Green Alliance, said: “This is not a story about an arbitrary number. It’s a fundamental question about the kind of future we want to live in. “Will Labour retrofit millions of homes, tackling fuel poverty and bringing down energy bills? Will they revitalise our automotive and steel industries, providing high-quality jobs and protecting our national security?” Senior Labour figures say that honing the commitment to focus solely on what has already been announced would boost the party’s green credentials. “It was always intended to be allocated before the general election, so this isn’t such a major departure really,” said one. “It’s being firmed up not dropped.” Shadow cabinet ministers are getting frustrated at the confused messaging. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, warned at a shadow cabinet meeting last month that the constant speculation was damaging policymaking more generally. Some say Sue Gray, Starmer’s chief of staff, was supposed to have resolved some of these disagreements in the last few weeks. Others say the blame lies with uncertainty on Starmer’s part. Meanwhile the Conservatives, riven by their own divisions on issues including immigration and tax, are watching on delighted. One senior Downing Street official compared it to Theresa May’s decision to reverse her manifesto commitment to overhaul social care in 2017 while insisting “nothing has changed”. Even if Starmer formally ditches the £28bn target next month, some believe it is too late to stop the Tory attacks on the policy. “I don’t know why they’re even bothering,” said one adviser to the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. “We’re just going to go on about £28bn even more.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; Rachel Reeves; Green politics; Politics; UK news; Economics; Environment; Business; Economic policy,Politics
2025-01-16T18:36:05Z,The Guardian view on Biden’s warning of oligarchy: Trump and the malefactors of wealth | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-warning-of-oligarchy-trump-and-the-malefactors-of-wealth,"Aristocrats are “the most difficult Animals to manage, of anything in the whole Theory and practice of Government. They will not suffer themselves to be governed,” John Adams warned, writing after his presidency. Banning titles was insufficient; a few would still be distinguished by birth or, especially, wealth. The problem was not just their ability to buy political favours but the grip that their money had on people’s minds. Economic and political power entwine everywhere. Fear of the rich’s outsized influence has existed throughout US history. Yet at times the relationship becomes especially stark and threatening. On Wednesday, Joe Biden evoked the 19th-century Gilded Age and the robber barons – who crushed competitors, exploited workers, bought judges and politicians, and flaunted wealth – in his warning against oligarchs. In his parting words from the Oval Office, the president talked up his achievements: “The seeds are planted, and they’ll grow, and they’ll bloom for decades to come.” It is true that he received insufficient credit for the strengthened economy, green investment, massive healthcare expansion and his management of the Covid disaster that he inherited from Donald Trump, alongside his support for Ukraine. But his carelessness towards Palestinian lives in Gaza and his refusal to stand aside sooner – extraordinarily, he still maintains that he could have beaten Mr Trump – contributed to the Democrats’ defeat. What resonated, however, was his alarm call as he warned of the “dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra-wealthy people”, adding: “An oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.” Like Dwight Eisenhower’s parting warning against the military-industrial complex – which Mr Biden cited – this was an unexpected and ominous alert to the American public. Inequality is at staggering levels. The top 0.1% of the US population hold nearly six times as much total wealth as the bottom 50%. Democrats as well as Republicans have profited from the super-rich: at least 83 billionaires backed Kamala Harris’s campaign. No one imagines that they all did so from disinterested concern for their nation. Yet rarely has the marriage of politics and riches been as naked or unashamed as with Mr Trump. The man who rages against elites has assembled a cabinet with 13 billionaires. Elon Musk, the first person whose net worth has passed $400bn, says that citizens will face “temporary hardship” as his department of government efficiency slashes public spending. “Oilgarchs” are already reaping the rewards for backing fossil-fuel-friendly Mr Trump. Though multiple large egos are in close proximity, this marriage is likely to thrive without external challenges. As anger grew at the turn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt weakened the “malefactors of wealth” by trust-busting, creating regulatory agencies and putting land off limits to commercial exploitation. Many Americans long for another “square deal”. But wealth allows its owners to shape reality. The railroads that enriched 19th-century tycoons literally set the time to which the nation ran. Now the “tech industrial complex” highlighted by Mr Biden and run by Mr Trump’s new friends works at an even more intimate level, determining what voters see. At stake may ultimately be the question of who shall rule: the people or America’s new aristocrats. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2024-02-08T18:16:30Z,Sunak refuses to apologise to Brianna Ghey’s father over PMQs trans jibe,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/rishi-sunak-refuses-apologise-brianna-ghey-father-pmqs-trans-jibe,"Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise to Brianna Ghey’s father and said it was “sad and wrong” to link his jibe about transgender people to the murdered teenager’s case. The prime minister doubled down on his comments on Thursday morning, saying it was “the worst of politics” to link them to the trans teenager’s case. Sunak has been urged to apologise after accusing the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of having difficulty “defining a woman” at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. He made the remark after he was told by Starmer that Brianna’s mother, Esther Ghey, was in the public gallery. Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, said Sunak’s comment had been “dehumanising” and urged him to apologise. Brianna was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered by two teenagers in February last year. On a visit to Cornwall, Sunak told reporters: “Like everyone, I was completely shocked by Brianna’s case. To have your child taken from you in such awful circumstances is almost impossible to come to terms with, and for Brianna’s mum to talk with such empathy and compassion about that, I thought, was inspiring and it showed the very best of humanity. I’ve nothing but the most heartfelt sympathy for her entire family and friends.” “But to use that tragedy to detract from the very separate and clear point I was making about Keir Starmer’s proven track record of multiple U-turns on major policies, because he doesn’t have a plan, I think is both sad and wrong, and it demonstrates the worst of politics.” The prime minister’s remark drew fierce criticism from opposition parties and some Conservatives. Starmer told Sunak: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame.” Asked to respond to Spooner’s request for an apology, Sunak said his comments had been “absolutely legitimate”. “If you look at what I said, I was very clear, talking about Keir Starmer’s proven track record of U-turns on major policies because he doesn’t have a plan.” Earlier on Thursday, the policing minister, Chris Philp, said Sunak was “very keen” to meet Brianna’s family. Esther Ghey wrote on Peace &amp; Mind UK, the Facebook page she set up for a campaign in her daughter’s memory, that she did not “wish to comment on reports of wording or comments recently made. My focus is on creating a positive change and a lasting legacy for Brianna. “Through Peace &amp; Mind, we want to improve lives by empowering people, giving them the tools they need to build mental resilience, empathy and self-compassion through mindfulness. In developing these skills, I hope that we can create a more understanding, peaceful and stronger society for everyone.” Several Tory MPs have criticised Sunak’s remark. The former minister Paul Scully told the BBC’s Politics Live: “If it was me, I would probably pick up the phone to Brianna’s father, frankly.” Another former minister, Jackie Doyle-Price, told Times Radio that while she advocated balancing transgender rights with the protection of single-sex spaces, Sunak’s comment “trivialises something that’s very important” and was “frankly very ill-judged”. Dehenna Davison, another former minister, said on X that it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense”, adding: “Our words in the house resonate right across our society and we all need to remember that.” Brianna’s mother had been in Westminster during PMQs with her local MP, Charlotte Nichols, as she campaigned for mindfulness lessons to be taught in schools after her daughter’s murder. Brianna was stabbed to death by Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe in a Cheshire park last year. During their sentencing last week, the judge said the “exceptionally brutal” murder had elements of sadism on the part of Jenkinson and transphobic hate on the part of Ratcliffe.",Rishi Sunak; Transgender; PMQs; Conservatives; Society; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-07-17T16:48:38Z,Keir Starmer appoints two influential leftwing critics as government advisers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/17/keir-starmer-appoints-two-influential-leftwing-critics-to-government,"Keir Starmer has drafted into government two leftwing critics of his stance on benefits and green investment, as the prime minister faces pressure to drop Labour’s cautious approach to reviving the economy. Carys Roberts, the influential director of the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, has joined Downing Street’s policy unit as a special adviser, while Rachel Statham, who headed the IPPR’s work on public services, has been hired to lead his policy unit’s work on childcare, the early years and education. Roberts had been among leading figures behind Labour’s now-scrapped pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment. When the plan was controversially ditched earlier this year, the economist warned that such a significant scaling back on investment would “undermine efforts to grow the economy and manage the transition to net zero fairly”. Roberts will advise the prime minister on climate, energy and the environment. Statham has also criticised Starmer’s economic caution, and argued as recently as last month that his failure to prioritise scrapping the two-child limit on benefits would ensure Labour was making a “plan for substantial increases in child poverty” over the next five years. In the first weeks since Labour’s election landslide Starmer has been filling key ministerial appointments and recruiting expert figures to play influential roles behind the scenes in his administration. Alongside surprise appointments for the businessman James Timpson, as prisons minister, and the leading barrister Richard Hermer, as attorney general, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has created a council of economic advisers chaired by the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenen. Since taking over as Labour leader four years ago Starmer has gradually shifted the party to the political centre ground, aiming to win back swing voters and to neutralise Tory attacks that it could not be trusted with the economy – despite the risk of alienating some in the Labour base. His government has so far prioritised sticking closely to Labour’s “no drama” election manifesto, with the cabinet minister Pat McFadden telling the BBC on Wednesday that “people shouldn’t expect us to implement the things we didn’t say we’d do” when asked why the two-child benefit limit was being kept. However, Starmer’s appointments give an influential role to economists who have advocated a more radical stance. As the IPPR’s executive director since 2020, Roberts oversaw the thinktank’s Environmental Justice Commission, which recommended a £30bn increase in public investment in a low carbon economy – widely seen as the catalyst behind Labour’s £28bn pledge. IPPR has also consistently criticised the two-child benefit limit, first introduced by the Conservatives in April 2017. Statham wrote on X last month that “to keep the two-child limit is to plan for substantial increases in child poverty over the next parliament”. It comes as Starmer faces pressure from within his own ranks to abolish the policy after official figures showed a record 1.6 million children living in families affected by it.",Keir Starmer; Labour; Green politics; Poverty; Children; Benefits; UK news,Politics
2025-02-06T12:21:19Z,Jeff Bezos fund ends support for climate group amid fears billionaires ‘bowing down’ to Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/jeff-bezos-climate-group-trump-bezos-earth-fund-science-based-targets-initiative-decarbonisation-aoe,"Jeff Bezos’s $10bn climate and biodiversity fund has halted its funding of one of the world’s most important climate certification organisations, amid broader concerns US billionaires are “bowing down to Trump” and his anti-climate action rhetoric. The Bezos Earth Fund has stopped its support for the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an international body that assesses if companies are decarbonising in line with the Paris agreement. Earth Fund had been one of two core funders of the SBTi, with the Ikea Foundation: the two accounted for 61% of its total funding last year. Earth Fund’s decision was first reported by the FT. Spokespeople for Earth Fund and SBTi said the $18m (£14.5m) grant had been a three-year commitment that expired as previously agreed, and Earth Fund had not made a final decision on future support. But researchers familiar with the SBTi, as well as advisers at the organisation, raised concerns that the vanishing support was part of a broader trend of wealthy individuals moving away from funding causes that the US president – who has previously called climate change a hoax – did not agree with. Prof Doreen Stabinsky, who is on the technical council of SBTi, said: “You look at Bezos and the folks he’s hanging out with in the billionaires club, and you realise this is about more than SBTi,” she said. “Bezos is bowing down to Trump in a way a bunch of billionaires are bowing down to Trump.” Stabinsky said Bezos’s decision was “not surprising at all” given he previously stopped the editorial board of the Washington Post – which he owns – taking an endorsement position on presidential candidates. It came as scientists described their “stress and fear” at Donald Trump’s executive orders to cut federal grant money. Mentions of the climate crisis have also been removed or downgraded across US government websites. Stabinsky said: “Climate for Trump is just one of those things that is very visible, very on his radar, very part of his messaging – anti-climate action, anti any corporate that is doing something that is visibly about climate change.” Before Trump’s inauguration last month, the US’s six biggest banks quit the global banking industry’s net zero target-setting group. Kelly Stone, a senior policy analyst at ActionAid USA, said the move to no longer fund SBTi was “really disappointing, but not especially surprising at this point”, describing it as “part of a corporate wave” of abandoning green ambitions. She said: “We’re seeing a huge retreat from a lot of these climate pledges from the biggest corporate and financial actors.” Peter Riggs, executive director of US nonprofit Pivot Point, said he was concerned “about how this will impact green investment generally, and investments in energy transitions, because obviously the signal from Washington right now is very strong that renewable energies and other kinds of zero-carbon or low-carbon approaches are actively discouraged. It’s not even that they’re being sidelined, they’re being eviscerated.” In April last year, SBTi announced plans to allow companies to use carbon offsets from the voluntary carbon market for indirect emissions, in a move some believed was influenced by the Bezos Earth Fund. It provoked internal fury from staff, who said they had not been consulted, and warned that it opened the door to greenwashing. Riggs said: “I think there are two things at play. One is that Bezos, or the Bezos Earth Fund, ultimately decided that they weren’t in the position, or weren’t willing to endorse, the science-based standard because of the challenges in it. And second, the political climate in Washington having changed – they didn’t want to draw a lot of attention to those kinds of commitments.” An SBTi spokesperson said: “The three-year incubation grant made to the SBTi in 2021 by Bezos Earth Fund was designed to help us scale at the pace needed to meet extraordinary demand for our services. The grant expired in 2024 as originally agreed.” A spokesperson from Bezos Earth Fund said: “In 2021, the Bezos Earth Fund made a three-year grant to SBTi for capacity building, which ended in December 2024 as originally agreed. There has been no change in the relationship between the Earth Fund and SBTi. SBTi has not requested additional funding from the Earth Fund. As a result, the Earth Fund has made no decision with regard to further funding.”",Jeff Bezos; US news; Environment; Philanthropy; Climate crisis; Climate finance; Climate science scepticism and denial; Climate science; Climate aid; Green economy; Donald Trump; World news,Environment
2024-02-08T09:55:36Z,Minister defends Sunak’s transgender jibe amid calls for apology,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/minister-chris-philp-defends-rishi-sunak-transgender-jibe-amid-calls-for-apology,"A government minister has defended Rishi Sunak’s transgender jibe after the father of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey called on the prime minister to apologise. Chris Philp, the policing minister, insisted on BBC Breakfast that Sunak had “made no reference at all to any individual trans people” and was instead “making a point about Labour’s very numerous flip-flops”. Sunak is under pressure to apologise for making a joke at the expense of transgender people at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, just after he was told by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that Brianna’s mother, Esther Ghey, was in the public gallery. Brianna, who was transgender, was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered by two teenagers in February last year. Starmer welcomed Esther Ghey to the Commons on Wednesday and praised her “unwavering bravery” before asking Sunak a question about NHS waiting lists. In response the prime minister listed what he called broken Labour promises, telling the Commons: “I think I counted almost 30 in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.” The jibe drew cries of “shame” from opposition MPs, who called for Sunak to apologise. A visibly angry Starmer responded: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in the chamber.” Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, said Sunak’s remark was “absolutely dehumanising” and called for him to apologise. “For the prime minister of our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising,” he told Sky News. Facing questions about the controversy on Thursday morning, Philp declined six times on BBC Breakfast to say whether he thought Sunak’s jibe was appropriate or respectful. Asked whether he was suggesting that Brianna’s father had misunderstood the prime minister’s remark, Philp said he was “very sad” to read Spooner’s response and added: “I have got every respect for, obviously, the views and feelings of a bereaved father.” He insisted that the prime minister was making a political point about Labour and that Starmer was “actually wrong” to bring up Brianna after Sunak’s remark. “It is of course important to conduct public debate respectfully,” Philp told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “That is why I think it was actually wrong of Keir Starmer to introduce Brianna as a subject in the next question, because Rishi Sunak had not made any reference to any individuals.” Sunak has offered to meet Esther Ghey but no meeting has been publicly confirmed. Although some Conservative MPs have criticised Sunak’s remark, the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, accused Starmer of trying to use Brianna’s murder for “political point-scoring”. Philp told Times Radio: “The point the prime minister was making was about flip-flops and U-turns, and he listed about 10 different flip-flops and U-turns that Keir Starmer’s made – he’s making another one, I understand, later on today, on this £28bn that seems to be vanishing or is being U-turned, or they’re saying they can do the policy without it costing anything, or some similar nonsense.” “So, the PM was trying to highlight Keir Starmer’s flip-flops and U-turns, and that I think was an understandable thing to do.” “As a more general point, when talking about difficult and sensitive issues, it is obviously important for everyone in public life, all of us – journalists, politicians, everybody – just to use measured and respectful language.”",Rishi Sunak; Transgender; UK news; PMQs; House of Commons; Politics,Politics
2023-04-17T23:01:28Z,EU faces legal action after including gas and nuclear in ‘green’ investments guide,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/18/eu-faces-legal-action-gas-nuclear-green-investments-guide-european-commission,"The European Commission is being sued by environmental campaigners over a decision to include gas and nuclear in an EU guide to “green” investments. Two separate legal challenges are being lodged on Tuesday at the European Union’s general court in Luxembourg – one by Greenpeace and another by a coalition including Client Earth and WWF – after the classification of fuels in the so-called taxonomy, a guide for investors intended to channel billions into green technologies. The EU executive, argues Greenpeace, acted unlawfully when it designated gas and nuclear as bridge technologies in the taxonomy, which is intended to help meet the bloc’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Client Earth, along with three other NGOs, is challenging the inclusion of gas, which it says breaks the EU climate law that sets a legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The cases are the latest legal action against the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”. Last year a lawsuit was launched by Austria and supported by Luxembourg. Eight national and regional Greenpeace organisations including France, Germany and EU office in Brussels are asking the court to rule the inclusion of gas and nuclear invalid. Nina Treu, the executive director of Greenpeace Germany, said: “The taxonomy was meant to be a tool to meet the 1.5C target [on global heating] and make the European Union climate neutral, fostering social and economic restructuring for the European economy by shifting funds. Instead of hindering greenwashing, it has become a tool for greenwashing.” Gas and nuclear had been included because of “politically motivated lobbying”, Treu said. Greenpeace will tell the court that gas cannot be considered a “transition fuel” because any gas-powered plant that comes online today will still be running beyond 2050. The environment group will also say the construction of new nuclear plants – which usually take one to two decades to build in Europe – will delay the move away from coal power, hinder development of renewables, risk accidents and create pollution. “Nuclear is dangerous, expensive, vulnerable to climate change and too slow to stop the climate breakdown,” Treu said. Greenpeace has hired the lawyer Roda Verheyen, who acted for the group in a landmark case that resulted in Germany’s climate protection laws being ruled inadequate by the country’s constitutional court in 2021. Verheyen said the inclusion of gas and nuclear was not in line with the EU’s original taxonomy law. “The European Commission has violated the very idea of the taxonomy regulation. This is especially obvious as including nuclear activities does pose significant harm to the environment, which is expressly prohibited by the regulation.” The lawsuit was “essentially an enforcement claim”, she said. “Observe your own law. Actually carry through with the European green deal,” she said, referring to the EU’s flagship climate plan. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The campaign groups are challenging one of the delegated acts. The separate legal challenge by the coalition including Client Earth and WWF covers the inclusion of gas but not nuclear. Anaïs Berthier at Client Earth said the European Commission had violated a requirement to make science-based policy and broken the EU climate law that required policymakers to carry out checks to ensure all actions by the bloc were consistent with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050. “Labelling fossil gas as ‘sustainable’ is as absurd as it is unlawful,” said the coalition, which also includes the NGOs Transport &amp; Environment and Bund. “It goes against the EU’s own scientific advice and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the EU’s climate action. Fossil gas is not clean, not cheap and not a secure source of energy.” A judgment is expected in 2025, although participants expressed the hope the court would act faster. “There is confusion in the market, because the current law infringes European law,” Verheyen said.",Energy; Climate crisis; European Commission; Fossil fuels; Nuclear power; Greenpeace; Environment; European Union; Europe; World news; Green economy; Environmental activism,Environment
2024-07-01T20:08:48Z,"Labour will take global lead on climate action, Ed Miliband vows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/labour-will-take-global-lead-on-climate-action-ed-miliband-vows,"Labour will promise to take the lead on global efforts to tackle the climate crisis, filling a “vacuum of leadership” on the world stage and proving Rishi Sunak’s U-turn on net zero has been a “historic mistake”, Ed Miliband has said. The shadow energy security and net zero secretary said the UK needed to change course and was “off track”. Labour drew widespread criticism earlier this year from economists, industrial leaders and environmental campaigners when it cut its green investment plans by half, rolling back on a pledge to spend £28bn equipping the economy to reach its climate target. It has also been locked in combat with the Tories over the costs and benefits of a green transition and has given way in certain key areas. Miliband has pledged to stick with the Tories’ decision to scrap a ban on gas boiler sales from 2035. But Miliband says his party would put climate front and centre of its plans in government, promising to reverse the ban on onshore wind in the immediate days after parliament returns after the election. He said it was also a chance to fundamentally change course on climate and to make that case on the world stage. “We have taken the manifesto position we have because we think it is the right thing now,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “But it is also right that we fill the vacuum of leadership on this issue. “We now have a government that is explicitly going along with the climate delayers. We have to change course as a country and as a world. And this election is an opportunity for us to change course.” Miliband is to become one of the most influential figures in the expected next Labour government and one of very few with direct cabinet experience. He said that climate was the front line in the battle against the populist right across the world. “If we win, we will seize the moment,” he said. “There is not a minute to waste in the drive for 2030 clean power and in the drive for climate action. The world is off track, Britain is off track and we intend to change that direction.” There is a growing awareness within Labour of the scale of the party’s task internationally in the coming years, with the potential loss of progressive allies on climate issues in governments such as France, Canada and the US. The former party leader said a Labour government would take on that mantle of climate leadership, should it win the election. “You only get to lead internationally if you set the right example at home,” he said. “If we win the election, it will send a message round the world that the approach we are taking on clean energy, our argument on bills, independence, jobs and future generations, you can win an election on that argument.” Labour has avoided getting into direct conflict with the Green party, which is outflanking Labour on most climate pledges and targeting seats against Labour in Bristol Central and in Brighton Pavillion. But Miliband said his experience from the 2015 election taught him not to believe the polls – and that in seats with wafer-thin majorities a vote for small parties would risk allowing the Conservatives back in. “Do not vote Green and wake up with a Tory government,” he said. And he also said he would not defend the actions of climate protesters like Just Stop Oil, accusing them of being part of breaking the consensus on climate and being “deeply counterproductive”. Though there was a right to peaceful protest, he said, “I think all the evidence is that it turns people off the cause.” Miliband said there had been huge damage done by the Conservatives to the climate consensus in Britain since the UK hosted Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021. Net zero has been a major battleground on the right and Sunak announced a dilution of green policies last autumn including moving back the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Miliband said voters could chose to give their endorsement to tackling climate action on Thursday. “This is a moment to show that the Conservative party and Rishi Sunak made a historic mistake by trying to break the climate consensus in this country,” he said. “This is the most important climate election in history – we are halfway through the decisive decade. The next government will serve for most of the rest of this decade. This is the biggest choice in our history on this,” he said. In February, Labour cut its green investment plans by half and pledged only £15bn a year for its green prosperity plan – only a third of which would be new money. The U-turn dismayed many business leaders and green campaigners, who said that without green investment on a larger scale the UK faced steep decline as a result of crumbling infrastructure and that energy targets would be difficult to hit. Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens, the German industrial giant and major investor, said massive investment was needed to rebuild the UK economy and make it fit for the future. Before the cut was announced he warned: “These are the growth areas of the future. The £28bn is not a cost, it’s an investment. If you make this investment, business will return to the UK.” At the time Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had “caved like a house of cards in the wind”. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, said the issue was less the actual sum spent than “the signal it sends”. Speaking after the cut, she said: “The party has been engaging constructively with business over recent months, but retaining the confidence of the market is dependent on not making U-turns that damage the UK’s investability.” But Miliband insisted it remained the “most ambitious plan for climate and energy in our national history” and said the party was committed to clean power by 2030, no new oil and gas licences, a warm homes plan and a national wealth fund to rebuild industrial heartlands. “We are seeking a mandate in this election for that agenda, it’s a mandate for economic change and it’s a mandate to tackle climate change,” he said. “We will make the modern, progressive, big tent case for climate action which does the right thing now. Rishi Sunak may have departed the pitch but I don’t think the British public have.” Research by More in Common has suggest Labour’s plan for Great British Energy is one of the main public cut-through policies – along with the Tories’ plans for national service. While there have been concerns the project would be merely an investment vehicle akin to George Osborne’s Green Investment Bank, Miliband said it would be a generator of clean energy. “It speaks to the sense we should own and invest in our own infrastructure,” he said. “And it speaks to a sense of a loss of control that we saw in the two years of our cost of living crisis that we have no control over fossil fuel markets governed by dictators like Putin.” Miliband said that the Tory narrative on the cost of net zero could be disproved by the action Labour would take to cut bills. “The truth is that we can beat the political right, the anti-climate right on this,” he said. “Take the onshore wind ban: the Resolution Foundation has shown that the ban hits the poorest six times harder than the rich. Their opposition to clean energy is driving up poverty and energy bills.”",Climate crisis; Ed Miliband; Labour; General election 2024; Environment; General elections; Politics; UK news; Green politics,Environment
2024-02-08T13:09:36Z,Starmer to scale back home insulation scheme as part of green policy U-turn ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/starmer-to-scale-back-home-insulation-scheme-as-part-of-green-policy-u-turn,"Keir Starmer is cutting back his ambitious home insulation scheme as part of his decision to scale down Labour’s green policy, sources have told the Guardian. The Labour leader will announce on Thursday that he is drastically reducing the scale of the £28bn “green prosperity plan” after weeks of uncertainty over the fate of the plan. People briefed on the scaled-back plan say the party’s home insulation scheme, which was singled out for attack by the Conservatives earlier this week, would be the major victim of the cuts. One person added they expected Labour to promise an additional £5bn a year of additional green spending on top of what the government has already committed, allowing the party to stick to its separate pledge to cut government debt levels. Starmer is expected to formally announce the U-turn later on Thursday after heavy speculation about whether the £28bn could survive in its original form. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, first announced it at the Labour party conference in 2021, as she promised to be the UK’s “first green chancellor”. Since then, however, Reeves has become much more sceptical about the policy, with economic analysis showing that sticking to the £28bn would violate Labour’s separate promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output by the end of a five-year period. Starmer has been lobbied heavily in recent weeks both by supporters of the plan, who say it forms the main plank of Labour’s economic policy, and opponents, who worry it could be used against the party in a general election campaign. The Conservatives have claimed that Labour is preparing to put up taxes to help pay for the scheme, though Reeves has denied this. The home insulation scheme is the largest single item in the green plan, with Labour having promised to spend up to £6bn a year to insulate 19m homes over a decade. A government analysis commissioned by the Conservatives earlier this week suggested the plan could actually cost double that, though Labour said it would fund the scheme through private sector incentives as well as public spending. However, some experts criticised the Treasury for having released the document at all, given Labour has explicitly said it will spend a maximum of £6bn on the scheme. Nick Macpherson, a former lead civil servant at the Treasury, tweeted on Wednesday: “Since time immemorial, whatever the party in power, these costings have had little if any credibility.” Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, said on Thursday morning that Starmer’s decision showed his lack of consistency. “This is a serious moment,” he said. “This was the flagship plank of Labour’s economic policy and it now looks like he’s trying to wriggle out of it.” Sunak added: “I think it demonstrates exactly what I’ve been saying, that he U-turns on major things, he can’t say what he would do differently because he doesn’t have a plan. And if you don’t have a plan, then you can’t deliver change for our country.” Starmer was also under fire on Thursday morning from both environmentalists and the left of his party. Barry Gardiner, the former shadow energy secretary, told the BBC: “Politically, it’s strategically incompetent.” Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “If we want warm homes, reasonable bills, and energy independence, investment is required. Switching to heat pumps will leave us less dependent on foreign gas imports, running our home heating instead on electricity from British renewables. “There is a global economic race to build clean industries and Britain has to compete for green investment.”",Labour; Green politics; Keir Starmer; UK news; Energy; Environment,Politics

Last month a delegation of MPs and peers from the cross-party home affairs committee and the joint committee on human rights visited the barge, which accommodates about 300 people in Portland, Dorset, and spoke to residents and staff. After the visit, the group wrote to ministers to set out serious concerns about the wellbeing of men on the barge. The group of MPs and peers said “many asylum seekers expressed mental health concerns”, with one man telling them he had suicidal thoughts as a result of being housed on the barge. Leonard Farruku, a 27-year-old Albanian man, was found dead on the barge on 12 December 2023 after a suspected suicide. The delegation also raised concerns about discrepancies in information provided by officials and the asylum seekers themselves. For example, there was confusion about whether a GP was available onboard every day or for one day a week. Organisations working with the men told the delegation the barge felt like a prison. In their letter to ministers, the group wrote: “We were disheartened to see some of the living conditions on the Bibby Stockholm, with many individuals having to share small, cramped cabins [originally designed for one person], often with people [up to six] they do not know [some of whom spoke a different language to them]. “These crowded conditions were clearly contributing to a decline in mental health for some of the residents, and they could amount to violations of the human rights of asylum seekers.” Diana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs committee, said: “Beyond the question of whether housing asylum seekers on a barge instead of hotels is actually value for money, which we are still seeking further information on from the Home Office, we need to know that they are living in conditions that are not detrimental to their wellbeing. “We are concerned that housing asylum claimants on Bibby Stockholm is leaving them in a claustrophobic environment, isolated from external support, including legal advice, and without important links to community, faith or family, potentially for months on end. “Support services on the barge must be adequate to meet the needs of those housed there, and if not, that there are practical steps in place to allow them to be accessed in the wider community.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm is of the utmost priority, and we constantly work to ensure the needs and vulnerabilities of those residing on the vessel are identified and met. Asylum seekers are screened to identify vulnerable individuals and ensure they are placed in suitable accommodation. “There are rigorous safeguarding processes in place on the barge. Residents have access to health and social care services, including mental health support. If concerns are raised about any aspect of the service delivered, we work with the provider to ensure these are swiftly addressed, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2025-03-12T16:00:47Z,"US energy industry’s climate retreat is putting profits over people, advocates say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/fossil-fuels-oil-gas-conference-ceraweek,"At a major oil and gas conference in Texas this week, companies publicly retreated from their flashy climate pledges of years past, redoubling their commitment to planet-warming fossil fuels. The withdrawals illustrate the companies’ allegiance not to ordinary Americans, but to their shareholders and the climate-skeptical Trump administration, advocates said. “We didn’t necessarily feel that those climate goals were really being done in a sincere, earnest way in the first place,” said Shiv Srivastava, an organizer and policy researcher with the Houston-based environmental justice organization Fenceline Watch. “It’s bad that they’re walking them back, but the problem was always that they could choose to walk them back if they wanted.” Five years ago, amid climate rollbacks from the first Trump administration, BP made headlines when it announced a plan to dramatically slash oil and gas production and up its renewable energy capacity twentyfold. Months later, Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, also made a much-lauded promise to “fundamentally reshape finance to deal with climate change”. Today, the companies are singing a different tune. Late last month, six weeks into Trump’s second term, BP said it would increase its investment in oil and gas to $10bn a year while slashing more than $5bn from its previous green investment plan. “I’m super excited we’ve launched it now,” BP’s CEO, Murray Auchincloss, said of the plan at the oil and gas conference CERAWeek in Houston on Tuesday. In January, BlackRock said it was leaving a key international group of asset managers committed to net-zero investments, though the company pledged to continue allowing investors to place money into into climate-focused funds. The coalition has since said it is temporarily shutting down. “We have to think about power and energy in a pragmatic way,” Fink said, adding that he believes gas will play a “major role” in the US for decades. He showed off a bracelet he wore that read: “Make energy great again.” Other companies have similarly eschewed their past climate commitments. Shell in December announced reduced investments in renewable energy. The company is “simplifying” its portfolio and focusing on expanding gas, Shell’s CEO, Wael Sawan, told CERAWeek attendees on Monday. Within the span of a month from December to January, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan all said they were abandoning their commitment to a UN-sponsored group, under which members pledge to zero out emissions from their investment portfolios. The announcements bring the companies into alignment with the Trump administration’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda. If the widespread climate retreat results in additional fossil fuel production, it will have disastrous consequences for those living in the most polluted and climate-vulnerable areas, said Srivastava. “It’s a further darkening of the skies for communities like ours,” he said. The true impact of the announcements will depend on market forces. Right now, many companies are reluctant to increase domestic oil and gas production, which already soared to record levels under Joe Biden. Adding to that supply could suppress energy prices and put a damper on profits, so many may choose to keep their production flat unless fuel prices increase. What will not dictate energy policy, Srivastava said, is climate science. Top experts have long warned that the world must phase out planet-warming coal, oil and gas to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis. “Decarbonization is clearly not the concern,” he said. Even before the recent round of rollbacks, corporate climate plans were insufficient to stem the climate crisis, experts have long warned. As it touted its green pledges, BlackRock maintained relationships with climate-denying politicians and was backing fewer environmentally and socially focused investment proposals. A May report from the research and advocacy non-profit Oil Change International also found that oil majors’ climate pledges were incompatible with the goals of the UN Paris climate agreement, with most companies planning to expand fossil fuel production. “Big oil and gas companies’ talk about transition has always been cheap,” said Kelly Trout, research director of Oil Change International. “A key lesson to take away is this: we cannot rely on the same companies that got us into this crisis to get us out of it.” The abandoning of climate commitments puts corporations out of step with the desires of the majority of Americans. December polling by the progressive Climate and Community Institute thinktank suggested most US voters support efforts to wind down fossil fuel production. A 2024 study in the journal Nature Climate Change found that 89% of the world’s population want their governments to “do more” to fix the climate crisis. And a January survey from Yale and George Mason University found that “most Americans, including many Republicans, do not support President Donald Trump’s proposed climate and energy policies”. At a Monday protest – the largest ever seen at CERAWeek – activists highlighted the disconnect between ordinary Americans’ concerns and energy policy. Tickets for this year’s conference cost more than $10,000, they noted, and only two panels this year were livestreamed to the public. “They’re here making decisions about our communities without giving us a seat at the table … without considering our best interests,” said Isabella Guinigundo, a campaigner with the activist group Youth Climate Finance Alliance. “They won’t even let us watch.”",Oil and gas companies; Environment; Fossil fuels; Oil; Oil; Energy industry; Energy; Business; Texas; US news,US news
2025-03-23T06:00:13Z,Kemi Badenoch accused of breaking pledge to Tory MPs of net zero by 2050,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/23/kemi-badenoch-accused-of-breaking-pledge-to-tory-mps-of-net-zero-by-2050,"Kemi Badenoch has been accused of breaking a promise made to Tory MPs during her leadership campaign after abandoning the party’s commitment to reaching net zero by 2050. Speaking to the Observer, Chris Skidmore, who served as a government minister between 2016 and 2020, said that Badenoch had made clear to a group of Tory MPs and other Conservatives at a leadership hustings in 2022, when she was seeking their votes in the race to replace Boris Johnson, that she backed the policy. Skidmore said he recalled “how she told a Conservative Environment Network hustings of 60 MPs that I organised with [former business and energy secretary] Alok Sharma for the leadership in 2022 that she believed in net zero – and made that promise in private to us all.” Skidmore, a former Tory energy minister who led a high-level review into how the UK could achieve net zero by 2050, added: “While I was conducting the net zero review, I spoke with her during a cabinet committee meeting chaired by Cop[26] president Alok Sharma and she restated again the importance of net zero for green trade and building international supply chains. “So the speech [last] week seems surprising, especially as it seems to also U-turn on a 2024 manifesto commitment.” Another Tory source who was at the 2022 hustings confirmed that, during a private meeting, Badenoch had said she would support the net zero policy, although the source added that she appeared to change her position soon after the hustings. Badenoch caused dismay among green Tories last week when she unceremoniously ditched the policy, saying politicians needed to come clean with voters that net zero was “impossible” to achieve “without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us”. She added: “We’ve got to stop pretending to the next generation. We’ve got to stop government by press release. “It’s exactly the reason that the political class has lost trust. The only way that we can regain it is to tell the unvarnished truth – net zero by 2050 is impossible.” After her speech, Theresa May, who introduced the target when she was prime minister, countered that “net zero by 2050 is challenging but achievable… It is supported by the scientific community and backed by the independent Climate Change Committee as being not just necessary but feasible and cost-effective.” Former Tory cabinet minister John Gummer, who as Lord Deben chaired the Climate Change Committee from 2012 to 2023, said Badenoch appeared not to have talked to anyone in the party who had been involved at the highest levels in examining the feasibility of achieving net zero by 2050, nor did she appear to have taken on board the findings of numerous reports by official bodies. “You would have thought she would have talked to the Climate Change Committee, which was set up under the Conservatives to provide such independent advice,” said Deben. Her approach would be “very damaging” and harm “green investment” into the UK, he added, as well as lead to higher electricity prices by making the country reliant on oil and gas for longer. Ryan Shorthouse, executive chair of the Bright Blue thinktank, which was the first centre-right organisation to call for a legal net zero target by 2050, said that polling over the past decade had consistently found tackling the climate crisis and improving the environment to be among the top priorities for voters under the age of 40. “There is independent and rigorous evidence showing that net zero emissions in the UK is achievable by 2050, but only if good policies are put in place now to support people on modest incomes with the costs and changes of the transition. There will be unsustainable costs to both our environment and economy if we do not achieve net zero emissions by the middle of this century. “Grownup politics means moving beyond political posturing and political polling and focusing instead on designing and implementing detailed, pro-market policies to reduce carbon emissions. Conservatives should recognise the significant long-term economic benefits from green growth, especially in coastal and industrial areas, and the importance of passing on a better environment to the next generation.” Skidmore, who resigned as an MP and from the Tory whip last year after Rishi Sunak’s government announced plans for new annual oil and gas licensing rounds, said that if Badenoch thought that ditching net zero would help win back support for her party, she was mistaken. “True Conservatives are not reactionaries like Reform – they know that the best way to predict the future is to shape it and not turn your back on it. “For those voters who are anti-net zero and don’t take climate change seriously, they won’t be turned – after all, it just strengthens in their own minds the case for voting for Reform. “So it’s a very odd strategy that will cost votes in the local elections, with more moderate Conservatives now likely to turn away from Badenoch, while strengthening Reform at the same time.” Analysis by the London School of Economics has found that although reaching net zero by 2050 would initially cost between 1% and 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) a year, it will save money by about 2040. Badenoch herself made this point in parliament in 2022: “Our latest estimates put the costs of net zero at under 2% of GDP – broadly similar to when we legislated for it two years ago – with scope for costs of low-carbon technologies to fall faster than expected.” A spokesman for the Tory leader indicated that she had made clear her reservations about achieving net zero by 2050 at the time the hustings were held in 2022.",Kemi Badenoch; Conservatives; Politics; UK news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment,Politics
2025-04-18T07:00:04Z,Why is Ed Miliband a target for all sides? Because he’s a lefty politician who gets things done | Andy Beckett,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/18/ed-miliband-target-all-sides-labour-left-politician-gets-things-done,"Why exactly does Ed Miliband make so many people so angry? At 55, 20 years into his parliamentary career, with rare ministerial experience under both New Labour and Keir Starmer, and a reputation around Westminster and Whitehall as one of politics’ nicer, more knowledgeable characters, he could be a respected figure in a generally inexperienced government. Instead, he’s this unpopular administration’s most controversial member. “An eco-zealot”, “a net-zero fanatic”, a “nauseating” hypocrite, “a cackling madman”, an “eco-Marxist”, “out of control”, “trashing Britain”, “a recruiting sergeant for the opposition”, the “most dangerous man in Britain” – Miliband provokes rightwing journalists and voters like no other minister. Possibly not since the onslaught in the 1970s on the socialist disruptor Tony Benn, whom Miliband later worked for as a teenager, has a Labour minister been so relentlessly targeted. Even the long-running and complex crisis in Britain’s steel industry has become an opportunity to blame him, despite him being secretary of state for energy security and net zero for fewer than 10 months. Like Benn, Miliband is also undermined by his own side. Anonymous briefings are constantly given to journalists that he is a political liability and about to be demoted or fired. In January, a typical Labour “colleague” told the Sunday Times: “The only minister who really knows how to work the system and get officials delivering what he wants is Ed Miliband … And Ed is the one minister we don’t want to be a success if we want to win the next election.” The government has forced Miliband into real or perceived retreats on airport expansion, electric vehicles, the nationalisation of energy companies and the scale of Labour’s green investment. To the disappointment of some environmentalists, he has had to spend much of his ministerial time trying to justify the government’s climate compromises, willingly or otherwise. To critics on all sides, the question is when he will resign – or why he hasn’t already. Yet neither his divisiveness nor his survival should come as a surprise. His determinedly upbeat 2021 book Go Big: 20 Bold Solutions to Fix Our World includes a quote from Machiavelli: “The reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order.” As any rational climate policy unavoidably focuses more and more on restricting big carbon-emitting interests – motorists, airlines, fossil fuel companies – so the policy’s designers and implementers inevitably become the hated or, more subtly, obstructed removers of commercial and personal freedoms. And unlike most Labour ministers, Miliband appears to enjoy upsetting the established order. His speeches are increasingly combative. In interviews, he challenges the assumptions behind hostile questions. Because he was an underwhelming Labour leader in what seems a distant era, the relatively calm first half of the 2010s, it’s been forgotten by many voters – but not by some of his enemies – that he was a sporadic troublemaker even then: attacking the Murdoch press over phone hacking, and corporate “predators” for feasting on the British economy. Despite his old “Red Ed” nickname, his politics are hardly revolutionary: no more than centre-left by postwar Labour standards. But unlike with many centrists, his beliefs are both stubbornly held and open to radicalisation, as has happened in recent years as he has perceived capitalism and the climate developing in increasingly catastrophic directions. Years of being slagged off has also hardened him. He no longer has any illusions that the rightwing media will ever tolerate him. He is often portrayed as alien – a “zealot” – to the supposedly sensible traditions of our politics. Despite the pro-Israel rhetoric now obligatory on the right, this othering still has a hint of the antisemitism that shadowed his leadership, with its endlessly reprinted photo of Labour’s first Jewish leader struggling with a bacon sandwich. Miliband is also an earnest north Londoner who believes in the state, defeated his more rightwing and media-favoured brother, David, in a leadership contest, and then lost what was widely seen as a winnable general election. Even if he was running a less contentious ministry, which may be his eventual fate, plenty of people would find reasons to dislike him. Although, strikingly, that dislike does not extend to the Labour membership. A recent survey for the website LabourList found that Miliband was their favourite minister, far ahead of rightwingers such as Wes Streeting and Rachel Reeves, and of Starmer himself. That popularity is probably one reason Miliband hasn’t been sacked. But it also generates tensions, reminding the Labour right that its party purge is not yet complete, and highlighting Starmer’s limited rapport with the members. Anti-Miliband feelings are also generated by his ability to work the Whitehall machine. For all the British right’s disdain for socialist dreamers, what it really dislikes is a lefty who get things done. Largely driven by Miliband, trying to maximise his impact while he can, Labour has ended the de facto ban on onshore wind turbines, announced a large expansion of solar power, begun legislating to create the state-owned clean power company GB Energy, and stopped granting exploration licences for new North Sea oil and gas fields. Meanwhile, some of his defeats on climate policy may be more apparent than real. The expansion of Heathrow, for example, will have to meet so many environmental conditions that many observers believe it will never happen. Miliband and Starmer remain quite close. As leader, Miliband cleared the way for him to become an MP. As a minister, Miliband helps him believe he is still leading a progressive government. But those who predict Miliband’s imminent demise point out Starmer’s ruthlessness towards close colleagues when he thinks they have become a problem. In 2021, he removed Miliband’s shadow ministerial responsibility for business. Then, as now, Miliband was winding up powerful people. Yet the world has changed since then. The climate crisis has worsened faster than expected. Labour has found being back in office harder than it anticipated. Along with Reform UK and the Lib Dems, the Greens are eroding its support. As the failure of his policies to stop the latter process shows, Miliband is hardly a perfect politician. But being angry or disappointed with him is really a displacement activity. It’s much easier to think about the end of Miliband than the end of the world.

2024-07-02T17:38:38Z,The Guardian view on Britain’s green future: where was the debate? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/02/the-guardian-view-on-britains-green-future-where-was-the-debate,"For all the many televised encounters between party leaders, one huge subject has largely flown under the radar during this underwhelming election campaign. In 2019, at a time when the Brexit crisis had overwhelmed national politics, Channel 4 nevertheless devoted an entire pre-election debate to the climate emergency. Boris Johnson didn’t turn up. But, sensing the mood of the times, as prime minister he was soon committing to a “green industrial revolution”. Climate action was high-profile and it mattered. Contrast that with last week’s final leaders’ debate between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer. None of the questions selected from the audience addressed the environment. Aside from one attempt by Mr Sunak to suggest that Labour’s green plans will lead to higher taxes – feeding into the Conservative party’s wider attack strategy – both leaders focused their energy and political capital elsewhere. It has been much the same throughout the campaign. Economists, industrial leaders and environmental campaigners are united in their desire for more proactive green government. But the politics has become difficult. Given that depressing backdrop, this newspaper’s interview with the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, Ed Miliband, is both timely and welcome. As Mr Miliband rightly points out, the next government will preside over the remainder of a make-or-break decade in relation to net zero. Crucial climate targets risk being badly missed without a step‑change in Westminster. Labour’s pledge to reverse the ban on onshore wind in its first days in office would send the right signal, as does Mr Miliband’s message that “Britain is off track and we intend to change that direction”. He is also right to say that if the country is to play a leading role internationally, the right example needs to be set at home. But after five years during which the green agenda has become a target for the radical right, and a short-term focus on reducing debt has stymied investment, vital arguments need to be restated and won if a course correction is truly to take place. As Mr Sunak has sought to wage culture wars over net zero, the green transition has been portrayed as an extraneous financial burden, and an unwanted imposition at a time of economic fragility. Yet in reality, as the former UK head of Siemens, Jürgen Maier, has emphasised, massive green investment is a prerequisite of future economic prosperity. As the global economy decarbonises, going green is the starting point of a desperately needed British growth strategy, not a discretionary add-on. Labour, should it fulfil expectations on Thursday and win the election, needs to rediscover this truth and be full-throated in expressing it. Its defensive response to Mr Sunak’s dividing-line strategy led it to abandon the totemic £28bn-a-year spending pledge. Since then, Sir Keir has mainly focused on other themes. But achieving the highest sustained growth in the G7, the boldest of Labour’s five “missions” for national renewal, will not be accomplished without gamechanging levels of green investment. Securing a fair transition, which delivers good new jobs and provides energy security and cheaper bills to less well-off households, will not be possible without a budget to match the size of the task. Such arguments have not received the airing they deserved, during a campaign that has neglected the major crisis facing the planet. From 5 July that needs to change. The biggest challenge of our age deserves much better than to be kicked into the long grass. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2025-01-29T11:51:30Z,Environmentalists urge Reeves to rethink plans for airports and roads ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/29/environmentalists-urge-reeves-to-rethink-plans-for-airports-and-roads,"Rachel Reeves has been accused by environmental experts of putting the climate at risk with high carbon projects including the expansion of Heathrow airport. The chancellor made airports the central focus of her plan for growth, despite having previously promised to be the first green chancellor and having extolled the benefits of green growth. Environmental leaders have asked her to recommit to green growth, such as the renewable economy and green public transport, rather than expanded aviation and new roads. Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity and a major donor to the Labour party, said: “New runways are a mistake; we don’t need them. This is the old economy, it grew 0.1% last year while the green one grew 9%. This is where the biggest opportunity for growth is, and it’s sustainable in all senses of the word. That’s the right kind of growth.” Reeves did commit to a rail project, promising to create what she described as “Europe’s Silicon Valley” between Oxford and Cambridge, and giving support for a railway between the two university cities. Shaun Spiers, executive director at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “The chancellor is right to focus on economic renewal, but we cannot have growth at any cost. The economic case for bigger airports and new roads is highly questionable, and it’s crystal clear that pushing ahead with these will fly in the face of the UK’s climate targets. Rachel Reeves recognises that the low carbon economy offers ‘the industrial opportunity of the 21st century’; we should grasp this rather than chasing high-carbon, high-risk projects.” Dr Doug Parr, head of policy at Greenpeace UK, suggested other growth-boosting measures the chancellor could adopt instead: “It’s not a ‘growth at all costs’ approach that will get us to a better economic future. Instead of picking up any old polluting project from the discard pile, the chancellor should focus on industries that can attract investment and bring wider economic and social benefits. “These include upgrading our power grid, railways and housing while growing the renewables revolution and spearheading innovation in green steel, electric vehicles and batteries.” Reeves did say the airport would not go ahead without meeting climate objectives: “We will then take forward a full assessment through the airport national policy statement. This will ensure that the project is value for money, and our clear expectation is that any associated surface transport costs will be financed through private funding, and it will ensure that a third runway is delivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate objectives.” However, the Climate Change Committee, the independent watchdog tasked with ensuring the UK meets its legally binding net zero target by 2050, said in its sixth carbon budget that there could be no new airport expansion unless there were significant reductions in carbon intensity in other areas of the economy such as road transport and agriculture. Otherwise, the emissions would overshoot what is required to keep the UK within its carbon targets. The seventh carbon budget will be published next month, and some have said decisions on airport expansion should have waited until it was released. On Tuesday in parliament, the Green MP Siân Berry asked the transport minister Mike Kane: “Can the minister explain why we are hearing trailed announcements of multiple airport expansions, in the month before new advice from the Climate Change Committee is delivered? The committee could not have been clearer in previous reports that without a framework to manage aviation demand, we should not expand airports.” Research from the New Economics Foundation suggests airport expansions would in effect cancel out the carbon savings of the government’s clean power plan, and backbench Labour MPs have complained that new runways will bring air and noise pollution to their constituents. Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at the climate charity Possible, said: “Clearing the way for new runways is economically illiterate and sets our climate on course for a crash landing. The chancellor wants to boost growth, but new runways won’t strengthen our economy. Bigger airports will only benefit a tiny group of frequent flyers, while worsening the UK’s massive tourism deficit. “There is no conflict between a safe climate and a strong economy. The chancellor should rethink these dangerous and self-defeating plans, and instead invest in the day-to-day connectivity provided by affordable, reliable, electrified buses and trains.” Other plans outlined by Reeves in her speech include the Environment Agency lifting objections to build 4,500 new homes as well as schools and leisure facilities around Cambridge, nine new reservoirs, including the new Fens reservoir serving Cambridge, and the Abingdon reservoir near Oxford, and improving the A428 to reduce journey times between Milton Keynes and Cambridge. She also vowed to reduce regulation in order to get infrastructure projects built, but experts have criticised this. James Alexander, the CEO of the non-profit UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, said: “Not all regulation is anti-growth. The UK stands to gain more from maintaining and furthering our leadership posture in sustainability, especially at a moment where other major economies risk alienating green investment by signalling regressions on climate ambitions.”",Airline emissions; Airline industry; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heathrow third runway; Heathrow airport; Rachel Reeves; Environment; Business; Economic growth (GDP); Rail transport; UK news,Environment
2024-11-12T18:26:47Z,The Guardian view on Cop29: 1.5C has been passed – so speed up the green transition | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-cop29-15c-has-been-passed-so-speed-up-the-green-transition,"Predictions that this will be the first calendar year in which the 1.5C warming limit enshrined in the Paris agreement is surpassed provide a stark backdrop to the UN’s 29th climate conference. This year – 2024 – has already seen the hottest-ever day and month, and is expected by experts to be the hottest year too. Addressing delegates on Tuesday, the UN chief, António Guterres, referred to a “masterclass in climate destruction”. The escalating pattern of destructive weather events, most recently in Valencia, is a warning of what lies ahead. When the 1.5C figure was included in the 2015 deal, it was known to be a stretch. The treaty says countries must hold the average temperature “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels” and aim for 1.5C. Busting this target in 2024 will not mean it has been definitively missed; the measurement of global temperatures relies on averages recorded over 20 or more years. But the crossing of this threshold is a menacing moment. Around the world, people as well as governments and climate specialists should take notice – and act. Whether temperature data will sharpen minds and negotiations in Azerbaijan remains to be seen. Cop29 got off to a rocky start with a row over carbon markets, which are used by rich countries and businesses to offset their emissions by paying for environmental protection elsewhere. New rules were pushed through despite objections regarding the sector’s history of fraud and false promises. Donald Trump’s victory last week points to renewed conflict regarding the role of the US, not only in relation to fossil fuel expansion, but also institutions such as the World Bank, which must lead on climate finance – and in which the US is the dominant stakeholder. The fallout from Mr Trump’s election and the political crisis in Germany mean that leaders of several of the world’s richest nations did not travel to Baku. But Sir Keir Starmer took the opportunity to announce an ambitious new climate goal for the UK. Several months ahead of the deadline for updated nationally determined contributions – as the carbon pledges made by governments are known – Sir Keir accepted the recommendations of the UK’s Climate Change Committee and committed to cut emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035. Especially given the poor record of the last prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on climate, this is a significant step from the UK and builds on recent announcements on green investment for which the climate secretary, Ed Miliband, deserves credit as well. There is no doubt that the threat to life from climate disruption is rising – and with it the threat of the political instability that is caused when lives and livelihoods are destroyed, as they have been in eastern Spain. The priority for this round of climate talks is the financing of the green transition, and the urgent necessity for rich countries to support poorer ones. New taxes on fossil fuel companies, which have vastly inflated their profits since the Ukraine war, are among measures being argued for, along with frequent-flyer levies and loan guarantees enabling poorer countries to borrow. Petrostates including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates should also become contributors. All of the above, and more, will be needed if the targets set in Paris are not to be pushed beyond the realms of possibility.

2023-06-09T16:55:54Z,Keir Starmer must learn to break a few eggs if he’s to achieve a green economy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/keir-starmer-must-learn-to-break-a-few-eggs-if-hes-to-achieve-a-green-economy,"A U-turn on the eve of a major policy announcement is not usually part of the plan for a government in waiting. Later this month the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will set out his pitch on energy, jobs and net zero, hoping to place a green economy at the centre of his vision for revitalising the UK. But with just weeks to go, his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, admitted on Friday that the key plank of that vision – the party’s much-heralded flagship commitment to spend £28bn a year on green investment – would be delayed. She blamed the economic mess being left by the Conservative party, and insisted the target would be met in the second half of a Labour parliament. Green investment will instead start at an unspecified level and “ramp up”. Aides said the move was not a U-turn, but an act of economic realism, given the need for fiscal stability after years of Tory chaos. Economists and green campaigners were far from convinced. Several Oxford economists questioned the move and suggested that Reeves and Starmer had misunderstood the economics of green investment. Prof Cameron Hepburn, director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said: “Fiscal prudence matters. Borrowing for a consumption binge is foolish, particularly in the current economic climate. But borrowing to invest in productive assets is a different matter, especially when those assets deliver cheaper energy and new jobs. The sooner we get on with decarbonising the economy, the better.” Prof Sam Fankhauser, also of the Smith School, added: “By delaying the investment, Labour will also delay the returns – economic, environmental and social.” Green campaigners were up in arms. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics for Greenpeace UK, said: “This prevarication risks throwing in the towel on the global race in green tech, with the US, China and the EU already far ahead. It would simply be bad economics to say that we can’t afford this now, when it would pay for itself. Green infrastructure investment is now one of the best economic growth generators, and with it the opportunity to lower bills and tackle the climate crisis. Labour mustn’t let this go.” The furore over the delay to the £28bn investment promise was the latest twist in a fortnight of turmoil for Labour over its green ambitions. When Starmer laid out the first tranche of his green plans – an end to new licences for oil and gas drilling in the North Sea – to world business leaders at Davos in January, it generated little interest. But when he reiterated his stance at the end of last month, the knives were sharpened and ready – and not only from the predictable quarters. Grant Shapps, the Tory energy secretary, took to social media to accuse Starmer of being in the pocket of the Just Stop Oil protesters, and the rightwing media duly took up the same cry. They sensed an opportunity to claim that halting new licences would raise energy bills, even though this was comprehensively debunked by the chair of the Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, who said that fuel from new fields would not flow for a decade or more, and that it would have no impact on UK prices as it would be sold to the highest bidder. Those inconvenient facts have not deterred Shapps. One Tory insider indicated the attack lines would continue, saying: “He doesn’t believe families should pay the price for making the country dependent on foreign fossil fuels from the likes of Putin, which is exactly what Labour’s Just Stop Oil-sponsored policy would do.” Attacks from political enemies could be shrugged off. Far harder to dismiss was the public outcry from unions. Two major unions – hefty donors to Labour historically – lambasted the plans. Sharon Graham of Unite called the pledge “reckless”, and Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said the move was “naive”. Union leaders fear losses among the 200,000-strong North Sea fossil fuel workforce, and called for a “coherent, fully funded plan for jobs” as part of any moves to question the UK’s energy future. The Labour leader stood firm on the North Sea, but a few days later offered an olive branch to unions in supporting nuclear power, a move that also conveniently distances him from his anti-nuclear predecessor Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer is also expected to woo the unions by making highly skilled green jobs a central plank of his pitch later this month, though that may be harder to do convincingly given the scaling back of the £28bn pledge. Opposition to green initiatives from within the ranks of Labour, and its usual allies, has deep roots, according to Newsom. “Parts of the Labour party don’t sufficiently grasp that green investment is as much of a vote winner as it actually is. Polling on Labour’s £28bn pledge shows it is popular across the population – people seem to understand that you need to borrow to invest on this issue,” she said. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the thinktank E3G and a veteran adviser to governments, said the Labour leader had not yet laid out a coherent green vision for his party, and the public, to rally around. “He’s trying to buy off these lobbies [such as the unions, and nuclear industry] but that just gets you back to where the Tories were. He needs his own clear political narrative,” Burke said. “Jobs is just one part. He needs to talk about incomes, raising incomes, how green policies can tackle the cost of living.” Senior Labour insiders say the North Sea pledge and the £28bn investment are just two parts of a much wider strategy, which will be laid out more compellingly when Starmer takes to the stage in Scotland later this month. They point to a series of measures already: a pledge to reach 100% clean power by 2030, and make the UK a green energy superpower; to establish Great British Energy, a homegrown publicly owned champion of green power generation; to set up a national wealth fund to create green industries; and to upgrade 19m homes through a warm homes plan for insulation and energy efficiency. What is missing from this list, green campaigners worry, is much commitment to the other side of green policy: the natural environment. Within the shadow cabinet, the focus on nature is the purview of Jim McMahon, the shadow minister for environment and rural affairs, who many feel has made little impact. Starmer recognises that the countryside must be a key part of his strategy. The limited appeal of his predecessor was mainly to young urban voters. But Labour’s thumping majorities in English cities – such as Corbyn’s own 64% vote share in Islington North – are wasted in the UK’s first-past-the-post system. With an overall vote share of 43.6% in 2019, the Conservatives were able to win an 80-seat majority partly through scores of rural and semi-rural constituencies with much smaller majorities. “The path to electoral victory runs through rural seats,” said one former shadow minister. Starmer’s advisers have long understood that he needs a message for the shires, and in 2021 and 2023 he headed for the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) conference to proclaim farming was “in my DNA”. He met a receptive audience, battered by Brexit, supermarkets and soaring input costs. Minette Batters, president of the NFU, said she was impressed. “We need to see clarity on Labour policy, but they’ve been very engaged,” she said. “Keir has visited my farm. They know, as do all parties, that the rural vote will matter at the next general election.” Yet farmers, rural linchpins though they appear, make up only a minority of voters in rural and semi-rural constituencies, and their needs are sometimes at odds with those of the rest of the public. Take sewage. The scandal, years in the making, of routine releases of raw sewage from the privatised water companies is likely to be a key flashpoint for voters, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats vying to come down hard on what is obviously a Tory weak spot. But while the misdeeds of water companies have rightly grabbed the headlines, the other major cause of pollution and ecological death for rivers and streams is runoff from agriculture. Farmers have gone largely unpunished by this government, which has shrunk the number of inspectors and created a virtual indemnity for farmers. Intensive farming is also behind the precipitous decline of wildlife, from farmland birds and small mammals to insects and plant species. Labour has vowed to reform the environmental land management system of payments for farmers. But unless there is more money for farmers to switch to less intensive, more ecologically sound practices, then there is little chance of stemming the nature losses, let alone hitting the target of preserving 30% of the UK’s biodiversity by 2030. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “[Starmer] can’t U-turn on nature because Labour has not yet constructed a strong, authentic narrative on nature to U-turn on. Why not? The pandemic showed the depth of people’s appreciation of the natural world, and that’s something to build on. Labour should be championing access to nature, which is good for health, and would reduce pressure on the NHS, including mental health services. But they’ve been curiously silent on nature.” When Starmer sets out his green vision this month, his low-carbon efforts will take centre stage, and anger over the delay to the £28bn investment may have died down. But if the Labour leader wants a genuine green strategy, to get the UK to net zero and protect and restore the natural environment, then the storms of the past fortnight will be just the beginning. Pursuing net zero and protecting nature involve taking on vast ranks of vested interests: farmers; the car lobby, who will label any attempt to tackle transport emissions as “a war on motorists”; while addressing aviation will threaten foreign holidays. Gas boilers will have to go, provoking resistance from boiler makers and tens of thousands of plumbers and heating installers, as well as housing developers and private landlords who have little enthusiasm for heat pumps or insulation. Even companies that loudly claim to be green need to be held to account. If Starmer is serious about leading Labour to a greener future, he will have to be prepared to make far more enemies.",Labour; Green economy; Green jobs; Climate crisis; Rachel Reeves; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2025-05-04T12:26:08Z,The English question now isn’t about Reform or party politics: it’s the rage that means we can’t talk to each other any more | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/04/english-reform-party-politics-local-elections,"It was unseasonably hot in Alford, Lincolnshire, and the early evening had brought a contented glow to the main street and residential avenues of this quiet market town. Colin Matthews, a genial former schoolteacher, was putting in another shift trying to convince people to give him another term as a local Conservative councillor and marvelling at the outbreaks of fury he was encountering. One man, he told me, had simply grabbed a bit of Tory campaign literature out of his letterbox and torn it into small pieces. A couple emerged from their house and got into a very large car. For some reason, they were both carrying huge slices of chocolate cake teetering on tiny white plates. What one of them told me was laced with disdain. “They don’t normally turn out giving us leaflets,” she said, pointing at Matthews. “They don’t normally give two shits.” Even here, it seemed, rude and angry were the things to be. Matthews and a few of his fellow Tories explained some of the reasons for local people’s fury: the government’s plans to put up lines of pylons in the fields next to the Lincolnshire coast, and the giving-over of increasing expanses of land to solar farms. Outside the town’s principal pub, a few people talked of immigrants in Skegness being housed while military veterans slept on the streets. It was an odd spectacle: flailing fury in an idyllic-looking environment, for reasons Matthews well understood. “This country’s buggered,” he said. It’s certainly not a country that is prepared to give his party much support. In Thursday’s council elections, Matthews was defeated by a Reform UK candidate who received nearly three times as much support. Lincolnshire’s first mayoral election, meanwhile, was won by Andrea Jenkyns, the former Conservative minister who has just joined Nigel Farage’s latest political vehicle. At 6.30 the next morning, I watched her give the most graceless, clunky acceptance speech I have ever seen, in which she said it was time for an end to “soft-touch Britain” – kindness, be gone! – and suggested that asylum seekers should be forced to live in tents. The biggest part of this story was about Tory defeat and collapse. But Reform got close to twice Labour’s vote in North East Lincolnshire, a local government area that includes Grimsby and Cleethorpes, a constituency with a Labour MP. Across the country, moreover, as the party took control of 10 councils and the Tories crashed, there was the same sense of a realignment of the right being part of something even bigger. A vocal chunk of Reform supporters – men in particular – is nothing if not familiar. They want “British shops”, zero immigration, the return of capital punishment and all the other things that usually make it on to the average hard-right shopping list. But in Lincolnshire I also spoke to newly converted Farage voters who spoke in much vaguer, tentative terms about how they simply craved change. What tied everybody together – along with plenty of abstainers – was the same bitterness and bad feeling I saw in Alford. Some 48 hours before polling day, Luke Tryl, the director of the More In Common thinktank, had reported back from his latest focus groups, which he said were brimming with a level of “anger, despondency or misery about the state of Britain that doesn’t feel sustainable”. That is completely right, and what has fundamentally caused that wave of negativity might be a lot simpler than some people would like to think. People’s food-shop costs, council tax bills and dealings with HMRC highlight the fact that they are paying much more for far less – surely the dictionary definition of infuriating. The winter fuel allowance cut, one of those rare political stories that just about everybody now mentions, has cast the government – probably for keeps – as mean bureaucrats set on tilting the scales even further away from basic fairness. And these distributional furies are the context for a lot of people’s complaints about immigration. There is also an overarching narrative about the last two decades. After the financial crash of 2007-8, the false dawn of Brexit, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the ongoing cost of living crisis, people have a sense of life amounting to one damn thing after another. In that context, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves following their election win with warnings that everything was about to get even worse was the most stupid thing they could have done. And here we are. Life continues to go round in circles, and with each grim rotation of the wheel, Farage and his friends get more and more popular. They do so despite the clear gap between the issues they habitually bang on about and what might actually improve millions of lives. Over the weekend, Reform leaders sounded off about teaching kids the wonders of the British empire, the evils of councils’ diversity policies and how they were going to fight green investment. In the places where they will now be in charge, meanwhile, the same stark problems fester on, even amid affluence: hollowed-out local services, terrible public transport, a chronic lack of social housing and a shortage of work more fulfilling than driving delivery vans or making up the parcels that are piled into them. To point that out is not to overlook the politics of culture and identity, but still: if mainstream politicians finally began to act on those issues, maybe they would begin to be less loathed and mistrusted. That, in crude terms, is a picture of how this moment could pass. But I also wonder whether England might have irrevocably changed in ways that none of us yet understand. When I hear people pay tribute to Farage as a “good lad” and see whole streets rush to take pictures of him on their phones, I rather wonder what has happened to our old bullshit detector. We are no longer the country of “mustn’t grumble” – quite the reverse, in fact. It often feels, moreover, as if the 21st-century combination of social media’s polarising effects and all those economic convulsions has left us with an intensified version of an old national problem: our inability to really speak to each other and collectively bargain for a better country. All of us, it sometimes seems, are suffering from the political equivalent of road rage, manifested in either futile shouting or tense silence. The day after my stop in Alford, I spent two days in Boston, the Fenland town that has long been a byword for immigration from eastern Europe and support for Farage. As usual, I stayed at the local Premier Inn, and dined in the adjoining pub and restaurant. Outside, everything was aligning for a victory based on anger and disaffection. Inside, despite the 30 or so people who were seeing out their evening, there was a deathly quiet, and a scene that vividly summed up where we have arrived: among the pints of Madri and faux-traditional grub, even the married couples hardly said a word to each other.

2025-03-25T08:00:05Z,"This government has one last chance to take a progressive path. Otherwise, we’re at the point of no return | John McDonnell",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/25/government-progressive-spring-statement-rachel-reeves-economic-stability,"If someone read out the following list of policies, which party would you think was in power? Depriving 2 million pensioners of the winter fuel allowance. Refusing to scrap the two-child benefit cap to lift nearly half a million children out of poverty. Raising tuition fees for students by more than the rate of inflation. Cutting overseas aid to the poorest people across the globe by half. Cutting £5bn from benefits for disabled people. Introducing a new round of cuts to government department spending and laying off 50,000 public sector workers. I very much doubt even 12 months ago you would have thought that this would be the Labour party in government. It is expected that in the spring statement, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will seek to justify this effective return to austerity by the necessity to maintain “iron” economic discipline through a rigid adherence to her fiscal rules. The chancellor’s argument will be that the world has changed, which is true, but this prompts the question: why, then, doesn’t the government’s strategy change to meet the situation it now finds itself in? Even Germany’s iron laws welded into its constitution are being adapted to the new economic realities. Media briefings suggest that in her spring statement speech on Wednesday Reeves wants to be upbeat about Labour’s achievements so far. She is likely to cite the welcome rise in the minimum wage, but may fail to acknowledge that even working full-time on the minimum wage means a person is nearly £10,000 below the annual income, after tax, calculated by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation as necessary to secure an acceptable standard of living. In recent interviews Reeves has already claimed this year’s above-inflation rise in wages as a government success, but has failed to mention that even with this long awaited rise, wages remain so low that 37% of people having to claim universal credit are actually in work. At least she will have some big numbers to cite on investment in the NHS and infrastructure. The problem is that much of the new NHS money could be drained away by the strains placed on it as disabled people find they are unable to cope without the support that has been taken away from them. This will include elderly people without adequate physical care and younger people without mental health support. The problem with the increase in infrastructure investment is also that the memory of the cut in Ed Miliband’s green investment budget lingers in the mind and, as Reeves has repeatedly been warned, infrastructure investment takes a long time to feed into growth on any scale in the economy, and any benefit is likely to land after the next election. The danger now is that the government’s standing could be irretrievably damaged as the Labour party is branded just another austerity party. This will provide the key that opens the door to the populist Reform UK. Nigel Farage’s party doesn’t need to present a rational, implementable alternative economic policy programme. It will simply go full Trump to distinguish itself from both Conservatives and Labour by portraying itself as anti-establishment, the defender and voice of the working class – while targeting immigrants, wokeism and even some corporations. The polls and council byelection results are showing that there is a crisis of confidence in the government, reflecting the reactions and worries about recent policies among our supporters and even party members. But it is not too late to turn things around. In the very short term, a relaxing of the fiscal rules would enable the chancellor to raise sufficient taxes from those with the broadest shoulders to prevent a return to ongoing austerity. It is not rocket science to implement a programme of marginal tax rises that would end cuts and fund the progressive policies any Labour government would aim to pursue. The list is obvious: equalising capital gains tax with income tax rates; a realistic rise in corporation tax; a financial transaction tax; the introduction of a small wealth tax on multimillionaires, called for by the Patriotic Millionaires group. There are also many non tax measures to help people who are still struggling with the cost of living, such as fair rent controls, service charge caps, stricter controls on energy and water price rises, and reviews of food price rises to prevent price gouging. However, the spring statement and the subsequent public spending review in June should define what the long-term strategy of the government is rather than responding to the short-term political and economic mess it has created for itself. For this I urge the chancellor to look beyond just stabilising our economy and managing the existing system slightly more efficiently than the Conservative chancellors before her. People want long-term change that provides everyone with a decent quality of life and addresses the grotesque levels of inequality in our society and the environmental crisis. Over the past 25 years, I have followed the work of Richard Wilkinson and subsequently his colleague Kate Pickett at the Equality Trust. Their detailed research has forensically revealed the impact of inequality on our society and economy. To quote the trust’s report timed to coincide with the election of the new government last year: “Biased public policies and flawed economic systems are serving a few wealthy people at the expense of the wellbeing of people and planet.” The report went on to outline how the duty that was enacted in the Equality Act 2010 to reduce inequalities resulting from socioeconomic disadvantage could be implemented by redistribution power and wealth in our society. This includes new policy-making mechanisms that empower communities to identify and design the services to address their needs, wealth taxes to fund these, universal social security programmes and community wealth-building. I thought and hoped, maybe naively, that this was the sort of programme that the incoming Labour government would implement. The track record of the government so far is, sadly, remarkably distant from this progressive approach. The spring statement could be the opportunity to change that narrative, not just by bridging the short funding gap with redistribution but more importantly to narrate and launch the longer term progressive path we need to achieve true Labour goals. My remaining hope is that the chancellor will seize that opportunity, for I fear that if she doesn’t it will be impossible to recover the ground we have lost.

2025-04-23T05:00:09Z,Nigel Farage thinks net zero is the new Brexit. Starmer can prove him wrong | Rafael Behr,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/23/nigel-farage-net-zero-new-brexit-starmer-labour-reform,"Which former British prime minister described the climate emergency as “a clock ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines … quilting the Earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2”? The florid style gives it away. You’d guess Boris Johnson even if you’d forgotten that the master of Brexit bombast also had a sideline in net zero evangelism. It wasn’t the most memorable part of his repertoire and it didn’t catch on as a Conservative catechism. Subsequent Tory leaders abandoned Johnson’s rhetorical urgency over carbon emissions and repudiated Theresa May’s targets for cutting them. Kemi Badenoch acknowledges that the science of global heating is real but only as an afterthought, once she has finished complaining about the costs of a green transition and the improbable timetable set to achieve it. As in most matters, the Tories are flattering Nigel Farage with pale policy imitation. The Reform UK leader calls net zero “lunacy” that destroys jobs and drives up household bills. Reform’s policy is to scrap carbon targets entirely and tax renewables. Farage needs a vehicle for economic and cultural grievance to replace his old anti-European bandwagon. It served him so well but was immobilised in multiple collisions with reality. He wants climate-scepticism to be his second crusade, rallying demoralised, alienated voters against arrogant metropolitan elites. “This could be the next Brexit, where parliament is so hopelessly out of touch with the country,” the Reform leader said over the weekend. (He seems to have dropped an earlier demand for a referendum on net zero.) The Tories are too beaten, too drained of intellectual autonomy, to do anything but tag along behind Reform. Labour is not immune to the same paralysing anxiety – the fear that Farage, despite his public school pedigree and City trader swagger, has an uncanny way with working-class voters. It doesn’t help that the rightwing press amplify Reform’s campaigns and caricature Ed Miliband, energy secretary, as a zealous crank. In the ever-seething stew of Labour factionalism it isn’t hard to find MPs who use Miliband’s name as a byword for electoral liability. That resentment bubbles to the surface as media speculation that he might be removed at the next cabinet reshuffle, or that he should be. That isn’t the signal coming out of Downing Street. No one actually involved in writing or presenting government climate policy is preparing a U-turn in flight from Faragism. On the contrary, later this week, Keir Starmer will reaffirm his commitment to the renewable energy transition in a speech at an international summit in London, co-chaired by Miliband. It won’t be a green rhapsody in the key of Johnson. That isn’t the current prime minister’s style. Starmer’s case will be grounded in economic pragmatism and the national interest – investment in high-skilled, high-wage industries; ending the vulnerability of supply that pegs household bills to the coercive whim of Vladimir Putin; safe British jobs in secure British energy. If delivered well, it is a message with enough potential public resonance to box Reform on to the side of economic decline and dependence on dictators. The evidence from opinion polls (supported by accounts from focus groups that test these issues) suggests that climate scepticism is not the Brexit sequel craved by Farage. Opposition to the government’s net zero target is a minority position across every segment of the electorate. Even Reform and Conservative voters are more likely to say that green investment will have a positive impact – growing the economy and reducing the cost of living – than the opposite. Anxiety about climate change is not confined to places that voted to remain in the EU. In one survey by research organisation More in Common, 68% of Farage’s constituents in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, declared themselves “somewhat” or “very” worried about the issue. There are places where net zero is universally despised, but they are online. In those radical rightwing digital arenas, climate consciousness is the stuff of woke activism, a badge of culture-war villainy worn alongside gender-neutral pronouns. Those digital silos, skewed by their fanatical American conservative audience (and, in the case of Elon Musk’s X, a maniacal American proprietor) seethe with conspiracy theories and denial of climate science. Party leaders and prominent commentators of the British right who play to that crowd are pulling away from the mainstream position in their domestic political market. There are still plenty of hazards for the government navigating a complex energy transition. There is a way to sell the long-term goal as a happy alignment of future prosperity and cleaner living, but there are still upfront costs and tricky trade-offs. One cautionary tale is a notoriously botched German scheme to phase out gas boilers. Households were spooked by the cost of heat pumps and, despite promised subsidies, the backlash helped bring down Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition. The main beneficiary was the far-right Alternative für Deutschland. Another instructive episode is the July 2023 Uxbridge byelection, which the Tories won in defiance of national polling trends. The result was credited to a Conservative campaign targeting London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to extend congestion charging to the capital’s outer suburbs. But two years on, the lessons from that tale are not so clear-cut. Rishi Sunak thought he had found a template for attacking Labour as a party of anti-motorist ecowarriors. But when he tried to scale the message up into a new policy direction he was pilloried for reneging on Britain’s international climate commitments. Uxbridge was over-interpreted in Westminster, held up as a distorting lens that continues to warp conversations about environmental regulation. The seat flipped to Labour in the general election a year later. That is worth remembering if, as seems likely, Reform does well in council elections and the Runcorn byelection next month. Farage will want the results to prove that his fossil-fuelled bandwagon is on the roll. Tory climate-sceptics will eagerly jump aboard even if the true motivations of voters are messy and hard to untangle. They usually are. There will be calls for Starmer to fend off the radical right with concessions to Reform’s agenda. Yielding to that temptation is a mistake. The tributes go unappreciated by their target audience. They land instead like a slap in the faces of long-suffering Labour supporters who had hoped the era of coddling Farage would end once the Tories were evicted from power. It doesn’t take too many demoralised liberal-left voters in marginal seats switching to the Liberal Democrats, Greens or Scottish National party to put new obstacles on the road to a second Starmer term. Allegiances that have been frayed by cuts to benefits, overseas aid and other sundry disappointments would be irretrievably severed in a retreat from climate commitments. Leaning into the green transition slows that decay in morale. It draws a clarifying line between the Starmer project and an axis of Tory-Reform climate defeatism. Deftly argued, it is a way to position the prime minister on the side of optimism, mainstream British opinion, resilience in an uncertain world and clean air. His opponents can have Putin, Donald Trump and pollution on their team. It is the smart move in terms of electoral strategy. It happens also to be the right thing to do.

2025-05-18T11:00:32Z,A Labour lost in the weeds can’t rebuild this country. Starmer must regain his nerve | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/18/labour-keir-starmer,"Just under a week on from Keir Starmer’s latest pronouncements about immigration, plenty of people on his own side are still gripped by a queasy sense of fury and disappointment, and it shows no signs of fading away. His aides and allies will now try to gladden left-liberal hearts by emphasising gains from Monday’s UK-EU summit, and the prime minister’s remodelling of Brexit. But the acrid cloud hanging over Starmer will surely remain, and with good reason. Whatever the surrounding context – and whether or not he was consciously echoing Enoch Powell – his suggestion that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers” still sounded like a horribly calculated provocation. The insistence that the government was set on closing “a squalid chapter for our politics, our economy, and our country” was even more brazen. So was the suggestion after years of “a one-nation experiment in open borders… the damage this has done to our country is incalculable”. That last claim, in fact, might have been the worst of the lot: a shameful example of a prime minister reducing a story replete with complexity and nuance – and raw humanity – to cheap and nasty hyperbole. Starmer is obviously set on trying to avenge the impression that he is a rather hesitant, dweeb-ish politician by playing the hardman, an act he has brought to his posts on social media: “I’ve already returned over 24,000 people with no right to be here. And I won’t stop there.” And as the resulting anger simmers on, a lot of it is mixed up with a familiar dismay about where the government has ended up. Its planned cuts to disability benefits will soon face a Commons vote, and there is speculation that a huge Labour rebellion could lead to a government defeat. Continued angst about the cut to the winter fuel allowance may yet spark at least a partial U-turn. Many Labour MPs scrabble around for positives, and can find things – school breakfast clubs, VAT on private schools, a rise in the minimum wage – that might get them through the odd interview, but do not neutralise a biting disquiet. Hanging over everything is a question that has nagged at Starmer and his colleagues since they arrived in office: what is this government here for? Imagine if his talk about incalculable damage and squalid failure were concentrated on the issues that any self-respecting progressive government ought to be focused on: poverty, industrial decline, the UK’s awful class divisions. The idea that we are on the way to becoming an “island of strangers” would work better as a sharp critique of the same inequalities. But Starmer rarely talks about that stuff. Away from big diplomatic occasions, an administration elected less than a year ago is behaving as if its time is nearly up, and strategy and policy substance must be sacrificed on the altar of desperate electioneering. Starmer seems to hover over his own government, deferring and delegating while setting no coherent agenda. Rachel Reeves, meanwhile, remains in thrall to Treasury orthodoxy: the origin of no after no, in a country that has not heard a significant “yes” in far too long. To say that millions of people – and places – have yet to see any improvements to their lives might sound impatient; the more relevant point is that they see no sign of any change coming. Stagnation and decline, moreover, are the root of the angry, fearful mood that now eats away at mainstream politics. All those grievances about migrants are not wholly reducible to economic factors – some people, it has to be said, simply have pretty questionable views about human difference – but if the country were in a more prosperous condition, the complaints would surely not be nearly as loud. Faragism is what you get when the established political class seems so bereft of answers that a shameless opportunist is able to swagger into the resulting void, offering his own prejudices as the answer. But as unlikely as it may sound, it is just about possible to imagine things being at least slightly better. The government has four years of its full term to run. The optimism it catalysed back in July last year may have been very brief, but it was real. In the not-so-distant past, moreover, there were signs that the Labour leadership had plans for something much better than the mixture of half-measures and cuts that has since materialised. On that score, I think back to the early autumn of 2022, when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had tanked the economy, and Starmer was offering a creditably bold alternative. It was all about government leading an economic transformation, and something close to a Green New Deal. At Labour’s conference in Liverpool, he talked about a “modern industrial strategy” built on “a true partnership between government, business and trade unions”. The modern state, he said, could “support businesses to innovate and grow” and “bring in the creative genius of our scientists and universities”. At that point, Labour was still committed to the £28bn green investment pledge that was killed by Reeves before the election. There was a passage in the leader’s keynote speech that sketched out its vision: “Let’s get clean hydrogen energy in South Yorkshire, in the east of England … Offshore wind in Scotland, Teesside, East and North Yorkshire. Solar power growing rural communities,” Starmer enthused. He promised not just a million new jobs, but training for plumbers, electricians, engineers and builders. Here, it seemed, were the beginnings of answer to the longstanding predicament of at least some of those places in the “red wall”. “And it will all start ,” he said, “within the first 100 days of a new Labour government.” Some of those ideas live on in the scaled-down policies still being pursued by Ed Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. But they are neither properly funded, nor put at the heart of the government’s messaging, which squashes the idea that a green industrial policy is a matter of improving people’s lives. A fortnight ago, Richard Tice, Reform UK’s deputy leader, responded to his party’s victories in Lincolnshire by announcing its quest to tear down industries that contribute about £980m to that county’s economy and account for more than 12,000 jobs: “We will attack, we will hinder, we will delay, we will obstruct, we will put every hurdle in your way,” he said. In the House of Commons, Starmer recently attacked Reform and the Tories on exactly this basis. So why not boost the policy, and do that all the time? The way to beat these people is not to thieve their lines about migration: it lies in pointing out that a party of nostalgists and chancers has nothing to say about any realistic version of our future. Since the forced departure of Louise Haigh, the government’s first transport secretary, policy on buses and trains has gone eerily quiet. Even more importantly, the government should go back to its past talk about making social housing the second-most common kind of tenure besides private ownership, and make it real, as a matter of urgency. These moves ought to be bundled up with meaningful devolution, including the fiscal powers that Reeves and the Treasury still refuse to hand down. Then, perhaps, Labour might have a story about the modern UK characterised by something we seem to have mislaid: a vision that is the opposite of all the rage and complaint that now runs riot across the political right. That same mood seems to have infected a government increasingly defined by its nervousness and lack of imagination. The result is the strange spectacle of a newly elected administration with the most pessimistic understanding of its own prospects – the kind of mindset that, at this rate, will lead not just to defeat for the Labour party, but nightmarish national harm: incalculable damage, some people would call it.

2025-01-28T00:00:40Z,Rachel Reeves tells MPs of plans to go ‘further and faster’ in pursuit of growth,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/27/rachel-reeves-tells-mps-of-plans-to-go-further-and-faster-in-pursuit-of-growth,"Rachel Reeves has told MPs the government needs to go “further and faster” to increase economic growth, as Downing Street sought to reassure people concerned about the environment that net zero and increasing output go “hand in hand”. The chancellor has unnerved some Labour MPs and green campaigners with her increasingly punchy rhetoric about growth being a priority over preventing climate change, as she strives to improve the UK’s anaemic forecasts and drive up living standards. In a speech on Wednesday, she is expected to outline her plans to radically alter planning rules and accelerate building and infrastructure projects, as well as backing airport expansion, despite fears it may put the UK in breach of its legally binding carbon budget. At a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday, Reeves made a direct pitch to MPs, telling them there would be “no easy routes out” to growing the economy, and the government must “start saying yes” to changes that could create wealth across the country. “Have we done enough? No. We must go further and faster because the cost of living pressures are still very real for working people across Britain, and the only way we can turn this around is through economic growth,” she told them. “Will that growth come easy? No. There are no easy routes out. There are always reasons for government to say no. Over the past six months as chancellor, my experience is that government has become used to saying no. That must change. We must start saying yes. “Now is the chance for us to shout about that potential and the brighter future ahead. Because no one else is going to do it.” No 10 sought to reassure those who may be concerned about the environmental implications of the relentless drive for growth, insisting it went “hand in hand” with the net zero agenda and the green investment behind it. “We’ve talked previously about the jobs that green industries of the future will bring, the fact that, by backing Great British Energy and the National Wealth Fund, we’ll be crowding in billions of pounds of private sector investment. These agendas absolutely go hand in hand,” Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said. Backbench Labour MPs have criticised the emphasis Reeves has placed on the economy, potentially at the expense of the environment. Barry Gardiner, the shadow climate secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, told the BBC: “Rachel is wrong to pit decarbonising the economy against economic growth. Decarbonisation is the growth of the future. The world is transitioning to net zero and I want our businesses to be leading the way.” At Monday night’s PLP meeting, Ruth Cadbury, the MP for Brentford and Isleworth, questioned the case for a third runway at Heathrow. “Our policy is that aviation growth has to be done in the context of our four tests for growth across the UK, our carbon climate commitments, local noise and local air pollution,” she said. “As chair of the transport committee, I want to have a chance to see it in the context of an aviation strategy, something we’ve been asking for a long time. In the context of a growth strategy, it’s all going in the right direction, but this doesn’t fit. The case for UK-wide growth from Heathrow isn’t there. We’re massively constrained in west London.” Another backbench MP raised concerns that the apparent support for the airport expansion had come out of nowhere, and that MPs had not been consulted on the issue, even if it remained speculation. The chancellor’s spokesperson said there was overwhelming support for her infrastructure plans and the government’s agenda to reform the planning system. Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, who ruled out resigning over the decision to back a third runway at Heathrow last week, had told peers that the government saw “no contradiction” between net zero and growth. “We believe they go absolutely hand in hand, because net zero is a major contributor to growth, can be, and the climate crisis is the biggest long-term economic threat our country faces,” he said. Questioned by the environmental audit committee on Monday, he refused to be drawn into speculation about Heathrow, but said: “I just want to provide this element of reassurance to you, which is, 100% any aviation expansion must be justified within carbon budgets, and if it can’t be justified, it won’t go ahead.” In a further effort to improve growth, Reeves said she would allow businesses to access surplus funds in occupational final salary pension schemes for investment. About 75% of the funds, also known as defined benefit schemes, are in surplus, worth £160bn, but restrictions have meant businesses have struggled to invest them, she said. She outlined proposals for pension megafunds to be created from individual defined contribution schemes and a merger of local authority pension schemes in her Mansion House speech. Many pension fund trustees are known to be concerned that allowing company boardrooms access to surplus funds could leave their schemes vulnerable after a panic in financial markets. Without strong safeguards, giving businesses access to surplus pension funds could also make them more attractive targets for foreign takeovers. It is understood the new regime would allow trustees to block moves to access surplus funds if they believed it undermined the safety of the fund. Many pension schemes can already hand over surplus funds, while others cannot until legislation is passed, Treasury officials conceded.",Economic growth (GDP); Business; Economics; Rachel Reeves; Labour; Keir Starmer; Climate crisis; Environment; Politics; UK news,Business
2025-03-01T19:50:06Z,UK gives royal welcome to Zelenskyy after White House meltdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/uk-gives-royal-welcome-to-zelenskyy-after-white-house-meltdown,"King Charles will hold an official audience at Sandringham with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday as the UK and EU demonstrate their “unwavering” support after his humiliation at the hands of Donald Trump and JD Vance in the White House. Keir Starmer will also host European heads of government and the leaders of Canada and Turkey at a special defence summit aimed at presenting a united front on the Ukraine crisis. On arrival in Downing Street for a meeting with Starmer on Saturday night, just 24 hours after Trump and his vice-president Vance subjected him to a 10-minute tirade in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy said he was “very happy” that the king had agreed to the meeting. The offer of a royal audience was seen at Westminster as a deliberate move to give the Ukrainian president equal treatment to Trump, who was presented during his meeting at the White House on Wednesday by Starmer with an invitation to a second state visit to the UK, including a meeting with King Charles. Last night there were reports that the UK would show further solidarity by unlocking billions of pounds of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. The Sunday Times claimed Rachel Reeves would divert money earmarked for green investment in the UK to the defence industry. It would be the first time that money from frozen Russian assets would contribute towards military spending. The irate exchanges between Trump and Vance, on the US side, and Zelenskyy, which led to the Ukrainian president being told to leave the White House before any formal talks took place, led to fears among European and other world leaders of irreparable damage to the western alliance, and to the hopes of peace in Ukraine’s war with Russia. At today’s defence summit, which demonstrates the increasingly central role being played by the UK in Europe’s defence and security, Starmer will be clear that Europe must stand united against President Putin. Starmer said last night: “Three years on from Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we are at a turning point. Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security and secure our collective future.” Yesterday, as Zelenskyy touched down in the UK on his way back from the US, he appeared intent on trying to repair the damage caused by the diplomatic showdown in the Oval Office. He posted on social media that he was “thankful to President Trump, Congress for their bipartisan support, and the American people”, adding that Trump’s support was “crucial”. On Friday evening, Trump and Vance had accused him of not being grateful to the US for the huge sums they had spent on helping Ukraine to defend itself following the Russian invasion in 2022. In stark contrast to the White House meeting, Zelenskyy arrived at Downing Street to be met with cheers from crowds standing on Whitehall. And in a clear sign that Starmer wanted to demonstrate his sympathy for Zelenskyy, the prime minister took the unusual step of walking along the pavement to greet him. The two men then embraced before the prime minister gestured towards the crowds. Inside No 10, Starmer told his guest that the cheering outside was “the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you, how much they support Ukraine”. Starmer said he had “absolute determination … to achieve what we both want to achieve, which is a lasting peace – a lasting peace for Ukraine based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine, so important for Ukraine, so important for Europe and so important for the United Kingdom”. Zelenskyy replied: “We count on your support, and we’re really happy that we have such partners and such friends.” Among the key issues to be discussed at today’s defence summit will be the extent to which Europe can beef up its military support for Ukraine, and maintain the strength of Nato if the US is seen to be reducing its involvement in European defence. The leaders will also discuss how to increase economic pressure on Russia in order to hit Putin’s military machine. Many western experts say that the weakness of the Russian economy means that it has, at most, a year of being able to sustain its operations on the borders of Ukraine. King Charles met Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s surprise visit to the UK in February 2023, when the king told him: “We’ve all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long.” Zelenskyy also used his address to parliament during that visit to thank the UK for its steadfast support, finishing by saying: “God bless Great Britain and long live the king.” On Friday, in their curtailed meeting, Trump had claimed Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” as he became increasingly angry with what he thought was Zelenskyy’s resistance to his plans for peace with Russia. The meeting ended with a proposed deal on exchanging Ukrainian mineral rights for American arms being put on ice. After Starmer’s meeting with Zelenskyy, which lasted an hour, the prime minister escorted the Ukrainian president to the motorcade outside No 10 and waited to wave him off – in contrast to his lonely departure from the White House 24 hours earlier. With European leaders believing the rift with the US over issues from security to trade could present an existential threat to the bloc, they will meet on Thursday, aiming to reinsert themselves into the US-led peace efforts on Ukraine. But they will insist that Ukraine be at the heart of any talks, something that the Trump administration has remained equivocal about. “There can be no negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine,” states the draft summit text seen by the Observer. “There can be no negotiations that affect European security without Europe’s involvement. Ukraine and Europe’s security are united.” Summing up the sense of crisis, one EU diplomat said: “If this is not a wake-up call, then I don’t know what is. It is extremely important that the EU now moves from talking the talk, to also walking the walk in a much more focused and diligent way.”",Ukraine; Keir Starmer; Russia; Volodymyr Zelenskyy; King Charles III; Donald Trump; Vladimir Putin; Politics; UK news,World news
2025-03-12T14:37:19Z,"The government's climate plans are still ambitious and on-track, so why is Labour making so much anti-green noise? | Richard Power Sayeed",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/12/labour-climate-plans-anti-green-noise,"There’s no getting away from it: in the last few months we’ve seen leaders and corporations do very real damage to the energy transition. Donald Trump has paused future spending on clean energy infrastructure and he’s cancelled decarbonisation targets. And the new European Commission has loudly promised to cut environmental “red tape”. If you only read the headlines, you might think we’re facing the same issue here in the UK. But overall, Labour has remained committed to its long-term climate goals. Someone close to No 10 has said the prime minister wants to allow a massive new North Sea fossil fuel development (but they know this would still need to pass a climate assessment). The government has invited Heathrow to apply to expand (knowing it will need to fulfil a myriad of conditions). There are reports that Labour could move funds away from carbon capture and storage (but that’s always been a speculative technology). And there were reports that GB Energy’s funding might be cut (but that might be nonsense, or it might just mean spending being moved around government). More concretely, it is moving fast towards supporting a second runway at Gatwick (knowing that planning conditions, and then long political and legal battles, could scupper the scheme). It appears that some in Labour are using good old gesture politics to roll the pitch for what they hope will be a genuine slowdown of the energy transition. But Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves themselves appear to have a more prosaic – and reasonable – motivation: they’re waiting for their broader domestic growth strategy to bear fruit. In the meantime, these rather thin pro-fossil fuel policies give them a chance to say “look at how focused we are on increasing GDP” in front of the rightwing press and less strategically minded members of the parliamentary party. So Reeves very conspicuously slashed the £28bn annual green investment budget of the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, while in opposition. But at the autumn budget, rather less conspicuously, she increased his capital budget more than any other cabinet member’s. Even in the US, where things are undeniably bad, the picture is still complex. The US needs domestic energy production from any source available, and Joe Biden designed the Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates investment to clean energy security and climate change initiatives, so that Republican members of Congress would have an interest in protecting some, though by no means all, of it. So there’s a lot of noise; but here’s the signal: last year, the world invested almost twice as much in clean energy as it did in fossil fuels. Downing Street has a long list of reasons not to buck that positive trend. First, it has seen the numbers. Labour knows that anti-net zero feeling hasn’t contributed to its fall in the polls; but disappointment about unambitious environmental policies has. More importantly for Labour’s long-term strategy, turning away from net zero would hurt its drive for growth. Last month, Confederation of British Industry research, commissioned by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told us that the net zero sector grew three times faster than the overall UK economy in 2024. In the same week, the Climate Change Committee dramatically revised its estimate for how much investment is necessary for the transition, cutting it by nearly half thanks to its projection of cheaper electric vehicles and more widespread electrification in heating, transport and industry. In terms of climate strategy, this is crucial: we need it to be profitable to turn fossil fuels into stranded assets (investments that lose value before their expected end of life). And it works politically: it’s an unambiguous good news story for Reeves. She’s not going to sabotage it. Neither does the government want to turn its back on policies that are helping to shore up Labour’s union support. One well-placed union official is moderately upbeat: “Lots of the right levers have already been put in place,” they say, but more government investment will be needed, and government support must be tied to recipient businesses being better employers. And what the government really doesn’t want to do is cancel policies that will protect consumers. We’ve spent £140bn on wholesale gas in the past four years, a period that saw Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That’s far more than the net cost to the UK of decarbonising over the much longer period of the next 25 years. As Ellie Mae O’Hagan of the climate change thinktank E3G put it to me: “The energy transition is unstoppable. The anti-net zero political pantomime we’re seeing right now doesn’t change the fundamental economics.” Of course, no one thinks the transition is yet going fast enough to prevent catastrophe. And it’s not happening equitably enough to prevent global disorder. So whether or not the surface-level gestures continue, we need Labour to pull together and cooperate on energy policy. It has done it before. In 2008, New Labour’s climate reforms succeeded because (almost) the whole of the left was on board. It was the innovative campaigning by progressives at Friends of the Earth – plus increasing economic nationalism in the global energy sector – that helped push opposition leader David Cameron into supporting the idea of a climate change bill in 2006. It was someone from Labour’s centrist flank – one David Miliband, then the environment secretary – who at a cabinet meeting demanded his party match the Tories’ policy and, indeed, go further than them. And two years later, it was his leftwing brother Ed Miliband who, as energy secretary, pushed through reforms that were hailed – and attacked – as reversing Nigel Lawson’s laissez-faire restructuring of the sector in the 1980s. In December last year, the same energy secretary’s clean electricity plans were hailed – and attacked – as the most interventionist shift in energy policy in a generation. So there is every reason to believe Miliband is a politician who can get this done. But in 2025, as in 2008, geopolitics make his reforms an easier sell. And now, as then, he relies on his party’s support. Only this time, it is also doing it under cover of an anti-green pantomime. Richard Power Sayeed is a historian of modern Britain.

2024-09-26T17:06:47Z,Rachel Reeves’ mission must be to invest in a sustainable future | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/26/rachel-reeves-mission-must-be-to-invest-in-a-sustainable-future,"Your leading article was right to highlight the challenge that the chancellor faces in demonstrating fiscal responsibility while reviving the economy (23 September). As it pointed out, the London School of Economics published a report in January – of which I was a co-author – that made a compelling case for an increase in annual public investment of about £26bn per year, equivalent to 1% of GDP, to jolt UK productivity and economic growth out of its rut. This would pull the UK out of bottom place in the G7 league table for public investment, and would promote confidence in private investors that having skin in the game would mean the government would provide supportive policies to ensure healthy long-term returns. Our report made a further case that the strongest returns would be secured from green investment that accelerates the transition to a sustainable, inclusive and resilient economy by tackling even more effectively damage from climate change, biodiversity loss and other environmental degradation, including air and water pollution. Borrowing long-term at low cost for highly productive investment is fiscally responsible, building the skills, markets and technologies that will strengthen UK competitiveness. A failure to invest would be not only fiscally irresponsible, but would miss opportunities to boost growth, productivity and the environment. There is no other credible path to sustainable growth, and the chancellor should not allow an arbitrary public debt rule invented by past administrations to derail the government’s central economic mission. Bob Ward Grantham Research Institute, LSE • I think Polly Toynbee needs to listen a little harder to what Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are actually saying and where they say it (Labour has been overdoing the doom and gloom – but now Reeves has given us a glimpse of sunshine, 24 September). Reeves talked a lot in her conference speech about trust, about the £22bn black hole and about how there would be no return to austerity. Crucially, though, she didn’t define what she meant by “austerity”. The impact of a de facto cut through not increasing public spending will be felt just as much as a deliberate reduction. In her February business conference speech, she said Labour “sees profit not as something to be disdained but as a mark of business succeeding”. All well and good, but profit isn’t generated simply by “business” but by the surplus labour of those who work for it, and nowhere does Reeves talk about how such profits might be more fairly distributed for the benefit of working people and public sector growth. Meanwhile, with the threat of a crackdown on “benefit fraud”, it seems things really will get worse for the poorest. In July, Polly told us she would “eat my hat … if Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves don’t soon find the money to bury the pernicious two-child benefit cap”. Now she can only “urge” Reeves to do so.

2024-10-04T14:40:31Z,Starmer pledges to avoid rerun of 1980s deindustrialisation with clean energy plans,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/04/keir-starmer-clean-energy-plans-new-technologies,"Keir Starmer has signalled his government will drastically increase its green investment plans in an attempt to avoid a rerun of 1980s-style industrial decline by safeguarding jobs in heartland manufacturing communities. On a visit to a Merseyside glass factory on Friday to unveil billions of pounds in funding for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, the prime minister suggested there would be more public money made available for new technologies. “It’s just the start,” he told workers at the Encirc plant on the banks of the Mersey, between Chester and Runcorn. “I’ve always believed clean energy is a golden opportunity for our country: a chance to bring security and hope for working people, to relight the fires of hope in those areas that were hit so hard by deindustrialisation.” At the end of a week when the last coal-fired power station in Britain closed, and virgin steelmaking ended in south Wales, Starmer said Labour would prioritise investment to kickstart a moment of “industrial renewal”. It is understood a string of funding pledges involving public and private sector capital will be announced over the coming days, for projects across the country, before the government hosts a global investment summit on 14 October. Rachel Reeves, who was in Merseyside with Starmer and Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is also expected to pave the way for an increase in public investment at her budget on 30 October, involving changes to the Treasury’s self-imposed fiscal rules to help lay the foundations for economic growth. Starmer said: “Investment is how we will change the country. We have to start. We have to be pragmatic. We have to invest only where we have clear and undeniable potential, to make sure like today there’s a place for long-term growth.” The government on Friday said it would commit almost £22bn over 25 years to two CCS projects: one on Merseyside, and another on Teesside. The technology, which involves trapping emissions and burying them under the seabed, is controversial because it has never been used at commercial scale in the UK before. Climate scientists say big energy firms could use it to extend the life of their fossil fuel assets. Private sector firms, including the energy giants BP and Norwegian energy company Equinor, are expected to spend £8bn alongside the government funding. Successive governments have pledged to fund carbon capture projects in recent decades, only to pull back at a later stage. While Rishi Sunak’s government promised £20bn of investment in 2023, Labour says the Tories never budgeted for it and no contracts with industry were signed. Starmer sought to draw a link between investing in clean technologies and preventing a rerun of the 1980s when whole communities were cut economically adrift by Margaret Thatcher’s government amid rapid deindustrialisation. “If you take that away from people without a plan to replace it, it’s like losing a part of yourself: a limb, an open wound, the heart ripped out of the nation,” he said. The prime minister said CCS was vital for maintaining jobs in industries where some form of carbon involvement would be required long into the future, including glass and cement manufacturing. Speaking on the Encirc factory floor, where up to 30,000 bottles are made an hour, he said: “You can’t bury your head and hide from the future, that’s how you go backwards. But what you can do is use the power of government, the strength and skills of the nation, to shape that future in your interest. That’s what we do today in CCS. That is the country’s heritage.”",Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Energy industry; Business; Keir Starmer; Labour; Politics; UK news; Environment,Environment

2024-12-20T12:00:48Z,The facts about a planet facing climate disaster are clear. Why won’t this Labour government face them? | Jeremy Corbyn,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/20/planet-climate-disaster-labour-government,"There is no need to overcomplicate things: a rise in global temperatures of 3.1C is not compatible with human survival. That is where we are heading, unless we act now. On our current path, the world will exceed 1.5C of warming, and could reach a rise of 2.6-3.1C by the end of the century. For you, today, that might make the difference between wearing a jumper or a jacket. For humanity, it is the difference between survival and extinction. Paris and Berlin will bake under heatwaves. New York will be hit by frequent storm-surges. Coastal towns will be submerged; 800 million people are living on land that will be underwater. More of the tropics and the Gulf will exceed the heat threshold at which the human body can survive. We do not have to look to the future to know the horrors of climate breakdown. It is here, now. According to a study at Monash University, extreme weather can account for 9.4% of all deaths across the globe between 2000 and 2019. In the past year alone, heatwaves have killed 1,500 in Myanmar; flooding has affected more than 700,000 people in east Africa and left more than 400,000 displaced in southern Brazil; and wildfires in Chile have destroyed more than 14,000 homes. This is on top of catastrophic biodiversity loss; in just 50 years, the world has lost more than two-thirds of its wildlife. If our political leaders acted out of humanity, the plight of others would be enough to motivate them into action. In the absence of empathy, perhaps we need to be more direct: the climate crisis is coming for you, because it is coming for us all. Without urgent action, “once-in-a-generation” events – the flooding of New York subways, the typhoon-like winds sucking people out of their apartments in China, the forest fires – will become the new routine of daily life. Politicians abandoned the goal to stop climate breakdown many years ago. We have a much more basic demand: to stop climate breakdown entering a new phase of existential disaster. That means avoiding certain “tipping points” that would put humanity on an irreversible path to catastrophe. The collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, for example, would disrupt the rains that billions of people depend on for food in India, South America and west Africa. Permafrost thaw would generate an irreversible release of carbon dioxide. And the loss of the Greenland ice sheet would result in disastrous runaway melting. Few politicians deny that human-made global heating is real. Instead, our government peddles a different – more insidious – kind of denialism. One that moves away from a disbelief in the climate crisis, and toward a belief that incremental change can fix it. The Labour government has already rowed back on its £28bn green investment pledge, cutting it by half and replaced it with blind faith and a £22bn investment in carbon capture. It is a policy that lets the fossil fuel industry carry on destroying our natural world. In unrelated news, the Labour party accepted a £4m donation from a Cayman Islands-registered hedge fund with shares in oil and gas. This government is not just failing to stand up to fossil fuel giants. It is failing to confront the economic system that empowers them. The richest 1% are responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest 66%, yet our government still refuses to bring in wealth taxes to reduce inequality. Unless the government has the courage to rewrite the rules of our ecocidal economy, its climate targets will soon become yet another broken promise. A planet cannot be cooled by warm words; we need fundamental change, now. A Green New Deal would invest in publicly owned renewable energy and water. It would create millions of green jobs. It would promote sustainable farming based on the principles of agroecology. And it would kickstart an economy based on human need, not corporate greed. The climate emergency is a global problem that requires global solutions. The least this government could do is show some respect for nations that have contributed least to global heating but will suffer the worst effects. When the prime minister said reparations were off the agenda, he wilfully ignored the lasting colonial inequalities putting vulnerable communities at risk of climate disaster. Up against such historical amnesia, is it any wonder that delegations representing smaller nations temporarily exited negotiations at Cop29? In one respect, the UK is a global leader: cracking down on climate activism. British police arrest environmental protesters at nearly three times the global average – a shocking reflection of an establishment that criminalises those who want to save our natural world while rewarding those intent on destroying it. The government is also trying to win the global race-to-the-bottom over migration. The prime minister knows what he is doing when he talks of British “open border experiments”. He is fanning the flames of hatred of the kind we saw on the streets last summer. And he is contributing to the demonisation of human beings who are fleeing the very climate crisis he is failing to address. While marginalised communities are under attack, climate doomism is not an option. As long as there is life on this Earth, there will always be a reason to defend our shared humanity. The future is stark, but it is never too late to build a better, more sustainable world.

2023-01-23T18:30:06Z,The CBI is right. The UK needs a growth plan | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/23/the-cbi-is-right-the-uk-needs-a-growth-plan,"The CBI billed it as a “major speech”, which is a judgment best left to others, but, yes, Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, made a couple of excellent points on Monday as he addressed the current obsession in UK boardrooms: where is the national plan for growth? First, it’s time for the UK to stop congratulating itself of having built so many offshore windfarms, and understand that “a subsidy arms race”, as Danker put it, is under way in green investment. The dramatic phrase may sound like a plea for corporate handouts (and, up to a point, it is) but it is also a widely held assessment of President Joe Biden’s misleadingly named Inflation Reduction Act. A $369bn (£298bn) package to direct subsidies towards green technologies is enormous and has the potential to change the investment landscape and increase the gravitational pull of the US. It is a hard piece of legislation to ignore. The EU is alarmed – at Davos last week, the Czech trade minister called it the equivalent to “doping in sport” – and one can understand why. Even Northvolt, the Swedish electric battery maker that is a European champion in the technology, is debating openly whether to open its next gigafactory in the US rather than Germany to take advantage of the subsidies. Little ol’ UK clearly cannot compete on largesse (especially when some prospects are as unpromising as Britishvolt, a company without a developed product or customers) but nor is it credible to do nothing. “We’re behind the Germans on heat pumps, the French on electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the US on operational carbon capture and storage projects, despite the UK’s North Sea advantage,” said Danker. It’s a fair point. Success in offshore windfarms was built on incentive arrangements that morphed into the contracts-for-difference regime and it feels unlikely that hydrogen or sustainable aviation fuels, to use two of his examples, will become turbo-charged without a similar mechanism. The current approach does indeed smack of hoping for the best. Second, the government isn’t even following Sunak’s own philosophy when it comes to tax strategy for stimulating business investment, where the UK has sat near the bottom of OECD league tables for about a decade. As chancellor, Sunak gave a lecture only 11 months ago that hinted strongly that the two-year post-lockdown “super-deductions” setup – the tax breaks that allowed companies to offset 130% of investment spending on plant and machinery against profits – would get a successor regime. “We need our future tax policy to be targeted and strategic,” declared Sunak, as he argued that simply cutting headline corporation tax had not led to a step-change in investment by companies. It was on that basis that CBI leaders, who probably now feel like mugs, last year backed a rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%: they thought something would flow in the other direction. As it is, super-deductions will end in March with nothing else in place. Not everybody, it should be said, is convinced that super-deductions stimulated extra business spending – or spending that would not have taken place anyway. These things are hard to measure, even if the likes of BT – a big advocate, unsurprisingly – demonstrably tried to pick up the pace on its fast-fibre installation programme. Equally, though, there is obviously a cliff-edge danger in yanking a scheme overnight. Danker reckons the UK could slip from having the fifth most competitive tax system in the OECD for capital investment to 30th place out of 38. “Our investment plan just became anti-investment,” he argued. A repeat of the lavish generosity of 130% isn’t realistic but, yes, 50% initially, as the CBI suggests, would be a signal that the government accepts the case that growth requires a shot of adrenaline from investment. Some of Danker’s other pleas – on immigration, for example, to address skills shortages – will probably be ignored, whatever their merits. But the rest of the content deserves a response. The CBI isn’t always the authentic voice of business but, on this occasion, it is on the money: the appeal for a joined-up strategy for growth is almost universal. Corporate heads understand the shortage of money; the grumble is the lack of ideas.",Business; Economic growth (GDP); Economics; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Rishi Sunak,Business
2023-01-18T22:30:09Z,Starmer to tell Davos a Labour Britain would be ‘open for business’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/18/starmer-davos-labour-britain-open-business,"Keir Starmer hopes to entice global finance leaders in Davos on Thursday by ensuring them Britain “will be open for business” under a future Labour government. With Rishi Sunak declining to attend this year’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the Labour leader will arguably be the most high-profile UK politician attending. He will be joined by Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, in a bid to encourage business leaders and international figures to envision a Britain under his leadership. The duo will hope to reassure finance bosses they will pull in more foreign investment, particularly in the “green” industries of the future. During the day of talks, they will promote Labour’s green prosperity plan to decarbonise the economy, boost energy security and ensure Britain leads in future green industries. Starmer’s focus on the plan may hearten some Labour figures, who want to pressure his office into ensuring green policies are at the heart of his manifesto. Ahead of the visit, Reeves said: “With Labour in government, Britain will be open for business. We have the ambition and the practical ideas to have our country lead on the global stage again, especially in those green industries of the future that are so vital for our energy security. “We will restore economic growth to the UK, improving living standards and creating jobs, and bring global investors back to drive our economy forwards – all built on the rock of economic stability and certainty. “Labour will work in partnership with business to boost investment in the UK economy, to make sure the jobs of the future are in the UK, and to ensure the UK is a world leader in the climate transition.” Neither Sunak nor Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, will attend the exclusive gathering, with the prime minister instead delivering a short speech on levelling up. The trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, and the business secretary, Grant Shapps, will represent the government instead, rubbing shoulders with their old boss, Boris Johnson. Starmer and Reeves will be the first Labour leaders to attend the summit since John McDonnell made a surprise visit as shadow chancellor in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet in 2018. McDonnell told the Guardian before his debut appearance that he had travelled to the summit to deliver some home truths, including the fact that those in attendance were held in contempt by ordinary voters. This visit will highlight how much Labour has changed under Starmer’s leadership, further distancing the party from claims that it is “anti-business”. Johnson, like his former opposite number Starmer, is on a mission to turn his own image around after ordering his ministers to avoid attending Davos. He described it as an elitist event after winning a huge majority in 2019, in order to reaffirm his party’s position among working-class voters. The former prime minister has been on his own networking mission since leaving No 10, having attended Cop27 and spending time on the after-dinner speech circuit. Labour’s fresh business drive comes after reports revealed donations to the party jumped by nearly a quarter to £4.7m, boosted by spending from unions and individual donors. A party spokesperson said donors were “coming back to Labour because they can see we are a changed party that is serious about getting into government and building a fairer, greener, more dynamic Britain”.",Davos; Keir Starmer; Labour; Politics; UK news; Business; Davos 2023,Business
2024-03-30T14:00:11Z,"Labour membership falls by 23,000 over Gaza and green policies",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/30/labour-membership-falls-by-23000-over-gaza-and-green-policies,"Labour has suffered a sharp fall in membership over the past two months following controversies over its policy on Gaza and its U-turn on green investment, according to figures released to its National Executive Committee (NEC). The drop of more than 23,000 members comes despite the party holding a commanding lead in the opinion polls, which suggests it is now seen by the wider electorate as ready and able to form the next government, after 14 years of Tory rule. Labour sources said the party’s overall financial position remained strong despite membership subscriptions falling off, because donations large and small were healthy, and the expectation was that the unions would still give very substantial backing to the election effort. In a report to the NEC last week, the party’s general secretary, David Evans, caused surprise when he revealed that membership, which had stood at 390,000 in January, had plummeted to 366,604 at the latest count, with more than 11,700 of these being in arrears. Labour membership reached a peak at the end of 2019 when it hit over 532,000. One senior Labour figure who was there said: “It is a big fall in just two months. People were surprised, even taken aback.” Labour insiders believe that the fall has been caused primarily by anger among Muslim and others Labour supporters over Keir Starmer’s position on Gaza and his refusal over several months to call for an immediate ceasefire. Since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, Labour’s refusal over many weeks to call for a ceasefire led to the resignation of at least 70 Labour councillors. It also triggered a loss of control in four councils: Oxford, Burnley, Hastings and Norwich. At the same time, Starmer faced rebellions by many of his own MPs, as well as frontbench resignations. In November, 10 frontbenchers resigned or were sacked from his team after voting for a Scottish National party motion that called for a ceasefire. Jess Phillips, one of the most high-profile shadow ministers to resign, said at the time: “I have to use my voice to try, and wherever possible, move a dial. And look, I think this dial will move. I think that it won’t be too long before the US and the UK feel that the military action is achieving nothing.” The party high command has also felt the wrath of green supporters over its decision to drop a commitment to spend £28bn if it wins the general election on its green investment plan, a centrepiece of a programme to drive economic growth. Early in February – in a move that prompted an angry response from environmental groups, unions and some in the energy sector – Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, jointly announced they would slash the green prosperity plan from £28bn a year to under £15bn, only a third of which would be new money. Luke Akehurst, a member of the NEC, said the party was in a strong financial position despite some cancelling their memberships. “Party membership is still at historically high levels. Labour only had 150,000 members at the end of its last period in office [in 2010],” he said. “The state of the opinion polls suggest there is no correlation between membership and electoral popularity.” Grassroots leftwing group Momentum, which has become increasingly critical of Starmer recently, said: “These figures highlight the danger of Labour’s leadership taking its base for granted. From a failure to oppose Israel’s brutal war on Gaza to morale-damaging U-turns and the mistreatment of Diane Abbott, Keir Starmer is alienating swathes of Labour’s core support. Members are the lifeblood of Labour – their departure en masse should set alarm bells ringing.”",Labour; Politics; UK news; Keir Starmer; Israel-Gaza war; Green politics; Green economy; Economic policy; Foreign policy; Rachel Reeves,Politics
2024-12-01T12:31:31Z,Wake up and smell the coffee: rising food prices show destabilising impact of climate crisis | Heather Stewart,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/01/wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee-rising-food-prices-show-destabilising-impact-of-climate-crisis,"Your morning – and afternoon – coffee is the latest staple threatened by climate chaos: the price of quality arabica beans shot to its highest level in almost 50 years last week amid fears of a poor harvest in Brazil. It follows warnings that orange crops have been wiped out by the catastrophic floods in Valencia, Spain; and the soaring cost of olive oil in recent years, as the southern Mediterranean has sweltered. The cost of the beans accounts for only about 5% of the price of a fancy latte, according to the economic research group Capital Economics, so the impact on coffee drinkers is likely to be minimal, but almost every week seems to bring fresh news of climate-induced price increases. In the rich world these cause inconvenience and make the lives of low-income households harder. In developing countries, they can mean outright hunger. Sometimes these price jumps follow extreme weather events, as in the case of the Spanish floods. Scientists tell us such events have already become more common as a result the climate crisis, and will continue to multiply. Or the jumps may result from the higher temperatures that have become a new and alarming normal, forcing farmers to rethink longstanding cultivation patterns. A paper for the UN’s Department for Economic and Social Affairs recently said: “Staple crops like corn, soya beans, wheat, rice, cotton and oats exhibit suboptimal growth when exposed to excessive heat.” It went on to warn that the diminishing availability of water was another damaging factor – with the wider spread of pests and diseases – as climate patterns changed. If a single foodstuff is affected, or a defined region, the impact in shoppers’ baskets, in the developed world at least, may be minimal: retailers can source alternative producers, and shoppers can substitute other products. But economists are increasingly starting to assemble evidence that global heating is putting systemic upward pressure on food inflation – as well as injecting volatility into the food production system worldwide. The challenges can be compounded by climate-related transport bottlenecks, as when the number of ships that could transit the Panama Canal each day had to be cut because of low water levels. Research published earlier this year in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment found that climate pressures could add on average anything from 0.9 to 3.2 percentage points to global food price inflation over the next decade, depending on how much hotter we allow the planet to get. In hard-hit regions, the impact can be much worse. This is yet another reason that action on curbing emissions is essential, and it strengthens the arguments of countries who were fighting for a bigger financial settlement from the rich world at the Cop29 summit. But even on the best-case scenario, climate-related price chaos is already here to stay. All which raises the question of whether policymakers have the tools to cope with this new era of uncertainty. Whacking up interest rates is not meant to be the right response to supply shocks anyway but it seems particularly ill-suited to dealing with climate-induced shortages. The European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, discussed some of these issues last year at the central bankers’ annual gabfest in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in a speech that questioned whether conventional monetary policy could work in what she called “an age of shifts and breaks”. (Lagarde also referred to other important structural changes, such as the geopolitical reordering of trade patterns.) The economist Isabella Weber has shown that corporations have extraordinary pricing power in the grip of shocks such as this, which they use to build profit margins at the expense of consumers. She believes governments may have to use unconventional approaches to managing the resulting inflation – including price caps, and potentially even building up buffer stocks of staple foods for emergencies. The latter sounds like an extreme measure, but Liz Truss’s energy price guarantee – a drastic intervention in the UK’s energy market to shield households from soaring bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine – would have been unthinkable, until it wasn’t. Clearly, a significant part of the response to climate-induced price rises should also be to invest in global resilience in the face of the onrushing crisis: flood defences, more weather-resistant crop varieties, and research into tackling pests and diseases. But as the economist Andrew Sissons argued recently, in the current political environment there is a problem with many of these solutions – they are costly, and long term. Judging by the spate of global elections over the past 12 months in which incumbents have been turfed out, voters have little patience for the price of staples rocketing. The cost of a box of eggs featured repeatedly in the US campaign, for example. There is little sense either that the cash-strapped public are prepared to bear the costs of insulating the economy against structural shifts such as these – or that politicians are willing to discuss the trade-offs honestly. And populists, including Reform in the UK, are ever-ready to pounce on environmental spending as wasteful and unnecessary. Ed Miliband’s green investment dash in the UK may be an honourable exception – but Labour’s current plans are a shadow of the £28bn a year once promised, and the payback in terms of lower bills looks a long way off. Or, as Sissons puts it: “The things that actually work to tackle cost of living crises may not fit neatly into electoral cycles.” Food price shocks are only one aspect of the climate crisis, but their growing frequency is a warning sign that we are entering a new, more volatile era, with a policy toolkit created in calmer times.",Food & drink industry; Business; Inflation; Climate crisis; Environment; World news; Europe; UK news,Business
2024-05-10T11:00:05Z,"In France, we’ve been desperate for a real alternative to Macron and Le Pen. Finally, he’s here | Alexander Hurst",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/10/france-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen-raphael-glucksmann,"Maybe it’s the result of having moved to Europe with a North American point of view, but it has always stunned me that Europe’s nations – crammed together into an elbow of a landmass – could ever think of their sort as anything but inextricably linked. Regardless of what river, mountain range or narrow channel of water their borders run along, anything but a united Europe will be a plaything in a world split between the unchallenged economic power of the US and China. Emmanuel Macron understands this. It’s why he’s often at his most prescient and convincing when he talks about Europe. As far as a vision for Europe goes, the first speech he gave at the Sorbonne won me over in 2017; when he returned in late April this year for Europe Speech 2.0, I once again found myself agreeing with his calls for greater European federalism. But in the 9 June European elections, in which I have a vote – my first ever as a French and European citizen – I’m not sure that I’ll vote for the French president’s party, Renaissance. First, because I’m not sure that Macron, the object of so much domestic division, is well-placed to bring France along with him for all the ways that Europe urgently needs to evolve. And second, because France desperately needs a left wing that is genuinely committed to the European project. The 9 June poll is a chance for that French left to reassert itself (to “take back control”, if you will) by regrouping behind Raphaël Glucksmann. At 44, two years younger than Macron, Glucksmann has made his mark as an MEP by being vocal about the need for European integration as essential to accelerating the green transition, promoting human rights globally and solidifying democracy against authoritarianism. To his credit, support for these things goes deeper than his career in electoral politics. As a young journalist, Glucksmann made a 2004 documentary, Tuez-les tous!, about France’s role in the Rwandan genocide, and he was in Kyiv for the 2013 Euromaidan protests. Perhaps his long experience with Ukraine is why Glucksmann has always been clear-eyed about the danger Vladimir Putin poses to Europe as a whole. And in the context of rising illiberalism across the political spectrum, he has cut ties with the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The downside of what Macron accomplished in 2017 and held together in 2022 –uniting the mainstream left and right under the banner of radical centrism – is that it has reinforced the horseshoe theory of politics fuelling an even more radical opposition on the far left and far right. (It certainly didn’t help that after his 2017 election, Macron quickly and repeatedly stepped into an easy caricature of himself as arrogant and lacking empathy.) No country can long sustain a politics that has become extractive, where a significant chunk of its political class seeks destruction in the hopes of one day ruling over the rubble. In the US, one half plays this game unilaterally against the other half; in France, both poles of the horseshoe have played it against the centre. We know what the far-right vision for Europe is: hostility to immigrants, a lack of green investment and regulation, open season for illiberal leaders to erode the rule of law, judicial independence and a free press, and a far more friendly turn towards the Kremlin. By retreating behind the useful youth of 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, Marine Le Pen has achieved ever-increasing normalisation for the National Rally, which now leads pre-election polls with 32% of the vote. And the far left, under Mélenchon’s leadership, has spent the past two years helping to do her job. The French are more afraid of seeing Mélenchon in power than they are Le Pen. Mélenchon has cast a solid left-Eurosceptic shadow over French politics. Glucksmann has a chance to change that by convincingly marking the argument that many of the left’s priorities – a wealth tax, public contracting with local producers, reorganising subsidies to farmers around regenerative agriculture, protecting strict climate regulations, massive green investment in everything from renewables to affordable train travel – only make real sense at a European level. With 14% of French voters supporting Glucksmann’s party, Place Publique, there is a significant portion of the French electorate that doesn’t fully align with Macron domestically, but that wants none of the Euroscepticism Mélenchon is offering, and that has come to Glucksmann from both Macron’s camp (on 17% support) and Mélenchon’s (on 7%). These voters understand that in the face of behemoth economies like China and the US, and unflinching aggression from Putin, sovereignty is nothing if not European. They desire greater integration in order to have real impact on the climate crisis and ecology, and they know that Europe’s strongest global lever of influence on behalf of both is access – or not – to its single market. Elections often involve some amount of tug-of-war between a strategic vote and a heartfelt one. But on 9 June, for the first time since the very first vote I ever cast (for Barack Obama, in 2008), my vote for Raphaël Glucksmann will be both a vote of strategy and a vote de coeur.

2024-10-15T17:28:07Z,"Starmer calls it slashing ‘red tape’. In fact, he’s just capitulating to big business | Nicholas Shaxson",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/15/starmer-red-tape-big-business-labour,"There is a profound yet simple question about investment in our economy that all politicians should be forced to face: who benefits? At this week’s International Investment Summit in London, Keir Starmer offered a worrying answer. He is pledging to “rip out” bureaucracy” and to make his deregulatory agenda a “cross-government priority”. He proceeded to lead a back-slapping discussion with Google’s former boss Eric Schmidt, who joshed that Starmer should appoint a “minister for anti-regulation”. He also sent a warning shot across the bows of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), whose mission is to protect the British public against scams and abuses by monopolists and other nasty global forces. “We will make sure that every regulator in the country, especially our economic and competition regulators, take growth as seriously as this room does.” Taking sides with the monopolists in the room – and against his own regulator. It’s not a good sign. All this comes in a wider context of sucking up to the City of London, while ignoring the policy preferences of much of the public. Starmer has rowed back on pledges to cap banker bonuses and tax windfall bank profits; he has watered down a £28bn green investment plan and now threatens to defenestrate the CMA. This is Tony Blair’s old playbook. For foreign investors, the former Labour leader managed expectations upwards, while managing them downwards for the home audience. But the Blairite economic package was ultimately about transferring resources away from consumers, workers and ordinary taxpayers, and towards the (mostly non-resident) shareholders of large global multinationals – in the hope that some of it would trickle back down. It is telling that Starmer’s investment summit was held not in Newcastle or Manchester, but at the Guildhall, home of the City of London Corporation, Britain’s foremost finance lobbyist. Blair’s pro-finance agenda helped usher in the global financial crisis, which evaporated trillions of pounds’ worth of economic activity, and in which Britain played a central, deregulatory role. Now, urged on by the Tony Blair Institute, Starmer risks stripping away protections and potentially ushering in different crises, not least a rise in what the academic Isabella Weber calls “sellers’ inflation”, where companies jack up prices far above the costs of production, levying what are in effect private taxes for the benefit of a class of investors based in wealthy parts of London, overseas and offshore. The CMA’s job is to stop this, and Starmer seems to want to stop the CMA. Britain’s politicians have long genuflected to the City, but they increasingly doff caps to big tech now too. Last year, according to Open Democracy, Labour ditched its proposals to levy a digital services tax on the tech giants – a day after senior Labour figures received thousands of pounds’ worth of Glastonbury freebies, as guests of Google’s YouTube. Starmer seems to be taking the side of global monopoly power over the people of Britain. But if his goal is to make the UK safe for American or Chinese multinationals, then who runs Britain? And what is the red tape to be cut? There are of course always rules that hold parts of the economy back. But most of these rules are intended to save people and the planet from unjust exploitation. As the late President John F Kennedy once said, referencing GK Chesterton: “Don’t ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up.” The assumption underpinning Labour’s worldview is that there is a trade-off to be had between regulation and growth. But it’s the other way around, especially when it comes to tackling excessive corporate power. Make no mistake: monopolists kill innovation and they kill growth. Pandering to them is anti-business. Voters don’t want deregulation, either. The latest polling by Unchecked found that 79% of Britons support strong regulation for a “strong economy and stable society”. If Labour sticks to this course of using tax cuts and pro-monopoly deregulation to transfer resources away from people and businesses in the UK and towards globally mobile giant firms with mostly foreign shareholders – in the hope that somehow wealth will trickle back down – Starmer’s popularity is likely to mirror that of the embattled French president Emmanuel Macron, facing a surge in support for the far left and the far right. It could be worse still: the ensuing public anger may unleash forces that would see the final implosion of the Labour party itself.

2024-09-02T05:00:26Z,Labour urged to place trade union members on wealth fund board,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/02/trade-union-members-wealth-fund-board-labour,"The government is being urged to install trade union members on the board of its new £7.3bn national wealth fund to help offset the influence of big banks and ensure that it is geared towards hitting green targets and bringing “shared prosperity” to the UK population. It is part of a wider set of recommendations set out by the campaign group Positive Money, aimed at shaping the governance and investment plans of the national wealth fund (NWF), which was launched by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after the July election. The NWF is part of government efforts to attract billions of pounds of private-sector cash – roughly £3 for every £1 of taxpayer cash – for big infrastructure projects across the UK, including ports, gigafactories and hydrogen and steel projects. The government is hoping that putting £7.3bn of public money forward will persuade private funders to put their own money on the line. While the government has yet to release further details of how the NWF will be run, Positive Money is concerned that the blueprint will be disproportionately influenced by City bosses. Labour has so far relied on a taskforce made up of the chief executives of firms including insurer Aviva and banks such as NatWest and Barclays, as well as the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The group said the fund should “focus on delivering for workers and communities, not just investors”, and be governed by an independent board and investment committee with “strong representation from civil society” – potentially including thinktanks such as the IPPR and climate strategists E3G – “and, in particular, trade unions, to help ensure the NWF supports a genuinely just green transition and shared prosperity”. It added: “These recommendations arise from what Positive Money sees as over-representation of the financial industry in the national wealth fund taskforce.” The launch of the new wealth fund quickly followed Labour’s controversial decision to cut its £28bn green investment pledge in half – a move that prompted an angry response from green groups, unions and others. Positive Money said the NWF should aim to operate more like the much revered £580bn KfW development bank in Germany, but it would have to grow to more than £460bn to reach the same per-capita scale as its European counterpart. It said this could be done in part by giving the NWF powers to raise money by issuing bonds through financial markets, and have its borrowing be excluded from government fiscal rules that cap public sector debts, giving it more freedom to borrow and invest at scale. The campaign group said the NWF should devolve investment decisions to a network of 12 “regional banks” based in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland plus the nine regions of England, which would seek guidance from local authorities, as well as local industry and businesses, about how to allocate funds. Decentralising investment decisions would “ensure funds are best channelled to where they are needed across the whole country”. Simon Youel, head of policy and advocacy at Positive Money and author of the research, said Labour had an opportunity with the NWF “to establish a long-lasting, legacy public institution”. “The NWF isn’t just an opportunity to deliver social and environmental value to the public after years of underinvestment. It’s a chance for the public to finally start seeing some returns on their investment, instead of the ‘privatised rewards, publicised risk’ model that has become all too familiar in recent decades,” he said. “With genuinely ambitious mandates, objectives and financing power, the NWF could join the ranks of purpose-driven public banks the world over, and demonstrate the potential of public finance to deliver truly transformative change, such as the rapid and just decarbonisation of our economy and infrastructure.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “The national wealth fund will play an important role in the government’s industrial strategy and growth and clean energy missions, making transformative investments across every part of the country, supporting thousands of good jobs and making everyone better off, while generating a return for the taxpayer.” The spokesperson added that further details would be set out in due course.",Infrastructure; Financial sector; Trade unions; Investing; Politics; Business; Labour; UK news; Green economy; Public finance; Government borrowing; Budget deficit; Economics; Environment; Bonds; Industrial policy; Tax and spending,Business
2024-11-07T12:25:15Z,First Thing: Harris concedes to Trump but urges supporters to ‘never give up’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/first-thing-harris-concedes-to-trump-but-urges-supporters-to-never-give-up,"Good morning. Kamala Harris formally conceded the election to Donald Trump on Wednesday, calling on her supporters to “never give up” and to fight for American democracy as he prepared to choose his top team. Speaking at her alma mater, Howard University, after the Republican gained more than the 270 votes needed to win the electoral college, Harris said: “While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. Hear me when I say: the light of America’s promise will always burn bright, as long as we never give up.” She drew loud applause as she told the crowd she would aid the peaceful transition of power. For the first time in two decades, Republicans look set to win the popular vote: at the time of writing, Trump had 51% against Harris’s 48%. With the results still trickling in, Joe Biden, who said he spoke to Trump on Wednesday and invited him to the White House, will address the nation on Thursday. How many people voted for Trump compared with 2020? The vote count is ongoing – but Trump is expected to hit the 74m votes he won in 2020, while Harris looks set to fail to reach the 81m votes Biden gained in 2020. US elections 2024: control of House remains unclear Control of the US House of Representatives remained unclear early on Thursday morning, though the Republicans secured their widelyexpected majority in the US Senate. With two pillars of power already in Republican control, the stakes are higher than ever for the Democratic party, as winning control of the House could serve as their only way to check Trump’s power as president. At time of writing, 38 races remained uncalled, with the Republicans up one seat, giving them 206, while the Democrats were down one seat, at 191. When will we know? It may take days yet to determine the winner of the House – in 2022, it took more than a week. US special counsel to shut down criminal cases against Trump Special counsel prosecutors will end their criminal cases against Trump before he assumes office in January, according to two sources close to the matter, as his victory means the cases will not go to trial. The decision is being taken because the cases will not be finished by inauguration day, and once Trump is in the White House, the special counsel’s office would be prohibited from pursuing further criminal actions. The justice department has long been aware that if the Republican candidate were elected, Trump’s attorney general would probably drop the charges against him over his retention of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. How much of this was planned by Trump? His legal strategy had been to delay the criminal cases until after the election – he repeatedly told rallies that he was running to save himself.

2024-07-02T15:55:19Z,Shell to pause construction of huge biodiesel plant in Rotterdam,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/02/shell-to-pause-construction-of-huge-biodiesel-plant-in-rotterdam,"Shell has paused the construction of one of Europe’s largest biofuel plants which was expected to convert waste into green jet fuel and biodiesel by the end of the decade. The oil company said on Tuesday it would “temporarily pause” work on one of its biggest energy transition projects to address the technical difficulties that have delayed its progress so far. Shell began constructing the plant, based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, in 2021, and had initially expected to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year in April, before this was pushed back to 2025. About half of the plant’s biofuels were to be used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from waste cooking oil and animal fat. The fuel is seen by some as crucial if airlines are to cut their carbon emissions in line with global climate targets. The nascent industry has also attracted criticism from those who claim that SAF is not a realistic replacement for paraffin-based aviation fuels within the timescale needed to prevent rising carbon emissions from creating a climate catastrophe. “We’re taking the tough decision now to temporarily pause on-site construction,” a Shell spokesperson said. “This gives us the opportunity to take stock, complete engineering, optimise project sequencing and in doing so maintain capital discipline.” The spokesperson added: “Low-carbon fuels form a key part of Shell’s ambitions to provide affordable and sustainable products to our customers.” The aviation industry accounts for 3% of the world’s carbon emissions, and is seen as one of the most difficult forms of transportation to decarbonise. The decision to pause the work deals another blow to Shell’s biofuels plans after the company cancelled an SAF project at Singapore’s Bukom Island in March last year. Shell was considering investment in a plant that could produce 550,000 tonnes of SAF a year to supply major Asian hubs such as Hong Kong International airport and Singapore’s Changi. The blow to Shell’s green aviation plans has come after the company signalled a scaling back of its green growth ambitions by reducing the number of staff working on low-carbon solutions by at least 200 roles, while a further 130 positions will be placed under review. The decision is expected to affect Shell’s plans for offshore wind development and sharply scale back its ambitions to fuel hydrogen passenger vehicles. Shell was an early adopter of hydrogen, which has fallen out of favour as electric vehicles become more popular. Instead, Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, is planning to shift its focus towards high-profit oil projects and expanding its gas business to exploit higher global oil and gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The rise in global energy market prices has prompted executives across the oil and gas industry to review green investment plans and climate targets. BP confirmed last week it would halt investment in new offshore wind projects, and place a hiring freeze for the new business division, in an apparent attempt to placate investors who are unhappy with the greener direction set by its ousted boss Bernard Looney.",Shell; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Business; Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Biofuels; Airline emissions; Airline industry; Energy; Environment; Netherlands,Business
2024-02-15T13:48:52Z,‘Rishi’s recession’: Reeves seizes her moment to take the economic high ground,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/15/rishis-recession-reeves-seizes-her-moment-to-take-the-economic-high-ground,"As she stood beside two union flags in a wood-panelled room, it looked as if Rachel Reeves had stepped into Rishi Sunak’s own press conference room in Downing Street – a deliberate move. The shadow chancellor had been preparing for this moment for months, warning of the heightened risk of recession ever since the last quarter’s GDP figures showed negative growth. Accusing Sunak of putting the economy “into reverse” and leaving his promise of economic growth “in tatters”, Reeves was keen to imprint one phrase on voters’ minds: “Rishi’s recession.” One Labour source said it was “an economic and political moment – for a government to have fallen into recession in an election year, when Rishi Sunak has made his whole argument about growing the economy”. Labour sources say Reeves had wanted to speak directly to the country at such a crucial time, rather than popping up briefly on television screens for a short clip. “The picture we want the country to see is a competent alternative to what you’ve gone through, doubling down on Rachel’s core strength of people looking at her and trusting her,” one source said. They say Reeves is now gearing up to make the election all about economic competence, having put to bed the argument over Labour’s £28bn green investment promise once and for all. Prior to the decision to ditch the pledge, Labour figures had been getting tangled up in questions about how it would be paid for and were fearing Conservative attacks on their spending plans. But having abandoned the £28bn figure after weeks of uncertainty, Reeves and her team now feel they “can prosecute the economic case much more effectively”, one source said. Reeves’s speech showed Labour trying to get back on the front foot after a difficult few days for the party in which its poll lead has slipped slightly, and Keir Starmer has been mired in accusations that he did not act quickly enough to suspend a Labour candidate accused of spreading a conspiracy theory about Israel. The shadow chancellor appeared sure-footed in the face of questions about the Rochdale candidate furore, saying the comments had been made in a private meeting and that Labour could not know everything about what was said behind closed doors. She also batted away queries about what she would do if standing in Jeremy Hunt’s shoes for the budget next month, apart from saying Labour would go for growth with planning reforms and a modern industrial strategy. The question remains about how Labour’s economic offering differs from the Tories’ now that the party has got rid of the £28bn green investment pledge, which, while the subject of political attacks, had polled well with the public. Reeves made noises about matching Tory tax cuts, saying she had “made no secret of the fact that [she] wants taxes on working people to be lower” as long as the money was there to make that possible. But with Sunak and Hunt believed to be pencilling in public spending cuts to fund tax cuts, that could put Labour in a difficult position over whether to follow suit. The shadow chancellor referred to “hard choices ahead”, but went no further in indicating how Labour would deal with a scenario where the Tories go to the polls promising tax cuts on the back of fresh austerity.",Labour; Rachel Reeves; Recession; Rishi Sunak; Conservatives; Business; Economics; Politics; UK news; Economic policy,Politics
2024-06-15T05:00:10Z,What each party promises voters in its UK general election manifesto,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/15/what-each-party-promises-voters-in-its-uk-general-election-manifesto,"Of the big parties contesting the election outside Northern Ireland, all but the Scottish National party and Reform UK have now released their manifestos. So what is on offer thus far to voters on 4 July? Economy, tax and spending You could very broadly split the fiscal offerings into two camps: the disinclination to raise taxes among Labour and the Conservatives; and the less rigid approach of the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Within this, of course, are many other distinctions. Labour’s manifesto promises £7.4bn of tax rises, including a pledge to levy VAT on private school fees, one to tighten the taxation of non-doms, and one to widen the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. That pays for just £4.8bn in new spending, which will pay for more teachers and nurses as well as green investment. The Tories have much bigger commitments on both spending and raising money. The party is planning to cut £17bn in taxes, mainly by reducing the rate of national insurance. But it is less specific on how it will raise that money, for example promising £12bn of unspecified welfare reductions. The Liberal Democrats have bigger commitments still, promising to raise £27bn in taxes such as capital gains tax and a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. Much of that money will be spent on the NHS and social care, including providing more access to mental health support, GPs and dentists. The party says it would spend another £19.7bn on investment, such as building 150,000 new social homes a year. This money is not included in its costing, however, suggesting it would be funded by extra borrowing. The Greens advocate a wealth tax, among other changes, to support their fiscal plans. Plaid Cymru’s focus is primarily on securing for Wales what the party argues is a fairer distribution of central government funds. Health Pretty much everyone agrees that the NHS and dentistry need urgent action, but each party has its own way of trying to address the crises of waiting lists and “dental deserts”. Labour is pledging 40,000 new appointments a week to clear backlogs, plus more NHS technology and a “dentistry rescue plan”, including supervised tooth-brushing for three- to five-year-olds. The Tories have pledged their own dental plan, mainly based around new GP surgeries and a cull of health service managers. As part of a long-term workforce plan which the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, unveiled last year, the party would recruit 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors by 2029. The Lib Dems and Greens, with their greater fiscal scope from tax changes, are going further. The Lib Dems would offer a time guarantee to see a GP, and free adult social care. The Greens would add £8bn a year more for the NHS, plus a similar amount for infrastructure. Plaid Cymru has its own troubles with the Welsh health system, but promises an increase in GPs by restoring funding for them to 8.7% of the devolved health budget. Environment Unlike Labour, the Conservatives are pledging to keep issuing licences for North Sea oil and gas extraction. They will maintain the windfall tax unless oil prices fall sharply, but will continue to offer investment incentives for fossil fuel companies. The party says it will invest in green technologies such as carbon capture and storage, but will offer MPs a vote on the next stage of its net zero plan. Labour’s climate plan is centred on the creation of two new institutions: an energy generation company known as Great British Energy and an investment vehicle called the National Wealth Fund. Together these account for the bulk of the party’s green investment, with Labour promising to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030. The Lib Dems go further, with proposals for an emergency programme of home insulation and heat pump installation, while the Greens promise to cancel the recently awarded licences for the Rosebank oilfield. Plaid Cymru is pushing for a big expansion of renewable energy across Wales. Education The Conservatives have made a number of pledges on education, including a ban on mobile phones during the school day and mandatory maths study to 18. The party is promising to maintain day-to-day spending on schools in real terms, but this will increase pressure on other unprotected areas such as local government and the courts system. Labour is promising to recruit 6,500 new teachers, paid for by adding VAT to private school fees, as well as free breakfast clubs in every primary school. The party said this week it would introduce 3,000 extra nurseries in schools, although some in the industry have called on the party to offer more money to pay for extra staff. Among the Lib Dem offerings is a lifelong skills grant, giving adults £5,000 to spend on improving their skills. The Greens would abolish Ofsted, end “high-stakes formal testing” in primary and secondary schools, and scrap university tuition fees. Plaid Cymru also wants to recruit more teachers, and would like universal free school meals. Immigration The Conservatives are campaigning hard on immigration, with a promise that flights deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda would start leaving immediately if they won the election. Sunak has promised to bring net migration to half its current level, while making sure it stays down by implementing a cap. Labour has also promised to cut net migration, without saying by how much. It would scrap the Rwanda scheme and try to stop unofficial arrivals via small boats across the Channel with a new border security command. The party is also promising to sign returns agreements with international partners, though will not say how many people it is willing to accept as part of those agreements. The other parties take a different approach, with the Lib Dems promising safe and legal routes for asylum seekers and removing responsibility for work and student visas from the Home Office. Plaid Cymru wants to introduce more safe routes for asylum seekers to come to Britain, while the Greens would drop restrictions on migrant workers bringing dependants and would allow asylum seekers to work. Housing The Conservative manifesto promises to build 1.6m new homes in the next parliament, but does not pledge to restore mandatory housing targets for councils, which were dropped in 2023. Labour would restore those local housebuilding targets and allow some targeted construction on the green belt. The party is also promising widespread reform of the planning system, including by bringing down the cost of compulsory purchase orders. The Lib Dems would promise 150,000 new social rent homes a year, with Plaid Cymru promising what the party calls a “right to adequate housing”. The Greens have promised a mass building programme, rent controls and a plan to let councils requisition empty properties or ones without proper insulation. Crime and policing The Conservatives say they will oversee the recruitment of 8,000 new police officers and a rollout of facial recognition technology. Labour is promising neighbourhood policing teams and says it will “stamp out” low-level misdemeanours such as fly-tipping. The Lib Dems say they want more focus on rehabilitation and community supervision, while the Greens propose a national commission to “agree an evidence-based approach to reform of the UK’s counterproductive drug laws”.

2024-02-10T19:00:50Z,Labour’s green U-turn has threatened its plan for growth | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/10/labour-green-pledge-u-turn-threatened-plan-for-growth,"Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves promised to be Britain’s first “green chancellor” when she announced in 2021 that a Labour government would invest £28bn a year in greening the economy. A little over two years later, and the Labour party has unceremoniously dropped this commitment, instead pledging to spend a more modest £4.8bn a year over the next parliament on green investment, over and above the government’s existing investment plans. Labour says this is part of its broader commitment to fiscal responsibility; but in the week that the EU’s climate service announced that global heating had exceeded 1.5C across an entire year for the first time, environmentalists have expressed concerns that it might signal a diminishing commitment to tackling the climate crisis. While Labour’s plans still represent a significant increase in green investment, there are certainly questions about whether it goes far enough. Moreover, the reduction leaves a big hole in the party’s plans to expand the economy by boosting lagging levels of public and private investment. Because the government shifted its planned spending on the green transition since Reeves’ 2021 announcement, Labour’s original commitment to spend £28bn a year amounted to an additional £20bn a year on top of government plans. The revised announcement reduces that by three-quarters, with about 40% funded through hiking windfall taxes on oil and gas. The rest will be funded through additional borrowing, which Reeves is assuming will still allow Labour to meet the fiscal rules she has set. Labour has justified this scaling back because, as it rightly points out, the cost of government borrowing has risen sharply since its original announcement, thanks to rising inflation and interest rates in the last two years. It is also true that it was unrealistic to believe that a new government could raise spending on green investment to this level immediately on taking office. That said, this planned reduction could have an impact not just on the speed at which the UK can transition to net zero, but also on energy bills. Labour’s warm home plans will be cut by a fifth, meaning many fewer homes will be insulated during a first Labour term. There will also be implications for the transition to electric vehicles. The party is still planning to spend £8.3bn to achieve its clean power pledge to decarbonise the UK’s energy supply by 2030, although this will be made more difficult by delays in building the new nuclear power station Hinkley Point C. So the implications for the UK’s green transition are concerning, although there is no question that a Labour government would be far better for the climate than a Conservative one. But there are also implications for economic growth. The beauty of Labour’s “green prosperity plan” was that it was double-headed: it would be good for the climate, but also provide a vital and significantinjection of public investment to kickstart Britain’s sluggish productivity growth. By effectively adopting the arbitrary fiscal rule Jeremy Hunt has set that debt must be forecast to be falling in five years’ time – a rule that Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calls “basically silly” – Reeves is hemming a Labour government into the Tories’ macroeconomic worldview. There may be good political reasons to do so; Labour leader Keir Starmer and Reeves are rightly concerned to avoid a political trap Rishi Sunak and Hunt are trying to set, so they can make the argument that much-needed higher levels of investment by a Labour government would necessitate higher taxes. The problem is, it is the wrong economic strategy. Public and private investment is the engine of growth; yet in the 40 years to 2019, average annual investment in the UK was the lowest of any G7 country, and levels of UK public investment over the last two decades have been at two-thirds of the level of competitor countries. Together with Brexit, this has made us all much poorer than we would otherwise be, and the gap between London and the south-east and the rest of the country has widened in recent years. Stimulating private investment through higher levels of public investment in the green transition is vital to growing the economy. And that is crucial to generating the tax revenue that Labour will need to draw on in order to restore the public realm, from an NHS with record waiting lists to services for vulnerable children and homeless people. The green prosperity plan was Labour’s plan for doing this; in other areas like housing, roads, and hospitals it was planning to stick to Conservative plans for public investment. Just as significant as any impact for the climate is the fact that Labour’s overall plans for public investment after the next election are now only marginally higher than the Conservatives’. Of course, Labour politicians have a delicate path to pick through, setting out a plan that can revive not just the economy but the whole country, while not making themselves vulnerable to bad-faith Tory attacks. But the economic situation today is fundamentally different to the last time Labour was in opposition with a big poll lead in the mid-1990s; back then the City was booming and delivered significant, albeit ultimately unsustainable, revenues to the exchequer. Last week’s announcement to scale down its green prosperity plan means Labour has considerably more work to do on its plans for growth before an election.

2024-07-27T17:44:02Z,How bad are Britain's finances? Five questions on the state of the UK economy | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/27/britain-finances-key-questions-answers-state-economy-labour-government,"Labour will say the economy is in a terrible state – are they right? The economic outlook is improving, but a recovery from last year’s recession will be long and arduous without a boost to public investment. As President Biden has shown, businesses are reluctant to invest without government support and this applies especially to the need for green investment. Since the Brexit vote and the chaos and indecision it sparked inside Whitehall, businesses have delayed or cancelled planned investments, leading to eight years of stagnation. Skill shortages and the prevalance of long Covid, which has prevented tens of thousands of workers from returning to their jobs, has made it difficult for employers to recruit, leading to higher than expected pay rises. Higher than normal salary increases are one reason the Bank of England has delayed cuts to interest rates. Without a cut in the cost of borrowing, many economists believe consumers will resist spending and the economy will remain stuck on a low-growth path. Why are public finances so bad? The UK continues to borrow heavily to fund a shortfall in government spending. Taxes have risen since 2021, but spending has outpaced revenue to meet commitments on health, defence, pensions and inflation-linked welfare payments. Former chancellor Jeremy Hunt made a bad situation worse when he sanctioned expensive cuts to national insurance contributions and paid for them by slashing public investment and freezing departmental budgets already hit by 14 years of austerity. Some experts say we already knew the scale of the problem – are they right? It’s not true. The government’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, lays out each year the extent of the public spending shortfall according to what it is told by the Treasury. But Hunt gave a false picture of the government’s likely commitments, prompting the OBR boss Richard Hughes to declare that the OBR assessment last year read like a work of fiction. One instance illustrates how departments are being asked to cope with unfunded commitments. Public-sector pay review bodies have recommended teachers and some NHS staff receive a 5.5% increase this year, well above the 3.2% inflation figure in March and the current 2% rate of increase in the consumer prices index. An across-the-board rise in public-sector pay would mean the salary bill rising by up to £10bn. A freeze on the Home Office budget took no account of the need to revamp the border control and asylum systems to cope with the extra number of people arriving in the UK. Will Labour’s plans briefed so far make a difference? Gone are the wild and unfunded promises of public investment during the Boris Johnson years and the reckless tax cuts under Rishi Sunak. Labour’s approach will be based on a sober understanding of what cash is needed to maintain the current infrastructure – from mending crumbling hospitals to repairing leaky school roofs – while also plotting improvements that are affordable. The cash set aside for a national wealth fund and GB Energy – a body to support the building of wind farms and solar-panel arrays – is modest by international standards. However, rushing to spend public funds quickly has always proved wasteful. Is there anything else they could do? Rachel Reeves has boxed herself in with two commitments. First she has promised to recognise on the government balance sheet multi-billion-pound losses incurred by the Bank of England (which the US Treasury ignores) and to adopt Hunt’s budget rule that forces her to reduce the government debt as proportion of national income in the fifth year of the official forecasts. Ditching both would free up large sums of money to spend on the key to driving growth – public investment. • Phillip Inman is economics editor of the Observer and an economics writer for the Guardian",Economic policy; Government borrowing; Economic growth (GDP); Politics; Public sector pay; UK news; Society; Economics,Politics
2024-10-27T11:27:21Z,The long-awaited Labour budget needs to show the party knows what to do with power | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/27/labour-budget-raising-tax-spending-borrowing,"The long wait is almost over. On Wednesday, for the first time in more than 14 years, a Labour chancellor will have the chance to deliver a budget – and much is riding on what Rachel Reeves comes up with. After a series of unforced errors, the government needs to seize back control of the political narrative. Reeves has said her budget will launch a new era of investment that will rank alongside Labour’s historic reform programmes of the past. She cannot afford the budget to be a dud. There is no reason why it should be. Forget the idea that “wealth creators” are about to leave the country en masse because they may have to pay higher rates of capital gains or inheritance tax. Some could, but the vast majority will stay put. Ignore, too, suggestions that Reeves’s plans to borrow more for investment will lead to a ferocious sell-off of UK financial assets. The chances of another “Liz Truss moment” are remote. That’s not to say Reeves has an easy job on her hands. The chancellor has pledged that there will be no return to austerity, and that requires an increase in public spending. She wants to keep the financial markets happy, so higher day-to-day spending means higher taxes. Labour has ruled out raising taxes on working people, by which it means the rates of income tax, VAT, employees national insurance contributions and corporation tax. Together these account for about two-thirds of all tax raised, so raising the revenue to pay for the spending increases requires some ingenuity and some confusion over exactly who qualifies as a working person and who doesn’t. The biggest chunk of money will come from the national insurance contributions made by employers. Finally, the chancellor wants to reverse the cuts to infrastructure spending, inherited from the last government, to boost the UK’s growth rate. Jeremy Hunt’s plans involved a fall in public investment from 2.4% to 1.7% of national output (gross domestic product) by 2028-29 – the equivalent of £24bn a year by the end of the current parliament. This is therefore a budget that will raise spending, raise borrowing and raise taxes all at the same time. With growth slowing and consumer confidence dented by the chancellor’s repeated warnings about how draconian she intends to be, it could all go horribly wrong. Yet despite the risks and the apparent contradictions, the strategy has a logic to it. Extra spending on the NHS, schools, local government and prisons can be justified by 14 years of neglect under the Tories. The tax increases to pay for higher spending can also be blamed on the Tories. Part of the budget is about wiping the slate clean. The other part of the budget involves laying the foundations for future growth. Writing about the last Labour budget in his memoirs, Alistair Darling says: “A great deal of my speech was devoted to the need to improve our country’s infrastructure, including energy and transport. The case for government investment remains a strong one. There are areas in which, without government support, both financial and over important matters such as planning laws, we will fall further behind other countries.” That was true back in 2010 and it is just as true today. The prolonged period of rock-bottom interest rates after the global financial crisis provided an opportunity for a succession of Conservative governments to borrow cheaply for investment. Sadly, that opportunity was squandered. Reeves says plugging the hole in the public finances and investing for the future are two sides of the same story. The reason the NHS is creaking and the government is letting prisoners out on early release schemes is because economic growth has been weak for the past decade and a half, and even weaker once population growth is taken into account. Getting the economy to grow faster requires higher investment but Britain – as the International Monetary Fund noted last week – has lower rates of private and public capital spending than many of its peers. The chancellor thinks it makes sense to borrow to invest in transport and energy projects because this will lead to faster growth, higher tax revenues and the ability to spend more on public services. She is absolutely right about that. Reeves said last week that she intends to make it easier for the government to borrow by changing the rules on public debt. Analysts estimate that her planned new measure – which takes into account the state’s financial assets and liabilities – could increase the scope to borrow by about £50bn. In reality, Reeves will only use some of this additional headroom and may borrow only enough to avoid the £24bn cut to investment inherited from Hunt. In part this is due to concern over a market backlash but it is also due to the chancellor’s insistence that day-to-day government spending must be covered by tax receipts. Debt interest counts as day-to-day spending and – all other things remaining equal – the more the government borrows for investment the higher those interest payments will be. In some respects Reeves has made life harder for herself. The recent slowdown in the economy is in part due to her overdoing the doom and gloom. Means-testing the winter fuel allowance for pensioners was a blunder that has cost her much public goodwill. Her message now that public investment is both good and necessary sits oddly with the decision in opposition to scale back the ambition of Labour’s green investment plan. So this is a big moment for the government and for Reeves personally. Labour had a well-executed plan for gaining power. The budget needs to show increasingly sceptical voters that the party knows what to do with it.",Economic policy; Economic growth (GDP); Economics; Economic recovery; Infrastructure; Rachel Reeves; Budget; Autumn budget 2024; Business; Politics; Government borrowing; Public finance; Tax and spending; Investing,Business
2024-09-25T07:00:22Z,We disrupted the Labour conference because war and climate breakdown were not what Britons voted for | Jack McGinn,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/25/rachel-reeves-speech-protest-war-climate-labour-conference,"On Monday morning, we walked into the main hall of Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool, before the keynote speech of the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. What we did next, you might have seen. Shortly after Reeves began her address, two of us stood to speak out on Labour’s complicity in suspected Israeli war crimes, and the party’s ties to climate-wrecking corporations. We were there on behalf of Climate Resistance, a group campaigning to end the cosy relationship between politics and the fossil fuel industry. Just like arms manufacturers, oil companies have been guilty of hindering democratic processes with donations and lobbying, putting human lives on the line for their own profits. Faced with the assault on Gaza and Lebanon, and the deadly impacts of climate breakdown all over the world, we needed to end the silence. We needed to remind Labour that, until it breaks its ties with these organisations and takes meaningful action, there is no time to celebrate. The booing of our action was anticipated, the manhandling was not. We were removed, arrested and questioned in a police van for an hour, before being driven from the venue and dropped 10 minutes down the road. The landlord of the pub opposite remarked that he wasn’t sure how to feel about the police choosing this spot for dropping detainees after arrest. I was slammed into a wall, the handcuffs made marks and there was unexpected verbal abuse. But it’s important that our rough treatment isn’t the main story to come out of Monday’s disruption. Though we couldn’t hear it at the time, Reeves replied: “This is a changed Labour party. A Labour party that represents working people, not a party of protest.” To say this is to deny the rich history of protest behind the freedoms we take for granted, and the tradition that once gave birth to the Labour party. The roots of the labour movement go back to a time when the 40-hour working week was a pipe dream, unions were banned and women had no vote. As much as the Labour leadership would like to forget this, they are standing on the shoulders of striking workers and trade unionists. From workers’ rights to the end of apartheid, change was never won by sitting and clapping along. On one point, however, Reeves was right. This is a changed Labour party. Today, it is in power and instead of keeping working people as its priority, it is ready to sell its allegiance to the highest bidder. Walking through the conference, it is not hard to see who pays best. Drax, whose power station is the UK’s single largest carbon emitter, features among the sponsors of conference events, alongside the gas company Cadent. This is telling in light of Labour’s decision to uphold dozens of oil and gas licences issued by the Tories, including the controversial Rosebank oil field, and to not act decisively to end the billions of pounds of public money being given to Drax in subsidies. Reeves herself accepted a £10,000 donation from Lord Donoughue, the former chair of a prominent climate-denying thinktank, shortly before she ditched the party’s commitment to spending £28bn a year on green investment. New research by the Campaign Against Arms Trade demonstrates a similarly cosy relationship between the arms industry and the government, with BAE Systems enjoying more ministerial meetings than any other private company between 2012-23. Meanwhile, the government continues to tiptoe around the need for an immediate arms embargo, despite the continuing investigation by the international criminal court into suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity by Israeli leaders, and despite the request of arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant. The Foreign Office recently made headlines cancelling 30 arms licences for Israel, but 90% of the licences still remain in place and British-made components facilitate the bombing of refugee camps in Gaza. In the face of 40,000 civilian casualties, the bombing of schools and hospitals and the looming threat of mass starvation, flashy headlines are not enough. If this is the change we voted for, it looks remarkably like complacency and complicity.

2024-06-13T17:38:51Z,The man behind the manifesto: Labour’s quiet policy chief,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/13/man-behind-manifesto-meet-labour-policy-director-ravinder-athwal-,"For one softly spoken, little-known member of Keir Starmer’s team, it was their chance to shine. Since February the former Treasury economist Ravinder Athwal has been diligently putting together the 136-page Labour manifesto – a lengthy and occasionally fraught process that has put him at the centre of the party’s competing factions. Athwal, a Cambridge economics graduate, joined Labour in 2020 from his previous job as head of growth strategy at the Treasury, where he worked under the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Though he was brought in to head up Labour’s economic policy formation, he impressed so quickly that he was soon promoted to being director of policy and in charge of writing the document that could propel his party to power. “Rav is bright, hard-working and with an eye for detail,” said one person who has worked with him. “He is very fair to staff and politicians alike and he is not seen as factional, which means he has been able to manage the various competing interests within the party.” Those who have worked alongside Athwal describe a quiet and thoughtful colleague. “In every conversation he always asks the pertinent questions,” said one. “He is not showy, just smart and thoughtful.” Athwal’s job in corralling the manifesto has been made easier by the fact that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, two policy-minded politicians, have made most of the big calls themselves. The decision to slash the party’s green investment plans, for example, was taken by the party leader and shadow chancellor months ago as the manifesto-drafting process reached its culmination. Much of Athwal’s job has been to help thrash out agreements between the party’s leaders, shadow cabinet members and union leaders, all of whom have a say in Labour’s policy platform. Occasionally this has meant Athwal having to manage direct conflict, whether on policy towards workers’ rights or on how much to use the private sector to help relieve the burden on the NHS. And while most in Labour testify to the calm way in which he has managed such situations, some say he has on occasion been dismissive of others’ concerns. One insider said he had upset several Labour officials during the party’s tense national policy forum last year – a weekend-long meeting between Labour and trade unions designed to agree the template that would become the manifesto. “He is a bit socially awkward, a bit abrasive and can be patronising at times,” the person said. Others, however, say this has not been their experience of Athwal. “He is very well liked – not just by Keir’s team but across the party,” said another who knows him well. Athwal does not like the spotlight and declined to comment for this article. Nevertheless, he was the man called on Thursday to brief journalists on the manifesto’s fine print. “He has solid political judgment and knows how these things work,” said one colleague. “But most of all there is probably no one else in the Labour party who knows every detail of our policy platform as well as he does.”",General election 2024; Labour; Keir Starmer; Rachel Reeves; Politics; UK news; Manifestos 2024,Politics
2023-05-30T15:20:50Z,Water companies profit as we bathe in apathy | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/water-companies-profit-as-we-bathe-in-apathy,"Your article (Water firm to pay shareholders £300m despite anger over leaks and pollution, 25 May) was very well timed as the water company was having a two-day event in Windermere to “explain” what it was doing. I duly trundled along and asked about the enormous dividend paid by the most polluting water company in England last year. Lo and behold, the main problems lie with Ofwat, which insists that it keeps prices low, and with shareholders, who demand an enormous payout. Then came what was, apparently, the clincher – “We have spent £XYZ million...” – a tactic much loved by Conservative frontbenchers, ie provide a meaningless sum instead of telling us what proportion of the amount that should have been spent was achieved. I suppose I was meant to be grateful that United Utilities is going to open an information centre in Windermere to tell us what it is doing. That money would be better spent reducing pensioners’ bills. The sad thing is that the public appears to bathe in apathy. Perhaps we should resurrect the spirit of the poll tax demonstrators and cancel our direct debits to the water companies. Gwyn Jones Windermere, Cumbria • Your editorial (21 May) drew attention to the failings of privatised water companies and called for change, either by reforming the regulatory framework, or through renationalisation. The 1989 privatisation of the water industry in England and Wales was a response to the failure to invest in maintaining the nationalised industry’s assets. The regulatory regime introduced at that time addressed these problems by creating an independent regulator, Ofwat. For perhaps the first 15 years, it could reasonably be claimed that privatisation had been successful. But more recently, yardstick competition between water companies, enabling Ofwat to set demanding targets based on best practice, has been weakened as ownership has passed increasingly to financial institutions more focused on returns than improving efficiency or service. Incentives for water firms to act responsibly have been weakened as responsibility for monitoring sewage discharges has passed from the Environment Agency (EA) to the firms themselves, while the EA’s environmental protection budget fell by about two-thirds between 2010 and 2019. Reform should involve restoring the EA’s responsibility and resources. Alternative ownership models should also be considered. Welsh Water is a debt-financed, not-for-profit business, whose average household bills fell in real terms between 2000 and 2020. Ian Jones Fownhope, Herefordshire • Re your article (30 water treatment works released 11bn litres of raw sewage in a year, study suggests, 27 May), sewage needs different treatment. Digesters produce methane, which can be used as a “green” fuel, as the methane and CO2 are produced anyway as sewage decomposes. The resulting volume of sewage is vastly reduced and is full of nutrients, which can be used as fertiliser. Care is needed as chemicals and heavy metals may have got into the sewage at source, but there are plants that sequester heavy metals. Obviously this needs major infrastructure, or green investment. The solutions will take a while to put in place, but what else are we going to do – keep swimming in shit? Dr Miles Clapham London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2023-01-12T18:41:37Z,Why net zero tsar’s review is a damning indictment of Tory government,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/12/why-net-zero-tsar-review-is-a-damning-indictment-of-tory-government-chris-skidmore,"Shortly before Christmas, the former energy minister Chris Skidmore announced he would not be standing again as a Conservative MP. He was one of a slew of Tory MPs to do so, amid party turmoil and plunging opinion polls. But unlike his colleagues, he was in a unique position to make his views felt. During her brief premiership, Liz Truss had effectively made him the UK net zero tsar, tasked with writing a comprehensive review of the country’s progress towards achieving the legally binding target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Now Skidmore, one of the co-authors with Truss and the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng of the notorious rightwing Britannia Unchained tract, has delivered a stinging broadside against the government he is leaving. His review argues that the Conservatives have failed on nearly every aspect of net zero policy. Though it is cloaked in polite language, and couched in terms of constructive suggestions rather than hard-hitting new policy demands, there is little in its 320 pages to show the government is on track on any of the wide range of policies needed, on areas from transport to housing, farming to energy generation. “From a former Tory minster, this is a very significant clear-eyed analysis of what is missing from government policy,” said Polly Billington, the chief executive of UK100, a group of local government leaders that campaigns for climate action. “This is a strong critique of the shortcomings on net zero.” Across the areas of policy that are key to meeting emissions target, Skidmore records failure after failure. Renewable energy growth has been hampered by government U-turns and dithering, he notes. Homes are leaking heat because of the government’s refusal to enact insulation programmes, and new ones are still being built with no regard to net zero standards. Land use is confused and farmers are not being helped to make low-carbon choices. Transport policy emerges from this critique as more or less an abject mess, though Skidmore skimps on the recommendations he could have made to rectify it. Yet his review also makes it clear that net zero offers huge economic potential for the UK. Rather than being a cost, as Skidmore’s rightwing colleagues would argue, the review shows in detail how pursuing net zero can bring: green jobs, economic growth to regions in need of levelling-up, health and wellbeing benefits as well as fulfilling the UK’s international climate obligations. Skidmore has said how deep-delving and broad-ranging this review is. He told the Guardian: “The independent review ‘Mission Zero’ is the largest ever engagement with organisations, business and industry on net zero. As the independent chair, I’ve personally listened to over 1,000 individuals and companies in over 50 roundtables held across the country in every region and devolved nation of the UK. The review is as comprehensive as I could make it – with over 130 recommendations in the 330 page report.” He added: “Above all, I hope it demonstrates how to implement and deliver on net zero effectively, efficiently and in the most cost effective way by getting on with the transition. As the report explains, net zero is a huge investment opportunity for the UK and I have sought to set out the positive case for why we should be making it easier to invest in sustainable and renewable energy.” Lord Stern, a global development and climate economist, said the findings pointed to new economic potential for the UK. “[This is] a rigorous, robust, and inclusive review of the evidence on the economics of the UK’s net zero transition, [which argues] convincingly that the transition to a net zero economy is the growth opportunity of the 21st century, and the UK is well-placed to benefit from the increasing demand for net zero goods and services, if it makes the right public and private investments.” He added: “It highlights the critical importance of government creating an environment that is conducive to this investment by providing clarity, certainty, consistency and continuity of policy. This transition, and the investment and innovation it embodies, are at the core of the UK’s growth story for the coming decade.” Campaigners have said they would have liked to see a much harder-hitting set of recommendations across the board: some were disappointed, and felt that Skidmore had pulled his punches. But it would be wrong to under-estimate his work. This is a damning document, by one of the party’s own loyalists, laying bare how badly off track the UK government is on its core climate policy commitment, and how little appetite the government has for seizing the policy and economic opportunities on offer.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Green economy; Renewable energy; Conservatives; Environment,Environment
2024-01-31T13:00:23Z,"UK risks steep decline without £28bn green economy pledge, Labour warned",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/31/business-leader-urges-labour-to-stand-by-28bn-pledge-for-green-economy,"Labour’s proposed investment of £28bn a year in the low-carbon economy is an absolute minimum, a leading business figure has said, adding that without green investment on that scale the UK will face steep decline as a result of crumbling infrastructure and stagnating industry. Jürgen Maier, the former UK head of Siemens, the German industrial giant and major investor, said massive investment was needed to rebuild the UK economy and make it fit for the future, and that it should concentrate on low-carbon energy, transport and industry. “These are the growth areas of the future,” he said. “The £28bn is not a cost, it’s an investment. If you make this investment, business will return to the UK.” Maier is advising Labour on transport and infrastructure, and formerly gave advice to the Conservative government. He said the Tories had turned their back on business and industry, and urged Labour to stand firm on its £28bn commitment. “Do not let populism make you waver,” he told doubters within the party. “This is the right decision for the future of this country, for the future of the communities that rely on these industrial jobs. For them, Labour need to stick to this plan.” The shadow cabinet and Labour’s top advisers are considering whether to alter or even abandon the longstanding pledge to increase public investment in the low-carbon economy to £28bn a year in the second half of the next parliament. The Tory party has made the pledge its key attack line against Labour, claiming that the only way the party will be able to make such investments is by raising taxes. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to attempt to reinforce this by cutting some taxes in the budget in March, further reducing the fiscal headroom an incoming Labour government would have to increase spending, unless it rowed back on his cuts. The Tories also argue that their plans, which include scaling up fossil fuels by issuing more oil and gas licences, are already attracting private sector investment. Private sector investment in the UK’s low-carbon economy since 2010 stands at £200bn, with £30bn of that coming since September, mainly in offshore wind. A government spokesperson said: “This shows huge confidence in the UK, and our plans will see a further £100bn [in private sector investment] by 2030, helping to support up to 480,000 jobs.” A Whitehall source said the government’s roadmaps on industries such as nuclear power, carbon capture and hydrogen were “providing industry with the certainty they need to back low-carbon projects in the UK”. Maier, however, said the government needed to intervene much more in the market to attract the levels of investment needed for a low-carbon economy. He also cast doubt on its current strategy, pointing to the closure of the Port Talbot steelworks despite previous assurances that it would stay open, and failures to invest in the electricity grid, high-speed rail and manufacturing. The Tories “have no credible industrial strategy, no investment and no growth plan. They have turned their backs on industry,” he said. “This transformation [to a low-carbon future] is clearly an area where you need intervention by government.” He pointed to the US, where $369bn (£291bn) of investment in green industry is planned through the Inflation Reduction Act, and EU countries, which are also investing heavily. “This is global money, it’s movable money. Every other advanced industrial nation is taking a different approach,” he said. Maier’s views were backed up by leading economists and business experts, who said that without strong investment in green infrastructure, the UK would fall behind to international rivals, lose out on jobs and experience further economic decay. A paper by Lord Stern and colleagues from the London School of Economics found that government investment of £26bn a year would generate additional private sector investment of twice as much, as well as reducing energy bills, creating jobs and stimulating the economy. Dimitri Zenghelis, the lead author, said: “The direct public finance required to support this transition should not be expected to worsen public debt. Indeed, by facilitating long-term resilient growth, borrowing to invest is the only way to secure enduring public debt sustainability.” Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, said: “Labour has one shot at keeping Britain competitive against the billions that the US, EU and China are ploughing into their low-carbon economy. If Labour wants Britain to regain its international climate leadership, it should keep its promise of green investment. We should take a leaf out of America’s book and ramp up clean, green investments so we can create jobs, lift up our communities and rebuild an economy on its knees.” Andrew Simms, the director of the New Weather Institute, said global examples showed that public investment programmes “more than pay for themselves economically and environmentally, deliver better human health and crowd in other investment”. By contrast, fiscal rules were “made-up economic nonsense” that should not be allowed to stymie much-needed investment in future prosperity. Reneging on the pledge would be “like a person walking into a prison and demanding to be locked up in case they do something good in the world”, he said. Without a large increase in investment, the UK would face further decline, said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance. “The UK has been underinvesting for the last 45 years. The consequences are evident all around us, in failing infrastructure, costly energy and a depleted natural world.” The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) also favours green investment but stops short of endorsing any political plans. “A defining challenge for the next government will be setting out a strategy for boosting the UK’s global competitiveness,” said Tania Kumar, the CBI’s director of net zero policy. “That requires shifting the economy’s focus away from the short-term shock absorption dictated by global events to identifying the big choices and bold moves that can define the next decade.” She said the UK was well-placed to benefit, but that political leaders must set the pace of change. “Global investors will naturally respond to the size of the investment, and ambition here is important,” she said. “But the UK’s pitch must be how it can outsmart, not outspend its competitors. Real clarity on where public funding will unlock investable propositions alongside the market mechanisms to crowd in private finance remains the smart play that can give the UK an edge.”",Green economy; Environment; Economics; Economic policy; Labour; Business; Politics; Renewable energy; UK news,Environment
2022-09-08T05:01:07Z,Oil and gas firms’ green investments fail to match promise of publicity – study,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/08/oil-and-gas-firms-green-investments-fail-to-match-promise-of-adverts-study,"Big oil and gas companies are spending tens of millions publicising their environmental work, while only about a 10th of their investment goes into low-carbon development, a report claims. A comprehensive study of public communications from five oil and gas firms by InfluenceMap, a climate finance thinktank, found that 60% of the publicity made at least one claim highlighting the companies’ positive climate actions. But on average, the five companies devoted only 12% of capital expenditure to low-carbon activities – and this included some gas projects. Less than a quarter of the publicity material highlighted the companies’ fossil fuel activities, InfluenceMap said, which suggested that the companies were spending about $750m a year on communications aimed at burnishing their climate credentials. Researchers looked at 3,421 public communications materials published by BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies in 2021, including articles and blogposts on corporate websites, press releases, reports, speeches and company and CEO social media accounts. The researchers did not look at adverts as it was not possible for them to obtain a full dataset of any company’s global advertising They found that 60% of the publicity material made at least one green claim, with the most popular being centred on efforts to “transition the energy mix”. However, analysis of the capital expenditure of the five companies found that all were forecast to increase their oil and gas production, with the exception of BP, which was expected to have similar levels in 2026 as in 2021. “Essentially, we found that big oil is spending millions of dollars on this green PR, and it is a really systematic campaign to portray themselves as pro-climate,” said Faye Holder, programme manager at InfluenceMap. “But at the same time, they are still lobbying to lock in fossil fuels and investing in a really unsustainable energy future with high levels of oil and gas, and very low spend on low-carbon activities.” None of the “About us” pages on the firms’ websites described them as oil and gas companies, Holder said. “The best instance, in my mind, was BP – on their ‘Who we are’ page, they only mention the word ‘oil’ twice. And it’s at the bottom of the page, under a section called ‘Our history’, where they describe how they have always been a transitioning energy company, from coal to oil to gas to this lower-carbon future. “So it’s really clear they want to dissociate themselves from oil and gas, and attach themselves to this climate agenda.” Shell made the most green claims, with 70% of public communications stressing pro-environmental activities, while just 10% of capital expenditure was invested in low carbon, which included some gas projects, according to InfluenceMap’s report. ExxonMobil made green claims in 70% of its communications, while devoting 8% of capital expenditure to low carbon. For TotalEnergies, 62% of communications made green claims, with 25% of capital investment going towards low carbon. Shell contested the findings, saying InfluenceMap had failed to take into account low-carbon businesses included in its marketing division, including EV charging and low-carbon fuels, and a joint venture in Brazil that is a world-leading bioethanol producer. The company has previously said more than 35% of capital expenditure in 2022 would go towards low-carbon energy, as well as “non-energy products”. “We are already investing billions of dollars in lower-carbon energy,” a spokesperson said. “To help alter the mix of energy Shell sells, we need to grow these new businesses rapidly. That means letting our customers know through advertising or social media what lower-carbon solutions we offer now or are developing, so they can switch when the time is right for them. “The world will still need oil and gas for many years to come. Investment in them will ensure we can supply the energy people will still have to rely on, while lower-carbon alternatives are scaled up.” A spokeperson from TotalEnergies told the Guardian: “Our public announcements policy reflects the transformation of TotalEnergies in a multi-energy company. “As an evidence of this, the InfluenceMap report releases a forecast that ranks TotalEnergies as the frontrunner among the supermajors in terms of renewables assets-based capacities.” A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “ExxonMobil continues to mitigate emissions from its operations and achieved its 2025 emission-reduction plans four years earlier than planned. “This progress supports the company’s more aggressive 2030 emission-reduction plans and its ambition to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from operated assets by 2050. ExxonMobil is investing more than $15bn between now and 2027 on lower-emission initiatives, and we anticipate a tripling of investment by 2025.” Chevron and BP did not respond to requests for comment.",Fossil fuels; Oil; Gas; BP; Shell; Business; Commodities; Energy industry; Oil and gas companies; Advertising; Media; ExxonMobil; Chevron,Environment
2023-06-11T09:59:06Z,Urge to soothe markets may blunt Labour’s edge on Tories,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/11/labour-green-prosperity-plan-fiscal-stability,"Dread of the financial markets is part of the Labour party’s DNA. This primal fear has been passed down the generations. Ramsay MacDonald, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan were all battle-scarred from their vain attempts to defend the pound. Even though the signs point to a big Labour victory at the next election, the mood at the top of the party remains cautious. For months, Rachel Reeves has been on a charm offensive in the City, sending out a message to the bond dealers and currency traders that she will take no risks with the public finances. Now the shadow chancellor has gone a step further. In a scaling back of the party’s green prosperity plan, Reeves has said the promised £28bn investment will not materialise until the second half of the next parliament. It had been assumed the commitment was from year one of a Labour government but, Reeves insists, fiscal stability comes first. Reeves says circumstances have changed since Labour made its pledge two years ago, and she is right about that. Inflation is a lot higher and so are interest rates. It is not just mortgage payers who are being stung by higher borrowing costs: the government is, as well. What’s more, Liz Truss’s short-lived economic experiment last autumn has meant the markets now see the UK as a riskier bet. For a while, the return to financial orthodoxy under Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt brought downmarket interest rates, but signs that inflation will prove harder to shift has caused them to shoot up again in recent weeks. For Reeves and the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, the market turmoil is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it makes a Labour win more likely; on the other it raises an obvious question for the party: if this is what the markets can do to a Tory government then what are they likely to do to us? So Reeves intends to follow the example of Gordon Brown, who in 1997 stuck to the tough plans he inherited from Kenneth Clarke and faced down calls from his own supporters to spend more. This was not a universally popular decision on the left, where expectations were high after 18 years of unbroken Conservative rule. Reeves can expect the same reaction. For a start, there is a big gap between Labour’s rhetoric and what it is actually planning to spend. The £28bn commitment amounts to a little more than 1% of annual national output and is far less ambitious than Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Nor is it all new money. The small print of Labour’s plan makes it clear the commitment involves taking whatever spending Starmer inherits from Sunak and ramping it up to £28bn. As things stand, the net increase in spending will be closer to £20bn. Even that assumes the new timetable is stuck to and not amended as a result of any future crises. There’s a valid argument that even an additional £20bn of immediate extra spending would run into capacity constraints. Even the relatively modest increases Labour is planning would be a stretch for the UK if the spending came on stream immediately. There would be skills shortages, supply bottlenecks and a big surge in imports. After attacking the government for wasting billions of pounds in its response to the Covid pandemic, Labour will need to show that its green prosperity plan offers value for money. Not all state investments are good ones. That, though, is not really what Labour is arguing. Reeves’s case for a gradual build up in spending is much more about hitting fiscal rules and keeping the markets sweet than it is about capacity constraints. Labour does not want to be in the position – as it was in the 1960s and 1970s – of borrowing heavily in the first two years of a parliament only to face a financial crisis that forces retrenchment as the next election approaches. That did for Wilson in 1970 and Callaghan in 1979. It may do for Sunak as well, since his government has got the economic and political cycles badly misaligned. Ideally, governments get all the bad news out of the way early in a parliament. The problem with this approach is twofold. First, by the time Labour gets round to ramping up its green investment, other countries may well have streaked ahead. Second, and far more importantly, Labour is fully on side with the idea that time is running out to deal with the climate crisis. As Reeves herself pointed out, the Office for Budget Responsibility says that delaying action by a decade doubles the cost of transition. Serious action requires serious investment, money on the scale that Biden is providing. It requires governments to make the case for different fiscal rules if the existing ones fail to make a distinction between borrowing that will provide a long-term asset and borrowing for current spending. It requires governments to make the case for green quantitative easing, on the grounds that if money can be created to cope with a financial crisis (2008-09) and a health crisis (2020), why should it not be created to cope with a climate crisis? No question, there is a realpolitik argument for what Reeves has done. She would have a job making the case for turning on the green printing press in the current high-inflation environment. Truss has entrenched the idea that borrowing is bad and governments have to live within their means. But adherence to financial orthodoxy has a cost. With a fair wind, in four years’ time Labour could be spending slightly more on greening the economy than the Conservatives are now. That’s not transformative.

2024-03-30T21:19:11Z,"Conservatives set for worst election result yet, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/30/conservatives-set-for-worst-election-result-yet-research-shows,"The Conservatives are on course for their worst election result, winning fewer than 100 seats, according to a new poll. The seat-by-seat analysis gives the Tories 98 constituencies compared with Labour’s 468, giving Sir Keir Starmer a 286-seat majority, the Sunday Times has reported. The 15,000-person poll, conducted by agency Survation on behalf of Best for Britain, gives Labour a 45% vote share with a 19-point lead over the Conservatives. Rishi Sunak’s party is on track to win 98 seats with none in Scotland or Wales, according to the research. It also suggests the prime minister is at risk of losing his own constituency, the new Richmond &amp; Northallerton seat in North Yorkshire, to Labour with his lead less than 2.5 percentage points. The analysis forecasts that Reform UK will come second in seven seats and achieve an overall vote share of 8.5%, just behind the Liberal Democrats on 10.4% The poll also suggests the Scottish National Party would pick up 41 seats, the Liberal Democrats 22 and Plaid Cymru two. Naomi Smith, Best for Britain’s chief executive, said: “With the polling showing swathes of voters turning their backs on the Tories, it’s clear that this will be a change election.” In 2019 the Conservatives had 365 seats, Labour 203, the SNP 48, the Lib Dems 11 and Plaid four. The findings come after Labour sources said the party’s overall financial position remained strong despite membership subscriptions falling off because donations were healthy and unions were expected to give very substantial backing to the election effort. Labour has suffered more than a 23,000 fall in membership over the past two months after controversies over its policy on Gaza and its U-turn on green investment, according to figures released to its National Executive Committee (NEC). The party’s general secretary, David Evans, revealed that membership, which had stood at 390,000 in January, had plummeted to 366,604 at the latest count, with more than 11,700 of these being in arrears. Labour membership reached a peak at the end of 2019 when it hit more than 532,000. Luke Akehurst, a member of the NEC, said: “Party membership is still at historically high levels. Labour only had 150,000 members at the end of its last period in office [in 2010],” he said. “The state of the opinion polls suggest there is no correlation between membership and electoral popularity.”",Labour; Politics; Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Keir Starmer; UK news; General elections,Politics

2024-06-19T06:26:59Z,Advice to Rachel Reeves: rename the national wealth fund | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/article/2024/jun/19/my-first-piece-of-advice-for-rachel-reeves-rename-the-national-wealth-fund,"Here’s a plea to Rachel Reeves, assuming she is the next chancellor: please give your new national wealth fund a different name. The title is misleading because, whether intentionally or not, it conjures images of a Norway-style sovereign wealth fund – a vehicle to accumulate vast long-term riches for the benefit of today’s citizens and future generations. In reality, Labour’s national wealth fund will be nothing like a sovereign wealth fund, even if it is sometimes misreported as being one. It would be a fine thing if we had such a vehicle but, sadly, the time to launch one was circa 1990, as the far-sighted Norwegians did, when North Sea oil revenues were booming. With the benefit of regular capital injections, plus the wonder of compound returns over long investment horizons, the value of the Norwegian fund is now $1.6tn. That is equivalent to half the UK’s national debt. By contrast, the new national wealth fund will invest a mere £7.3bn over the course of the next parliament – and the cash will come from borrowing. And, unlike a sovereign wealth fund that invests around the globe to spread risk, Labour’s fund will concentrate on a narrow sector of the UK economy. The party’s manifesto details £1.8bn directed at ports, £1.5bn for gigafactories, £2.5bn to clean steel, £1bn for carbon capture and £500m to green hydrogen. Therein lies the real purpose: this is a state-backed vehicle to co-invest alongside private sector companies in order, it is hoped, to accelerate growth in areas related to the green economy. It will be able to take equity stakes, lend directly and underwrite loans. But the core part of the mission is to attract £3 of private investment for every £1 of public investment. That 3:1 ratio looks achievable because it is what the old “green investment bank” (also misnamed, because it wasn’t a bank) achieved before George Osborne, having set it up during the coalition years, shockingly sold it to Macquarie for £1.6bn in 2017. The national wealth fund will be bigger than the green bank but will be similarly aimed at hard-to-finance projects and should also have an arms-length investment manager to impose commercial discipline. One practical challenge will be to ensure the investments are genuinely aimed at additional projects. There is little point in de-risking schemes for the Dubai-backed owner of the Southampton and London Gateway ports, which can stand on its own feet. But backing upgrades to smaller ports so they can handle floating offshore wind installations? Yes, on the right financial terms: that could clearly be worthwhile and have knock-on benefits for UK jobs. A less-clear part is how the fund will avoid stepping on the toes of GB Energy, Labour’s separate creation aimed at energy generation. The lines look blurry. And it’s unclear how the national wealth fund, which won’t make grants, will handle projects that often require straightforward state subsidy – gigafactories and clean steel plants tend to fall into that camp. The advisory taskforce will be crucial in laying down the rules of engagement: it includes Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England; Dame Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of the insurer Aviva; and CS Venkatakrishnan, the chief executive of Barclays. The mood in the business world is cautiously positive, even if Reeves’s claim of hundreds of thousands of new industrial jobs is viewed sceptically. Aside from the pro-growth signal, companies tend to like the idea of a formal structure around public-private partnerships. Smoother processes can make life simpler, which is half the challenge in an era of global competition for green capital. But the name of the fund is still a shocker. A sum of £7.3bn is not blow-the-doors-off, and some schemes may offer only borderline direct returns for the state, whatever the job-creation benefits. A “green transition fund” sounds less exciting, but would avoid anybody thinking the UK is about to be nationally wealthy.",Labour; Business; Rachel Reeves; Politics; UK news,Business
2024-05-07T17:47:15Z,The Guardian view on Labour’s big idea: organising the state effectively matters for jobs and growth | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/07/the-guardian-view-on-labours-big-idea-organising-the-state-effectively-matters-for-jobs-and-growth,"The Labour party has in mind new institutions that will capitalise future-facing industries, create good jobs and see Britain catch up with its peers. That is one message from Rachel Reeves’s speech. Her Labour colleague John Eatwell suggests she is inspired by Alexander Gerschenkron, whose seminal work concludes that the way the state was organised influences its ability to adopt income-enhancing technologies. Many of Labour’s proposals, such as Great British Energy, are welcome. But this column has been sceptical about whether they would meet the scale of the challenges Britain faces without substantial funding or effective mechanisms for socially directing investment. The Bank of England’s role remains particularly unsettling in shrinking the fiscal space available to ministers. Both the opposition and the government hide behind the Bank’s independence. However, MPs on the Treasury select committee raised concerns about whether it was playing a productive economic role this year. They warned that the rapid sale of bonds the Bank purchased through quantitative easing (QE) potentially had “worrying implications for public spending”. The parliamentarians have good reasons to be troubled. On the Bank’s balance sheet, it considers as assets the bonds bought under QE. On the liabilities side of its ledger are the reserve accounts of the commercial banks, which are flush with cash from selling those bonds. The Old Lady pays interest on the reserve accounts. As interest rates rise, the central bank’s outgoings to private banks increase and its returns from bonds decrease. The result is notional losses on the Bank’s accounts. The hole in the Bank’s finances gets bigger as it briskly sells large amounts of bonds for less than it paid for them. Unlike in most other major economies, the Bank’s “losses” are indemnified by the Treasury. This is nonsensical as the central bank cannot go bust. Nevertheless, the economist Daniela Gabor thinks the bailout could cost the taxpayer £230bn by 2033. Meanwhile, private banks are raking in big profits, an unearned jackpot from high rates. Last year the big four high street lenders made £44bn in profits, four times the amount they made in 2020. The Guardian has argued for windfall taxes on banks to repair public services. Gordon Brown, alternatively, thinks banks should be paid less interest on their reserve deposits, as in Europe, to free up funds to fight poverty. The Bank’s monetary policy committee will make headlines this week when it decides whether to cut the base rate. But the committee also has a say on quantitative tightening (QT), which sees the Bank selling more bonds to investors next year than the total sales of gilts to cover government borrowing. Ending the sell-off of bonds – or at least slowing it down as Harriett Baldwin, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, has suggested – would be prudent. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, gave MPs the brush off. Faster QT constrains a government’s spending power while shovelling state cash into private banks. Ms Reeves missed an opportunity to recast the policy. Perhaps she thought doing so would imply a radicalism that undercut the impression of stability she seeks to project. The same concerns saw Labour throttle green investment despite the climate emergency. Economic development is affected by the industries that a central bank promotes. Labour wants a “decade of national renewal”. That won’t happen if the Bank of England is allowed to advance the financial sector at the expense of all others.",Economic policy; Labour; Rachel Reeves; Politics; Banking; Tax and spending; Bank of England,Opinion
2024-07-05T17:00:13Z,Houses and pylons: Labour’s biggest business challenges,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nils-pratley-on-finance/article/2024/jul/05/houses-pylons-labour-biggest-business-challenges,"A landslide victory for Labour was also a satisfactory result for the vigilantes of the bond market. A Conservative administration that served up Liz Truss’s reckless budget of unfunded giveaways in 2022 has been punished. A Labour party promising fiscal discipline, to the point where it ditched a previous flagship £28bn policy on green investment in case it scared the horses, has been rewarded. So, yes, one can see why the UK has suddenly acquired haven-like status in the eyes of financial markets. Unlike the US and France, for instance, international investors now know what they’re getting with the UK: a stable government anxious to demonstrate its market-friendly credentials. Meanwhile, inflation is falling and cuts in interest rates lie around the corner. “We believe UK government bonds (gilts) are attractive at current levels,” said Peder Beck-Friis, an economist at Pimco, the enormous bond fund manager. All that is very helpful for attracting investors, as the incoming chancellor, Rachel Reeves, emphasised throughout the campaign; the big-picture outlook for growth and investment could be worse. Here, though, are two detailed pro-growth targets that look hard to achieve but are central to Labour’s plans. First, the new government wants 1.5m homes to be built in England and Wales in the next five years. Second, it intends to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030. On houses, Labour starts from a position where as few as 150,000 might be built this year, half what it needs for a par annual score for its five-year target. Talk to the executives in the housebuilding sector and many think that the ministers will have done well if they get to the implied annual run rate of 300,000 by the end of parliament. The ingredient that ministers can directly influence is the planning rules. Reeves has called the planning system “the single biggest obstacle to our economic success” and Keir Starmer promised last year to “bulldoze through” the UK’s “restrictive planning system”. The taboo of building on the green belt – or, at least, the “grey” parts of it – will be challenged. So expect a return to local authorities being given mandatory targets for housebuilding, as a first step, and funding for planning officers to follow. Even so, the 1.5m target looks a stretch: supply chains cannot simply be turned on by government diktat. And Labour’s parallel demand for more affordable houses within the mix may cause tensions with big private-sector housebuilders, which dominate the market to a far greater degree than in the 1970s, the last time the UK was building at such a rate. On energy infrastructure, there is at least a blueprint for reform. Nick Winser, the electricity commissioner, delivered his report to the previous government last August. But note the size of the job, even when the Conservatives were pursuing a deadline of 2035. “In Great Britain, around four times as much new transmission network will be needed in the next seven years as was built since 1990,” said Winser’s report. The biggest impediment are blockages created by the “first come, first served” system of allocating hookups to the grid for new wind, solar and battery storage projects. Some developers have been waiting up to 15 years to produce power. The worry is that the system is being gamed by operators who are more interested in selling on a connection rather than building the infrastructure themselves. Ofgem, the regulator, now has rules to kick out such “zombie” schemes but, again, that process does not happen overnight. Now consider the scale of Labour’s ambition on the generating side: double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. Meanwhile, Great British Energy – the state-owned company that will partner with local authorities in local power schemes and with the private sector in novel technologies such as floating off-shore wind – will take time to set up. Nor does its capitalisation of £8.3bn over the life of the parliament sound like gamechanging money when National Grid alone intends to invest £30bn in the same period. Analysts at the investment bank Jefferies think that “Labour’s goal to have a net zero grid by 2030 appears to be an unrealistic target, even with steady progress”. One energy expert it consulted concluded that “even if the new government executed every project in the pipeline, had linear interconnector growth, and electricity demand on the lowest end of the range, the country would still miss the target by 25%.” The 2030 ambition – one of the central manifesto pledges for growth – looks extremely challenging.",General election 2024; Labour; Construction industry; Housing; Energy industry; Business; Politics; Bonds; Energy; Wind power; National Grid; Renewable energy; UK news; Utilities; Environment,Politics
2024-04-03T10:32:16Z,Labour no longer a ‘party of protest’ says shadow minister after drop in members,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/03/labour-no-longer-a-party-of-protest-says-shadow-minister-after-drop-in-members,"Labour has fewer members than it did under Jeremy Corbyn in part because it is willing to make compromises to prepare for government rather than being “a party of protest”, a senior shadow minister has argued. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that “membership numbers of parties go up and down all the time”, and it was not a cause for alarm. At the end of 2019, the party’s membership was more than 532,000. In a report last week to the party’s national executive committee, David Evans, Labour’s general secretary, said it was currently just above 366,600. There had been a drop of 23,000 in the previous two months, despite Labour leading the Conservatives in polls by 20 percentage points or more, with the numbers potentially depressed by concern over the party’s policy on Gaza and the watering down of its £28bn-a-year green investment pledge. Asked about the membership figures, Jones told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “There was also a huge surge in membership of the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn and many Jeremy Corbyn supporters preferred a party of protest as opposed to a party who have had to make difficult decisions around the trade-offs in its preparation for government in the hope that we get to run this country. “We’ve still got plenty of Labour party members across the country, I think more than any other party.” Since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, Labour’s refusal over many weeks to call for a ceasefire led to the resignation of at least 70 Labour councillors. It also triggered a loss of control in four councils: Oxford, Burnley, Hastings and Norwich. At the same time, the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, faced rebellions by many of his own MPs, as well as frontbench resignations. Despite a massive Survation poll earlier this week suggesting Labour could win a majority of 268, with the Conservatives reduced to fewer than 100 seats, Jones told the programme that the party was far from complacent, not least because of the scale of its defeat in 2019. He said: “We do have work to do to win the trust, respect and motivations across the country, not least because we performed so badly under Jeremy Corbyn in 2019, but the scale of the challenge is historic in size, and huge operationally for us to achieve.” Guardian Newsroom: What is Labour’s plan?

2024-07-24T23:01:30Z,"Great British Energy is becoming a reality – bringing with it cheap, clean and secure energy | Ed Miliband",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/25/great-british-energy-ed-miliband-labour-clean-power,"The public voted for change at the general election. Perhaps nowhere more than when it comes to energy. Every person and business has paid the price of our country’s energy insecurity. As Vladimir Putin sought to use energy as a weapon in his illegal invasion of Ukraine, bills went through the roof in a cost of living crisis unprecedented in modern times. As the Climate Change Committee (CCC) recently made clear, there is one obvious answer to preventing us being so exposed again – a sprint for homegrown clean energy. As it said in its progress report to parliament last week: “British-based renewable energy is the cheapest and fastest way to reduce vulnerability to volatile global fossil-fuel markets. The faster we get off fossil fuels, the more secure we become.” Britain was left horribly exposed by years of underinvestment in its own supply and an overdependence on fossil fuels. With energy bills due to rise again in the autumn, according to independent forecasts, because of fossil-fuel prices, the challenges we face have not passed. The only way to protect ourselves as a country for the long term is to deliver cleaner, cheap, homegrown energy – boosting our energy independence, creating jobs and tackling the climate crisis. That is why our mission to make Britain a clean-energy superpower, with a fully decarbonised power system by 2030, is so important – and there is not a moment to lose. Within a week of coming to power, the new government lifted the onshore windfarms ban, appointed the former head of the CCC, Chris Stark, to drive forward that clean-energy target, announced a rooftop solar-panel revolution and established a new national wealth fund with the chancellor for green investment. Today, we take the next steps. What was also clear from the election is how much the British people understood the case for Great British Energy, our new publicly owned energy company. In post-election polling by the organisation More in Common, Great British Energy enjoyed the support of 73% of all voters and 56% of 2024 Conservative voters. People recognise that this innovation can help drive cheaper, cleaner energy, create good jobs and growth, and generate wealth for the country. It is what our European neighbours have been doing for decades. A pragmatic, dynamic state partnering with the private sector to deliver for families and businesses. To accelerate the action we need and make good on our election mandate, today we have introduced our legislation for Great British Energy and published an update statement for the organisation – and the prime minister is announcing an unprecedented partnership between Great British Energy and the crown estate. The two organisations are coming together for the benefit of the nation with a new division called Great British Energy: The Crown Estate. The crown estate, which has a £15.5bn portfolio of land and seabed, and returns its profits to the government, will bring its long established expertise, having enabled the UK to be a world leader in offshore wind. It will also have access to new borrowing powers recently announced by the government. As a publicly owned company, Great British Energy will provide the link to the government’s strategic industrial policy objectives of investing in supply chains for the country. This new partnership will help accelerate the deployment of the clean energy we need, help create good jobs in our country and generate wealth for the taxpayer. It is an exemplar of the difference Great British Energy can make, working with the private sector to deploy new technologies. Currently, it can take years before a company can move its clean-energy project forward. Great British Energy will co-invest in new technologies, attracting private funding in areas including floating offshore windfarms, tidal power and hydrogen. It will also have the power to scale and accelerate mature technologies such as wind, solar and nuclear, partnering with existing private sector firms to speed up their deployment and meet ambitious timelines for delivery. It will also work to scale up community energy projects – partnering with energy companies, local authorities and cooperatives to develop up to 8GW of small- and medium-scale projects. Great British Energy will prove the case for 21st-century, modern public ownership – a dynamic state in partnership with workers, industry and unions, serving communities with cheap, clean and more secure energy, and we’re doing it in a way that will deliver economic prosperity to every home, business and community across the UK. The new government is under no illusions about the scale of the challenge we face. This is a long-term plan, not a quick fix, but we believe we can galvanise the whole country behind this mission.

2024-06-10T13:36:42Z,Lib Dems launch election manifesto with pledge to ‘save the NHS’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/10/lib-dems-launch-election-manifesto-with-pledge-to-save-the-nhs,"The Liberal Democrats have become the first of the big parties to launch their election manifesto, with a pitch to voters based on boosting the NHS and social care. They also said that – unlike those of Labour and the Tories – their plans were fully costed. Speaking at a glitzy launch event in north London, the party’s leader, Ed Davey, told voters that electing enough Lib Dem MPs would bring “a strong liberal voice pushing for these policies” and could make a notable difference even with an expected Labour majority. The 116-page manifesto has been launched alongside a costings document, which pledges increased capital gains tax for very wealthy people, plus new levies on aviation, energy companies and banks. Davey said this would pay for policies particularly focused on health and care, including guarantees about seeing GPs and dentists, free-to-access social care and more mental health support. “We are putting forward a bold, ambitious and fully costed plan to tackle the healthcare crisis from top to bottom. This is a manifesto to save the NHS,” Davey told an audience of journalists and Lib Dem candidates and staffers. As well as a series of green pledges, including an urgent programme of home insulation and retrofitting, and policies on the cost of living, such as a pledge on free school meals, the manifesto also takes in traditional Lib Dem areas such as political reform and Europe. On the first, Davey said he hoped to “transform the nature of British politics itself”, both by introducing a proportional representation voting system, and by capping donations and thus “getting big money out of politics”. On Brexit, while the Lib Dems’ primary pledge in the 2019 election was to annul the departure from the EU without a second referendum, the 2024 manifesto does not mention the issue until more than 100 pages in. However, scattered through the manifesto are a series of EU-facing policies, including a pledge to expand freedom of movement for young people and returning to the Erasmus scheme for overseas study within the bloc. Quizzed by reporters, Davey said that while rejoining the EU remained the party’s goal “in the long term”, this would only ever be done in stages, starting with moves to improve the existing trade deal with Europe – something the manifesto said would boost the economy. “You can’t have a timeline – you’ve got to rebuild that relationship,” he said. As the party released a document setting out its costings, it challenged the other main parties to do the same. They have been criticised for engaging in a “conspiracy of silence” over the scale of the economic challenge ahead. The document says the Lib Dems could raise £26.9bn from measures including overhauling capital gains tax to raise £5.2bn for the NHS by 2028-29, as well as a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies and reversing tax breaks on bank profits. However, more than 25% of the total is made up of a planned £7.2bn to be saved by tackling tax avoidance and evasion, a financial source also cited by Labour and the Conservatives, but one experts have warned is difficult to harness. The document also sets aside a planned average of £19.7bn a year in capital investment, which does not sit within the costings calculation, including £6.2bn for 150,000 new social homes a year, and £8.4bn for green investment. The Lib Dems say they would also reform aviation taxes on international flights, raising a planned £3.6bn. They said families flying abroad one or twice a year would pay less, while those who travelled three times would pay about the same. Those who took four or more flights abroad a year – less than 4% of the population, many of them on business flights – would pay more. The party hopes this could eventually encourage fewer flights. Davey has already ruled out any increase in income tax, national insurance or VAT, but party sources insisted they were taking a “cautious” approach to their costings, which did not include the benefits of growth.",Liberal Democrats; General election 2024; UK news; Politics; Ed Davey; General elections; Manifestos 2024,Politics
2024-02-03T19:23:40Z,Labour ditches radical reforms as it prepares ‘bombproof’ election manifesto,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/03/labour-ditches-radical-reforms-as-it-prepares-bombproof-election-manifesto,"Labour is planning only limited first-term reforms of social care and the House of Lords and a smaller green investment plan as part of a stripped-down general election manifesto, as it seeks to make its policies “bombproof” to Tory attacks. Shadow cabinet ministers have been given until 8 February to make policy submissions for the manifesto, as Keir Starmer’s party gears up for an election that, according to opinion polls, looks likely to return it to government for the first time since 2010. A committee of shadow ministers and officials will then assess which commitments will require legislation in a king’s speech that will be delivered within weeks of entering office. The party intends to have both documents ready by mid-March, in case Rishi Sunak calls an early spring poll. The Observer understands that as well as backing away from its £28bn a year commitment on green investment (while sticking to the overall drive to achieve clean energy by 2030), Labour will not seek to legislate on the creation of a new national care service in its first king’s speech. Instead, it will focus on a fair pay agreement for care workers as well as issues of recruitment and retention, as part of a wider workers’ rights bill. Its plans for a complete overhaul of social care will, however, be presented as a longer-term mission taking at least 10 years and two parliaments. In addition, despite Keir Starmer’s previous promises to abolish the Lords in a first term, it is expected to commit only to limited changes. This is likely to mean legislating only for the abolition of the remaining 91 hereditary peers. Labour’s cautious approach – which is frustrating some MPs and party members – is partly the result of uncertainty about the economic situation it will inherit and what can be afforded. But shadow ministers are also determined to offer as small a target as possible to the Tories on issues such as social care, which in the past have turned election campaigns upside down. In 2010, Labour’s care plans were branded a “death tax” by the Conservatives, and hit the party’s vote badly, while in 2017 Theresa May’s campaign suffered irreparable damage amid accusations she was planning a “dementia tax”. On social care, Starmer’s party has rallied the unions behind its more gradual approach. Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, told the Observer: “Care is in crisis and the need for a national service has never been greater. But the sector is complex and, with many thousands of care employers, creating a new system isn’t a five-minute job. “In stark contrast to the litany of broken promises from this government, Labour is committed to reforming care. Under the proposed fair pay agreement, wages will rise and care workers earn the same no matter where they work in England. “Care jobs will immediately become more attractive, and the sector be able to start filling the huge hole in its workforce. That will boost support to everyone needing care and begin to lift the pressure on the NHS.” With its green prosperity plan now being talked down, Labour’s new “flagship” policy is increasingly seen as its new deal for working people, which involves handing workers new rights from their first day of employment, as well as the abolition of zero-hours contracts. The deal, fiercely guarded by deputy leader Angela Rayner, also includes a ban on “firing and rehiring”. Another bill that is likely to be prioritised will be a “fiscal lock” that will force government to submit all tax and spending plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility for its judgment before pressing ahead. The aim is to contrast Labour’s commitment to fiscal discipline with the disastrous decision-making of the Liz Truss government, which caused near panic on financial markets. Elsewhere, Labour’s pledge to roll out breakfast clubs to every primary school in England, funded by the abolition of non-dom tax status, remains prominent in the manifesto. There are also hopes internally that a big childcare pledge could form part of Labour’s programme in a first term, with the party keen on expanding the number of nurseries attached to primary schools to tackle a huge shortage of places and staff. The former Ofsted head, Sir David Bell, is studying the issue for Labour, but is unlikely to report in time for an election before the autumn. The party’s pledge to raise more tax from private equity managers has also come in for scrutiny. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has vowed to raise the amount charged on profits they earn on deals, to match the 45p top rate of income tax. However, some in the party are said to be keen to water down the plan, fearful of deterring investment and denting Labour’s pledge to make the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of developed countries. Party sources insisted the plan remained to tax such profits as income. The manifesto will also make much of a pledge to build 300,000 homes a year – a target in the last Conservative manifesto that has not been achieved. Starmer’s willingness to take on those who want to prevent any building on “greenfield” sites is used by Labour insiders to show the Labour leader is willing to take on potentially difficult battles, rather than always take a cautious path.",Labour; Politics; UK news; Keir Starmer; Social care; House of Lords; Green politics; Public finance; Society,Politics
2024-09-24T05:00:30Z,Labour has been overdoing the doom and gloom – but now Reeves has given us a glimpse of sunshine | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/24/labour-doom-gloom-rachel-reeves-sunshine-freebies-conference,"With the hail of bad freebie stories echoing the Mersey downpour, this looked set to be a less joyous conference than was due a party that had just gone from its worst defeat since 1935 to a stunning majority in one jump. But that victory was still in the air: the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, boasted there are more female Labour MPs than all the Tories on the opposition bench put together; and time and again people assail you with astonished tales of their local forever-Tory seat gone Labour – East Thanet, Hertford and Stortford. However, there is no escaping it: the freebies scandal soured the opening atmosphere. The FT splashed that public confidence and spending was spiralling down after the “‘Things will get worse’ before they get better” foreboding from Keir Starmer. No one disputes that Labour inherited a country in an abysmal state, but with too much “no jam today” it overdid the workhouse gruel. One wise headteacher told me that Labour’s task felt to her like taking over a failing school. And with polls sinking, the urgent task was to cast out fear with a breath of hope. Waiting for the budget has become like waiting for Godot. With all ministers banned from announcements until budget day, still weeks away, media malice fills the void. Every seasoned politician should know this rule: feed the beast before it eats you. Senior Labour insiders admit they were unprepared for the gale-force daily onslaught: they lack an effective rebuttal attack dog to fight back every minute of the 24-hour clock. Reeves’ task was to lift the despondency and let the sun shine in, and she did. She dispelled the fear that austerity 2.0 was on its way: no real-terms cuts to government spending she said. Talk of economic “pain” without saying who was due to get it in the neck left people assuming that everyone was in for same the treatment as will be meted out to pensioners above pension credit level. But Reeves has always said it would not fall on “working people”. And those listening hardest will know that the burden is for those “broadest shoulders” that Starmer mentioned in his rose garden speech. Reeves picked up this thread when she blasted tax evaders and avoiders, announcing more tax inspectors: Labour is expected to raise billions from abolishing the tax reliefs and loopholes that amount to the secret welfare state for the well off. That will be popular. Is there a theme? Reeves doesn’t quite have a definable -ism. She points to the prize, the vision, the light at the end of the tunnel, with sunlit uplands of green growth and fairer prosperity. She walloped the Tories and promised the possible with a passion utterly unfamiliar to the Treasury these past 14 years. Her rhetoric and reason was greeted with delight: it’s the best chance for recovery in a country battered by atrocious government. With a precarious victory teetering on a 34% vote, there is much talk of trust. Reeves doesn’t just speak of shovels in the ground and cranes reaching the sky, but of rebuilding fragile trust in politics as a force for good. That has been a goal of Starmer’s Labour from the beginning, but it has become trickier territory after free football and Taylor Swift tickets, hospitality and holidays. People are used to Tory snouts in the trough, and grandees such as David Cameron or Owen Paterson being paid walloping sums by firms while at the same time lobbying their colleagues. Reeves is hotly pursuing the Tories’ disputed £674m in Covid contracts. But higher standards are expected of Labour, with no shock absorbers for any improprieties: as ministers were sent out with toe-curling excuses, calling it “within the rules” only made it plain to most people that the rules are wrong. It was days too late when Starmer pledged they will refuse all gifts in future. He needs to go much further. His deputy, Angela Rayner, hinted at it obliquely to Laura Kuenssberg, mentioning “a national debate about how we fund politics”. Starmer said as dawn broke on his first morning as prime minister, “The fight for trust is the battle that defines our age.” After last week’s disclosures, Labour will need to try harder to regain the high ground. It must use this moment to clean up politics by purging dark money, ending big donations and the fundraising arms race. Britain sucks up more private political money than similar countries, where public funding is the price for putting democracy above suspicion. Who knows what donors expect in influence or reward? Unaccustomed sums flowed to Labour in the final weeks of the campaign once it was clearly headed for power. Surely sincere well-wishers would have donated when the money was most needed: 90% of people think MPs “very often” or “sometimes” act according to their donors’ wishes. It doesn’t require a mea culpa for Starmer to decide politics needs a total cleansing of cash to regain public trust. Labour will have regained impetus this week, with that row receding. But it did distract attention from intense fringe discussions of policies in progress. “We’ve been busy,” said Rayner, listing what Labour has set out in its first 80 days: taking rail into public ownership, founding Great British Energy, reviving onshore wind, new trade union and working rights, rights for renters, planning reform to speed housebuilding, a national wealth fund for green investment, more teachers, no one-word Ofsted damnations, and a child poverty review that can only end in more money for children. There’s much more than fits this space, and it’s impressive. But only bold strokes are visible to most voters. A poll on Tuesday showed Labour hemorrhaging support to Greens and Lib Dems. According to Prof Rob Ford, this is a far greater risk than losses to Farage, who has already taken the relatively few he’s likely to get from Labour. That should urge Reeves to focus on the left flank: abolishing the two-child benefit cap would be a totemic down payment. The art of politics requires a bit of wizardry and this government has been learning on the job, sometimes the hard way. Many people, say the polls, will give Labour only a year to keep blaming the Tories, so it must act fast – as voters notoriously lack patience. Labour’s “Don’t panic!” Lance Corporal Joneses will have been reassured and enthused by Reeves’s hopeful speech, and more uplift will come on Tuesday from the prime minister. Never mind the polls now: Thatcher tanked in her first years – and it’s a very long time until the next election.

The Conservatives have been involved in a fresh bout of leadership speculation over the past week, after rumours surfaced of a plot to dump Sunak and replace him with Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House, before the next election. But Opinium found that of the four most likely replacements for Sunak, were there to be a contest – Mordaunt, James Cleverly, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, and Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary – only Mordaunt would have any positive effect at all on the Tory vote. And even then, the “Mordaunt bounce” would only be marginal and still end in a large defeat. When asked if voters would prefer a Tory government led by Sunak or a Labour one led by Starmer, Opinium found that Labour under Starmer would have a lead of 18 points. If Mordaunt were to lead the Tories against Starmer, Labour would be 15 points ahead. This would still mean a sizeable majority in the House of Commons. But if Braverman or Badenoch were to lead the Tories, the Labour lead would be even more, increasing to 24 points, and with Cleverly in charge it would go up to 21 points. Overall, when asked which party they intended to vote for, without citing current or potential leaders, Labour’s lead remained unchanged from a fortnight ago at 16 points. Labour is on 41%, the Conservatives 25%, Reform 11%, the Liberal Democrats 10%, and the Greens 8%. The poll comes as Labour today claims that a clear majority of 2019 Tories (61%, according to its own polling) now support its plan for a new state run company, Great British Energy, which it says would secure the country’s energy independence and bring down prices. Despite having recently abandoned their plans to spend £28bn a year on green investment, Starmer and shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband will this week promote the party’s scaled-back ideas on the latest of Starmer’s missions tours, focusing on its aim to turn the UK into a “clean energy superpower”. Miliband said it was encouraging that so many 2019 Tories were now supporting Labour’s energy and green policies. “The Conservative party’s opposition to a publicly owned energy company is shortsighted and self-destructive. Even their own voters know it is preposterous that the governments of other countries profit from our energy system while British families struggle with rising bills.”",Conservatives; Conservative leadership; Rishi Sunak; Penny Mordaunt; Suella Braverman; James Cleverly; Labour; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-07-28T05:00:46Z,The Observer view: sticking to fiscal rule will imperil Labour’s future | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/28/the-observer-view-sticking-to-fiscal-rule-will-imperil-labours-future,"Britain’s public finances are in a desperate state. That is the key message the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will deliver in a speech on Monday, which she will use to draw attention to a £20bn black hole in the tax and spending plans bequeathed to her by the last government. Critics will say that this should not be news; it was patently obvious that the Conservatives cooked the books before the last election, baking in impossible-to-achieve spending cuts in order to make their plans for the next five years seem plausible. That did not stop Labour adopting the Tories’ projections as its baseline, because it suited the party politically. However, Reeves would be entirely correct in arguing that the unenviable inheritance is as much a product of Conservative neglect and incompetence as it is of external shocks, and that Labour could not know the full extent of the fiscal gap until it was in government and had the opportunity to examine the books carefully. The most important question is what she will do about it. She faces a toxic mix: an economy characterised by sluggish productivity growth, weakened by decades of insufficient business investment, and made worse by the uncertainty, and the trade barriers, occasioned by Brexit. Meanwhile, Britain’s public services are in urgent need of investment: from the NHS, plagued by record waiting lists, to schools struggling to close the attainment gap between poor pupils and their peers that was widening even before the pandemic, to services for vulnerable adults and children struggling to meet demand. There are examples of crumbling infrastructure everywhere, from railways and roads to hospitals and schools. Child poverty has risen as a product of cuts in financial support to low-income parents. Pay bodies have reportedly recommended a 5.5% pay rise for public sector workers, estimated to cost an extra £10bn a year. A record proportion of working-age people are economically inactive. There are also significant one-off costs to the state, which have not been properly accounted for, that will fall due in the next few years, including compensation in the Post Office and infected blood scandals. There are worrying reports that Reeves’s planned response involves cutting back on infrastructure investment, including in new roads and hospitals. The argument for doing so is that such inherited commitments are “unfunded, with unfeasible timelines”. It may be true that they have not been properly accounted for, but the last thing the economy needs is further reductions in the public investment critical to encouraging the private investment that is so important to boosting growth. While in opposition, Labour already scaled back green investment plans in a way that significantly reduced its public investment plans. To react to this fiscal crunch by cutting public spending – both capital investment and current – is the wrong approach macroeconomically. It risks making the problem worse: depressing growth further, and reducing tax revenues and hence the resources available to improve public services. The economy will not sufficiently grow while people sit for months on NHS waiting lists unable to work; while children from poorer backgrounds are held back from achieving their full potential at school; and while the housing market is so dysfunctional that lack of affordability prevents people taking up economic opportunities. There are two other options available to Reeves other than cutting spending. First, she must look to increase tax revenues in her autumn budget by addressing the fact that the wealthiest find it all too easy to avoid wealth taxes. As we report this weekend, the Resolution Foundation estimates that scrapping reliefs that allow wealthy people to unfairly minimise their inheritance tax bills would raise an extra £2bn a year. Aligning the rate of capital gains tax on shares and dividends with the equivalent income tax rate on earned incomes for employees, even while indexing further increases to inflation, would raise up to £7.5bn a year. The proceeds of these taxes should be earmarked for alleviating child poverty, including but not limited to lifting the two-child benefit cap. Over the longer term, Labour should look at council tax: it is the main form of property taxation in the UK, yet the average effective tax rate for properties worth £500,000 is less than half that for those worth £100,000. Second, the unfunded liabilities that Labour will have to meet justify a reconsideration of Reeves’s fiscal rule that the government debt to GDP ratio must be falling in five years. By accepting this arbitrary rule in opposition, she effectively adopted the Conservative macroeconomic worldview: that growth can be achieved alongside fiscal conservatism. But this approach comes with significant risks; a failure to borrow prudently to invest consigns the UK to sluggish growth for at least another decade. Labour’s electoral strategy was hyper-cautious, shaped by the need to convince the public it could be trusted with the public finances. The problem is that if Keir Starmer and Reeves remain as risk-averse in government as they were in opposition, the approach that delivered them a handsome and well-deserved majority could end up impeding them from making enough difference to the country to convince voters to endorse them in five years’ time.

2024-02-11T18:30:23Z,Starmer and Reeves should listen to Brown’s call for action on child poverty | Letters ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/11/starmer-and-reeves-should-listen-to-browns-call-for-action-on-child-poverty,"I urge Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves to listen to Gordon Brown, our best Labour chancellor in recent times (Tables without food, bedrooms without beds. Grinding child poverty in Britain calls for anger – and a plan, 8 February). Not just listen and nod, but ask him for help in their plans for government. Labour might appear to be heading for a victory, but they need to be shouting about what they can and will do, not what they no longer plan to do (Starmer to announce scaling back of £28bn green investment plan, 7 February). Otherwise, the Tory press will continue to paint the party in terms of U-turns and dithering, making Labour appear indecisive and not committed to change. I fear that Reeves is wearing a banker’s hat and putting “fiscal prudence” and “growth” ahead of simple Labour values that get my vote: taxing the rich to feed the poor, and ensuring benefits look after those least able to fund themselves. Brown’s article shows the way. Susan Treagus Manchester • Gordon Brown rightly calls out the wall of silence around poverty. In calling for action to address this, he refers to the plight of children in Kirkcaldy (Gordon Brown slams ‘obscene’ levels of destitution in the UK, 8 February). So why no mention of the £25-a-week-per-child Scottish child payment that the Scottish government introduced to mitigate the dangerously low levels of welfare benefits mandated by the UK government? Could it be that, due to Labour’s hopes of denting the SNP majority in Scotland, Brown is also turning efforts to fix poverty into “a question of ideology” rather than “a question of decency”? Those destitute families deserve more than charitable efforts to redistribute waste products. They deserve an honest appraisal of the efforts that their government has made to protect them from the worst impacts of Westminster’s cruel policies. Shelagh Young Edinburgh • In Gordon Brown’s clarion call for action on child poverty, he refers to children without beds. I would ask the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to read Charles Causley’s great poem Timothy Winters. Written after the second world war, it is a tragedy that it still resonates today. The final verses should touch any heart.

2024-07-25T04:00:39Z,Starmer to pledge to develop enough offshore wind to power 20m homes,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/25/offshore-wind-to-power-20m-homes-within-five-years-starmer-to-pledge,"Keir Starmer will promise to build enough offshore wind turbines to power 20m homes by using taxpayer money to develop parts of the seabed owned by the crown estate. The prime minister will announce details of the government’s energy generation company, known as Great British Energy, during a visit to the north-west designed to highlight the government’s promises on green energy. The energy company will be given £8.3bn of public money over the course of the parliament to invest in green technologies, with a target of 20-30GW of new offshore wind developments reaching seabed lease stage by 2030. Ministers are hoping that investment will help persuade companies to spend another £60bn in an attempt to hit the government’s target of decarbonising Britain’s power sector by 2030. Starmer said: “This innovative partnership between Great British Energy and the crown estate is an important step toward our mission for clean energy by 2030, and bringing down energy bills for good. “This agreement will drive up to £60bn in investment into the sector, turbocharging our country toward energy security, the next generation of skilled jobs, and lowering bills for families and business.” “This new partnership will help accelerate the deployment of clean energy we need, help generate good jobs in our country and generate wealth for the taxpayer.” Labour is also in discussions with the Scottish government and the devolved management of the crown estate in Scotland about support for local projects. Great British Energy forms the centrepiece of the government’s green agenda, under which ministers are promising to deliver clean power by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. The company is modelled on nationalised energy champions such as EDF in France or Sweden’s Vattenfall, though it will not have anything like the spending power of either. It will be created through an act of parliament, which the government hopes will be passed and enacted within months. While GB Energy will ultimately invest in a range of cutting-edge technologies such as carbon capture, tidal power and small nuclear reactors, its initial focus will be on offshore wind. Under the plan being launched on Thursday, the company will spend money on activities such as scoping out the seabed and making sure there are connections to the onshore grid to allow private developers to build thousands of new turbines at pace. The publicly owned company will then keep a stake in the project, using the proceeds either to return money to the government or to invest in further energy projects in the future. Some of the returns however will be used to fund the royal family, which the crown estate was set up for. Even without Thursday’s announcement, the crown estate already had a target to begin the development of 20 and 30GW of additional offshore wind power by 2030 – more than double what the UK has already installed. Officials say, however, that without the additional funding and expertise provided by GB Energy it is unlikely to be able to hit that target. In an article for the Guardian, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “The crown estate, which has a £16bn portfolio of land and seabed and returns its profits to the government, will bring its long-established expertise having enabled the UK as world leader in offshore wind and the new borrowing powers recently announced by government. “Great British Energy will bring the strategic industrial policy that the state can provide, as well as its own ability to invest.” While in opposition, Labour promised to spend £28bn a year on green investment, but reduced that ambition by half as it came under pressure not to promise anything that might require higher taxes. The move disappointed many green experts, economists and industrialists when Rachel Reeves announced the cut early this year. She was determined to avoid accusations of “tax and spend”, despite the verdict of economists that borrowing for these purposes would generate money in the medium term. However, the government’s deal with the crown estate, which will have new powers to borrow money and invest, allows Miliband to sidestep some of the Treasury’s strict public finance rules. Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “The involvement of the crown estate could be an interesting way of getting round Treasury limitations. The crown estate is already a trusted body in the green energy space, with relationships already with many developers, bringing some certainty to investments.” Officials are also hoping the link to the royal family will help win support for the new scheme from even Conservative voters, saying they want to ensure the institution is seen as non-partisan and therefore survives any future change of government. Mathew Lawrence, the head of the thinktank Common Wealth, said: “By giving it greater planning and investment scope, the [deal with the crown estate] will help supercharge GB Energy and develop homegrown clean power.” But he also urged ministers to allow the company to supply customers directly, something the government has so far ruled out. “By adding a retail option, so that GB Energy can supply households directly, we can ensure the benefits of the deal are passed directly on to households,” he said. • This article was amended on 31 July 2024. An earlier version said that Labour was to pledge that 20-30GW of wind power developments would be completed by 2030. In fact, the pledge is for the developments to have the relevant seabed licences in place by that year.",Energy; Wind power; Environment; Renewable energy; Crown estate; Keir Starmer; Politics; UK news,Environment
2024-02-18T11:56:36Z,To revive Britain from recession the next government must get growth right | Richard Partington,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/18/to-revive-britain-from-recession-the-next-government-must-get-growth-right,"Britain’s economy is in a deep rut. After news confirming the country fell into recession late last year, most experts agree the downturn is likely to be shortlived and shallow. Few, though, are betting on a strong recovery from the toughest period for living standards in almost 70 years. In most of the economic cycles of the past century, robust growth has typically followed each period of recession, as households and businesses get back on their feet after each setback. But as highlighted by Matt Whittaker of the Pro Bono Economics thinktank, the past two decades have been different. Gross domestic product per capita has either fallen or flatlined for the past seven quarters, and it is now 16 years since the last sustained uptick came to an end. For whoever wins the next general election, making sure Britain can escape this quagmire ought to be the top priority. After more than a decade and a half of flatlining progress, capped by the current cost of living crisis, poverty levels have risen sharply. The proceeds of what little growth has been eked out are unevenly spread and geographically imbalanced, while the UK is slipping behind comparable advanced nations. To revive the sputtering engine of the economy, the next government will, however, need to keep in mind the kind of growth Britain would benefit from most. The plan will need two priorities in particular: tackling the inequalities entrenched over the past decade, and ensuring the biggest challenge of all – the climate crisis – is addressed. So far there is reluctance among political leaders to set out a clear roadmap, with Rishi Sunak promising tax cuts that would fail on the first priority while increasingly hacking away at policies that could help address the second. The prime minister had promised in the first weeks of his premiership to turn Britain into a “clean energy superpower”. Since then, however, Sunak has rowed back on net zero policies and leaned into anti-green politics to pacify the right of his party. Keir Starmer has also staged a managed retreat, having scaled back Labour’s £28bn green investment plan out of fear the Tories could weaponise it in the election campaign. At the heart of both is a common theme: affordability. The fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, Covid pandemic, Brexit and the cumulative drag on productivity from more than a decade of Tory underinvestment has indeed taken its toll on the exchequer, as has spiralling demand from an ageing population. The government’s budget deficit is historically high, while the national debt has risen to the highest level since the 1960s. However, it also plays on two falsehoods. First, that inaction is cost-free. This is patently untrue, as the past 15 years of underinvestment have shown, laying the ground for our current weak economic performance. The consequences of the climate crisis are also becoming clearer and costlier for households and businesses. And second, that leaving the private sector alone to kickstart growth and manage the climate transition would be cheaper. The cost of investing in new technologies does not magically vanish in the private sector. Instead of being borne on the government balance sheet – paid for mostly through taxation – the household balance sheet picks it up instead, in the prices charged for utilities, goods and services. As a paper from the leftwing Common Wealth thinktank last week showed, state-led investment in clean energy could be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent, primarily through the difference in cheaper borrowing costs that nations enjoy over corporate borrowers, helping households to save money on their bills. Investing in the climate transition could also help kickstart economic growth, creating the jobs and industries of the future. The report set out the case for a more ambitious plan for Labour’s Great British Energy, the party’s publicly owned clean energy generation company. According to the report, Labour’s initial £8.3bn capitalisation of GB Energy could save between £125m and £208m a year on debt interest costs each year compared with equivalent borrowing in the private sector – saving up to £1bn in total. While Starmer cut back Labour’s overall £28bn investment plan, the decision to keep and prioritise GB Energy is an important move. Plenty of details over its operation still need clarifying. And it could be more ambitious. But a publicly owned firm investing in renewable energy could help optimise the transition to net zero. One criticism would be that the state lacks the knowhow big energy companies possess, or would be less efficient than the private sector, adding to the cost of energy generation. However, it is increasingly clear the market alone is failing to deliver, as some of the wealthiest energy firms in history funnel profits into investor payouts rather than renewables. Over the last two years energy companies have benefited from a boom in prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing what ought to be a powerful war chest for the green transition. But analysis by the IPPR thinktank shows that BP and Shell alone handed £32.6bn back to their investors in 2022 through dividends and share buybacks – 11 times more than the £2.9bn they invested in renewables. In a world of rising supply chain costs, geopolitical shocks and higher borrowing costs on financial markets, a state-backed firm could help de-risk the cost of renewables projects for private firms by co-investing alongside them. It makes even more sense when the approach is already the norm in Britain – only with companies owned by overseas governments rather than our own. Figures from Common Wealth show 42.2% of the installed capacity from operational and under-construction windfarms in the UK is owned by foreign public entities, including state-owned enterprises and public pension funds. Such is the lack of our own involvement that the UK government owns less of that capacity (0.03%) than the city of Munich does (0.85%) through its stake in the Gwynt y Môr windfarm off the north Wales coast. The next government will have choices to make. Powering up economic growth could be helped by a step-change in green investment. Rather than holding back amid fears over affordability, it’s the cost of inaction that would hurt more.",Recession; UK cost of living crisis; Climate crisis; Energy industry; Economics; Business; Inequality; Keir Starmer; Rishi Sunak; Wind power; Renewable energy,Business
2024-02-02T17:04:09Z,"Labour scrapping £28bn green pledge could leave UK colder, sicker and poorer",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/02/labour-scrapping-green-pledge-leave-uk-colder-sicker-poorer,"Colder, damper, sicker, poorer and less employed: Britons in the near future are likely to be worse off if the next government fails to invest in a cleaner and greener economy, business experts and green campaigners have said. Economic revival requires investment, and the UK’s crumbling infrastructure needs renewal. The country faces a choice: decline, as businesses and financial investors go elsewhere to find welcoming governments and the regulations, equipment and skills they seek; or investment in the future. That is the context in which the decision by the Labour party’s leadership to abandon the longstanding pledge of investing £28bn a year in a low-carbon industrial strategy must be seen. “It’s economically illiterate [to scrap the spending pledge],” said Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting at Sheffield University. “Any person who has done the most basic undergraduate economics knows that you have to invest to get growth.” Low-carbon investment is necessary to meet the UK’s legally binding target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but the benefits go far beyond that. Clean energy is cheaper than fossil fuels, increases self-sufficiency and national security by making the UK less dependent on volatile imports of oil and gas, generates green jobs, and reduces air pollution. The push for a low-carbon economy also has far broader benefits: people will see lower energy bills, warmer and less damp homes, and better health as a result of that, as well as an increase in active transport and green spaces from low-carbon cities. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “Green investment is essential for reducing our energy bills, cutting emissions, creating long-term jobs and boosting business opportunities. Cold, damp homes are having a huge impact on people’s health and wellbeing, as millions struggle to pay the soaring cost of energy bills this winter.” But after more than a decade of chronic underinvestment, the UK needs somewhere between about £26bn and £30bn a year in public investment to achieve those aims, according to studies. The public money would attract private sector investment, probably enough to triple the amount invested, and would quickly pay off in economic growth and lower bills, as well as increased tax revenues. “The fiscal multiplier [by which public investment stimulates growth] is a reality,” said Murphy. “It also generates income in tax revenues.” Other countries, such as the US, China and EU member states, are seizing the opportunities for low-carbon growth. Dr Anupama Sen, the head of policy engagement at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at Oxford University, said: “It’s disappointing to see the Labour party water down this flagship policy due to short-term political pressures, at such a crucial time for climate action and leadership, especially with other countries racing to prepare their economies for the imminent green energy transition. It would be better to stand firm and make the case for this level of investment, which is that it would reduce our emissions and shield against increasingly volatile energy prices to give us genuine energy security.” Labour has said that its underlying plans to decarbonise the power sector by 2030 and hit the UK’s carbon reduction targets, through measures such as home insulation and improving transport, remain unchanged. The party has not said how much it plans to invest, however, or where the cash necessary to achieve these goals will come from. That is not good enough for many supporters of a low-carbon economy. The leftwing campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal said: “Without the £28bn green investment fund, the future of Britain is bleak. This promise, if kept, could have not only revitalised the green economy after 14 years of Tory failure, but put the UK on the front line of green innovation, leading the world in climate technologies and solutions.” Abandoning the pledge also makes it more difficult to distinguish between Labour’s offering on the low-carbon economy and the Conservatives’. The Tories have not outlined how much they would spend, and are reluctant to say how much public money has been invested in total in recent years. But the party is keen to boast of £200bn in private-sector investment in low-carbon efforts in the UK since 2010, and £30bn of additional private investment, most of it in offshore wind, announced since last September, when Rishi Sunak made his U-turns on net-zero policy. That investment had been achieved by setting out “roadmaps” for a direction of travel, rather than investing large sums of public money, a party adviser told the Guardian. But these investments were largely the result of past policies that had since lapsed or stagnated, according to Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “The government is living off its past glories. The policies that brought in funding for offshore wind were set a decade and more ago. And with its constant chopping and changing on net zero and industrial strategy, the government can hardly boast of setting a roadmap,” he said. “The private sector is crying out for more consistency.” Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, pointed to the accompanying failures of the government. “The Conservative government has been responsible for crumbling public services, a tanking economy, sewage in our rivers and seas – the list goes on. To fix the damage the government has caused, the UK urgently needs a bold green industrial strategy that will create millions of jobs, grow our flailing economy, ease pressure on the NHS, and help the cost of living and climate crises all at the same time.” Without investment in a low-carbon future, the future is likely to be “bleak, barren, hopeless and devastated”, according to Murphy. “The scale of regret is going to be phenomenal.”",Green politics; Green economy; Environment; Labour; UK news; Politics; Keir Starmer; Infrastructure; Energy industry; Energy,Environment

2024-05-22T16:24:48Z,Keir Starmer expected to make it to No 10 despite his low personal popularity,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/22/keir-starmer-expected-to-make-it-to-no-10-despite-his-low-personal-popularity,"Keir Starmer goes into the general election widely expected to emerge as prime minister, despite being roughly as personally popular as Ed Miliband was at the time of the 2015 election. Headline polls suggest Labour will win a convincing majority in July, with the party 20 points ahead, potentially enough for a landslide victory. But underlying data suggests Starmer and his party are no more popular or trusted than they were heading into 2015, when the Conservatives won a majority. A recent Guardian analysis of data from the polling company Ipsos shows fewer voters think Labour is fit to govern than did in 2014, fewer think it has a good team of leaders and fewer think it understands the UK’s problems. Ben Page, the chief executive of Ipsos, said: “Starmer’s personal ratings are the lowest Ipsos has ever seen for an opposition leader who is so far ahead in the overall voting intention. It is more disgust at the Tories than delight at what Labour offers that is driving politics.” Since taking over as party leader in 2020, Starmer has overhauled Labour’s policies, its personnel and transformed its poll rating. Having initially been elected on a platform of continuing the legacy of his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer soon began overturning much of the party’s 2019 manifesto. The process accelerated after the Hartlepool byelection in 2021, which Labour lost heavily to the Tories, only the second time a governing party had increased its share of the vote in a byelection since 1982. Since the early days of his leadership, Starmer has dropped pledges to abolish university tuition fees, increase income tax for the top 5% of earners and bring in public ownership of rail, mail, water and energy. He has also made, and then abandoned, a promise to spend £28bn a year in green investment, and watered down a flagship policy to improve workers’ rights. Perhaps most significantly, he has gone from promising to protect free movement as Britain left the EU to insisting that a Labour government would not even countenance rejoining the customs union. Starmer’s approach has mirrored that of Tony Blair in 1996 and 1997, when the then Labour leader was likened to “a man carrying a priceless Ming vase across a highly polished floor”. It has also paid off. Labour is now 44% in the polls, compared with 29% at the previous election, and has made most impact with the kinds of leave voters in marginal constituencies who are likely to decide the election. The cautious Ming vase strategy also has downsides, however. One consequence is that it has alienated some traditional Labour supporters, with the party now concerned about losing the urban seats of Bristol Central and Sheffield Hallam. Some believe Starmer’s determination to stick closely to the government’s position on Gaza could also cost it victory in marginal seats with a high Muslim population. More significantly however, some in Labour worry it has made the party more vulnerable to attack during a general election campaign. “The problem is, if you don’t have anything you’re willing to defend at all costs, you get buffeted about by every opposition attack,” said one Labour source. “It allows the other party to set the agenda the whole time.” Starmer’s aides brush aside any such concerns. Starmer’s chief election strategist, Morgan McSweeney, believes the bigger risk lies in setting out ambitious post-election plans that then blow up during the campaign. In a briefing to the shadow cabinet at the start of the year, McSweeney presented Labour frontbenchers with a series of slides showing that in eight recent elections around the world, the leading party going into the campaign collapsed in the final few weeks. He pointed to the 2017 general election, which Theresa May called in order to secure a majority, but which ended up costing her seats after a botched promise to overhaul the social care system. If Starmer does win, he will become the fourth Labour leader to take the party into government since the second world war, and only the second in the past 50 years. Unlike Blair, however, he will then inherit an economy that has only just emerged from recession, stretched government finances and crumbling public services. One Labour official said: “The good thing about the Ming vase strategy is that at least if we win, expectations will be low.”",Keir Starmer; Labour; Politics; UK news; General election 2024,Politics
2024-01-04T13:39:39Z,Starmer rules out breaking Labour’s fiscal rules to meet £28bn green target,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/04/keir-starmer-labour-fiscal-rules-green-investment-targets,"Keir Starmer has ruled out breaking Labour’s fiscal rules to meet its green investment targets if it wins the election this year, in the clearest sign yet that the party is willing to scale back one of its headline policies in the face of Conservative attacks. The Labour leader told an audience in Bristol on Thursday that he would not borrow £28bn to spend on green projects if it meant breaking a separate promise to reduce government debt as a proportion of economic output. The £28bn policy has been at the centre of a tussle between senior Labour figures for months, with some wanting to drop it and others arguing it is an essential part of the party’s growth plan. Starmer said on Thursday that the £28bn promise was not sacrosanct, and that the party’s main green policy was instead to have zero-carbon power by 2030. “There is no question of pushing back on the mission – the mission is clean power by 2030,” he said. But he added: “The money that is needed for the investment … will be subject to our fiscal rules. And that means that if the money is for borrowing … but the fiscal rules don’t allow it, then we will borrow less.” The Labour leader was answering questions after a speech in Bristol to mark the beginning of election year. Starmer promised that Labour would restore optimism to a “downtrodden” country if it wins the election, adding: “We must crush that politics of divide and decline with a new ‘project hope’.” A year ago, he and Rishi Sunak gave back-to-back speeches in which they made competing promises for how they intend to lead the country. While the prime minister has met only one of his five promises – halving inflation – Starmer has come under pressure in different ways. As Labour officials rush to finish the party’s manifesto, previously announced policies are coming under increased scrutiny to make sure they can withstand the heat of an election campaign. Chief among those is the party’s promise to spend £28bn on green investment projects, funded mainly by borrowing. Several senior Labour officials want the plans to be scaled back in order to protect Labour’s reputation for fiscal prudence, while others believe doing so would add to criticisms that Starmer’s promises cannot be trusted. Starmer clarified on Thursday that the party’s fiscal rules would come first. Nevertheless, party officials have not yet decided what to do if they cannot borrow enough to fund the green plans. Labour could either decide to hit the target using spending from elsewhere or revenues from increased taxes, or it could decide to drop or delay the target. Starmer’s words suggest he is more committed to achieving clean power by 2030 than he is on spending the full £28bn. “Clean power by 2030 will mean lower bills, energy security, the next generation of jobs,” he said. But his comments have angered some on the left who insist Labour’s green targets will not be met without proper investment. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the union Unite, said: “‘Project hope’ will require serious investment. Relying on growth to generate that investment is not realistic. We have not had significant growth since the 1970s. If we depend on growth to fund all the investment we need it will only result in inertia. “Britain needs a Labour government,” she added. “But it needs it to be serious about real change.” Meanwhile, Starmer appeared to damp down speculation that Labour could go into the next election promising income tax or national insurance cuts. He suggested Labour would reverse any inheritance tax cut announced by the Tories. “I’m challenged on tax all of the time,” he said. “The first lever that we want to pull, the first place we will pull, is growth in our economy, because that’s what’s been missing for 14 years without growth.” Asked whether he would reverse a mooted cut to inheritance tax, he replied: “I’d oppose it, it wouldn’t be what we would do, and of course we would change that if we got the opportunity to do so.” He also clarified that while Labour was willing to process more asylum cases abroad, it wanted to do so before they arrived in Britain rather than afterwards as is being proposed as part of the government’s Rwanda plan. “The Ukraine [asylum] scheme has an element of processing offshore before people arrive in this country – it can be done,” he said. “And I’m open to sensible suggestions and credible solutions to what is very obviously a problem.” Starmer will embark on a three-month tour of the UK, hosting a series of question and answer sessions with voters primarily in medium-sized towns that the party is hoping to take from the Tories this year.",Labour; Keir Starmer; Green politics; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-02-08T17:33:47Z,‘A make-or-break moment’: what does Labour’s U-turn mean for the UK’s green transition?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/08/uks-green-transition-is-being-hampered-by-a-lack-of-investment,"Britain needs investment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, revitalise the national economy and create the jobs of the future. On this, all the main parties are agreed, with the backing of major businesses and strong public support. But none wants to commit the funding that economists say is needed to kickstart low-carbon economic growth. The Tories have regularly blocked or underfunded some of the areas like wind power, public transport or home insulation that would put the country on the most direct path to hit our emissions targets. And now Labour has dropped its headline pledge to invest £28bn a year in a “green prosperity plan” in favour of a revised proposal that will reach less than £24bn in green investment over the whole parliament, a dramatic scaling back. Estimates from thinktanks and academics suggest 10s of billions a year are needed for the shift to a low-carbon future: the IPPR thinktank came up with a figure of £30bn a year of public investment in a study in 2021, while earlier this year the London School of Economics suggested £26bn a year. And as a result, the UK is now lagging behind. As Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the E3G thinktank, put it: “A lack of investment in our clean energy transition has left the UK off track to meet our climate targets and uncompetitive in the global clean tech race. Securing climate safety and future prosperity requires a major uplift in public green investment.” Failing to invest would lead to serious decline across the UK, experts have warned. Vital national infrastructure, from transport and the energy grid to buildings, are crumbling and increasingly under strain, which in turn is acting as a brake on potential economic growth. Public funding also spurs investment from the private sector: the LSE study found that £26bn from the public purse would generate twice as much again in private sector money. The change of tack by Labour is a missed opportunity, many believe. Paul McNamee, director of the Labour Climate and Environment Forum, said the opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer, should have made his pitch as an industrial strategy, needed to revive flagging British industries, rather than emphasising the climate element. “Selling this to the country as a climate policy rather than an industrial strategy designed to address the UK’s long-term issues was a mis-step,” he said. “Labour need to focus on the benefits that this plan will bring – jobs in the areas that need them most, lower energy bills, a more energy independent nation – to bring workers and communities with them, showcasing what green prosperity looks like in practice.” Because while the sums required for low-carbon investment sound large, the returns are much greater, in the form of higher GDP; household savings from lower energy bills, new jobs and a transition away from the declining North Sea oil and gas sector; and better health, which comes from warmer and less damp homes, lower air pollution, more active transport such as walking and cycling, and more access to green space. Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said more than a decade of underinvestment was holding the UK back and adding to the cost of living crisis. “A lack of investment in insulating homes and building more British renewables over the past decade left UK households on the hook for high gas prices, which cost bill payers and taxpayers in the region of £50bn to £60bn in one year alone. Each home could have saved up to around £2,000 last year had we made those investments,” she said. “If we want warm homes, reasonable bills and energy independence, investment is required. Switching to heat pumps will leave us less dependent on foreign gas imports, running our home heating instead on electricity from British renewables,” she added. Renewable energy, in the form of wind and solar power, has plummeted in price compared with oil and gas, making investment much more attractive. Electric vehicle technology has also advanced, and in industry companies are working on methods for making green steel and taking the carbon content out of cement. But there are still major obstacles – the UK’s electricity grid, for example, needs massive upgrades to allow for new wind and solar farms to come on stream quickly, and to cope with the increased demands from electric heating and electric vehicles. More energy storage, in the form of batteries, is also needed, and the next government must decide on the future of the gas grid. Public transport is another key area, requiring about £10bn a year in investment, according to one estimate. The government’s scrapping of HS2 and switch to concentrate spending on roads has set back investment further. About £7bn a year is needed for insulating the UK’s draughty homes, installing heat pumps and ensuring newly built social homes are at low-carbon standards, according to IPPR estimates from 2001. Labour’s plans to scale back such spending to about £13bn over the course of the next parliament fall far short of that. Supporting industry to decarbonise, and kickstarting projects to capture and store carbon dioxide, would cost another £4bn from the public purse, estimates suggest. Farmers, according to research from Greenpeace in 2019, should receive about £4bn a year to reduce carbon from agriculture. Temperatures for the year from January 2023 to the end of last month were 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for the first time, new research this week has shown. The next parliament will be crucial in deciding whether the UK can meet its legally binding targets on cutting emissions by 68% by 2030, and reaching net zero by mid-century. Whichever party is in power will face a massive task. Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuels campaigning at Global Witness, said: “Whoever wins the next UK election will preside over a make-or-break moment on climate change. This urgently requires the phasing out of fossil fuels and a turbocharging of a green economy founded on renewable energy. Not only will this protect the planet, it will create thousands of green jobs and begin a transformation towards a safer, more equal society.”","Greenhouse gas emissions; Labour; Environment; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; UK news; Conservatives; Politics",Environment
2024-06-24T09:00:24Z,Starmer’s Labour has one vital strength: a shadow cabinet with real government experience,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/24/keir-starmer-labour-shadow-cabinet-government-tony-blair-gordon-brown,"In the middle of an election campaign that Labour looks likely to win, how many of the shadow cabinet could you name? It currently has 31 members, but few are household names – beyond their own household. If you could make it to double figures you would be doing well. Yet the surprising fact is that this is one of the most experienced shadow cabinets in recent political history. Keir Starmer only became an MP in 2015, but Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn and Ed Miliband, alongside five other junior shadow ministers, were cabinet ministers in the last Labour government. How does this compare with previous eras? In 2010, David Cameron’s first coalition cabinet included two former ministers, Ken Clarke and William Hague. In Tony Blair’s 1997 cabinet, there were none. Margaret Beckett, who had been a parliamentary under-secretary in the 1970s, was the most experienced politician present. That was why the Conservatives went into the 1997 campaign arguing that “Bambi” Blair and his team were too inexperienced to be trusted. Many of Blair’s first full cabinet – including Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson, Jack Straw, Alistair Darling and Harriet Harman – subsequently became well known, partly because of their sheer durability. The latter four all sat around Brown’s final cabinet table in 2010. Remarkably, Labour’s shadow team is, in many ways, more experienced than the actual cabinet. As successive Conservative party leaders have purged their predecessors’ allies and other ministers have resigned or been sacked, inexperience has become the new normal. Only four of the cabinet Boris Johnson appointed after winning the 2019 general election are still standing (a few others, including Rishi Sunak, were attending cabinet meetings in 2019 but were not formally members). On average, current cabinet ministers have been occupying their positions for 16 months: more than the shelf life of the lettuce that outlasted Liz Truss, at least, but not by much. In the four “great offices of state” – prime minister, chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary – the present incumbents have had – between them – less than 60 months of experience in the job. Their four Labour shadows have had nearly three times that. Does any of this matter? Yes. Read the memoirs of any former minister, and one recurring theme is that it takes at least 18 months to master a new departmental brief, to decide what needs doing and how to do it. Several of Labour’s team will have a significant head start. Miliband, notably, will be doing essentially the same job he did from 2008 to 2010, when, as the first secretary of state in the new Department of Energy and Climate Change, he developed the country’s first renewable energy strategy. Having already managed to secure £4.7bn of annual green investment in Labour’s manifesto, he will also be able to get going without having to first plead his case to the Treasury. Cooper, as the incoming home secretary, has the right experience to get a good funding settlement for the police and the asylum backlog in Labour’s first spending review: she used to be chief secretary to the Treasury, and in charge of it. The five years John Healey spent as a junior Treasury minister in the mid-2000s will stand him in good stead too, as an incoming defence secretary seeking to raise the defence budget. And Benn, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, will embark on his task of smoothing relationships between politicians there. He will do so after seven years developing a reputation as a good listener and persuasive advocate as secretary of state for international development under Blair and environment secretary under Brown. There is another lesson to be learned from the past. On 2 May 1997 Blair dropped eight of his cabinet into new roles, negating the departmental knowledge they had previously acquired as shadow ministers. If he becomes the new prime minister, Starmer will have the political authority to move anyone in the parliamentary Labour party into or out of any role he wants. But given the emphasis he has rightly placed on governing competently, he would be well advised to stick, rather than twist, and keep everyone in the roles they now occupy. Experience, said Oscar Wilde, is the name we give to our mistakes. A Labour cabinet that can draw on the experience of Blair’s and Brown’s governments has had plenty of time to learn from its mistakes as well as its achievements. The new government will be the stronger for it.

2024-01-27T20:30:02Z,Voters think Labour would be better than Conservatives on housing and house prices,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/27/voters-think-labour-would-be-better-than-conservatives-on-housing-and-house-prices,"More than twice as many voters believe a Labour government would be better for housing than the Tories, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The survey shows Labour is well ahead of the Conservatives on most issues including the economy, health, education, the environment, immigration and crime, and level pegging on ones it has traditionally lagged way behind on, including defence. But its lead on housing and house prices will be particularly encouraging to Labour strategists who want it to be seen as the best party for housing provision and a healthy housing market. At his party’s annual conference last October Keir Starmer pledged to get Britain building again – starting with one and a half million new homes across the country within five years of a Labour government. Labour has promised to shake up the planning system to allow for more housebuilding, including the creation of a new generation of new towns if it wins the next election, as well as more green investment in onshore windfarms. When Opinium asked voters which party they thought would be best for “housing/house prices”, 34% chose a Labour government under Starmer, against just 16% who chose the Tories under Rishi Sunak. On the economy overall, 32% chose Labour, against 26% for the Tories. On immigration 30% chose Labour and 22% the Tories. On defence, traditionally one of the Tories’ strongest suits and Labour’s weakest, the parties are equal on 26% each. On fighting terrorism the Tories are just one point ahead of Labour on 25%. Overall Labour has increased its lead over the Tories by two points over the past two weeks. Labour is on 42% (up 2 points) with the Tories unchanged on 27%. Adam Drummond, head of political and social research at Opinium, said: “Worrying for the Tories is the lack of indication, as we enter an election year, that they can restore public confidence in their handling of issues. Labour continues to hold a lead on being best placed to handle all of the top five issues the public think the country is facing.”",Opinion polls; Labour; Housing; Conservatives; Politics; Communities; Society; UK news,Politics
2024-02-11T06:00:05Z,"‘The mother of all U-turns’: after Labour’s £28bn green policy climbdown, what’s left?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/11/labour-u-turn-28bn-green-policy-spending-pledge-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves,"It was in late September 2022, as Labour gathered for its annual conference in Liverpool, that the party’s top brass began to believe. The financial markets were in turmoil after Kwasi Kwarteng’s kamikaze mini-budget the week before. Interest and mortgage rates were spiralling as the Liz Truss experiment imploded. The pound had crashed. Members of Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet team tried to look and sound stern as the conference opened, reflecting the public’s fears of financial meltdown and worries about its effect on the cost of living, but secretly they could not believe their political good fortune. Some of the more forward-looking among them thought that thanks to Truss and Kwarteng, one of the keys to a general election victory was now within the party’s grasp – and it was marked “fiscal responsibility”. When shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves addressed delegates in Liverpool on the Monday, she fleshed out her party’s green prosperity plan, which had been launched 12 months earlier as the centrepiece of the party’s entire economic agenda. Labour, she said, would invest in solar, wind and tidal energy to “free ourselves from dependence on Russia” and build a modern sustainable economy. She repeated two sentences, word for word, from her conference speech the year before. “I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain’s first green chancellor.” But one thing – one important detail – was missing. There was no mention in the 2022 speech of the figure she had announced 12 months earlier. The £28bn a year of green investment (which she had promised would be delivered throughout the first term of a Labour government) had suddenly gone missing, as the prospect of power loomed into view. Now, almost 18 months on, some in the Labour party believe that even then, in the autumn of 2022, Reeves was having doubts about committing so much money to the policy. “I think even then that the fiscal hawks in the party were getting to her,” said one key source. “I think they were beginning to think this could put fiscal credibility at risk.” Early last Thursday evening, after an excruciating and tortuously protracted policy row at the top of the party, which at times caused real tensions between Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Labour MPs were invited to an online briefing with Reeves and Ed Miliband. The £28bn figure had at last just been officially declared dead and the entire plan had been sliced in half. They wanted to explain it to the footsoldiers who had been selling the plan as Labour’s big idea for the past two and a half years. Most Labour MPs were on their way home and could not tune in. But about 40 did so, and there were lively exchanges. No one bought in fully to the Reeves/Miliband show of total unity, and some were furious. Everyone knew Miliband, the shadow energy and net zero secretary, had fought to keep the £28bn intact and that Reeves had wanted to water it down for months, if not much longer. They knew too that Starmer had been uneasy about dropping it until days before the policy was dumped, fearing that if he did, people would think he did not believe in anything. The whole episode was demoralising and dispiriting, said one senior figure on the backbenches on Thursday evening. “If we can’t invest for the long term in climate change without worrying about what the Tories are going to say, then when will be able to invest in anything for the long term?” Other MPs who were present at the briefing said colleagues with strong Liberal Democrat forces in their constituencies, such as Catherine West in Hornsey and Wood Green, were particularly hot under the collar, saying they had pushed the £28bn on doorsteps for more than two years only for the mat to be pulled from under them. Plenty of Labour MPs and activists are very uneasy. If this pledge, which had formed the cornerstone of Labour’s economic and green policy, could be thrown overboard, what, they ask, will ever be sacred? And, with the party now in the final stages of drawing up a manifesto for the next general election, what, when it comes to polling day, will be left? Inevitably, after the deed was finally done, Team Starmer was quick to cast the “mother of all U-turns”, as it was rapidly (and justifiably) labelled, as merely good, pragmatic leadership. Josh Simons, director of the Labour Together group, which broadly supports the Starmer agenda, said the move had become inevitable because of the change in circumstances since Reeves announced it in 2021. The party should be unapologetic, he said. “The £28bn made sense then. Three years, three prime ministers, and one self-inflicted financial crisis later, it makes no sense at all. So often, the Labour party has lost elections because it clung to unachievable, pious, ideological purity. Labour wins when its agenda is radical but deliverable in the world as it is. Thank God that is the Labour party under Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. “It’s a harder path but a braver one, which appreciates the gravity of earning the British people’s trust. And it is how you change things. The £28bn number is dead. Good riddance. Now we can talk about Labour’s ambitious plan for Britain.” To people on the left of the party, and plenty on its centre ground, that kind of thinking is precisely the problem, and typical of a right-of-centre Labour faction which claims that it alone understands and prioritises the pursuit of power. As one Labour official put it: “Those of us who believed in £28bn also believe in getting into office. They are wrong to think they have a monopoly on that.” Miliband told the Observer that Labour would “go into the next election with a world-leading climate agenda”. He added: “I am proud of our agenda and I relish the fight between Labour’s ambition and a Conservative party flirting with climate denial.” Others are less convinced. Neal Lawson, director of the soft left Compass thinktank, who is threatened with expulsion from the party for sharing a Liberal Democrat MP’s call on Twitter in 2021 for some voters to back Green candidates in local elections, said in an essay published last week that the U-turn was symptomatic of a wider process of stifling debate and innovative thinking. “They ‘burn the village to save it,’” he wrote. “And so, an iron cage is built for any ‘victory’, not a springboard for greater radicalism.” Barry Gardiner, the former shadow energy secretary, said: “Politically, it’s strategically incompetent,” while senior environmentalists were clearly dismayed. Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, suggested the UK under a Labour government could lose out in the race for green investment if it was seen to go cool on the environmental agenda: “If we want warm homes, reasonable bills, and energy independence, investment is required … There is a global economic race to build clean industries and Britain has to compete for green investment.” As rumours of the U-turn swirled early last week Paul Johnson, director of the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there were no other big-ticket spending items on Labour’s list for the electorate to get excited about. “What is most remarkable about this pledge is not its scale, nor its affordability; it’s the fact that it is the only substantial spending pledge that Labour has made. It is quite the statement of priority. It has pledged next to nothing over and above the present government’s plans for anything else – health, welfare, social care, local government, education, anything.” As well as raising important issues about the substance of Labour policy, the £28bn fiasco also raises questions about the party’s processes and the chain of command under Starmer. A remaining puzzle is why Starmer continued to use the £28bn figure in interviews just days before the U-turn. Was he in a pitched battle with Reeves in which, finally, he gave in? His supporters insist not, and say that he merely stuck to the official line until the figure was dropped, rather than opting for an interim “fudge” position. (This generous interpretation ignores the fact that Reeves had clearly avoided saying the figure for some time.) But the level of indecision and confusion that had been allowed to endure for weeks and months, was, many MPs noted, off the scale. People who had worked with both Tony Blair and Starmer noted that while Blair had welcomed competing views, his own opinion on an issue was always easy to discern. Starmer’s approach, by contrast, was more gnomic – he would hear differing opinions before retreating to make a decision, with those involved left unclear about where he might land. That, they said, explained in part the confusion that had endured for weeks. It was also due, insiders said, to Starmer’s insistence that if the figure were to be axed, Labour had to come up with a robust alternative that could not be moved again. That led to a lot of often painful meetings with various figures across the party and industry, inevitably leading to leaks. Once the move was made, there was delight at the top of the party at the BBC News alert that followed. It said Starmer had dropped the plan because the Tories had “crashed the economy”. Internal supporters of the change are now bullish about what the U-turn allows them to do – attack the Tory economic record without being hampered by a borrowing figure they were struggling to justify. “We’ve got a platform now which we can agree on, and we can campaign on,” said one. “We’ve been able to remind people of a core part of our argument – that the Conservatives crashed the economy. Previously, we wanted to attack Jeremy Hunt after reports that he wanted to “max out” the government’s fiscal headroom with tax cuts. We weren’t able to do that because the [£28bn] figure became a distraction. Now we can.” But while that may be true, the whole fiasco has reinforced doubts among MPs and activists on the left and in the centre who were never convinced about Starmer and his beliefs in the first place: “He dropped most of the 10 pledges he made during his leadership campaign. Now he undermines his five missions by dropping this. People will have a right, the Tories will have a right in the run-up to an election, to ask: what is this guy about? What does he really believe in?” • This article was amended on 11 February 2024.

2024-05-30T15:56:13Z,"Greens and Plaid Cymru pledge to push Labour on climate, housing and poverty",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/30/greens-and-plaid-cymru-pledge-to-push-labour-on-climate-housing-and-poverty,"Plaid Cymru and the Green party have launched their election campaigns, focusing on issues ranging from offshore windfarms’ profits to initiatives for improving water and air quality. The parties, which hope to win about four seats each, vowed to keep a Labour government in check and to push the party’s leader, Keir Starmer, to be bolder in areas such as health, housing and the environment. At Plaid Cymru’s launch in Bangor, the party’s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts , said the party was intent on promoting new ideas such as devolving the crown estate to Wales so that profits from offshore wind projects could be diverted into tackling poverty. Saville Roberts said Brexit was the “elephant in the room” during the election campaign and Plaid Cymru wanted the UK to rejoin the single market and customs union. Plaid’s Cymru’s leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, took a swipe at the Tories and Labour, saying: “It’s time to kick the Tories out of power. They have left a trail of destruction and we cannot get rid of that government quickly enough. But the message is also abundantly clear that people don’t want Labour to be taking Wales for granted. For too long Wales has been overlooked by Westminster.” Ap Iorwerth said his party would support a motion of no confidence in the first minister of Wales, Vaughan Gething, a member of the Welsh Labour party, that has been tabled by the Welsh Conservatives. Gething is under severe pressure for taking donations for his leadership campaign from a company whose owner was convicted of environmental crimes. Ap Iorwerth said: “We don’t have confidence in Vaughan Gething due to his actions in receiving the toxic donation. More important than that, I have no doubt he has lost the confidence of the Welsh people.” The Greens, launching their campaign in Bristol where they have just taken over leadership of the city council, said the NHS, housing, climate and nature, water quality and public services were its priorities. Asked by the Guardian how they could make a difference if the Greens ended up with just a few MPs, Carla Denyer, one of the party’s co-leaders, cited the example of the climate and nature bill put forward by the outgoing Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas. Denyer, who is standing in Bristol Central, said: “It’s something that I and all Green party MP candidates have pledged to continue to work on if we get elected. We need policies that will go further, faster. We need policies that tackle the climate crisis and the nature crisis together. “We know from the experience of our elected Greens at all levels of government, including our fantastic London assembly members and now over 800 Green party councillors across England and Wales, that even just one or two or a handful of Greens in the room can make all the difference. Greens can ask the questions no one else is asking, put forward the proposals that nobody else is putting forward.” Denyer added: “People are disappointed by the way [Keir] Starmer has backtracked on his promises on green investment, his weak offer on housing, and now we have Wes Streeting telling us that more privatisation of the NHS is a good thing. “The Conservatives are clearly on their way out of government but Labour is failing to offer the real change needed. We have the practical solutions to the cost of living crisis, building new affordable homes, protecting our NHS from creeping privatisation and cleaning up our toxic rivers and seas. That’s why it’s so important that when Labour form the next government, they are pushed beyond the tiniest change they are offering.” She said the Greens would push for more and better housing. “I guarantee I will keep the pressure on Labour over fair treatment for renters and for warm, secure, affordable homes for everybody. We will push for the right homes to be built at the right price, in the right place, in consultation with the communities that need them.” The Greens’ other co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, who is standing in Waveney Valley, East Anglia, said: “Only by having more Greens in parliament can we be confident that we’ll have the strong voices to stop the backsliding on the urgent climate action we so desperately need. You can trust the Greens to protect communities against flooding, clean up our filthy waterways and make sure all our children have clean air to breathe.”",General election 2024; Green party; Plaid Cymru; Wales; Bristol; Politics; UK news,Politics

They don’t need another leg-up from the Tories” (Tories fuelling ‘greed is good’ with lift of cap on bankers’ bonuses, says TUC, 31 October). Now Rachel Reeves promises similar support from Labour (Frustration in Labour ranks over Reeves’s refusal to reinstate bankers’ bonus cap, 1 February). How different from her response in the Commons when Kwasi Kwarteng announced his plan: “Of all the things that he could save from the wreckage of the kamikaze budget that he chooses to press ahead with, it is their plan to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses. At a time when he is urging wage constraints for everybody else, how can he remotely claim that that is fair?” Unless Labour is now urging wage increases for everyone else, it is very sad and damaging if the party commits to retaining one of the few legacies of Liz Truss’s premiership. Mike Sheaff Plymouth • When Labour supporters go knocking on doors, I wonder how many report back and say: “You know what people are asking for? They are asking for there to be no cap on bankers’ bonuses.” My guess is none. So who was asking for this? This outrageous decision by the shadow chancellor fuels the belief of many who say they don’t know what Labour stands for, given that Labour has previously criticised the Tories for removing the cap, saying they were out of touch with the public. For me, this could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, and I may well resign from the Labour party. Barry Norman Drighlington, West Yorkshire • If this is a sign that Rachel Reeves wants to rebuild the economy based on being a leading financial services centre, someone needs to tell her that we’ve been there before and we don’t want to go back. On the other hand, the green investment plan that appears to be downgraded by her with each new mention is forward-looking and urgent, and continues to attract widespread support. She should be leading the economic challenges by inviting critics to answer the question: an economy built on dealing with money or one that sets out to build resilience in the face of accelerating climate change?

2024-02-20T06:00:40Z,Unions warn against watering down Labour reforms of workers’ rights and ban on zero-hours contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/20/unions-labour-workers-rights-zero-hours-contracts-tuc-cbi,"Union leaders have warned business groups against pushing Keir Starmer to dilute plans for sweeping reforms of workers’ rights and for a ban on zero-hours contracts. As the Labour leader comes under pressure from industry to scale back its shake-up of employment laws, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the plans were “extremely popular” with voters and good for the economy. Calling on employers to “get on board” with Labour’s plans, the unions’ umbrella body published analysis showing as many as two-thirds of workers on zero-hours contracts had been with their current employer for more than a year. It said that this showed the overwhelming majority of workers on the contracts are “stuck” in a position of insecure employment, which was leading to bad employers “parking workers on zero-hours contracts for years on end”. It found a minority of zero-hours contract workers were on them as a stopgap, temporary measure, with as few as 7% having been with their current employer less than three months. The TUC’s intervention comes after the president of the CBI lobby group, Rupert Soames, said this month that it was pushing Labour to soften its plans amid business concerns the measures could undermine economic growth. Labour has pledged to ban zero-hours contracts, end fire-and-rehire practices and introduce “day-one” employment rights as part of a “new deal for working people” within the first 100 days of taking office. Although business leaders are understood to be largely supportive of the party’s ambitions, some lobby groups have questioned whether a rushed introduction of the plan could cause “unintended consequences” and hurt the economy. Ahead of the general election, Labour has scaled back its £28bn green investment package and sought to win favour among business leaders by pledging not to increase corporation tax or reverse the government’s decision to scrap a cap on bankers’ bonuses. However, the TUC said strengthening workers’ rights was a vote-winning policy among the electorate. Recent polling carried out on behalf of the union body in the autumn showed almost two-thirds of UK adults support a ban on zero-hours contracts, including 60% of 2019 Conservative voters. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “Employers need to get on board with Labour’s new deal for working people – and good employers will. “The UK’s long experiment with a low-rights, low-wage economy is a complete failure. The Tories’ lack of an economic plan for jobs, growth and living standards has cost workers and industry dear. Labour’s New Deal for Working People stands in stark contrast to the Conservative’s dire record. “And it would be good for our economy too. Decent, secure jobs are essential to building a motivated, healthy, innovative workforce – all vital for high productivity growth.”",Economics; Business; TUC; Trade unions; Labour; Politics; Zero-hours contracts; UK news,Business
2024-03-20T18:51:12Z,The Guardian view on Labour’s economic plans: a response too small for the challenge the UK faces | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-plans-a-response-too-small-for-the-challenge-the-uk-faces,"On Tuesday night, Rachel Reeves gave an important speech in the City of London, in which she offered an insight into Labour’s economic thinking. In her Mais lecture, the shadow chancellor cast Britain in a “moment of flux”, comparable to the end of the 1970s when one economic paradigm replaced another. It was, in many respects, an admirably fluent analysis that highlighted the economic damage wreaked by austerity and the price paid by political instability. A radical agenda is needed to deal with the compounding crises of economic stagnation, political polarisation and the climate emergency. However, Ms Reeves’ response shrank from the scale of the challenge. This raised the question of whether Labour had learned anything from the last decade and a half. The extreme urgency of global heating means Britain can’t risk throttling green investment because of the demands of financial stability. Yet that is where Labour finds itself. Ms Reeves cited approvingly the US treasury secretary Janet Yellen’s “modern supply side economics”. But she refused to back Ms Yellen’s intellectual argument that there are social benefits in running the economy “hot” by maximising the use of all available resources. Ms Reeves’ speech was about expectation management. In industrial policy, she argued for an activist, bigger state, but one not so large or intrusive as to do anything more than work in “partnership with business to identify the barriers and opportunities they face”. Underlying her approach was the assessment that government can only push business down the same track that it’s on. It can only ask for what business chooses to give. That might be useful in blunting Conservative attacks, but it is profoundly misjudged. To quote the economist Joan Robinson, apparently another influence on Ms Reeves, “private self-interest rarely on its own directs new investment into the lines that best provide for the needs and desires of society as a whole”. It was Nigel Lawson who argued that growth would be obtained by doing away with government regulations, and inflation brought down by cutting the budget deficit and aggressive rate hikes. Ms Reeves said Mr Lawson, one of the most consequential chancellors of the last half century, was “wrong not only in application but in theory”. However, her radical statement was undermined by her apparent enthusiasm for reinforcing the institutions that maintain Mr Lawson’s judgment. Ms Reeves’ oration was politically artful, and in that owed something to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. New Labour loudly rejected Keynesian economics, but achieved growth via budget deficits that pumped demand into the economy. Redistribution to achieve greater social equality was a policy that dared not speak its name under Mr Blair’s premiership, but it was widely implemented. Mr Brown wrote in his autobiography that New Labour talked about fiscal realism and borrowing to invest but “rejected the myth that national finances were the same as household budgets, albeit on a larger scale, and with it the inflexible neoliberal insistence on a ‘balanced budget’”. With months of phoney election campaigning to go, it may be too much to ask for Ms Reeves to be so open. We can but live in hope. The 1970s are a political device that can be used to frighten voters into accepting the neoliberal logic of “there is no alternative”. But a better balance between capitalism and democracy will need alternatives – and Ms Reeves ought to offer them.",Rachel Reeves; Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; Economic policy; Janet Yellen; Tony Blair; Gordon Brown,Opinion
2024-01-28T12:00:05Z,Thinking small may get Labour into No 10. It could also stop it staying there | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/28/labour-downing-street-starmer-brown-blair,"In about 10 days’ time, we are told, the deadline will fall on policy submissions for Labour’s draft manifesto. Reports over the weekend have highlighted senior party people insisting that a May election is still a big possibility, and fretting about a contest that could be called as early as 16 March. And besides, Keir Starmer’s accelerated timetable suits his marketing as the kind of leader keen on preparedness, prudence, and technocratic efficiency. At which point, an inevitable warning: the content of Labour’s plan for government, in all likelihood, is not going to be terribly spectacular. To no one’s surprise, Starmer’s advisers have been briefing journalists that “financial discipline will run through the document”. Proposals that have come out of Labour’s policy forums will seemingly be ruled in or out depending on whether they can stand up to Tory attacks. The only extra taxes in play – on non-doms, private schools and private equity “dealmakers” – will raise less than £10bn a year, which also puts a lid on any big policy ambitions. To cap it all, after months of briefings about its possible demise, the party’s plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment may well be even further diluted and delayed. The leadership’s deep conviction is that this approach is the only way they can win. As Jeremy Corbyn led his party to 2019’s near-death experience, they point out, far too many people saw Labour as reckless, profligate and in the grip of ideological mania, an impression that lingers. The coalition government of 2010-15 also casts a long shadow: despite the wreckage left by the austerity that is still blitzing local services, a lot of voters need only to hear words such as “borrowing” and “deficit” to think that the sky is about to fall in. Liz Truss’s short time in office completes the picture: voters have a fear of politicians opening the way to national financial ruin, and those anxieties must be respected. After four consecutive Labour defeats, these issues demand to be treated with a certain nuance, even by Starmer-sceptics: getting the British electorate to return centre-left governments is onerously hard, and all this has a ring of truth. But the result is a politics characterised by chronic smallness. As proof of his supposedly huge sense of purpose, the Labour leader habitually points to his “missions” – among other things, to “get Britain building” and “break down barriers to opportunity” – but what sits under them often looks either equally vague or comparatively tiny. In the past few weeks, shadow ministers have made a lot of noise about such policy minutiae as supervised tooth-brushing for kids, and a new register for children who are absent from school. On a bad day, it looks as if Labour has decided to offer as little as possible in the hope that the Tories find nothing to attack, and even the most timid swing voters then help Starmer to victory. Such caution has started to lead in a dismaying direction. Once, all the party’s big figures would have self-identified as economic Keynesians, well aware that in difficult times, investment led by the state is the one dependable way of getting things moving. Now, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, seems to be drifting deep into the most tight-fisted kind of supply-side economics – which means, for example, that the key to solving the housing crisis is a mere relaxation of planning laws. Nothing of any substance can be done, it seems, until the animal spirits of the private economy are revived – and even borrowing to invest has to be subject to specious fiscal rules, which is a strange position for a party of the centre-left to be in. Last week, there were reports that if Jeremy Hunt cuts taxes in the forthcoming budget, the effects on the state’s fabled fiscal headroom will be so dire that the green investment plan will in effect bite the dust. If sinking Tory chancellors end up dictating Labour policy, something will surely have gone very wrong indeed. Here, then, is the Starmer’s project’s defining tension. As far as he and his people seem to see it, smallness is Labour’s most dependable way not only of winning, but then sustaining the public’s trust: the programme initially followed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, which included sticking to Tory spending projections for the first two years, is often cited as the proof. But that comparison does not really work. Will there soon be an equivalent of New Labour’s great rush of initial change: the minimum wage, Scottish and Welsh devolution, Bank of England independence and Sure Start, all either rolled out or launched in the Blair government’s first two years? It does not look like it. We are, moreover, a long way from the 1990s’ easy optimism and favourable economic conditions. The defining features of British life in 2024 are bound up with an overwhelming sense of shabbiness and decline: cancelled trains, aborted infrastructure projects, bankrupt councils, potholed roads, rivers full of sewage. And however much it tries to dial down public expectations and insist that change will have to wait until a second or third term, a Starmer administration will be judged – probably fairly quickly – on whether it makes any material difference to all that. From day one, an incoming Labour government will also be faced with a barrage of hostile rightwing noise, from a coalition of forces – the Mail and Telegraph, GB News, whichever political organisation Nigel Farage may have decided to lead – that could well have finalised its takeover of the Conservative party. The arrival of every so-called small boat will be held up as evidence not just of failure, but rampant government wokery; every Labour slip-up and mishap will be hailed as a terminal disaster. The new political right, let us not forget, tends to trade not just on prejudice, but the understandable resentments of people and places that fundamentally feel ignored. If you want to draw their sting, the only way to do so is by starting to convincingly mend what has been broken. Put another way, you cannot build any sort of good society – let alone support for it – when you are still surrounded by rubble. Not that anyone seems to be listening, but there are credible economic voices making the case for large-scale, debt-financed public investment; they point out that it would actually have the opposite effect to the financial ruin Reeves and Starmer now seem to fear, firing exactly the growth – and tax receipts – they want. There are also serious Labour figures advocating the kind of big fiscal changes – such as a wealth tax – that might loosen the party’s self-imposed straitjacket. These things highlight a fear that ought to be nagging at Labour people, whatever the party’s huge poll leads and rising hopes: that even if political smallness initially gets Starmer and his allies over the line, it could sooner or later be their undoing.

2024-06-17T14:50:26Z,"Do Reform UK’s election claims on tax, immigration and environment add up?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/17/reform-uk-manifesto-key-proposals,"Reform UK insists its plans are “not just another party manifesto”, because it does not expect to win the election. But there are a lot of policy ideas in its 28-page “contract” with the electorate. Here are the main proposals from Nigel Farage’s party. Economy and taxation • In short: Liz Truss on steroids. There would be cuts to personal tax worth £70bn a year, including scrapping income tax below £20,000, and big cuts to stamp duty and inheritance tax. Cuts to business levies including corporation tax would cost £18bn a year. • Reform says this would be paid for by scrapping plans to reach net zero carbon emissions (more on that below), plus £50bn a year from cutting government departments and quangos, and £35bn from the technical process of making the Bank of England stop paying interest on commercial bank deposits created through quantitative easing. • All this could be filed under “fiscally bold”. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank termed the package “problematic”, saying: “Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions about how much economic growth would increase, the sums in this manifesto do not add up.” Immigration • There is only so much room to the right of the Conservatives on this subject, but Reform would use most of it, pledging a freeze on “non-essential” immigration, with only a handful of exceptions, and higher national insurance imposed on overseas workers. • On asylum seekers, Reform would take Britain out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), process people offshore and “pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France”. • On small boat crossings, there would be significant doubts about whether, even outside the ECHR, the UK could actually return asylum seekers to France. And a freeze on immigration, even with limited exceptions for the NHS, could have a significant impact on the social care and hospitality sectors. Environment and energy • A major part of Reform’s offer is to roll back green targets, including to scrap net zero goals altogether, which the party says would save £30bn a year over 25 years. The International Energy Agency estimated that the UK spent less than £9bn a year between 2021 and 2023 on low-carbon energy policy. This is less than comparable developed countries, and, according to an LSE study, higher green investment is likely to lower household bills and boost growth more than tax cuts. • The manifesto says net zero has increased bills, damaged industries such as steelmaking, and made the UK less energy secure. However, evidence from the IMF shows energy bills have risen because of the UK’s heavy reliance on imported gas. • In terms of threats to security, the World Economic Forum put extreme weather as the leading global risk to security in 2024. Healthcare • As part of the tax cuts, frontline NHS and social care staff would pay zero basic-rate tax for three years, with the aim of boosting staff numbers. There would also be 20% tax relief on private health insurance. • While Farage has called for a move away from the current NHS funding system towards one that also uses social insurance, this idea is not set out in the document. It is fair to say that the health and care plans as they stand are fairly broad. Policing and crime • As well as promising 40,000 more police officers, the party has pledged mass stop and search, and the end of what it terms “woke policing”. • The sentencing regime would be significantly toughened, with mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of drug dealing, or a second violent or serious offence. And 10,000 new prisons places would be built. • Given that about 10,000 people a year are convicted for drug dealing alone, such policies would need a lot more prison places. Also, there is limited evidence that non-intelligence-led stop and search is effective in curbing crime – or that police forces would want to use it. Education • This section is low on specifics and seems to be led more by culture war issues, with the first two points calling for a “patriotic curriculum” and an end to “transgender ideology” in schools. There would be another tax cut, this one offering tax relief on private school fees. • On universities, as well as scrapping interest on student loans – this does not seem to appear in the costings section – the party would push for two-year degrees, and cut funding to universities it felt were denying free speech. Housing and transport • On housing, Reform says it wants to “unleash” housebuilding, but the party would also protect landlords, scrapping plans to ban no-fault evictions or other renting changes. • On transport, the party would end the “war on drivers”, unilaterally scrapping any clean air zones, low-traffic neighbourhoods and almost all 20mph zones. • These sorts of policies give a flavour of the type of voter Reform wants to attract: older people who are more likely to be homeowners and drivers. Other policies • Social security: “motivate” people to work, and withdraw all benefits if they turn down two job offers. • Brexit: abandon the Windsor framework, which sought to find a compromise over EU trade and not having a hard Irish border. • Constitution and voting: replace the Lords with an elected second chamber; move towards a proportional voting system. • Culture: scrap the BBC licence fee and the Equality Act; make St George’s and St David’s days public holidays.",Reform UK; Nigel Farage; General election 2024; Manifestos 2024; General elections; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-04-21T23:01:08Z,"High interest rates could add billions to UK green energy transition, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/22/high-interest-rates-could-add-billions-to-uk-green-energy-transition-says-report,"A permanent shift to higher interest rates could add billions of pounds to the UK’s renewable energy transition, a leading thinktank has warned. Borrowing costs have soared since the easing of pandemic lockdowns and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the world’s leading central banks raised interest rates to tackle inflation – pushing up the costs of investment in infrastructure across advanced economies including for green power generation schemes. The Resolution Foundation said £29bn a year could therefore be added to household energy bills in 2050 in a scenario where interest rates persist at current elevated levels, relative to a situation where borrowing costs return to pre-pandemic levels. However, it said the green transition would still save consumers billions of pounds compared with current sky-high energy costs, and slowing down the pace of transition was not an option. The thinktank said a fourfold increase in investment in the UK’s power sector was required to provide the crucial next step in decarbonising the British economy, and a plan was needed to fund this investment in case interest rates stayed at current high levels. Its report comes amid a pushback against green policies by rightwing politicians who argue the costs of hitting net zero are too high. Labour earlier this year slashed its green investment plans amid concerns over higher borrowing costs and a campaign by the Conservatives to weaponise the affordability of its £28bn price tag. However, the Resolution Foundation said the green transition remained vital despite the higher costs of investment. Decarbonising the power sector is key to tackling global heating, it said, and would also help to reduce Britain’s dependence on volatile fossil fuel supplies, which risked exposing households to global energy shocks of the kind witnessed after the Russian invasion. “Responding by pausing or slowing the pace of power sector decarbonisation is not an option,” the report said. The government is committed to reaching net zero by 2050, with targets to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, and Labour promising to reach this goal five years earlier. The report, Electric Dreams, outlined two scenarios for future costs by 2050: a “high-cost” one with global interest rates remaining at current levels, and a “low-cost” alternative where borrowing costs fall back to pre-Covid levels. Compared with energy bills in 2023 – which are at a historically high cost – it said decarbonising the power sector would still save £14bn a year for households by 2050. However, larger savings of up to £47bn a year would be possible if interest rates returned to the levels seen in 2019. However, in comparison with 2019 levels – before the spike in wholesale energy markets – it said household bills would be £11bn a year higher by 2050 in the high-cost scenario. If interest rates fell back to levels comparable with 2019, households would save £18bn a year – a difference of £29bn between the two scenarios. The report called for a focus on keeping prices low when providing new investment, including pushing for the development of onshore wind – which can be cheaper than other renewable alternatives. It said some projects could be publicly funded, such as modernising the energy grid, because paying for investment via taxation – rather than through energy bills – could help to spread the costs more fairly across rich and poor households. It also called for the government to introduce a social tariff for lower-income households, which could help to protect poorer households who are high energy users in particular. Jonathan Marshall, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said policymakers could not count on interest rates falling back to pre-pandemic levels in future. “If interest rates stay high, energy costs will rise rather than fall in the years ahead,” he said. “So now is the time for planning on how we deliver the energy investment surge while protecting lower income households, with a greater focus on price reduction in contracts, price protection for vulnerable households, and rethinking the role of the state as an investor.”",Energy industry; Resolution Foundation; Renewable energy; Business; Energy; Wind power; Solar power; Environment; UK cost of living crisis; UK news; Thinktanks; Energy bills; Money; Interest rates,Business
2024-09-03T05:00:14Z,We wanted a serious government: now we have one. But a little Rayner-like joy wouldn’t go amiss | Gaby Hinsliff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/03/labour-serious-government-angela-rayner-dancing,"Sometimes it’s the little things that matter. An unexpected kindness, a burst of late summer sunshine, a cheerful snippet of news; things that are never going to change the world, but lift the mood a bit. For teachers braced for the return to school this week, the news that Ofsted’s dreaded one-word grades – potentially career-ending labels, from “outstanding” to “inadequate”, which ended up being all anyone really remembered of an often more nuanced inspection report – will be scrapped with immediate effect may well fall into this category. It’s hardly a revolutionary change, since schools that would have been judged to be failing under the old regime will still face immediate intervention. But it gives teachers just a bit more room to breathe. It’s a small, human way of recognising the pressures they’ve been under and the depth of feeling triggered last year by the suicide of headteacher Ruth Perry, after her primary school was abruptly downgraded to inadequate over errors in its safeguarding paperwork. (An inquest later ruled that the sometimes “rude and intimidating” inspection had played a part in Perry’s deteriorating mental health.) Better still, the announcement by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, comes ahead of a more substantial longer-term review of what teachers are actually being asked to teach, which is expected to examine complaints that the Michael Gove-era curriculum had become impossibly overstuffed (do primary schoolchildren really need to know what a fronted adverbial is?) and badly in need of a little joy injected back into it. And it’s joy, to be blunt, that this young government is currently lacking. With the glorious exception of Angela Rayner – caught raving it up in a DJ booth in Ibiza on a school night – Labour has marked its landslide victory by having the very opposite of a brat summer. Weeks of clearing out Whitehall’s closets has produced a string of stern, buzz-killing pronouncements about how things are probably only going to get worse before they get better – including from Phillipson, who last week warned that the promised Tory rollout of free childcare places for toddlers will go ahead this autumn but may not deliver everything parents wanted. In other news, a revolt over chancellor Rachel Reeves’ plan to means-test the winter fuel payment for better off pensioners is brewing. Some who voted Labour hoping Keir Starmer didn’t really mean all that austere-sounding stuff are now worrying they’ve ousted the Conservatives only to end up with roughly more of the same, while others who voted Labour hoping fervently that he did mean it will have been unnerved by weeks of hysterical speculation about an autumn budget supposedly full of middle-class tax rises not mentioned in the manifesto. The polls were always going to narrow once the nation came down off its post-election high, so Starmer’s tumbling approval ratings are no great cause for panic yet. But there’s a limit to how long a government sitting on a huge majority can keep wailing that these aren’t the decisions it really wanted to make without starting to look faintly helpless. All of which makes this back-to-school week at Westminster a crucial one, aiming to pierce the gloom by showing Labour beginning to deliver on some of its bigger promises – like legislating to take railways back into national ownership, or lower fuel bills for the long term by setting up the green investment vehicle it calls Great British Energy – while offering some early reasons to be cheerful in the short term. Rayner has the rare gift in this cabinet of looking as if she’s actually having fun, which can be more useful than it sounds (ask Kamala Harris, whose exuberance has brought the US presidential race alive). But in the end it’s policy, not force of personality, that counts. When not out clubbing, Rayner has been touting new rights to request a four-day week in a push towards making flexible working the norm. It’s not the radical cut in national working hours some wanted – she’s talking about compressed working, which is essentially fitting five days’ worth of a job into four longer days to gain a free weekday off – and it may not suit parents anxious to be home early enough for children’s bed and bath time. But they’re not the only people desperate for a bit more time to themselves, and unlike the traditional option of going part-time, compressed hours is a way of carving out space for a three-day weekend that crucially doesn’t require the kind of pay cut many people can’t afford. It makes flexible working look less like a middle-class professional luxury, and it is potentially also more father-friendly, given it’s one of the few forms of flexible working that is more popular with men than women. Like Phillipson’s rethink of Ofsted, expanding ideas about who does and doesn’t get to have a healthy work-life balance is a small policy that’s potentially capable of stirring bigger emotions. The same is true of this autumn’s water regulation bill, if it ends up making swimmers and surfers feel safe to go back in the water. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has also promised to investigate the miserly Ticketmaster-style surge pricing tactics which saw Oasis reunion tickets double in price while fans were stuck in the queue to buy them – another much-needed boost of optimism. All of these look for ways, even in tough times, to make everyday life a fraction easier, less stressful; happier, even. In a country ground down by what’s sometimes called a “happiness recession”, that’s not nothing. British teenagers are now the most miserable in Europe, according to a new analysis by the Children’s Society, while the measure of national wellbeing published by the Office for National Statistics this summer showed adults feeling more anxious and less satisfied with their lives than in 2019. That official measure, it should be said, only exists thanks to David Cameron’s short-lived passion for using government to try to boost national happiness – a project seen as helping to ease the gloom of the austerity years that fizzled out rather awkwardly when it became obvious how much it might cost. Though money can’t buy happiness, it doesn’t half help, and Cameron’s half-hearted early experiment serves as a warning that there’s a limit to what this government will be able to do on the cheap. But he was right that it isn’t woolly minded or frivolous for politicians to prioritise the pursuit of happiness. This country faces a long, hard road back to prosperity, and at times it’s evidently going to be a miserable one. Starmer needs to help us take our fleeting pleasures where we can.

2024-03-28T18:49:36Z,Labour looks to local polls as dress rehearsal for general election,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/28/labour-may-local-elections-keir-starmer,"If a telltale sign of a politician’s confidence is how willingly they expose themselves to direct media scrutiny, then the likely narrative of May’s local elections was on full view on Thursday in Dudley. While Rishi Sunak had followed his Conservative launch speech last Friday with the strictly controlled and limited format of a brief TV clip, Keir Starmer answered journalists’ questions for about 40 minutes, covering everything from council spending to Angela Rayner’s tax affairs. It was a fluent and at times bullish performance, notably in the way he offered full-throated support for Rayner, his deputy, and his one-word answer of “yes” when asked whether Labour would fully implement their workers’ rights agenda. In part, this is the inevitable process of a leader growing into the job. But, of course, it does also feel easier when your party is polling about 20 points ahead of your main opponents. Starmer made it plain that even though this was not the campaign launch for a May general election he had hoped for, Labour would treat the local and mayoral polls as a dress rehearsal for the big event. His speech to Labour activists gathered at a technology institute would have needed minimal tweaks to have become a general election stump address, with its rousing-if-woolly cries of “national renewal” coupled with warnings that the fiscal and political path ahead will be difficult. Up for grabs on 2 May are a total of 10 mayoralties, as well as more than 2,600 English council seats, and police and crime commissioner posts in England and Wales. Much as will be the case in the general election, one of the bigger hurdles that Labour faces is a fairly general assumption they will sweep the board, something that is being met by a vigorous pushback from Starmer’s team. Hundreds of new Labour councillors are largely a given. What will perhaps be more crucial to perceptions of political momentum for Starmer are the mayoral races, notably in London, the West Midlands and Tees Valley. In the former, barring one of the worst collective mishaps in UK polling history, Sadiq Khan will win a third term against the Conservative candidate, Susan Hall. The West Midlands and Tees Valley mayoralties are held by two Conservatives, Andy Street and Ben Houchen respectively, and while Labour repeatedly insists it will be extremely tough to beat either, it is no coincidence that Starmer and Rayner travelled to Street’s patch for their launch event, where they were joined by the Labour candidate, Richard Parker. Local elections are notoriously difficult to predict, and the spectrum of within-possibility outcomes ranges from Street and Houchen being easily returned, with relief for Sunak, to the notion raised by one analyst of the Conservatives losing all 10 mayoral races. This latter outcome is less likely – Starmer’s team have noisily dismissed it – but were it to happen, the Conservative sharks would soon be circling again around the prime minister, prompting renewed speculation about a leadership challenge or even a summer election to see that off. Long or short, the election buildup has its obvious perils for Labour, which remains somewhat bruised by its convoluted ditching of the pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, finally confirmed in February. But even here, confidence is returning, with Starmer joining Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for energy security and net zero, on a visit earlier this week to Holyhead in north Wales, where the Labour leader talked up plans for floating offshore windfarms as a “gamechanger” for clean energy. The stage is set, and the canvassers will soon start knocking on doors and delivering leaflets. This is not the main event, but that is imminent, and both sides know it all too well.",Labour; Local elections; Keir Starmer; Angela Rayner; Politics; Local politics; Local government; UK news; Society,Politics
2021-09-27T15:38:09Z,Shadow chancellor’s green investment deal strikes the right notes,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/27/shadow-chancellors-green-investment-deal-strikes-the-right-notes-rachel-reeves,"While Rachel Reeves did not actually use the soundbite “prudence for a purpose” first coined by Gordon Brown, she might as well have done. The shadow chancellor’s speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton was all about balancing a series of seemingly contradictory ideas: how to convince voters that she can be trusted to run the economy, while at at the same time putting forward some striking new policies; how to keep the party faithful happy, while at the same time reassuring business. Every shadow chancellor in living memory has faced this challenge, and Reeves tackled it by delving into the New Labour playbook. Back in 1997, Brown sought to address the trust issue by granting the Bank of England the freedom to set interest rates. Reeves said she would create an office for value for money, with powers to ensure taxpayers’ cash is properly spent. She felt the need to provide this reassurance for two reasons. Firstly, voters clearly need some convincing about Labour’s approach to running the economy. Secondly, she also announced in her speech plans to spend £28bn a year for the rest of the decade to help Britain’s net zero transition. Although she didn’t actually use the words, this represents a Labour green new deal. The sums involved are considerable. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects capital spending to be just shy of £120bn in the current financial year, so Labour’s plans would involve a 25% increase. When he was shadow chancellor at the 2019 general election, John McDonnell said he would cover day-to-day government spending on items such as public sector pay through taxation, but was prepared to borrow for investment. Reeves would stick to that formula, with her plans for green investment resulting in higher government debt. The OBR’s recent fiscal risks report provides Reeves with some political cover for her approach. The spending watchdog said financing the net-zero transition would add 21% of gross domestic product to the national debt, but delaying action could double the cost. Reeves seemed to strike the right note with business groups, who also liked her pledge to scrap business rates and replace them with an alternative – as yet unspecified – form of taxation. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI’s chief economist, said the green investment sent the “right signal at the right time”. Some aspects of the plan require fleshing out. The money would be spent on everything from giga-factories that would supply batteries for electric vehicles to planting trees, and at some point Reeves will need to specify how much gets spent on all the items on her green agenda. Labour also seems to assume that all green investment is, by definition, good investment, but it is entirely possible that an independent office for value for money would say that billions of pounds are being squandered. Those are problems for another day, however. In the meantime, the fact that there was little immediate pushback from the Conservatives suggests Reeves has stolen a march on Rishi Sunak, who has plans for green investment of his own in next month’s spending review.",Rachel Reeves; Labour conference 2021; Labour; Politics; UK news; Tax and spending; Green politics; Economic policy; Environment,Politics
2024-03-06T13:46:36Z,"UK fuel duty cut is regressive policy that benefits the wealthy, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/06/uk-fuel-duty-cut-regressive-policy-benefits-wealthy-study,"Retaining the fuel duty cut in the budget is a regressive policy that benefits the wealthiest in society, who will save £60 a year, while those who earn the least will save just £22, according to analysis. Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday announced an extension of the 5p cut in fuel duty brought in during 2022, for which he has won plaudits across the rightwing press. But the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank found the freeze, expected to cost £5bn a year, is bad value for money and benefits the wealthiest in society who tend to own more cars, and drive less fuel-efficient vehicles such as SUVs. Combined, the fuel duty freeze, which has been in place since it was introduced as a temporary measure in 2011, and the 5p cut to fuel duty, have cost the Treasury £100bn since 2011, according to the SMF analysis. The two tax cuts to fuel are expected to knock £27bn off Treasury coffers over five years. The Conservatives attacked Labour’s ditched £28bn green investment promise over the same period as ruinously expensive. Critics have said the fuel duty cut “helps the rich” while doing “little for the economy” as public transport worsens in quality. In total, the SMF found the bottom fifth of earners would receive just 10% of the savings, compared with the top fifth who would pocket 24%. Chris Todd, the director of the campaign group Transport Action Network, said: “We need to increase investment in public transport to help level up and give people better access to jobs, healthcare and recreation. Instead, we’re seeing services slashed to subsidise cuts in fuel duty. These cuts mostly help the rich and do little for the economy. Those in need suffer most from poorer services and the higher levels of pollution that will follow.” Sarah McMonagle, the director of external affairs at Cycling UK, said: “Far too many of us are dependent on our car but that’s because the government has failed to invest long term in public transport, cycling and walking, to give more people affordable, safe and reliable alternatives to driving. The public needs integrated transport policies and long-term investment, not political rhetoric about standing up for drivers.” The SMF has suggested more equitable and green ways to cut motoring costs, which would be investing in public transport, that “provide cheaper alternatives to driving for those who want to switch and decreases congestion for those who don’t”. The analysis found that for every 10% increase in public transport speed relative to driving, the average household saved £435 a year on transport costs. Electric vehicle drivers spend almost half as much fuelling their car as the equivalent petrol or diesel model, and the SMF has calculated that if the initial price of an electric vehicle was the same, households would save an average of £900 annually. The thinktank suggests the government should instead spend the money used to cut fuel duty to build charge points and help lower-income households afford electric vehicles. Gideon Salutin, a senior researcher at the SMF, said: “Listening to the rhetoric around fuel duty, you would think freezes provide immediate relief for low-income households and working-class commuters. But those are the households that tend to drive less, own fewer cars and travel more efficiently. “By constraining fuel duty, the government is wasting billions of pounds every year while robbing low-income households of cheaper options like public transport and EVs. These could pull millions out of poverty, but instead we’re wasting billions on unjust cuts.”",Fuel duty; Budget 2024 (spring); Politics; Budget; Jeremy Hunt; Petrol prices; Motoring; Tax and spending; UK news; Tax,Politics
2024-03-04T18:53:55Z,The Guardian view on Treasury fiscal rules: no way to run a country | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-treasury-fiscal-rules-no-way-to-run-a-country,"The UK has had seven sets of fiscal rules since 2010. In a study comparing it with 34 peer nations since 1985, Britain not only changed its rules more frequently but they also had shorter lives. Clearly fiscal rules are not immutable laws of nature but arbitrary, human-made restraints. Implicit in this model is a dim view of human nature: that politicians cannot be trusted to resist the temptation to abuse government spending programmes for political or ideological ends. The result is that, instead of a political leadership that spends too much, Britain has politicians who spend too little. This is no way to run a country when there is urgent social repair needed. Instead, on Wednesday, Jeremy Hunt appears ready to deliver a budget full of tax giveaways and cuts to struggling public services to meet his fiscal rules. Labour should offer an alternative. Unfortunately, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, echoed Mr Hunt’s narrative and ditched the party’s flagship £28bn green investment pledge. This act of economic and environmental vandalism is because Ms Reeves does not want to be accused of profligacy and appears to have adopted the Tories’ gloomy debt pledge. Ms Reeves, like the chancellor, seems to want debt as a percentage of national income to be forecast to fall in five years. In practice this rule is so vague it can be met without debt ever actually falling as a share of GDP. The upshot is a draining debate around “fiscal headroom”, which is what the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says will be the national debt four years hence, minus the national debt five years hence. To cover the estimated £13bn cost of Mr Hunt’s tax cuts means there is forecast to be less public investment, fewer parks and libraries, longer waits for court dates and more violence in jails. To ensure the health of the economy, there must be a better way of deciding how much the government should be borrowing and spending. Both Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s former chief economist, and Lord O’Neill, who served in George Osborne’s Treasury, argue that the current rules need a shake up. But do we need them at all? Tim Leunig, who advised Rishi Sunak as chancellor, suggests replacing fiscal rules with a 250-word OBR-approved summary of Britain’s economic position at the budget, and the effect of the government’s proposals on that position. He argues that a chancellor “who spent more on proven investments, whether that is capital, or improving education, or getting people back into work” could then defend them on the basis that they would benefit the economy. It’s not a bad idea. Britain faces a lost decade unless it updates its governance framework. The next government will face pressure arising from an ageing society and the need to make up lost ground on net zero. The lack of available productive resources suggests that tax rises will be required to meet the challenge. The economist Daniela Gabor notes that the Bank of England will deplete Treasury coffers to boost commercial bank profits to the tune of £110bn during the next government. Taxing those sums effectively would provide resources to tackle the voter priorities of fixing a crumbling public realm and reducing sky-high NHS waiting lists. This approach might seem radical, but it is better. As John Maynard Keynes put it: “The new plan is required to satisfy ideals of social justice much higher than we have been attaining without it.”",Budget 2024 (spring); Jeremy Hunt; Rachel Reeves; UK news; Tax and spending; Economic growth (GDP); Office for Budget Responsibility; Andy Haldane; John Maynard Keynes; Economic policy; Politics; UK cost of living crisis; Public sector cuts; Austerity; Budget,Opinion
2024-07-07T20:31:42Z,"France’s progressives keep out the far right, but what could happen next?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/07/frances-progressives-keep-out-the-far-right-but-what-could-happen-next,"The New Popular Front (NFP), a left-green alliance dominated by Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s radical left France Unbowed (LFI), has emerged as the shock winner of France’s snap election, with 182 MPs in the 577-seat assembly. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Together coalition will have 163 deputies, while Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies, who last week were eyeing a majority, have 143. While the winner was a surprise, the result is as expected: a hung parliament of three opposing blocs with hugely different platforms and no tradition of working together – and, under the terms of France’s constitution, no new elections for a year. So, with Macron having promised not to step down until presidential elections in 2027, what’s likely to happen next? Here’s a look at the options. Could NFP hope to form a government? Against all expectations, the NFP alliance of LFI, the Socialist party (PS), Greens and Communists, will be the largest force in parliament , but is still a long way from the 289 seats required for an absolute majority. Mélenchon, a veteran firebrand, on Sunday demanded Macron appoint a prime minister from the alliance and implement the entirety of the NFP’s programme. Others, including in his coalition, said that with no majority the leftist bloc would be forced to negotiate. France’s constitution allows the president to choose whoever he wants as prime minister. In practice, because parliament can force the resignation of the government, the head of state invariably chooses someone who will be acceptable to the assembly. Normally that would be someone from the largest bloc in parliament – but appointing a radical left prime minister would run the risk of repeated no-confidence votes backed not just by the centre right and far right, but possibly from the president’s camp too. Can a governing coalition be formed? Unlike many continental European countries, France has had no experience of broad coalitions since the chaotic days of the Fourth Republic, but several figures from the left and centre have previously suggested it could be a solution to a hung parliament. The former prime minister Édouard Philippe, the longstanding Macron ally François Bayrou and the Greens leader Marine Tondelier were among those to say last week an anti-RN coalition, from the moderate left to the centre right, could unite around a basic legislative programme. On Sunday, several said something similar would also now be needed. “We are in a divided assembly; we have to behave like adults,” said Raphaël Glucksmann, who led the Socialist list in the European elections. “Parliament must be the heart of power in France.” Nobody had won, Bayrou noted, adding that the “days of an absolute majority are over” and it would be up to “everyone to sit at a table, and accept their responsibilities”. The PS leader, Olivier Faure, said the vote must “open the way to a real refounding”. Much will depend on LFI’s willingness to compromise – and on the moderate left’s response if Mélenchon’s party refuses to play ball. The hard-left party has long said it would only ever enter government in order to “implement our policies, and no one else’s”. Many of Macron’s centrists, meanwhile, have said they will not enter an alliance with LFI. Early estimates suggested it may be possible that an alliance between Macron’s forces, the PS, the Greens and a few others could scrape the slimmest of majorities. But experts say a mainstream coalition, while possible in principle, would be hard to build given the parties’ diverging positions on issues such as tax, pensions and green investment. It could also be vulnerable to censure motions backed by both LFI and the RN. “It’s a nice idea on paper, but there’s a huge gap between what’s possible and what’s actually achievable,” said Bertrand Mathieu, a constitutional law expert at the Sorbonne University in Paris. “And its programme could envisage only a bare minimum.” Ad hoc alliances, a technocratic government: what else is possible? Rather than attempt to put together a formal coalition government, the outgoing prime minister, Gabriel Attal, suggested last week that mainstream parties could form different ad hoc alliances to vote through individual pieces of legislation. Macron has tried this strategy since losing his majority in 2022 but with limited success, having to resort on numerous occasions to special constitutional powers such as the unpopular article 49.3 to push legislation through without a parliamentary vote. The president could also consider appointing a technocratic government, of the kind familiar to countries such as Italy, made up of experts such as economists, senior civil servants, academics, diplomats and business or trade union leaders. France has no experience of such governments. Jean-Philippe Derosier, a constitutionalist at Lille University, said there was no “institutional definition” of them either, so it would be “a normal government, free to act as it wishes – as long as it has parliament’s backing”. Finally, Macron could ask Attal – who on Sunday said he would hand in his resignation – to stay on at the head of some form of caretaker government. What are the likely consequences of all this? Whatever is agreed (or not), it seems likely that France is heading for a lengthy spell of political uncertainty and instability, potentially characterised by at best a minimum of legislative progress, and at worst by parliamentary deadlock. Dominique Reynié, a political scientist, said a bare-bones government might be no bad thing, portraying it as a “government of reparation” that might steady the ship and try to “fix what’s not working” for a population tired of political upsets. But others have warned that the far-right RN and perhaps Mélenchon’s LFI would portray any stopgap solutions as a plot by the political elites to deprive them of power, leading to an even more destructive presidential election campaign in 2027. Macron has so far ruled out resigning before that date – but it may become more likely if complete paralysis prevails. “France today has rejected rule by the far right,” said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group consultancy. “But the results point to deadlock and paralysis, even if the left has outperformed expectations while the far right has seriously underperformed.”",France; World news; Europe; The far right; Emmanuel Macron; Jean-Luc Mélenchon; Marine Le Pen,World news
2024-06-16T11:00:48Z,The anti-Ulez vote helped Tories win in Uxbridge but has pro-car agenda run out of road?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/16/the-anti-ulez-vote-helped-tories-win-in-uxbridge-but-has-pro-car-agenda-run-out-of-road,"Six weeks may be a long time in politics, but for pedestrians trying to cross the dual carriageway to get to the shops and library on Yiewsley High Street, it feels even longer. The traffic lights here haven’t been working since 3 May, when they were vandalised by anti-Ulez protesters. It’s a side-effect of the self-styled blade runners’ attacks on the cameras on top of the traffic lights put there to monitor cars as they come in and out of London’s ultra-low emission zone in Uxbridge. “The batteries on the temporary lights keep running out,” says Frank Leahy, one of the partners at FLC, a car dealership on the corner of the intersection. “Then nobody knows who can go. It’s dangerous. You get skip lorries flying through.” Leahy isn’t a fan of Ulez, like plenty of voters in this west London constituency. Uxbridge and South Ruislip used to be Boris Johnson’s patch, and after the disgraced ex-prime minister stepped down as MP the ensuing byelection saw the Conservative candidate win by 495 votes. The surprise result reset political thinking about green issues. Rishi Sunak began talking about a “war on motorists”, while Labour scrapped its £28bn green investment pledge in February and Keir Starmer told London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to “reflect” on the policy. It’s still a big issue, along with crime, for Jackie Masterson-Bird, whose partner has to pay £12.50 every day to drive his diesel car to work in Guildford. She hates the vandalism and risk to pedestrians but thinks the solution is to get rid of Ulez. “I just feel for the people with older cars who have to pay to go and do the shopping,” she says. But while she voted for the Conservatives’ Steve Tuckwell in the byelection, he cannot rely on her support this time around. “Maybe we need a total, total change,” she says, unsure of what that means. “If anything, I may go Reform. I really don’t know though.” And green issues are still important to her. A short walk past the traffic lights is Colne Valley regional park, crisscrossed by the River Colne and River Fray with Little Britain lake between them. It’s a nice place for a walk, but this year has often been inaccessible because the Fray has burst its banks. “As a kid you could swim in there and feed the ducks – people used to fish,” she says. “I went there three weeks ago to walk the dog and it was completely flooded. I didn’t even get out of the car.” So were the parties right to dial down their green policies? Khan was re-elected with a substantial majority and little change in his vote share in the outer London boroughs with the strongest anti-Ulez feeling. And here in Uxbridge, Labour is expected to comfortably end Tuckwell’s brief time in parliament. Oliver Lord, the UK head of the Clean Cities Campaign against pollution, said: “It certainly seems that the focus on Ulez was a political gamble that didn’t pay off. There was a lot of blatant scaremongering. The decimation of local journalism meant people were getting a lot of their information from social media.” The byelection “definitely led to a timid manifesto from Labour”, he added. “It states that cars remain by far the most popular form of transport. They may be the most used, but a lot of people in this country are forced into using their cars.” In some parts of England, bus services have lost half their provision since 2011. But Lord is pleased about Labour’s commitment to phase out new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 and improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure. “The discussion around rail reform … the talk about a long-term transport strategy – I’m cautiously optimistic.” Also optimistic is Paul Foley, a former civil servant who liked John Randall, the Conservative MP here until 2015, when he was replaced by Johnson. Foley lost faith “when that clown took over”. “I was appalled by that man and everything he stood for,” he says, and is unimpressed with Johnson’s replacement. “Tuckwell is fixating on a chip shop,” he adds, referring to the Conservative candidate’s campaign to bring fish and chips to Uxbridge town centre five years after apparently voting against planning permission for one when he was a local councillor. “It’s like Yes Minister,” says the 57-year-old, referring to an episode with Jim Hacker’s campaign to save the British sausage from Eurocrats, which turns out to be aJohnsonian Euromyth. Foley is a Ulez fan and says the air quality is better now, although he doesn’t see it as a big issue. “We need a change,” he says. “Labour, 100%.” For other voters in Yiewsley High Street, Ulez and green issues are not a priority. Vida Amos, who works in customer service at nearby Heathrow, is a loyal Conservative voter and her main concern is “gender issues”, although she doesn’t like Ulez and believes the climate crisis is a hoax. Arthur Farrow, a retired organic chemistry lecturer, will vote Labour because of the cost of living crisis and “the consequences of the ludicrous Brexit”. He is in favour of Ulez. “Unless you’re driving a traction engine from the 1920s, you’re not affected,” he says. “I have a 15-year-old Skoda, which is no problem at all.” Younger voters here are also making up their minds. Josh Frost, a 22-year-old cricket coach, is worried about the economy and thinks Ulez feels like an extra tax. “We’re struggling with what’s happening on our own streets – we need to look after ourselves,” he says. He’s edging towards voting Liberal Democrat.

Coming just two months before Boris Johnson’s government hosts the United Nations Climate conference, COP26 in Glasgow, the report by the TUC makes clear that the impact on employment in the UK as a result of jobs moving “offshore” to countries in the vanguard of green investment and technology will be particularly acute in the UK’s industrial heartlands in the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber. Separate research by the TUC in June found that the UK is second from bottom in the league table of G7 economies for its record in investment in green investment and jobs – despite Johnson’s claims to be a leading force in the race to save the planet from global warming. While the UK Treasury is expected to invest only about £180 per person on green recovery and jobs over the next decade, President Joe Biden plans to allocate more than £2,960 per person on a green recovery in the US: jobs and programmes involving public transport, electric vehicles and energy efficiency retrofits. Relative to population, the UK’s green recovery investment is just 24% that of France, 21% that of Canada, and 6% that of the US. The study, launched on the first day of its annual Congress, which marks the opening of the political conference season, says jobs in UK sectors such as the steel industry are at grave risk because manufacturing is still dependent on the environmentally damaging process of burning coal at high temperatures. Other countries are blazing a trail in technologies that allow “green” production of high-grade steel without coal and these pioneers will prosper and expand while “dirty” old producers will wither and die. Last month the Swedish firm Hybrit announced the delivery of its first consignment of “green steel” to the car maker Volvo while another Swedish firm, H2 Green Steel, is planning a hydrogen plant that will begin production in 2024. The report says that 79,000 jobs are at risk, as other countries race ahead in green development, in the UK rubber and plastic sector, 63,200 in the UK chemicals sector and 26,900 in iron and steel. In total it says that 260,000 manufacturing jobs could be at risk as well as 407,000 in supply chains. Alan Coombs, a workplace rep for the Community trades union who has worked at Port Talbot steelworks for 40 years, said: “Companies overseas are already setting target dates for green steel. But the UK isn’t even putting our toe in the water. “We have families here who are the third or fourth generation working at the plant. If we don’t have apprenticeships in green steel technology soon, there won’t be another generation. If we put ourselves at the forefront of green innovation, we can protect the workforce. But it needs government action.” The TUC is calling on the government to fund an £85bn green recovery package to create 1.24 million green jobs. In addition it is stepping up calls for a scheme to help protect working people through this and other periods of profound industrial change, which would act as a bridge for those in jobs and industries under threat from offshoring during the global transition to net zero. The union body says that such job protection schemes exist in Germany, Japan and many US states, producing significant savings on redundancies, training and hiring costs, and enabling firms to keep skilled staff on their books. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “The world is moving very clearly in one direction – away from carbon and toward net zero. The UK must keep up with the pace of change. There’s still time to protect vital jobs in manufacturing and its supply chains. “But the clock is ticking. Unless the government urgently scales up investment in green tech and industry, we risk losing hundreds of thousands of jobs to competitor nations. If we move quickly, we can still safeguard Britain’s industrial heartlands.” A government spokesperson said: “These claims are untrue and we do not recognise this methodology. “In recent months we’ve secured record investment in wind power, published a world-leading hydrogen strategy, pledged £1bn in funding to support the development of carbon capture and launched a landmark North Sea transition deal – the first G7 nation to do so – that will protect our environment, generate huge investment and create and support thousands of jobs.”",Green jobs; Green economy; Environment; UK news; TUC; Cop26; Politics; Trade unions; Steel industry; Business,Environment
2024-05-08T16:52:13Z,Natalie Elphicke is a hard-right Tory. Her defection sums up Labour’s contempt for progressive voters | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/08/natalie-elphicke-defect-labour-keir-starmer-conservatives,"Siri, show me a hollow victory. It is easy to imagine the glee felt by Keir Starmer’s advisers when Natalie Elphicke MP let them know she was minded to defect from the Tories to Labour. After all, nobody can accuse Dover’s parliamentary representative of being a Tory wet. If she hasn’t passed over your radar before, and you’re trying to place her politically, the better-known Jacob Rees-Mogg or Priti Patel would not be unfair comparisons. If Elphicke – Elphicke! – wants a spot in Labour’s tent, then nobody can accuse Starmer of harbouring some secret lefty agenda! Yes, the received wisdom would be that a political party welcoming defections from its chief rival has a strong hand. It shows the game is truly up for its opponents. It should, in fact, be seen as a weakness in a democracy, where the difference between two main political parties has become so narrow that its representatives can glide between the two. But even if you disagree with that, Elphicke’s defection is in a completely different category. This is a hard-right Tory MP who cut her teeth scaremongering about refugees and migrants. “When will The Left admit this is no refugee crisis … but simply illegal immigration,” was the headline of a Mail on Sunday article she penned in 2022. ‘‘Don’t trust Labour on immigration, they really want open borders, warns Natalie Elphicke,” said an article she wrote for the Daily Express only last year. Nobody serious should believe she has changed her views: she just no longer believes that Labour challenges this venom. When she was heckled by union members at a local protest in support of sacked P&amp;O staff, and was heckled for failing to vote against fire-and-rehire rules, she denounced “militant unionism”. She has generally voted against fewer obstacles for access to abortion. She was a member of the hard-right “Spartan” European Research GroupShe went for the English football icon Marcus Rashford over his campaign against child poverty, suggesting he should stick to football, despite having a second job herself. At the end of 2021, her local Labour party – which she has now joined – asked: “Is Ms Elpicke Kent’s worst MP?” Elphicke was also given a one-day suspension from parliament for trying to influence a judge presiding over the trial of her former husband, who was convicted of three counts of sexual assault. After his conviction, she claimed he’d merely been punished for being “attractive, and attracted to, women”. Remember this next time you hear Starmer trying to claim the mantle of integrity. Elphicke reportedly won’t be seeking re-election as a Labour MP, but let’s be clear about what today’s gesture means. Someone as rightwing as Elphicke would not be defecting to Labour if she seriously believed the party was committed to meaningful, progressive change. In her parting statement, she lauded Boris Johnson’s Conservative party for occupying the “centre ground”, suggesting that this is where Starmer has moved to. Elphicke, in other words, believes that Starmer is the true inheritor of the mantle of Johnson. What do you even say at this point? It has long been clear that Starmer led the most dishonest campaign for the leadership of a major political party in British history: he’s gone from promising a programme of nationalisation, tax hikes for the rich, scrapping tuition fees and lauding free movement, to welcoming a hardcore Tory MP into the fold. Thanks to the state of the Tory party, Starmer was already going to handsomely win a general election: none of this is necessary for him to enter No 10. Indeed Elphicke’s defection might be another harbinger of why it will all unravel for a Starmer premiership. Starmerism is a political project devoid of principle or, indeed, a soul. Many who have worked with him up-close have observed how little politics he seems to have. He has compensated for that by surrounding himself with what the Labour MP and former Tony Blair adviser Jon Cruddas described as “the most rightwing, illiberal faction in the party”. Trashing his signature £28bn a year green investment fund, and now reportedly watering down the last distinctive policy package still standing – workers’ rights – points in one direction only: a new government which will have no answers to the multiple crises afflicting British society. With no political core, a Starmer premiership will be buffeted by events. Voters who – not unreasonably – expect change after the Tories have been booted will soon ask: where is it? In the recent local elections, Green and leftwing independent candidates surged, capitalising on discontent with Starmerism. That’s before Starmer is even prime minister and had the opportunity to alienate voters in power – and it’s in the context of the country understandably desperately wanting the Tories out. What Elphicke’s defection tells us is that Labour is now a political party with contempt for the views of millions of progressive British voters.

2023-02-16T10:15:14Z,Why World Bank head’s resignation is good news for climate crisis fight,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/16/world-bank-chief-david-malpass-resignation-climate-crisis,"The resignation of David Malpass, president of the World Bank, was greeted with relief and joy on Wednesday evening by climate experts and campaigners, who said it should open up a new era for financing the global shift to a low-carbon economy. Malpass, who was appointed to the role by the then US president Donald Trump in 2019, had been facing mounting calls to step down after a series of missteps, including lacklustre plans for green investment, and appearing to deny climate science when confronted by a journalist. In a statement, Malpass said the World Bank Group, which provides investment and finance to alleviate poverty and build services and infrastructure in developing countries, was “fundamentally strong, financially sustainable, and well-positioned to increase its development impact in the face of urgent global crises” and that he would “pursue new challenges”. His departure, which will take place on 30 June to give time to find a successor, should herald sweeping reform of the bank and its sister institutions to focus much more on the climate crisis, experts said. Al Gore, former US vice-president, said: “Humankind needs the head of the World Bank to fully recognise and creatively respond to the civilisation-threatening danger posed by the climate crisis. I am very happy to hear that new leadership is coming. This must be the first step towards true reform that places the climate crisis at the centre of the bank’s work.” Developing countries have grown increasingly frustrated with the paucity of World Bank funds available for their pursuit of clean energy and to help them adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. Donor nations were also grumbling and pushing for reform, impatient with the bank’s slow progress in delivering a comprehensive climate plan. Jake Schmidt, strategic director for climate at the US Natural Resources Defense Council, said: “Malpass’s departure allows the World Bank to hit the reset button and finally commit to the leadership needed in the climate finance space. The world needs more and better climate finance to meet the scale of the climate crisis and the needs of developing countries. With new leadership, the World Bank now needs to rapidly evolve, as a growing chorus of countries and experts have been urging.” Calls for Malpass’s resignation gathered strength after an incident last September, on the fringes of the UN general assembly, when a New York Times journalist asked him on stage to confirm his acceptance of climate science. He fumbled for words and refused to validate climate science. Although he later attempted to clarify his position and insisted he was not a climate denier, the impression had been clearly given and his leadership irrevocably damaged. Then at the Cop27 UN climate summit last November, arriving late after the plane he was on was hit by lightning, Malpass flew into another storm. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, spearheaded a carefully coordinated attempt to gather international backing for a new global system of climate finance, with a reformed World Bank at its centre. The World Bank and its subsidiaries were set up under the Bretton Woods framework, developed by the allies of the second world war in 1944. Mottley told world leaders: “Institutions crafted in the mid-20th century cannot be effective in the third decade of the 21st century. They do not describe 21st-century issues. Climate justice was not an issue then [when the bank was set up].” Some of the criticisms of the World Bank are that its climate spending is too small, too scattered, uncoordinated and badly targeted, and hard to access by the poorest countries. The bank has also continued to fund fossil fuel projects, despite claiming to phase it out. According to data published last year, the bank has provided $15bn to fossil fuel projects since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Mottley, whose country is one of the many small island states at gravest risk from the climate crisis, was cheered and feted at Cop27, and country after country came forward to support her plans. World leaders including France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Olaf Scholtz, Rishi Sunak of the UK and the US climate envoy John Kerry discussed what reform could look like. Malpass, when he finally arrived, could only reiterate that his leadership was delivering a record $32bn (£26bn) for climate finance – sums derided as falling far short of the hundreds of billions and even trillions needed for the green transition. Yet reform of the World Bank need not involve vast new expenditure by developed country donors, according to its former chief economist Nicholas Stern. He estimates that because of the structure of the bank’s capitalisation, investment of about $9bn from developed countries over several years could enable it to raise about half of the $2.4tn a year he calculates will be required in total climate finance by 2030, to put the world on a low-carbon path. “These sums are not scary,” Lord Stern told the Guardian at Cop27. “They are about 5% more than the current investment [much of which goes to fossil fuels and high-carbon infrastructure]. We could, if we wanted to, get started quickly.” Mottley is expected to set out her proposals, known as the Bridgetown Agenda, in some detail in the coming weeks, to be discussed by world governments before the spring meetings of the World Bank Group in April. Then in late June, Macron will hold a climate finance summit in Paris, by which time – if nations can keep up their constructive spirit – the new plans may be ready to start putting into action. By then, a new World Bank president should be ready to take over. Since the Bretton Woods institutions were set up, that appointment has always been made by the US president, while European leaders choose the head of the International Monetary Fund. Some developing countries would like to see that convention reformed, too, and have a global competition to find a new president – but that might be a step too far for Malpass’s successor.",Climate crisis; World Bank; Global economy; Environment; World news,Environment
2024-02-09T06:48:35Z,Friday briefing: What to know about ‘authoritarian’ new plans to deter disruptive demonstrations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/first-edition-protest-laws,"Good morning. The government’s attempts to clamp down on “disruptive” demonstrations in recent years seem not to have deterred activists thus far. Since the crackdown began in 2022 protesters have: vandalised art with soup, paint, safety hammers and glue; scaled war memorials and government buildings; toppled statues; glued themselves to roads in front of traffic; tunnelled underneath railways; and chained themselves to bridges. In response, ministers have bemoaned demonstrators who they view as “selfish” and “wreaking havoc in people’s everyday lives”. Now, after months of near weekly demonstrations in support of Palestine, the Home Office has announced a new series of measures as part of the criminal justice bill to deter protesters from taking to the streets. Police will be given the power to arrest anyone wearing face coverings at specific demonstrations, climbing on war memorials or in possession of flares and fireworks at protests, with up to three months in jail for some of these new crimes. Human rights campaigners and civil rights groups have criticised the measures, insisting that the public’s right to protest needs to protected. For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Guardian home affairs editor Rajeev Syal about the potential impact of this new legislation. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Russia | Far-right commentator Tucker Carlson has interviewed the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. It was Putin’s first interview with a western media outlet since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Putin said if the US wants to stop the fighting in Ukraine it needs “to stop supplying weapons”. UK politics | Labour has cut its green investment plans by half, from £28bn a year to under £15bn, ending weeks of speculation and confirming the biggest and most controversial U-turn of Keir Starmer’s leadership. US news | Donald Trump was anointed the victor of the Nevada Republican caucuses after staunch loyalists in the state manipulated the primary election process to assure his success. NHS | More than a third of cancer patients in England are facing potentially deadly delays, leading doctors have said, with thousands of people forced to wait months to begin treatment. Ministry of Defence | More than 120 female civil servants have said they have experienced sexual harassment at the Ministry of Defence or public sector defence agencies in a survey conducted by Prospect, a trade union. In depth: ‘They say there will be exemptions but we are yet to see how they will be written’ The new measures have been described as “authoritarian” and “culture war nonsense” by critics including Shami Chakrabarti, but the government has insisted that they are necessary in order to limit what it views as disruptive criminal behaviour. And, perhaps most pressingly, in an election year the Tories need to be viewed as being in control: “Images of flares and fireworks being used against police do not send that image,” Rajeev says. *** What are the new rules? Over the last few years, the government has amended legislation a few times to crack down on what it describes as disruptive protests. In 2022 it granted police extensive new powers in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act designed to restrict environmental protests by banning non-violent demonstrations that were deemed “too noisy” – the threshold for disruption was left to the discretion of the government. But with every new amendment, protesters found loopholes, with the government playing legislative whack-a-mole to deal with it. In its latest crackdown attempt, the Home Office has announced that it is now a specific public order offence to climb a war memorial, with the penalty standing at a £1,000 fine and up to three months in prison. The new guidance also includes a ban on the possession of flares, fireworks and any other pyrotechnics at public processions and assemblies for protest: breaking this rule also comes with a £1,000 fine. Up to now, demonstrators have been able to use the right to protest as a reasonable defence for committing a public order offence; it is how the four protesters in Bristol were cleared for toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. That will no longer work, as the new guidance precludes demonstrators from citing “reasonable excuse” to cause disruptive offences. One of the most controversial parts of the guidance is the ban on masks. Protesters who wear face coverings could now face up to a month behind bars and, again, a £1,000 fine. Under the current rules, police officers can demand that an individual remove an item that is concealing their identity if a section 60AA order is already in effect in a specific area; a failure to comply could result in an arrest. The new measures seemingly give the police the power to arrest straight away. *** Unexpected consequences The amendments come at a time when the government is seeking to expand the use of facial recognition technology in policing, so the proposal for a mask ban has increased concerns of surveillance, particularly for foreign born dissidents who are already at risk. “Chinese and Iranian protesters are very concerned about their ability to protest,” says Rajeev, “because they know that facial recognition cameras are in use and that that evidence has been used to target and disappear their relatives who are still in their home countries.” Iranian activists are reportedly already being targeted by the regime in Tehran, which has used agents all over Europe to harass, threaten and surveil activists. A ban on face coverings could also stop those who wear masks for medical reasons from attending protests. *** Next steps The specific language of the amendments has not yet been made public so it is unclear how these new rules will be implemented. “They have said there will be exemptions but we are yet to see how they will be written into the amendment,” Rajeev says. When he spoke to lawyers who are familiar with the issue, they said that it would all depend on how the government defines a face covering: “Is a scarf that is worn above the chin or under the nose for religious purposes a face covering? Would that get you arrested? None of this is clear yet.” These details are sure to be challenged in the courts. What is certain is that curbing people’s ability to safely and peacefully state their grievance through protests and demonstrations will have repercussions for the way society functions, says Rajeev. “If democracy is a pressure cooker, it needs to let off steam.” What else we’ve been reading Did Lulu really go round to Pete Townshend’s folks’ house in Glasgow for tea and biscuits?

The old man was embittered and fanatically energised on his sons’ behalf in time-honoured fashion by his own failure to win glory as a young contender. As a result of his brutally dysfunctional parenting and toxic masculinity, the Von Erichs were plagued by a succession of heartbreaking calamities. Maybe this film will come to be shown as a double bill with Sofia Coppola’s The Virgin Suicides, although the ordeal here is broadly factual. Peter Bradshaw Music Kali Malone: All Life Long Despite its minimalism, this is not music that feels dry or emotionally austere. There’s a genuinely affecting melancholy about Prisoned on Watery Shore, while Moving Forward invokes a kind of contemplative calm. It’s also music that feels strangely malleable. On paper, All Life Long looks like hard work for anyone whose musical tastes don’t usually dwell on the avant garde fringes. The reality is that it requires virtually no effort on the part of the listener: you just have to let yourself succumb.

2023-10-01T10:50:49Z,"Tory swing voters switch to Labour after Sunak’s green retreat, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/01/tory-swing-voters-switch-to-labour-after-sunaks-green-retreat-poll-finds,"Almost nine in 10 voters who intend to switch their support from Conservative to Labour candidates in the next general election believe that “green growth” is important for the future of Britain’s economy, according to a poll. Carried out by pollsters Opinium, the survey found that 82% of all respondents backed the growth of Britain’s green industry to boost the economy, in the same week that the prime minister announced a series of U-turns on the government’s green commitments in an attempt to create a dividing line with Labour before the election. The survey of more than 5,000 adults found support for the green economy was even stronger among swing voters who supported the Conservatives in 2019 and are now planning to switch to Labour, at 88%. The survey was carried out between 8 and 20 September, when the prime minister confirmed a major about-turn on the government’s climate commitments. Rishi Sunak said the UK would push back the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. He also plans to dilute energy efficiency standards. Business leaders and green groups criticised the move for undermining Britain’s green economic agenda, while senior members of the Conservative party raised concerns that Sunak’s gamble may cost the Tories voters in the upcoming election. When asked which of the chancellor’s five “priority sectors” of the economy were most likely to encourage growth overall, twice as many people thought green industries would have the biggest positive impact on overall growth than any other sector, including life sciences, digital tech and advanced manufacturing. Growing investment in renewable energy was backed by 71% of respondents, according to the poll, which was commissioned by trade association Renewable UK. Only 40% of respondents agreed that the Tory party had even partially delivered on this commitment. Renewable UK is expected to reveal the findings of the poll at an event at the Conservative party conference. The Conservative MP, Alok Sharma, president of the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021, said: “The prime minister’s recent call for the UK to embrace the incredible opportunities of green industry with even greater enthusiasm is clearly backed by people across the country. “However, attracting inwards green investment does require further action and I therefore look forward to the government’s promised response in the autumn statement to the US’s Inflation Reduction Act which is hoovering up many billions of pounds of private sector investment and causing some companies to think about prioritising expanding in the US ahead of the UK,” he said. Sunak’s green U-turn came just weeks after the government’s annual renewable energy auction failed to secure bids from any offshore wind developers. Greenpeace described the outcome as “the biggest disaster for clean energy policy in the last eight years” because it risked jeopardising the UK’s plan to triple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030, and cast doubt on Britain’s climate targets. Nathan Bennett, a director at Renewable UK, said the polling demonstrates “very clearly that people see the success of green industries as vital to the UK’s economic growth”. “Although we welcome the prime minister reiterating his support for green industries in his net zero speech, this has to be backed up with tangible measures to make the UK a more attractive market for green investment or we will see factories and jobs which could have been in the UK go overseas,” Bennett said. “This polling shows not only that there is a wealth of public support for new incentives to secure renewable energy projects and manufacturing, but that people be would disappointed if we fail to secure these investments,” he said.",Green economy; Renewable energy; Conservatives; Energy; Business; Environment; Politics; Rishi Sunak; Economic policy; Economic growth (GDP); Economics; UK news,Environment
2024-05-16T16:56:09Z,What are Labour’s six pledges and how likely is their success?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/16/labour-six-pledges-how-likely-success,"Keir Starmer has unveiled six commitments which, he said, would constitute the first steps taken by a Labour government. The Labour leader was reluctant to use the word “pledge”, but the six statements inevitably drew comparisons with Tony Blair’s 1997 pledge card. Unlike Labour’s promises going into that election, however, the steps Starmer outlined were generally vague and their success is likely to prove difficult to measure. Deliver economic stability Labour has an ambitious policy on the economy: to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7. Interestingly, this is not the commitment that made it on to the poster for Starmer’s event on Thursday. Instead the party is prioritising the more cautious and vague “economic stability” – a pledge that highlights the volatility caused by Liz Truss’s tenure in Downing Street, but the success of which will be much harder to judge. Labour frontbenchers are locked in debates over whether the party should prioritise economic stability if it gets into power, or push for growth, perhaps with higher spending and lower taxes. The fact that stability made it on to the pledge card shows which way Starmer is leaning. Cut NHS waiting times Cutting NHS waiting times might sound like a vague promise, but it refers to 14 different targets the health service is currently missing, and in some cases has never hit. The promises include one to make sure ambulances respond to the most serious incidents within seven minutes, compared with the current average of eight minutes. Labour is also promising that 95% of people visiting A&amp;E will be seen and either transferred or discharged within four hours – far above the current figure of 74%. Another pledge says 96% of cancer patients will wait one month or less between a doctor deciding they need treatment and the treatment starting. At the moment that is true for only 91% of patients. Launch a new border security command When launching his missions last year, Starmer received some criticism for not including one on migration. Since then Rishi Sunak has sought to put the issue at the heart of his pre-election pitch to voters by relaunching the government’s plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Labour has promised to scrap the Rwanda scheme and to use the savings to pay for a new border security command, staffed with hundreds of additional special investigators, intelligence agents and cross-border police officers. Labour wants to focus on prosecuting people smugglers who help bring migrants across the Channel, rather than on deporting those who arrive here. Unlike Sunak’s promise to completely stop small boat crossings, Starmer is only promising to set up the border command. He has not said how its success should be judged. Set up Great British Energy Starmer’s original promise to spend £28bn a year on green investment has been whittled down to less than £15bn. The largest portion of that money will be spent creating a green energy company known as Great British Energy, which allies of the shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, say was the most important aspect of the original promise. Labour has promised to set up the company in Scotland within its first 100 days in power, with a mandate to invest in clean energy schemes. Its initial focus will be on cutting-edge technologies that private sector investors might deem too risky, and community energy schemes that they might deem too small. Setting up the company will be the easy part. Labour is also promising the country will have zero-carbon electricity by 2030, which will prove harder and more expensive to achieve. Crack down on antisocial behaviour Labour does have a measurable target on tackling crime – to halve serious violent crime and raise confidence in the police to its highest level. But this is not the pledge that appears on posters across the country. Instead, the party has decided to prioritise a far vaguer crackdown on antisocial behaviour. Labour has promised a range of measures, including “respect orders” for adults who repeatedly commit antisocial behaviour, introducing youth mentors and mental health professionals in schools, and new penalties for fly-tippers. Tackling antisocial behaviour is likely to prove far easier than solving some of the more entrenched problems in the criminal justice system, given prison and court capacity is almost non-existent and can only be improved with large amounts of extra money. Recruit 6,500 teachers Starmer’s education pledge is the only one to which there is an actual figure attached. The party has promised to recruit 6,500 more teachers, which it will pay for by using the money it generates through increasing taxes on private schools. Labour does not say how quickly it will recruit the extra teachers. If it intends to do so in the first year of government, this is a high target, but not unprecedented. From 2021-22 to 2022-23, the number of full-time equivalent teaching posts in schools rose by 2,844. Two years earlier, as the country came out of the pandemic, the number of teaching posts rose by 7,285. Recruiting more teachers might prove difficult in the short term if pay across the sector does not rise, something Labour will be reluctant to allow given the public sector funding constraints.",Labour; Keir Starmer; Economic policy; NHS; Immigration and asylum; Green economy; Teacher shortages; Education; Environment; UK news; Society; Politics; Schools; Health; General election 2024,Politics
2023-06-10T07:00:17Z,Labour’s green pledge offers everything voters want: to delay it would be foolish | Rebecca Newsom,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/10/labour-green-pledge-voters-delay-investment-climate-economy,"As wildfire smoke engulfs much of the east coast of the US and average global temperatures continue to rise, with the world imminently facing some of the hottest years on record, it would be an error of judgment for the Labour party to delay its green investment pledge. Doing so would not only be a mistake for our economy and the climate, but also threaten Labour’s electoral prospects, given strong public demand for bold action on this issue. Together with its world-leading promise to end all new domestic oil and gas developments, the Labour party’s £28bn-a-year investment pledge to green industries marks the scale of climate ambition we need to see from a future British government. These commitments mark Labour out as a potential major climate leader and, like Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the investment pledge clearly demonstrates that the party is in tune with the economic realities of today’s world. So it was concerning to hear of Labour’s plans to delay the full rolling out of its green investment programme in the news on Friday morning. The party would do well to consider three important factors that show it would be nonsensical to dither on allocating the full £28bn-a-year investment in green infrastructure as soon as possible. First, investing in the clean, green economy has huge public support and will be a vote-winner at next year’s election. Polling shows that Labour’s £28bn-a-year pledge is widely popular. Further polls show that 71% of Britons support greater investment in renewable energy, while, across all voter groups, people want the government to do more on the climate crisis. Voters understand that, given the trajectory of the climate crisis, global economics and technology, the way to grow the economy and create quality secure jobs of the future is through green investment. Second, large-scale green infrastructure investment is an enormous economic opportunity that should be seized right now. The global race to dominate green tech industries is well under way, with the US, China and the EU leading the pack. But a lack of vision, ambition, policies and investment from the current government means the UK isn’t even off the starting blocks. Without the necessary immediate investment we won’t catch up, and risk throwing in the towel on the prospect of creating thousands of jobs needed as we inevitably phase out fossil fuels. While concerns around fiscal discipline are completely understandable, Labour also needs to remember that green infrastructure spending is now one of the best economic growth generators and therefore borrowing to fund such investment will pay for itself. In addition, there needs to be a greater appreciation of the fact that climate breakdown itself is a threat to fiscal stability – the Bank of England has outlined the risks posed to the financial stability of our country if dangers associated with the climate crisis are not incorporated into fiscal policymaking. Simply put, it would be bad economics to say that we can’t afford this now. Finally, there are many other ways to generate additional revenue to fund the scale of green investment needed now. Introducing taxes on big polluters – such as an incineration tax, a frequent flyer levy and a loophole-free oil and gas windfall tax – could be used to help shift behaviour and make companies pay for the damage they’re causing, both here in the UK and overseas. Redirecting fossil fuel subsidies, and investment from dirty infrastructure such as new road building, could free up billions of pounds. And introducing a new green wealth tax, since the wealthiest 1% of humanity are responsible for twice as many emissions as the poorest 50%, could also help tackle inequality, while generating yet more revenue for green and other vital public services investment. The Labour party must stand by its £28bn-a-year green investment pledge without delay, and put forward a roadmap for how the money will be spent in the runup to the next election – so voters can be sure the party really means what it says. This, alongside a clear and detailed plan for how the party will support all workers to access the secure, quality green jobs of the future that this investment will create, will help to build the party’s credibility as a climate and economic leader and garner the support of the electorate ahead of next year’s general election.

2024-09-27T04:00:03Z,How Rachel Reeves could release billions more for investment in the budget,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/27/how-rachel-reeves-could-release-billions-more-for-investment-in-the-budget,"Rachel Reeves is considering changes in next month’s budget to the government’s so-called fiscal rules, which govern how much it can spend. The changes are aimed at paving the way for billions of pounds more investment in the UK economy, to help decarbonise the economy and reboot growth. Reeves signalled the change in direction in her speech to the Labour party conference on Monday, saying “it is time that the Treasury moved on from just counting the costs of investments to recognising the benefits too”. But with government debt running at 100% of GDP, and a total debt pile of £2.5tn, there are questions over how far Reeves could go. Would this break a manifesto pledge? Before the general election, Reeves pledged to meet two fiscal rules, which were largely unchanged from the self-imposed measures drawn up by her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt. The first manifesto pledge was that day-to-day spending would be balanced with tax receipts. Speaking at a fringe event at the party’s annual conference, Reeves stressed this measure would be “incredibly hard” to meet and would still require the government to make “tough decisions” on tax and spending. “The £22bn black hole in the public finances makes that even harder,” she said. “If you carry that £22bn forward for every year of the parliament, the previous government would not have met their fiscal rules, and we won’t meet our fiscal rules, so that’s why we have to take action at the budget in October.” The second rule was that debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of forecasts produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is where Reeves is most likely to make changes. While this could break a manifesto pledge, the Treasury sees things differently: Reeves could argue she is changing the definition of debt, while still committing to bring down this alternative measure. Why does the Bank of England matter? One well-trailed idea is excluding the losses for the Treasury on the Bank of England winding down its crisis-era quantitative easing bond-buying programme. Experts say this could open up £10bn-£20bn of headroom. Threadneedle Street amassed bonds worth £895bn as it battled the 2008 financial crisis and Covid pandemic. However, they are now being sold for less than was paid, with the Treasury picking up the tab. Total losses could hit £100bn over the next decade. Reeves got a £10bn boost earlier this month when the Bank announced it would sell £100bn of bonds over the next year – less than the OBR expected, and therefore crystallising fewer losses. However, excluding the losses altogether would add further headroom. Could the chancellor argue green investment should not add to debt? Reeves could exclude Labour’s new public investment companies from the debt targets, allowing the chancellor to borrow as much for these vehicles as she thinks the market will have appetite to lend. Britain is an outlier compared with several countries that already do this with their state-owned energy companies. Sources said trade unions had briefed the Treasury on this, highlighting how Germany excludes the energy company Stadtwerke München. Ørsted’s borrowing is not included in Denmark’s national figures, Vattenfall’s debt is not counted by Sweden, and neither Statkraft nor Equinor feature in Norway’s. Germany’s state-owned development bank, KfW, is also excluded. This is because the Maastricht Treaty’s definition of debt excludes publicly owned entities engaged in “corporate activity” or “market production”, definitions which include the liabilities of savings banks, public utilities and waste management operators. Allies of Ed Miliband say the energy secretary has argued for keeping the new institutions off the government balance sheet, but that he is not part of the pre-budget decision-making process. Could Reeves change the debt target? Currently the fiscal rules target public sector net debt (PSND), which measures the stock of past borrowing and totals £2.5tn. But this measure does not give any credit for huge swathes of assets that the state owns, from roads to public parks. Reeves could decide to target an alternative already tracked by the OBR: public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), which take into account all financial assets and liabilities and totals about £2.4tn. At the March budget, public sector net debt was forecast to rise, before a modest fall from 93.2% of GDP to 92.2% in the fifth year – meeting Hunt’s fiscal rule with £8.9bn to spare in cash terms. On the alternative measure, debt was forecast to drop in every year – including a significant drop from 80.6% of GDP to 78.7% in the fifth year, worth more than £50bn in cash terms. The main source of difference is how public assets, on which the government would expect a future financial return – including student loans and equity stakes in companies – offset liabilities, such as government debt and public sector pensions. “The current debt target sets an incentive to sell off illiquid assets – like the student loan book – without regard for whether you get a good price for it, or whether you think the public sector, or private, are better placed to manage it in the long term,” said Isabel Stockton, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank. However, there could also be challenges. “If that became your main fiscal rule, you’d be concerned about the incentive for gaming the system – to organise more parts of public spending as loans.” Could the chancellor go further? One of the most flattering possible measures Reeves could target is public sector net worth (PSNW), which includes non-financial assets – such as the road network, schools and hospitals – alongside financial ones. Using these assets to offset the government’s liabilities, the measure currently shows a deficit of about £700bn – a considerably lower sum than Britain’s headline £2.5tn net debt pile. Taking this broad view could help show the value of investing in everything from buildings and roads to machinery, intellectual property and artworks. Economists at the International Monetary Fund praised the metric in July, saying it was “more conducive to public investment and economic growth,” and could still act as an anchor that “precludes unsustainable debt dynamics”. However, the measure could be tough to adopt, as non-financial assets can be difficult to value. Roads like the M4 motorway and buildings like No 10 Downing Street might be undesirable to ever sell, or to dispose of quickly. Expanding the scope of what the government counts under the measure could also bring in some unhelpful liabilities, such as PFI contracts – which have been deliberately taken off the government books – and unfunded pensions schemes. For these reasons, economists often argue PSNW should not be the main target a government adopts, but could be helpful as part of a wider set of measures because it could help to incentivise investment. Would there be a risk of a Truss-style market reaction? Part of the reason Reeves has stuck so neatly to self-imposed fiscal rules is for political reasons – to show voters that Labour can be trusted with the public finances. But it is also to demonstrate to financial markets that the new government is committed to avoiding a repeat of Liz Truss’s mini-budget. The Treasury has previously warned that any increase in borrowing is likely to increase inflation and interest rates, according to one official who has recently departed the department. The person added: “I think officials will be a lot more comfortable with the Bank of England change than an open-ended allowance for the government to borrow as much as it likes to fund capital spending. Once you have carved out GB Energy, why not make it much bigger and load it up with debt?” Jeremy Hunt, the former chancellor, tweeted on Thursday: “My advice from HMT officials was always very clear on this: more borrowing means interest rates stay higher for longer.” However, the current fiscal rules have become increasingly discredited among leading economists. Stockton at the IFS said that frequent changes to the rules could alarm markets, but suggested some tweaks would be welcomed. “It certainly looks like keeping KfW outside the German debt rule doesn’t impact the costs that Germany can borrow at. Investors seem fine with that,” she said. Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said Truss had spooked markets after undermining the Treasury and the Bank of England, and by announcing large tax cuts that would have done little to boost the long-run potential of the UK economy. “It partly depends on the scale and type of loosening that Reeves employs after changing the rules, but I think the risk of a Truss-style event are very low,” he said. “If Reeves were to use the extra headroom to boost investment, then I think markets would view that as a sensible choice.”",Autumn budget 2024; Rachel Reeves; Economics; Business; Politics; UK news; Labour; Tax and spending; Budget,UK news
2024-02-04T20:00:09Z,Labour’s proposals unlikely to be enough to end race disparities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/04/labours-proposals-unlikely-to-be-enough-to-end-race-disparities,"While Britain was still struggling through the Covid pandemic in autumn 2020, Keir Starmer announced that Labour would bring in a race relations act if it came to power. His promise was driven by concern about the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus crisis on minority ethnic communities, confirmed in a report from Doreen Lawrence, the Labour peer and mother of the murdered black teenager Stephen. “If no long-term action is taken to tackle structural inequalities, we will keep seeing this pattern of injustice occur beyond the pandemic,” she said. “We have heard enough talk from the government. It is now time to act.” Lady Lawrence was asked by Labour to lead a race equality taskforce to draw up specific policies to tackle those structural inequalities that exist throughout society: at work and in the economy, the health service, the criminal justice system and in housing. The statistics are depressingly familiar, yet still shocking. Analysis by the TUC reveals the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) workers in insecure work more than doubled from 2011 to 2022, from 360,200 to 836,300. The cost of living crisis has hit people of colour, already disproportionately poorer, hardest: they are 2.5 times more likely to be in poverty than white people, according to the Runnymede Trust. Black people are almost three times as likely as white people to live in social housing, the census shows, with minority ethnic households more likely to experience homelessness or live in poor quality, unsuitable or overcrowded homes. So Starmer’s pledge was welcomed by BAME community leaders and race equality experts, as well as his own MPs. But the years passed, and despite attempts to reassure that the party was still committed to one, there was no draft law, and concerns began to mount. At the same time, Starmer has faced a reckoning over his handling of the Forde report, and the scrapping of democratic structures for BAME Labour members, while the party has been criticised for its failure to select more minority ethnic candidates. Labour’s cautious approach to policy ahead of the election – including over its green investment plan and, this weekend, reform of social care and the House of Lords – had worried some that it could also hold back on other big reforms. So the confirmation of what a race equality act would look like under a Labour government, after years of regressive and harmful policies from successive governments, will no doubt be welcomed. Yet it is unlikely to be enough, with experts such as the Runnymede Trust arguing that it falls short of addressing the formidable scale of inequalities that people of colour face. “Committing to address structural racial inequality needs to understand that racism doesn’t simply arise when the system fails – but that racism is actually sewn into the very fabric of the system itself,” the trust said. That is the real challenge for a future Labour government: can it bring together an ambitious, cross-governmental approach backed up with sustained investment to address the unacceptable, and in some cases worsening, disparities that exist? And not just because it is good for economic growth – a key tenet of its argument for bringing in a new race relations act – but because it is the right thing to do.",Race; Equal pay; Labour; Politics; Keir Starmer; UK news; Doreen Lawrence; Society,World news
2024-02-19T18:00:18Z,Humza Yousaf likens Labour to Margaret Thatcher over oil and gas plans,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/19/humza-yousaf-labour-margaret-thatcher-oil-and-gas-windfall-tax-plans,"Humza Yousaf has accused Labour of behaving like Margaret Thatcher by throwing oil and gas workers “on the scrapheap”, as he announced the Scottish National party would not back proposals for extending the fossil fuel windfall tax. In a campaign speech delivered in Aberdeen, the UK’s oil capital, Scotland’s first minister accused Labour of risking 100,000 jobs after Keir Starmer promised a “proper” windfall tax on oil and gas firms this month when he scaled back his party’s £28bn green investment pledge. Yousaf, who later told journalists he favoured maintaining the energy profits levy at the current 75% level, said in his speech: “Don’t get me wrong, we support a windfall tax but Labour’s plans to increase this to pay for nuclear energy power plants in England is plain wrong and will cost tens of thousands of jobs. “There is no justice in a transition that throws north-east workers on the scrapheap. The SNP will not let the north-east go the way that coal and mining towns went under Thatcher – that is exactly what Labour is threatening to do.” If elected, Labour intends to raise the levy from 75% to 78% and extend it to 2029 to help pay for its green spending plans. But Yousaf said the plans “to raid the north-east energy industry” meant that anger in the sector had “reached new levels”. Meanwhile, a body representing the offshore oil and gas industry, Offshore Energy UK, announced it would hold “emergency summits” this week in Aberdeen and London to discuss the proposals, which it described as “deeply concerning”. Yousaf’s attempts to appeal to the oil industry, which has been increasingly sceptical of the Scottish government’s plans for transition to net zero, its opposition to further exploration and its partnership with the Scottish Greens, were dismissed by opposition leaders as “breathtaking hypocrisy”. Later on Monday, the Scottish Greens’ climate and energy spokesperson, Mark Ruskell, described the SNP leader’s comments as “a little alarmist”. Interviewed on BBC Radio Scotland, Ruskell said he did agree that “where a windfall tax is levied we need to spend it on a transition in Scotland for oil and gas workers” rather than “propping up the development of new nuclear power stations in England”. Yousaf’s intervention came a day after Starmer’s speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, where the Labour leader promised work in the sector would continue “for decades to come” in an attempt to defuse the growing backlash from the industry. A joint letter published last week from more than 800 oil, engineering and business executives suggested the levy could cost up to 100,000 North Sea jobs and likened the potential impact of the windfall tax to the forced closure of coalmines by Thatcher’s government in the 1980s. Earlier at the conference, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, defended the proposals, arguing it was essential to Labour’s strategy to invest in the transition to net zero, boost Britain’s ailing industrial and energy infrastructure and fund a “British jobs bonus” to create green jobs. The shadow Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, described Yousaf’s position as “completely incoherent and out of touch”. “It beggars belief that Humza Yousaf thinks that a person earning more than £28,500 deserves to pay more tax but energy giants earning billions in profits from soaring bills should pay less,” he said. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, accused Yousaf of “masquerading as a friend of Scotland’s oil and gas industry”, saying: “The SNP have a longstanding ‘presumption against’ policy on all new oil and gas licences, they oppose Rosebank, [and] they were the first party to call for a windfall tax.”",Humza Yousaf; Scottish politics; Oil and gas companies; Labour; Scottish National party (SNP); Politics; Energy industry; Scotland; Aberdeen; UK news; Margaret Thatcher; Business; Fossil fuels,Politics
2024-05-23T04:00:10Z,"Economy, health, migration and more: key battlegrounds in the UK election",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/23/key-battlegrounds-uk-election-economy-health-migration,"Rishi Sunak has sought to frame the Conservatives as the party of the future and one that can be trusted with the economy and national security. The prime minister, who once billed himself as the “change candidate” and unsuccessfully tried to distance himself from years of Conservative rule, now claims his party’s experience in government makes it more likely than Labour to have a secure plan for the future. With Keir Starmer’s party topping the polls, this guide takes you through what the key issues are with voters and how those battles are likely to play out. The economy Sunak promised to grow the economy and halve inflation, which he has just about managed to achieve. But the cost of living crisis has hugely affected the working class across all political affiliations, from the “Essex man” to the typical “progressive activist” – all voters whom Labour hopes to win over – while national debt remains at levels not seen since 1960s. The prime minister has been waiting for inflation to fall to prove he can be trusted with the nation’s economic security and that his plan to make things better for the hardest-hit has worked. But recent polls suggest Labour outscores the Conservatives for being the party believed to represent working families and is more trusted with the economy. According to the More in Common thinktank, 65% of voters believe the Tories are for rich people. The NHS The health service is on its knees, with overworked staff, record waiting lists and crumbling hospitals. The Conservatives have struggled to resolve junior doctor strikes. Issues around rural healthcare have bubbled up in traditional Tory leafy seats, with older people struggling to access services. Disparities in maternal healthcare, which disproportionately affect voters in urban areas, have been neglected. In every constituency, hospitals lack funding and the ability to adapt to the country’s evolving healthcare needs. Migration The broader electoral landscape has shifted since Sunak made it one of his priorities to “stop the boats”, with no firm date for achieving this. The government’s Rwanda bill became law only last month, and the number of small boat crossings this year is already approaching 10,000. Keir Starmer has ramped up his migration messaging by vowing to launch a new border security command force to reduce Channel crossings. This issue will be a concern for “red wall” voters but also older Tory supporters in areas such as Yorkshire and the Humber, who usually have a negative view of immigration. Housing At least 1.5 million homeowners are feeling the effects of the Conservatives’ 2022 mini-budget, with mortgage repayments having gone up by hundreds of pounds. The Conservatives have been unable to meet a target of building 300,000 new homes each year in England by the mid-2020s, and have failed to close loopholes for unfair and illegal evictions of renters. There were concerns over Starmer’s decision not to include any form of housing policy in his recent six pledges. However, he has insisted that delivering affordable housing is integral to his mission. While Labour is understood to be considering its offer to renters, its plan to ensure 50% of all new homes are affordable while protecting green spaces has gone down well with progressive voters, who typically live in urban constituencies. Climate crisis The environment has been a major dividing line between the main parties, with Sunak’s hostility towards net zero at odds with Labour’s more progressive approach. The prime minister has overseen the rollback of key climate policies, including a delay to the phase-out of fossil fuel cars and the scrapping of HS2’s northern leg. Labour has argued that tackling the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis are one and the same. It suggests policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as insulating homes and boosting renewable energy, also bring down energy bills, while green growth attracts investment and new jobs. Starmer controversially U-turned on his £28bn green investment plan in February, cutting planned investment in half after warnings from senior aides that the Tories would weaponise the issue at the general election. Education and childcare Britain is in the middle of a childcare crisis, with parents struggling to access the government’s offer of funded places across the country – a policy introduced to gazump Labour’s own. A number of households, even on above-average incomes, have found themselves having to adjust their working hours in order to look after their children, and more young people than ever are opting to have children later in life so they can afford childcare providers. Voters will want to know what plans the parties have to help ease the burden. They will also want to know what the plan is to improve working conditions and pay for teachers, who are quitting in record numbers, and whether educational institutions such as state schools and universities will be given the funding they so desperately deserve. The prime minister has been criticised by senior Conservatives for not flaunting the party’s record on education, with many crediting the rise in England’s literacy and numeracy rates to its polices. Culture wars Rishi Sunak’s premiership has been dominated by MPs on his own benches pouring petrol on the fire of Britain’s culture wars, with a focus on transgender rights, mental health and supposedly “woke” universities. These issues are highlighted in an attempt to woo traditional “blue wall” seats such as Wokingham, but research has found undecided voters are generally repulsed by politicians’ attempts to jump on the bandwagon of culture war messages.",General election 2024; Economic policy; NHS; Health policy; Immigration and asylum; Housing; Education policy; Childcare; Conservatives; Labour; Politics; UK news,Politics
2021-10-28T09:00:07Z,Backers of UK airport expansion are part of UN green investment scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/28/backers-of-uk-airport-expansion-are-part-of-un-green-investment-scheme,"Investors funding bids to expand UK airports have been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged they are signatories to a UN green investment scheme. Members of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) scheme, who number more than 4,000, publicly commit to acting in “the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries”, including incorporating environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making. But analysis by the environmental investigation group DeSmog has found that 13 signatories to the scheme are also investors in UK airports with expansion plans, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Bristol. The investigation found that at least one investor in each of the seven airports seeking to expand is involved in the scheme, including four out of five of Bristol airport’s shareholders and four out of Heathrow’s seven. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the main pension provider for the British higher education sector, is a Heathrow investor at the same time as being part of PRI’s “Leaders’ Group”, which celebrates “responsible investment excellence”. Sam Pickard, a climate and sustainability researcher at the Overseas Development Institute thinktank, said: “This analysis shows – yet again – the gulf between the finance sector’s actions and its rhetoric. Investments that unlock decades of future carbon emissions in rich countries are the complete opposite of what is required for creating shared prosperity in the face of the climate emergency.” Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace, said the findings raised “really serious questions” for initiatives such as PRI. “We know airport expansion, particularly in Europe and the UK is totally incompatible with any kind of serious climate ambition.” He added: “Basically, every week there’s a new investor alliance or coalition that says their climate credentials are amazing and they’re still ploughing money into the same old high-carbon activity from airports to coal.” He said it was “essential” that groups such as PRI “re-evaluate their membership criteria”. Otherwise, he warned, “they risk being nothing more than a smokescreen or a meaningless badge for investors to hide behind”. The UK government recently concluded a consultation on how to achieve a net zero aviation sector by 2050. The Climate Change Committee, an independent body advising the government, has recommended that no net increase in airport expansion should be allowed unless the industry “sufficiently outperforms” its current emissions trajectory, following previous warnings that the sector could consume as much as two-thirds of the country’s 1.5C carbon budget if left unchecked. The PRI, which was started in 2006 under the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, describes itself as the “world’s leading proponent of responsible investment” and its chief executive recently called for a “sustainable and inclusive recovery from Covid-19”. But it has been criticised for not setting strict enough membership criteria. Last year, for the first time, five investors were removed for failing to meet minimum requirements. The scheme does not have a defined policy on aviation investment but last year released a statement with Climate Action 100+, another green investment initiative, in which it defined expectations for the sector, including setting 2050 net zero emissions targets and strategies to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels. Fiona Reynolds, the chief executive of PRI, told the Guardian it was “committed to driving investor action to help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement to reach a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050 or sooner”. Reaching that goal, she said, “requires near-term action and innovation across all sectors”, including aviation. But, she added: “The PRI is not responsible for – nor can it monitor – every individual investment in its more than 4,300 signatories’ portfolios. They must be monitored by the investor, in line with their own investment beliefs, investor duties, commitments and policies.” Reynolds said it was “continuing to strengthen our minimum requirements” and the investment reporting systems. Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said UK airports were “at the forefront” of global aviation decarbonisation efforts. “They were driving forces behind UK aviation’s commitment to net zero by 2050 – a world first for a national aviation sector – alongside a clear roadmap towards achieving that target.

2024-02-21T14:14:01Z,Stakes are high as SNP and Labour wrestle over Gaza ceasefire call,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/21/stakes-are-high-as-snp-and-labour-wrestle-over-gaza-ceasefire-call,"A few days after the Hamas atrocities of 7 October, Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, attended a service of solidarity at a synagogue near Glasgow. He embraced the mother of Bernard Cowan, a Scot killed by Hamas at the kibbutz where he had settled. “Your grief is my grief,” he told her. Later that day, the SNP leader spoke to journalists at Bute House in Edinburgh: he described movingly the plight of his in-laws, who had become trapped under Israeli bombardment while visiting relatives in Gaza. He became one of the first senior political voices in the UK to call for a ceasefire on both sides to allow humanitarian aid into the territory. It’s worth remembering this context ahead of the debate on the SNP’s motion, which reiterates that call for an immediate ceasefire, five months on and more than 29,000 deaths later. This is a matter of huge personal resonance for Yousaf, but his Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, has led on it in the Commons, returning to the matter again and again at prime minister’s questions. Party sources say this unity of purpose is a reflection of what SNP politicians – at Westminster and Holyrood – are seeing every day in their inboxes and hearing on the doorstep, as voters become increasingly horrified by what has unfolded in Gaza. Discussion of the motion has been dominated by the impact it could have on Labour, with concerns they could see a repeat of last November’s rebellion, also prompted by a similar SNP motion, in which 56 MPs rejected Keir Starmer’s more cautious stance. After Scottish Labour unequivocally backed calls for an immediate ceasefire at their conference in Glasgow last weekend, Starmer used his speech there to indicate an incremental shift in position, and a Labour amendment to the SNP motion published on Tuesday now calls for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. Meanwhile, senior Labour figures have accused the SNP of failing to build consensus, behaviour condemned as “deplorable” by the shadow Scottish secretary, Ian Murray, and of playing politics with a complex international crisis. By including a reference to Israel engaging in the “collective punishment” of the Palestinian people, say critics, the SNP deliberately makes it impossible for other parties to lend their support. There have been reports that, because of uneasiness about this particular language, Starmer will order Labour MPs to abstain from the SNP motion. But the SNP insists it has been working with groups of Labour MPs known to support an immediate ceasefire, and argues that Murray and Lisa Nandy’s call to support a Labour-amended motion that “everyone can get behind” risks ending up with a lowest common denominator view that has no international impact. As Flynn, writing for Guardian Opinion on Wednesday morning, says: “No one is pretending that one vote at Westminster will magically result in a ceasefire overnight. But a ceasefire is more likely to happen if the UK parliament and government join international pressure.” The party says this is entirely consistent with the position it has taken from those early days after the Hamas attacks – unlike Labour and the UK government. They believe that voters have appreciated the leadership Yousaf has shown – he has garnered praise from some of his most ardent critics for what they have described as his dignity and moral courage. But in an election year as high stakes as this for the SNP, with Scottish Labour toe to toe in the polls, this motion could have significance well beyond the machinations of Commons process. In his first campaign speech of the new year, Yousaf insisted that Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland” to win the general election, arguing that voting in more SNP MPs would “keep him honest”, and offering to “work constructively” with a Labour government to prevent backsliding on green investment or the creeping privatisation of the NHS. Regardless of the outcome of this afternoon’s vote, the SNP will use it to strengthen that argument.",Scottish National party (SNP); Humza Yousaf; Labour; Scotland; UK news; Politics; Scottish politics; Gaza; Israel-Gaza war; World news; Palestinian territories; Middle East and north Africa,Politics
2022-02-02T15:41:37Z,EU includes gas and nuclear in guidebook for ‘green’ investments,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/eu-guidebook-taxonomy-green-investments-gas-nuclear-included,"The European Commission has been accused of undermining its climate goals after it defied critics by pushing ahead with plans to include gas and nuclear in an EU guidebook for “green” investments. Gas and nuclear were deemed bridge technologies to meet the EU’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, in long-awaited proposals on the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”, which were published on Wednesday. “The reason we are including gas and nuclear in the way we are doing it is because we firmly believe that this recognises the need for these energy sources in transition,” the EU commissioner for financial services, Mairead McGuinness, told reporters. Critics said including gas and nuclear in a guide intended to prevent greenwashing jeopardised the EU’s climate goals and hopes of keeping global heating below 1.5C. “The European Commission is significantly undermining the EU’s credibility as a climate actor,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “At the UN climate summit in Glasgow, small steps were taken towards phasing out fossil fuels. Yet, unfortunately, the commission is already turning back the clock and leaving the door open to the gas industry.” Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, said: “The EU taxonomy was envisioned as a vital tool to align financial flows with the Paris agreement. Instead, Europe is undermining its climate leadership and lowering standards in the EU and beyond. When a gold standard does emerge elsewhere, this taxonomy will be left behind.” Since the proposals leaked on New Year’s Eve 2021 – fuelling bitter accusations of a lack of transparency – the commission has made minor tweaks that make it easier for gas projects to get in the green guidebook. Gas plants can get the stamp of approval if they switch to low-carbon gases or renewables by 2035. A previous requirement to phase-in low-carbon fuels by 2026 has been dropped. The taxonomy – intended to channel billions of private money into climate-friendly investments – is fast becoming one of the biggest controversies of Ursula von der Leyen’s tenure as European Commission president. Last month Greta Thunberg and climate activists slammed the plans as “fake climate action” that flout scientific advice. In a further sign of anger, campaign group Avaaz staged a mock burial of the taxonomy on a roundabout outside the commission headquarters, with activists wearing face masks of Von der Leyen, Germany’s Olaf Scholz and France’s Emmanuel Macron. France pressured Von der Leyen to grant the stamp of approval for nuclear power, while Germany had lobbied for the inclusion of gas, although Scholz’s coalition government is split on the issue. “Europe is witnessing our biggest setback yet in our moonshot mission,” said Patricia Martín Díaz of Avaaz. “Labelling fossil gas and nuclear as green is incompatible with the EU’s 2050 climate targets and our hope of keeping 1.5C alive.” The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 375 funds holding €51tn assets under management, also urged the commission to drop gas, citing International Energy Agency studies that show Europe’s existing gas plants will have to close by 2035. “Put simply, there is no remaining carbon budget for new investments in natural gas,” the group said. Other critics include an expert panel convened by the commission, which said the plans were “not in line” with the original regulation, agreed in July 2020. In its stinging rebuke, the EU platform on sustainable finance – a group that includes industry, NGO and finance experts from EU institutions – said they had doubts about the criteria for gas and nuclear, while “many are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts that may result”. The group said only gas plants emitting less than 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour over their lifecycle should be allowed, a criteria that excludes conventional gas. In contrast, the commission would allow gas plants emitting 270g CO2e/kWh to be classed as “sustainable” until 2030. A second alternative would allow gas plants that emit an average of 550g CO2 e/kWh over a twenty-year lifespan. Critics describe this as loophole that allows new gas plants to be built on a promise of carbon capture technology that is yet to take off. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Critics have accused the commission of abusing the process, by smuggling in the controversial issues of nuclear and gas into the latest delegated act, rather than drafting a separate law. Only a supermajority of 20 out of 27 EU member states, or a majority of the European parliament’s 705 MEPs can now defeat the plans during a scrutiny period of four to six months that began on Wednesday. Commission officials played down the threat of a legal challenge from Austria and Luxembourg, describing it as “a very theoretical discussion”. Both countries oppose nuclear power, while Green ministers in the German coalition government have dismissed the plans as greenwashing. Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands had urged the commission not to label gas as green, while Germany declared its opposition to nuclear. Yet France, backed by central and eastern European member states, lobbied Von der Leyen to include gas and nuclear, which they consider as a bridge to the EU’s net zero future. The largest group in the European parliament, the European People’s party has come out in favour of gas, underscoring the difficulties of defeating the plans. “Flexibility is needed in the way we decarbonise. If, for example, Poland would like to replace a coal plant with several small gas plants, this should be possible if it helps achieve climate neutrality”, Esther de Lange, a Dutch Christian Democrat, said. Lisa Fischer, who leads the E3G thinktank’s work on climate neutral energy systems, said gas and nuclear had no place in the taxonomy. “Gas investments are not only harmful to the climate they are also increasingly financially risky. Nuclear makes the EU’s energy transition more costly than it needs to be.” In a sign of the intense arguments, McGuinness revealed that had been no unanimity among the commission’s top 27 officials; she said an “overwhelming majority” of EU commissioners had backed the plans. “We were legally obliged to do this,” she said referring back to the initial July 2020 law. Opponents in national capitals, however, say the commission had no obligation to include gas or nuclear.",Energy; European Commission; Climate crisis; Environment; Gas; Nuclear power; European Union; Europe; Fossil fuels; World news; Business; Fossil fuel divestment,Environment
2023-08-23T05:01:02Z,"UK needs Dragons’ Den approach to investing in net zero, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/23/uk-needs-dragons-den-approach-investing-net-zero-thinktank,"The UK risks losing out to the US and EU in the global race to a net zero economy unless the government increases green investment by taking a stake in the companies of the future, a thinktank has said. The left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research said Britain needed a “national investment fund” (NIF) that would back new firms and secure a share of any future profits for the public as it called for the state to adopt a “Dragons’ Den” type approach to supporting enterprises. The IPPR said the UK needed its own version of Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – which offers US federal government subsidies to support clean energy, infrastructure and green jobs – and the EU’s proposed green deal industrial plan. Simone Gasperin, an associate fellow at the IPPR, said: “The national investment fund is a policy proposal for our time. The UK needs to finance and coordinate strategic industrial policy projects that will deliver a net zero transition through economic prosperity and inclusion. “The cost of inaction on people’s livelihoods will be too high, while there are huge opportunities to be captured by the government co-investing with private companies.” Under the thinktank’s proposal, the NIF would provide finance for investment in the green industrial sector, with the aim of encouraging private companies to make investments they might otherwise be reluctant to make. The IPPR said the plan would strengthen the UK’s manufacturing sector and help level up the economy. Governments of left and right have been reluctant to back the idea of the state taking a strategic stake in private firms since the 1970s. The National Enterprise Board created by the Labour government in 1975 ended up primarily concerned with keeping loss-making firms afloat and generated a longstanding aversion in Whitehall to “picking winners”. Keir Starmer has vowed to launch a publicly owned clean energy company, which may invest in emerging technologies, in its first year of government if Labour gains power. The IPPR said it was important to revive the idea of an active, modern industrial strategy. Initial funding to the NIF would be provided by the Treasury, but it would be further supported by tax revenues from North Sea gas and oil, or by levies which the thinktank said should be imposed on share dividends and “buybacks”. This would divert excess profits from fossil fuel activities into productive investments in a future green economy, it added. In exchange for the financial backing, the state would become a part-owner of the business and share in its success and future profits. The IPPR said this would be analogous to the sort of investment provided to budding entrepreneurs by tycoons in the Dragons’ Den BBC TV series. In its report, the thinktank said that “in the global green race to reap the benefits of the transition to a net zero economy, the UK is at severe risk of being left behind. While other countries recognise the need for green investment and industrial policy, the UK government is sitting on the sidelines.”",Green economy; Green jobs; Business; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Thinktanks; Manufacturing sector; UK news,Environment
2024-05-16T23:01:21Z,Union urges Labour not to ban new North Sea licences without plan for jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/17/union-urges-labour-not-to-ban-new-north-sea-licences-without-plan-for-jobs,"The UK’s oil and gas workers risk becoming “the coal miners of our generation,” Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has warned, urging Labour not to ban new North Sea licences without a clear plan to safeguard jobs. Unite is launching a billboard campaign in six Scottish constituencies aimed at persuading Keir Starmer to commit more investment to north-east Scotland, the centre of the offshore oil and gas industry. Unless Labour can show it will protect jobs and communities, it should be willing to continue issuing new licences for oil and gas exploration, Unite argues. The slogan for the union’s campaign is “No Ban Without A Plan”. “They are at risk of becoming the coal miners of our generation,” Graham said. “We only have to look at what’s happened in the coal towns. I’m the daughter of mining stock – my family’s from the north-east, lots of them were miners. And it’s decimation in some of these places. They’ve never recovered. And the difference is, we know this time – we can see it coming down the track.” The shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband, has promised to base Labour’s planned state-backed green power firm, Great British Energy, in Scotland. And part of Labour’s £7bn “wealth fund” will be earmarked for wind power. But Unite, which was Labour’s biggest donor in the 2019 general election, wants to see more specific pledges of investment in green technologies in north-east Scotland. Graham said Unite research suggested that £6bn over six years would be needed to kickstart wind turbine manufacture in the region. “You should not be letting go of one rope before you’ve got hold of another,” she said. “My main thing is that I cannot allow these workers to be sacrificed on the altar of net zero.” She claimed a clear offer on jobs and investment would help Labour make much-hoped-for gains in Scotland. “Labour would be the heroes of the hour. Why wouldn’t you do that?” she said. Most of the seats in which Unite is running its No Ban Without a Plan campaign – or their predecessors before boundary changes – are held by the SNP with comfortable majorities. Two are Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, and Aberdeen North. Despite the imperative for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, some unions expressed alarm last year when Labour first announced that it would not issue new licences for oil and gas exploration. The GMB general secretary, Gary Smith, called the decision naive. Starmer responded by saying to the GMB’s conference last June: “What I will never let happen is a repeat of what happened in coal mining where an industry came to an end and nobody had planned for the future.” But Labour went on to drop its £28bn-a-year green investment pledge, sparking concerns among unions and environmental campaigners about whether it had set aside sufficient resources to smooth the transition to a net-zero economy. Chaitanya Kumar, of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “The oil and gas industry is ultimately a threat to us all and needs to be scaled down considerably. But ensuring a fair transition deal for workers is non-negotiable. Fortunately, Labour still have the time to come up with a plan without compromising on its commitment to stop new drilling of fossil fuels.” According to industry estimates cited by the campaign group Uplift, which calls for a “rapid and fair” transition away from oil and gas in the UK, the sector supports 200,000 jobs either directly or indirectly, in the supply chain – a third fewer than a decade ago, as output has declined over time. Uplift director Tessa Khan said any government should work with local communities to manage the shift away from fossil fuels. “This part of the climate energy transition is going to require a huge amount of industrial change, and we absolutely cannot afford to victimise or throw communities under the bus,” she said. A Labour source said: “Labour has a non-negotiable commitment to a proud future for the North Sea. We will deliver the most significant investment in the North Sea in a generation as we pursue our mission for energy independence and lower bills. “If the Conservatives in Westminster and the SNP in Holyrood are re-elected they will continue to sell out workers and communities by leaving the industry without a plan for the future, as they have done for the last 14 years.” Graham has made workplace battles on pay and conditions, rather than internal Labour politics, the centrepiece of her leadership since succeeding Len McCluskey, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, three years ago. However, she has previously pushed for stronger commitments from Labour on protecting jobs in the steel sector, and she attended a crunch meeting this week on the party’s policy on workers’ rights. Jamie Peters, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Two things are clear as we head towards the next general election. Firstly, any incoming government must accelerate our shift to a clean energy system, including no new oil and gas in the North Sea. This is the bottom line if we’re to meet our climate goals and stem the very worst of climate breakdown. “And secondly, the transition must be designed in a way that’s fair, with workers and new jobs in emerging green industries at its heart, ensuring that no one gets left behind as we build a brighter future. What we’re yet to see is a plan for a cleaner Britain that’s equal parts rapid, ambitious and fair.”",Oil; Gas; Business; Unite; UK news; Politics; Trade unions; Scotland; Labour; Commodities; Renewable energy; Energy; Environment,Business
2024-03-05T05:01:00Z,"UK spends least among major European economies on low-carbon energy policy, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/05/uk-spends-least-among-major-european-economies-on-low-carbon-energy-policy-study-shows,"The UK spends less on low-carbon energy policy than any other major European economy, analysis has shown, despite evidence that such spending could lower household bills and increase economic growth more than the tax cuts the government has planned. Spending on low-carbon measures for the three years from April 2020 to the end of April 2023 was about $33.3bn (£26.2bn) in total for the UK, the lowest out of the top five European economies, according to an analysis by Greenpeace of data from the International Energy Agency. Italy topped the table for western European economies, having spent $111bn in the period. Germany spent $92.7bn, France $64.5bn and Spain about $51.3bn. The data includes spending on electricity networks, energy efficiency, innovation on fuels and technology, low-carbon and efficient transport and low-carbon electricity. In addition to spending on these measures, all the countries spent substantial amounts on holding down energy bills for households, in many cases more than was spent on low-carbon measures. The UK spent about $42bn on energy affordability in the period, through measures such as the energy bills rebate and payments and discounts for the vulnerable. Only about $13.3bn was spent on energy efficiency for homes and industry, $12.8bn on low-carbon transport and less than $6bn on renewable electricity and innovation in the UK. When spending on energy affordability was stripped out, per capita spending was also much lower in the UK, at just under $500 per person across the three years, compared with more than $950 in France, $1,115 in Germany and $1,880 in Italy. On Wednesday, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, will deliver the last budget of this parliament, which is likely to centre on tax cuts that economists have said will mainly benefit better-off people. Hunt is expected to devote little resource to energy or green issues, despite a growing body of evidence and expert opinion suggesting that government spending is needed to kickstart the UK’s flagging economy and dismal productivity, and that green spending could provide a greater boost than tax cuts. Bob Ward, the policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “There is now very clear evidence that the UK has been investing much less than its competitors across a range of areas, including on tackling climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. “This low investment explains why productivity has stagnated in the UK and growth has been so feeble. It also explains why our homes and businesses are vulnerable to climate change impacts, our countryside and seas are becoming depleted of wildlife, our cities have dirty air, and our rivers and beaches are covered in sewage.” A study from the LSE earlier this year found that investing about £26bn a year in the low-carbon economy would reduce household bills, attract about twice as much additional investment from the private sector, and do more to boost the economy than tax cuts. Georgia Whitaker, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the UK was losing out to international rivals in the race for the economy of the future. “It’s clear that despite the government’s bluster, we are utterly failing on the world stage when it comes to green investment. Not only are the US and China leaving us in the dust in the race on green technology, we’re also doing terribly compared to our European neighbours,” she said. She called instead for a green industrial strategy and infrastructure investment. “Jeremy Hunt should use the spring budget to address this embarrassing failure, but instead he’s flirting with tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest. Meanwhile, the rest of us struggle on with the cost of living,” she said. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “This report fails to recognise our progress compared to European allies. We are the first major economy in the world to halve our emissions, and we have the second largest renewables capacity in Europe. “We have a clear strategy to boost UK industry and reach net zero by 2050 – backed by £300bn in low carbon investment since 2010.”",Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenpeace; Europe; Environment; World news; Tax and spending; UK news; Energy efficiency; Green politics; Budget 2024 (spring); Budget,Environment
2024-02-14T18:29:57Z,The Guardian view on shifting party allegiances: Labour’s routine poll leads hide great volatility | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/14/the-guardian-view-on-shifting-party-allegiances-labours-routine-poll-leads-hide-great-volatility,"British politics has been characterised by a combination of turbulence and stagnation for a number of years. The country has had three prime ministers in two years, all from a party that has been in power since 2010. For as long as Rishi Sunak has been in Downing Street, opinion polls have shown the Conservatives trailing far enough behind Labour to suggest that Sir Keir Starmer will take over at the next general election. Yet the opposition radiates insecurity about this advantage. There is both firmness and brittleness about the Starmer project. Cracks have reached the surface in recent weeks, first with the messy dismantling of a flagship green investment policy, then with the even messier repudiation of two parliamentary candidates embroiled in rows about antisemitism. Whether that wobble will have a sustained impact on national polling is hard to foresee. It will affect the Commons in the short term because one of the renounced prospective MPs, Azhar Ali, is running in the Rochdale byelection in two weeks. Now there will be no official Labour candidate on the ballot paper. There is less controversy clouding two byelections this Thursday, but those contests also express features of the underlying instability in British politics. Kingswood, in South Gloucestershire, is up for grabs because the incumbent Tory MP, Chris Skidmore, resigned in protest over Mr Sunak’s retreat from carbon reduction policies. The race for Wellingborough, in Northamptonshire, was triggered after the parliamentary standards commissioner upheld complaints of bullying and sexual misconduct against Peter Bone, formerly the area’s Conservative MP. Boundary changes mean that Kingswood constituency will cease to exist at the next general election. The Conservatives appear to have written it off. By contrast, the Tory majority of 18,540 in Wellingborough ought to put it beyond reach. It is made vulnerable by disaffection with a long-incumbent ruling party, exacerbated by the selection of Mr Bone’s partner as the local candidate. One significant variable in this Thursday’s ballots will be the performance of Reform UK, successor to the Brexit party. Another will be the extent of tactical voting by Liberal Democrat supporters aiming to maximise punishment for the Tories. The combination of those forces, extrapolated nationwide, could make the difference between narrow defeat and colossal rout for the Tories in a general election. Mr Sunak could shed votes left, right and centre, as voters with very disparate motivations seek the most efficient route to regime change. Labour might be propelled into power by this anti-Tory momentum, but it will not reflect much enthusiasm for Sir Keir’s prospectus. Labour is benefiting from structural incoherence in the voter coalition that Boris Johnson assembled to win the 2019 election, while also embedding analogous faultlines in its own electoral bloc. Partly that is a normal function of building a parliamentary majority, especially given Britain’s electoral system. But large political parties should offer points of common interest and unifying belief to bind diverse voters with a sense of stable common allegiance. Mr Sunak has failed to do that. Sir Keir is already struggling, despite the appearance of a safe path to victory. The coming byelections will no doubt send a clear signal of national frustration with the Tories. But the consistency of that message belies a profound volatility that makes the task of governing Britain challenging for any prime minister. • This article was amended on 16 February 2024.

2024-06-20T22:10:27Z,Former Tory minister vows to vote Labour over party’s climate failures,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/20/former-tory-minister-vows-to-vote-labour-over-tories-climate-failures,"The Conservatives’ former net zero tsar has revealed that he intends to vote Labour for the first time because Rishi Sunak has been “siding with climate deniers” to politicise the energy transition. Writing exclusively in the Guardian, Chris Skidmore, a former energy minister, said he could not back the Tories, who had argued that net zero was “a burden and not a benefit”, a decision that he said would cost it votes. In a deeply personal attack, he accused the prime minister of breaking the consensus of the past on climate action to “seek division and polarisation”, suggesting it was the “greatest tragedy” of his premiership. “Worse still has been the rhetoric and extreme tone that has sought to politicise net zero as being forced upon people, a false narrative that is either the product of ignorance, or deliberate misinformation,” he said. The former Tory MP, who attended cabinet in his previous role, becomes the most senior figure yet to switch his support to Labour, after a small handful of Tory backbench defections, in a further blow to Sunak’s campaign. The prime minister has had yet another difficult week, with four polls suggesting the Tories were on track to suffer their worst ever defeat and senior cabinet ministers projected to lose their seats. The polls, combined with warnings from Tory figures that Labour would have unchecked power if it won a large majority, have raised suspicions that the party is now engaged in damage limitation rather than trying to win. He has become mired in a row over alleged betting on the general election date after it emerged that a second Conservative candidate and the party’s campaigns director were being looked into by the Gambling Commission. The watchdog is examining bets allegedly placed by Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate in Bristol North West, and her husband, Tony Lee, who is now on leave of absence from his job at party headquarters. Sunak told a BBC Question Time audience on Thursday night that he was “incredibly angry” about the Tory betting allegations first revealed by the Guardian. “I want to be crystal clear that … if anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative party,” he said. Last week the Guardian revealed that the prime minister’s closest parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, placed a £100 bet with Ladbrokes on a July poll, three days before Sunak announced the date. Sunak has been widely criticised for allowing new oil and gas licences, doing too little to improve the condition of the UK’s rivers and beaches, which are filthy with raw sewage, and, while vowing to stick to net zero, dismantling many of the policies – on electric vehicles, boilers, public transport – needed to get there. Skidmore, who resigned as a Tory MP in January in protest at the party’s dash for oil and gas, triggering a byelection in his Kingswood seat that Labour won, had been a leading voice within the Tory party on green issues. He was the energy minister who signed into law the former prime minister Theresa May’s “net zero by 2050” pledge. More recently, he led the government’s net zero review, which was published in September 2022. In his article for the Guardian, he criticised Sunak’s decisions to prioritise new oil and gas licences, scale back measures that would have saved households billions in energy bills and “pass on” the huge economic opportunities of transition. But his sharpest criticism was reserved for what he suggested were the prime minister’s attempts to transform net zero into a culture war issue in a bid to draw dividing lines with the Labour party before the election. “No one is in the pay of Just Stop Oil or Putin. No one has ever been told they must remove their boilers, or replace their petrol cars, for the energy transition is just that: a moderate transition from the past towards the future.” Skidmore said previous Tory governments had understood that change would be required to reach net zero climate targets and needed to be carefully managed and incentivised. “Rishi Sunak’s decision instead to side with climate deniers and to deliberately politicise the energy transition, breaking the consensus of the past to seek division and polarisation, is perhaps the greatest tragedy of his premiership,” he said. “It has cost the UK not just environmentally, but economically, and it has cost the Conservative party the ability to demonstrate that it is the party of the environment and nature. “It is a decision that will cost votes, including my own. For the first time, I cannot vote for my party that has boasted of new oil and gas licences in its manifesto, or that now argues that net zero is a burden and not a benefit.” The former Conservative, who is now a professor, said he would now transfer his vote to Labour, which has pledged to deliver a “green industrial revolution” to meet net zero targets. Keir Starmer’s party has also faced criticism for cutting its £28bn green investment plans by half, infuriating environmental campaigners, who said it would push up costs in the long term and make it harder for Labour to reach ambitious green targets. However, Skidmore said: “Like many others who know that we have no choice, nor any more time, but to tackle the climate crisis now, I have decided that the Labour party is best placed to achieve [that]. For this reason, I will be voting Labour at this election. ”It is a decision that I know others have and will be making also … All Conservatives serious about delivering real change to reduce emissions and grow our economy should be thinking the same.” The shadow energy and climate secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “This endorsement shows that only Labour has the practical and ambitious plan needed to secure Britain’s energy supply, end the cost of living crisis, and grow our economy by investing in clean homegrown power for our country. “As even former Conservative ministers are now making clear, voters face a stark choice at this election: between a Conservative party that would leave our climate and our economy exposed, and a Labour party with a clear plan to grow our economy, make us energy-independent, cut bills for good, and tackle the climate crisis. “Labour’s plans, starting with Great British Energy, will make our country better off by cutting bills for families and seizing the industrial opportunities of net zero, bringing good jobs to our communities.”",General election 2024; General elections; Chris Skidmore; Environment; Conservatives; Labour; Politics; Green politics; Rishi Sunak; UK news,Politics
2024-01-21T12:30:36Z,"Public will be at risk if Labour drops £28bn green plan, warns fire union chief",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/public-risk-labour-drops-28bn-green-plan-fire-union-chief-matt-wrack,"The public will be put at risk if Keir Starmer drops his plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment, according to the head of the Fire Brigades Union, who warned that his members were already witnessing the effects of the climate crisis. Matt Wrack, the FBU’s general secretary, urged the Labour leader not to scale back or delay the party’s green scheme, which he said was essential for combating a steep increase in floods, wildfires and storms. Wrack called on Starmer to include mitigation measures such as flood defences in the plan as well as more long-term investment aimed at cutting carbon emissions. His intervention comes at the beginning of a key week for the future of the plan in which officials are to meet to debate whether it should go ahead. Wrack said: “If Labour doesn’t spend this money, it will put our members at risk, but it will also put communities at risk, especially in areas which are at risk of wildfires or major floods. It will increase the strain on the fire service and the risk to firefighters.” Firefighters have been dealing with rapidly rising numbers of floods and wildfires in recent years, which scientists say is a direct result of climate breakdown. In 2018 there were 65 wildfire incidents in Britain, according to the National Fire Chiefs Council. Three years later that had more than doubled to 178. Government data shows that flooding incidents in England have increased by nearly a quarter in the last decade. Wrack said his members were struggling to cope with the increase in extreme weather events, and that people were being put at risk as a result. Heavy rains from Storm Henk flooded about 2,000 homes earlier this year as a month’s worth of rainfell in just four days in some parts of the UK. “We are potentially leaving people in a dangerous and vulnerable position, for example with no power in their homes or stranded on the upper floor of a house when the ground floor is flooded,” he said. The government plans to spend just over £220m on flood defences this year, but Wrack wants Labour to use its green prosperity plan to increase that figure. “Part of the scheme needs to be about emergency planning and preparation,” he said. “We think the fire service can play a central role in that.” Starmer has said in recent weeks that he remains committed to the policy of spending £28bn on environmental investments by the second half of the parliament, though the figure will be limited by how much Labour can borrow while sticking to its strict fiscal rules. The party has promised to borrow only as much as it can while still being able to forecast that debt will start falling as a share of economic output in five years’ time. The Labour leader also used a meeting with union leaders last week to reassure them of his commitment to the scheme. However, Labour sources say Starmer and his allies are still willing to drop the policy before the election if they decide it is too much of a liability in an election campaign. The Conservatives are preparing to feature the Labour pledge heavily in their campaign material, arguing that it can be funded only by higher borrowing or more tax rises.",Labour; Firefighters; Climate crisis; Green politics; Politics; Keir Starmer; Matt Wrack; Trade unions; Flooding; Wildfires; Environment; UK news,Politics
2024-04-24T21:30:07Z,Labour promises rail nationalisation within five years of coming to power,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/24/labour-promises-rail-nationalisation-within-five-years-of-coming-to-power,"Labour will fully nationalise the train network within five years of coming to power, with a pledge to guarantee the cheapest fares as part of “the biggest reform of our railways for a generation”. One of Labour’s first major acts in government will bring all passenger rail into national ownership under Great British Railways as contracts with private operators expire, a plan endorsed by the architect of the Conservatives’ own rail plan. Labour will announce it plans to cut waste and claw back shareholder dividends, saving £2.2bn. It will establish a watchdog, the Passenger Standards Authority, to scrutinise the new system. Passengers will be offered best-price ticket guarantees, automatic delay repay and digital season tickets across the network. In a speech on Thursday, the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, will say renationalisation “is not going to be easy and it will take hard graft, but it will be my mission to get us to the right destination and to deliver for the Great British passenger”. Labour insiders hailed the announcement as the moment the party would begin to champion its more radical proposals in the run-up to an election campaign, after a number of U-turns including over green investment. They said Haigh’s plan was a key plank to counter the narrative that Labour had only meagre plans for reform, alongside policies on workers’ rights and planning. “We will show we will make bold policy changes where the current settlement is failing,” a Labour source said. “But this is not just ideology, this is a detailed plan for reform.” Haigh will bill rail reform as crucial to productivity and cost savings and to achieve Keir Starmer’s “five missions”, while criticising Conservative inaction. “It is passengers who pay the price, through being stranded because of cancellations, through being unable to work as they travel because there’s no internet, through overcrowded and unpleasant trains,” she will say. “And they also pay through the nose to prop up this failing system, with huge amounts wasted every year through today’s inefficient and fragmented rail network, and even more money leaking out to pay shareholder dividends.” However, the plans do not include nationalisation of privately owned freight or rolling stock companies, which trade unions have called for but which would cost billions. The party will argue that the public ownership plans will cost nothing in compensation to operators, who would transfer ownership once contracts expire, and save significant sums on bureaucracy and dividends to private operators. Haigh, one of the most left-leaning remaining members of the shadow cabinet with close links to the unions, has been able to protect her renationalisation policy despite intense lobbying efforts to water it down. The party’s new costings, shared with the Guardian, suggest full public ownership would save £2.2bn every year after five years, including the £1.5bn identified in the government’s own review from 2021 that said the simpler structure of Great British Railways would make operations cheaper. Labour estimates that consolidating the 14 separate train operating companies (Tocs) could reduce additional waste worth up to £680m a year, including saving dividends to Tocs’ shareholders and eliminating bidding costs. A range of rail industry figures welcomed Labour’s announcement, although private train firms were dismayed at confirmation that train operating contracts would be taken back into public hands as contracts expired. That pledge was strongly backed by the leader of the train drivers’ union Aslef, which on Tuesday announced a fresh set of strikes. Mick Whelan, its general secretary, said: “The commitment delivers for the economy, for the taxpayer, for passengers and for staff,” adding that privatisation had “allowed a few companies to make enormous profits, which have taken much-needed money out of the sector”. Keith Williams, who co-wrote the Conservative government’s Williams-Shapps plan for rail after the 2018 timetabling fiasco, said Labour’s plan would follow through on the “substance” of his recommendations to the government. “Running a better railway and driving revenue and reducing costs will deliver economic growth, jobs and housing by delivering better connectivity,” Williams said. Labour underlined that it would not extend renationalisation to the ownership of the actual trains, as urged by unions including the RMT, by publicising an endorsement by Mary Grant, the highly paid chief executive of the rolling stock leasing firm Porterbrook. She said it welcomed “the party’s commitment to leverage private capital to help deliver its long-term strategy for rolling stock”. The pledge to make railways reform an early priority was welcomed by Darren Caplan, the chief executive of the Railway Industry Association, which represents suppliers. He said: “[It] would give certainty to our members about the future structure of the railway industry.” Private train operators, however, argued that nationalisation was “a political rather than a practical solution which will increase costs over time”. Andy Bagnall, the chief executive of Rail Partners, which represents Tocs, said the kind of contract model used by Transport for London’s rail network or Manchester’s buses was the “best of both worlds”, adding: “Ejecting private train companies from the railway will create a prolonged and messy transition at a time when we need all parts of the railway to pull together.” A Labour source dismissed that proposal, saying: “We are making the case for a simplified railway. It saves a huge amount of money, waste and duplication. We don’t have to replicate the worst elements of the franchise model with none of the benefits.”",Labour; Transport policy; Rail transport; Rail industry; Politics; UK news; Business; Transport,Politics
2024-09-27T11:12:41Z,Net zero or not: will the next Tory leader embrace green agenda or oppose it?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/27/net-zero-next-tory-leader-embrace-green-agenda-oppose,"When the Conservatives gather in Birmingham this weekend for their first party conference out of government in 15 years, the environment is not likely to be top of most members’ minds, amid the fever of a leadership campaign. That is probably a good thing, many green-tinged Tory insiders feel. The leadership campaign is dominated by the right wing of the party, with the favourite, Robert Jenrick, slugging it out on issues such as immigration, Brexit and the “scourge of woke” with Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat. One former senior green Tory privately warns the campaign is “likely to be a race to the bottom – the candidates appear to have spent most of their time trying to out-populist each other”. But as the party prepares for the slog of opposition, and begins to draw up a platform of policies for the next five years under a new leader, the realities of the climate crisis, the net zero target, and the dire state of the UK’s environment – including sewage-filled rivers, a touchstone issue in the general election – cannot be avoided for long. “Conservatives in government presided over some significant environmental achievements, such as the near elimination of coal from our energy mix and the creation of the blue belt of marine reserves around our overseas territories,” says Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network (CEN). “But the party underplayed and undermined this record during the election campaign. To rebuild, the party must learn the lessons from the defeat, re-establish a positive environmental narrative, and put concern for the environment at the heart of its agenda in opposition. That means holding the new government to account on its environmental delivery, challenging its overly statist approach, and setting out a distinctively conservative platform on climate change and nature loss.” Polling from More in Common in the general election suggests most voters are in favour of net zero and action on the environment. Using net zero as a “culture war” issue appeared to backfire, or at least had no positive impact for Rishi Sunak. Labour won while championing decarbonisation as one of its five “missions” for government; the Liberal Democrats made a strong showing with a green agenda including a strong focus on rivers; and the Green party enjoyed its best ever result, with four MPs. Meanwhile, Reform UK, which also now has four MPs including Nigel Farage, made clear at its recent conference that opposing net zero would join Brexit and immigration as its three core issues. That leaves the Conservatives facing a choice: to turn rightwards and emulate Reform and the Republicans in the US; or to embrace the longstanding tradition of green Toryism, exemplified by David Cameron in his successful campaign to be leader a political generation ago, and carried on by Theresa May, Boris Johnson and many senior cabinet figures of the last 14 years. Ben Goldsmith, a financier and the chair of CEN, says the only route to government is the green path. “It’s vital that as the party rebuilds from the general election defeat it reconnects with the core conservative instinct to protect and restore nature,” he says. The party’s achievements – including starting the reform of agricultural subsidies – were downplayed in the election, he feels. “They should have been much more vocal in the election about these achievements, and they should lay claim to this legacy now in opposition. Public concern about nature has been rising steeply in recent years. This is a political opportunity as well as moral responsibility we have for future generation,” he says. Developing a coherent economic programme also requires addressing the climate, adds Ryan Shorthouse, the executive chair of the Bright Blue thinktank, as pursuing net zero would lead to “new commercial opportunities to deliver economic growth”. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, says there is huge mileage in courting voters on green issues: “The UK is a country of nature lovers, with membership of environmental organisations still growing and already far exceeding that of political parties. If the Conservatives want to be forward looking and relevant to the concerns of large sections of the electorate, especially younger voters, they need to wake up and smell the organic coffee, and develop a comprehensive set of policies to tackle the climate and nature crises. Only then might they become an electoral option for these key voter segments.” A cross-party approach would also impress voters more than populism, believes Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth. “Protecting the planet and the people on it should be an area of agreement and priority across all serious political parties and not an issue of culture wars and playground politics.” As the Conservatives seek ways to reconnect with the electorate, and differentiate themselves from Labour, an unlikely political partnership beckons. The Green party and the Tories have generally had little in common, but on pylons they have found a common enemy. To achieve its aim of decarbonising electricity by 2030, Labour needs to build hundreds of miles of pylons across the countryside, to deliver power from offshore and onshore windfarms to the urban areas where it is needed. Local groups are gearing up to protest in affected areas. The Tory MP Graham Stuart, a former climate minister, told a recent CEN gathering it would be “really easy” to join those protests. “The political drive for us to be the chief opponents – and while opposing quite properly not giving people a say, putting in infrastructure on a timetable that’s not realistic, or a price that’s ridiculous because it’s been forced by an artificial deadline that cannot be met – that would be legitimate.” On the surface at least, this appears an attractive route. But as Stuart also recognises, embracing the nimby tendency could represent an electoral dead end. Blocking is easy, but it cannot replace the development of a coherent and productive policy programme. He warned: “The danger is that we actually, as a party on the environment, become the party of saying no.” How green are the Tory leadership candidates? The environment has not featured a huge amount in the Conservative leadership contest, but this is somewhat to the relief of green campaigners who worry it could become a race to the bottom. Some candidates, however, have more progressive ideas than others. Robert Jenrick A source close to Jenrick said the 2050 target was an “ambitious goal” but that he did think the UK should aim to decarbonise. However, he has said this should “not be on the backs of working people”. He recently told Politico that the UK did not need to be a climate leader, saying: “The UK is only 1% of the world’s emissions. There’s no prizes for being the first country in the world to decarbonise. We should be working towards net zero 2050, but we shouldn’t be decarbonising faster than our major competitors in the world.” He will be campaigning against solar farms because he is concerned about their impact on the landscape and also about the supply chain that has been linked to human rights abuses in China. Green score 2/5 Kemi Badenoch A source close to Badenoch said she thought that legislating for the 2050 target without first coming up with a plan to reach that target was a big mistake, and said that as business secretary she lobbied across government to slow down the speed of net zero policy interventions. She takes credit for the former prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to put back the petrol and diesel car ban to 2035 to give more time and space for industry to invest, plan and adjust, and allow more time for the charging infrastructure to be put in place. She will continue to campaign about pylons and her team said she would not be coming up with any nature policies as now was not the time to be coming up with new policies. She believed the important thing was to establish principles and what the party was for, renew the Conservatives around a set of ideas, and then come up with policies once they had gone through that process. Green score 1/5 Tom Tugendhat The 2050 net zero goal could be under threat if Tugendhat ever became prime minister; in July he told Jacob Rees-Mogg’s GB News show: “No. It’s not realistic. If you can show me the science that delivers it I’ll be fascinated, because I’ve never seen it. All I’ve seen is that as an aspiration.” He has however said that environmentalism was a core tenet of conservatism and a principle that needed to be rediscovered in the party. When approached by the Guardian, a spokesperson for Tugendhat declined to comment or expand on his views on the environment. Green score 2/5 James Cleverly Cleverly’s team said he believed the country should be pushing the world to decarbonise and use it as an opportunity to boost green tech, green exports and green investment in the UK, and indicated he supported the 2050 target. However, as leader he would take on Ed Miliband by arguing GB Energy was a “bad idea and won’t help cut bills” and that the central planning of solar panels and other renewables “will ignore local consent, which is unacceptable”. He thinks we need to decarbonise, but we should be looking to do things such as putting solar panels on top of buildings, not across prime agricultural land. Cleverly’s team added that he would be outlining nature policies and that as minister he was proud to support the Conservative government in its Environment Act, which includes a legally binding target to halt species decline. As foreign secretary, his team said he led on the blue belt programme to promote the protection and sustainable management of marine environments.

2024-02-15T00:01:01Z,Labour urged to double funding in publicly owned renewables,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/15/labour-urged-to-double-funding-in-publicly-owned-renewables,"Keir Starmer is being urged to more than double Labour’s investment in publicly owned renewable energy to save consumers billions of pounds on their bills, despite the party drastically scaling back its plans last week. In an intervention after the Labour leader scrapped the party’s £28bn green investment pledge in the most controversial U-turn of his leadership, the Common Wealth thinktank said a step-change in government backing for clean energy generation was still required. It said plans to retain an initial cash injection in Great British Energy – a state-owned renewable power generation company planned if Labour is elected to power – was an important “down payment”, but should be increased to £30bn over the course of a first term in office. There have been growing questions over Labour’s target to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2030 after it slashed the funding package behind its green economy plans by half. As a key group influencing Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary, Common Wealth was the first thinktank to promote a new publicly owned energy generator – providing backing for GB Energy – based on similar European firms such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, Denmark’s Ørsted and Norway’s Equinor. Miliband is understood to have pushed back against the dilution of Labour’s £28bn investment plan, with speculation – denied by his team – that he could resign over the issue. However, in a sign of unity, he contributed a quote to the press release confirming it would be scaled back. Labour has said GB Energy would be headquartered in Scotland as a “homegrown, publicly owned champion in clean energy generation” to enable the creation of jobs and manufacturing in Britain’s renewables sector. However, several details remain unclear, including whether it would operate green assets directly or control a portfolio of investments in other companies instead. Labour said last week that GB Energy would “partner with industry” and “co-invest” in groundbreaking green technologies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and tidal stream energy. It has also suggested the party would help capital-intensive projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk with “backing and building”. The government is, however, seeking significantly more investment for the project than Labour currently plans for GB Energy, with ministers looking to raise £20bn from outside investors after removing the Chinese state-owned group CGN in 2022 over security concerns. In a report setting out the case for a vast expansion of GB Energy in the early years of a Labour government, Common Wealth said state-led investment in clean energy would be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent – helping to save households money on their bills. It said renewable investment financed out of Labour’s initial £8.3bn capitalisation would save between £125m and £208m a year on debt interest costs each year – saving up to £1bn in total compared with private-sector borrowing, which is typically more expensive. Analysis in the report was based on estimates from the International Energy Association that a 2 percentage point increase in borrowing costs can lead to a 20% increase in a solar or wind project’s “levelised cost of electricity”, a measure of the average cost of each unit of electricity generated over the lifetime of an asset. Common Wealth said this was a good proxy for the savings between government-backed investment and the private sector, which could be passed on to households in the form of cheaper bills. Mathew Lawrence, Common Wealth’s director, said: “Keir Starmer’s renewed commitment to GB Energy, Labour’s proposed new public renewables company, is welcome. However, the true test of ambition is in its design and scale. “An ambitious public renewables company like GB Energy on the scale of leading international equivalents would mean lower energy bills, good jobs in every part of the country, faster decarbonisation and energy independence for the UK - indeed it is the cornerstone of any serious attempt to transition our economy.” A Labour spokesperson said: “With Labour’s ambitious £8.3bn capitalisation of Great British Energy, we will invest in clean homegrown power that will cut energy bills, create the next generation of jobs in clean industries, and make Britain energy independent.”",Energy industry; Labour; Keir Starmer; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy; Politics; Environment; Energy; UK news; Green politics; Business,Business

Britain’s manufacturers are “battening down the hatches” amid a sharp drop in activity, according to the latest quarterly data from Make UK, which represents manufacturers, and the business advisory firm BDO. Their manufacturing outlook survey shows that factory recruitment plans are weakening significantly for first time since the EU referendum in 2016, due to a slowdown in orders from domestic and overseas customers. Make UK has cut its forecast for 2023, predicting output will fall by 0.5% this year. “Manufacturers are seeing a very sharp slowdown in activity as the potent cocktail of rising interest rates, cost of living and slowing overseas markets bites hard,” said Verity Davidge, policy director at Make UK. “As a result, they are now battening down the hatches in the expectation that the next year is going to be anaemic at best and, potentially, much harder,” Davidge added. Recent surveys of purchasing managers have shown that the UK manufacturing industry’s downturn deepened as a weakening economic backdrop led to falls in output and orders in August. Almost three-quarters of firms surveyed by Make UK and BDO believe that incentives offered overseas, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, make it harder to justify investing in the UK. Heather Boushey, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, has told the Guardian that countries including the UK must ramp up green investment to reboot economic growth, boost energy security and protect against future inflation shocks.",Manufacturing sector; Interest rates; Inflation; UK cost of living crisis; Job hunting; Business; Money; Politics; UK news; Economics; Green economy; Environment; Global economy; International trade,Business
2024-02-16T07:57:31Z,"Labour can celebrate byelection wins, but low turnout is cause for concern",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/16/labour-can-celebrate-byelection-victories-but-low-turnout-could-indicate-larger-threat,"The records continue to fall for Labour. The result in the Wellingborough byelection, in which the party achieved a 28.5 percentage-point swing from the Conservatives, was the biggest Labour victory over the Tories since 1994 and the second biggest since the war. Along with the victory in Kingswood, the party has now made six byelection gains since 2019 – the most it has made in a single parliament. The Conservatives have lost 10 byelections in that time – the most they have ever lost in a single parliament. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called the results “fantastic”, adding: “By winning in these Tory strongholds, we can confidently say that Labour is back in the service of working people and we will work tirelessly to deliver for them.” Labour’s swing in both seats was large enough that if repeated at a general election, the party would easily secure a majority. On a swing of 16.4 points, as seen in Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, Labour would have a majority of about 60 seats. If the result in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was repeated nationally, it would be apocalyptic for the Conservatives. On one calculation it would give them just four seats in a general election. John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, wrote on Friday morning: “These two results suggest the Conservatives still have a mountain to climb. Indeed, at the moment, they still seem to be struggling to get even so far as base camp.” For Starmer, the results are a welcome relief after a month dominated by headlines first about his U-turn on his green investment plans and then the controversy surrounding two of its candidates in the north-west who were recorded making derogatory remarks about Israel. Labour officials, however, will be slightly concerned that the Wellingborough result is an anomaly, given that the Tory’s candidate was Helen Harrison, the partner of the constituency’s former MP, Peter Bone, who was recalled after being found to have bullied a staff member. One Tory activist said: “None of us wanted to campaign in Wellingborough, we just couldn’t face having to justify our choice of candidate.” If Kingswood is more representative of national opinion, it suggests the Labour lead is softening slightly after three byelections last year where the swing was more than 20 points on each occasion. Recent polls suggest the party has dropped in the polls since Starmer’s decision to scrap his £28bn-a-year green spending plans – though none have been conducted since Thursday’s announcement that the country entered a recession at the end of last year. The Tories tried to put a gloss on the defeats on Friday, highlighting the low turnout in both seats. Just 37% of voters turned out in Kingswood, and 38% in Wellingborough – below the mid-40s seen in recent byelections in Mid Bedfordshire, Somerton and Frome, and Selby and Ainsty. In both seats, the increase in Labour support was just half the drop in the Conservatives’ vote, suggesting that the opposition party is not fully capitalising on the government’s unpopularity. If the Conservatives can persuade their voters to come out at a general election, party officials have said, they can still keep hold of power. Some are also keen to point out the success of Reform UK at both byelections, securing more than 10% of the vote in each. “We have fought robust campaigns on the ground in both of these seats with local candidates,” said a Tory official. “But these byelections were always going to be hard. The government of the day rarely win byelections.” The former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “I certainly thought this result would be worse … If we can reunite the right in politics there’s a real opportunity for us.” Rees-Mogg has been at the forefront of efforts by Tory backbenchers to get the prime minister to tack to the right to claw back voters from Reform. Responding to Thursday’s economic data, one Conservative MP said Sunak should “cut business and personal taxes, reduce immigration, adopt radical measures to increase the size of the indigenous workforce”. Sunak’s problem, however, is that he is losing votes on both sides and that any move to the right risks losing support, especially in the southern suburban seats being targeted by the Liberal Democrats. Labour’s concern, however, is one identified by Starmer at the beginning of the year: that voters are not really moving their way but are instead so disillusioned with politics that they are staying at home. “The message on the doorstep was the same everywhere I went,” said one Labour activist. “Voters hate all of us.”",Byelections; Labour; Conservatives; Local politics; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-05-14T07:00:28Z,I’ve seen how firms cheat the law to exploit workers and here’s a warning: those days are ending | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/14/workers-rights-labour-policy,"How did Labour let its most life-transforming policy get more publicity for its suspected “watering down” than it ever got for the policy itself? Today, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner will meet the unions to assure them the new deal for working people is as radical as ever: an agreed, detailed policy document follows soon. The Trades Union Congress, broadly supportive, is watching carefully for any weakening of the deal, while this year’s TUC president, the Fire Brigades Union’s Matt Wrack, sends out warning shots against backsliding. Speaking to the shopworkers’ union Usdaw last month, Starmer was adamant that he would not back down. And to business leaders recently he said that “to be crystal clear”, Labour would “level up workers’ rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades”, though he recognised “that might not please everyone in the room or the wider business community”. This is core to Labour’s purpose and to igniting growth. Only Unite’s Sharon Graham publicly claims “betrayal”, as she often does. But in private today, all unions will want cast-iron reassurance. They do need to scrutinise every word to block loopholes. These rights best help the weak and voiceless – the one in nine workers in insecure jobs who are prone to exploitation. I saw how employers cheat the law when researching my book Hard Work. I took a job as a porter advertised in the job centre, not for some rogue outfit but for a hospital. As most public sector manual work has been outsourced, ever since Margaret Thatcher’s orders, I was not working for the NHS, but for an agency supplying the main contractor, providing portering and cleaning. After queueing for hours in a jam-packed office behind a shabby shopfront, applicants were handed forms to sign. We couldn’t take them away to study their minuscule fine-print, so I took notes. The casual worker agreement was an “agreement to provide occasional services” – otherwise known as a zero-hours contract. In a key clause, I opted out of the 48-hour maximum working week, a legal “voluntary” waiver: “The temporary worker hereby agrees that the working week limit shall not apply.” All flexibility around working too many or too few hours belonged to the agency. Other clauses read: “as a casual worker you will not be subject to the company’s grievance and disciplinary procedures” and “uniform costs will be deducted from the following week’s pay”. The legal four weeks’ holiday would apply after 13 weeks of continuous service; agencies tend to fire and rehire after 12 weeks. Voluntary? No signature, no job. That’s the squalid, exploitative world Labour would abolish. But employment law is fiendishly complex because work covers multitudinous occupations and situations. Examine the working time regulations’ exemptions for sea fishing, civil protection, the armed forces, police and so on to see why some of the broad principles outlined in Labour’s original green paper were bound to be refined. Done right, that’s not necessarily “watering down”. After much negotiation with the unions, these changes were agreed (except by Unite, which abstained) at Labour’s national policy forum this January. One difficulty: zero-hours contracts suit some workers, so Labour’s new offer gives them day-one rights and after 12 weeks a contract for minimum hours actually worked. However, the law hardly matters if enforcement is reduced to rubble. Labour will merge and boost ineffective regulators, so every employee knows the number to call. The UN’s International Labour Organization, to which the UK is a signatory, requires one inspector for 10,000 employees: the UK is 1,797 short, and bad employers know it. Labour’s fair pay agreements, drawn up with business and unions, would enforce pay and conditions across an entire industry, starting with social care. Winston Churchill in 1909 created wages councils for minimum pay across sectors from agricultural work to hat-making: Thatcher and John Major abolished them. The first ever law forcing all employers to admit union recruiters will be a gamechanger, letting union reps into every “fulfilment centre”, fast-food restaurant, care home and care agency, pizza delivery company and delivery depot. Trade union membership raises average pay and prevents employer skulduggery. The fall in union membership helped cause the great 1980s decline in pay. But recruitment is now near-impossible in such places, relying on union reps leafletting outside workplaces at shift change, as people hurry home to children or to a second job. To organise freely without fear of employers picking on joiners, sacking them or denying them extra hours will send membership soaring: there were more than 12 million union members in 1980, but only 6.25 million in 2022. Restoring union rights will remove recent anti-strike laws: Labour has just added easier union recognition rules and electronic balloting. It will stop planned new employment tribunal fees, which – along with tribunal backlogs a year long – deter the low-paid from making claims. These rights get overwhelming support from the public, and from most managers: a level playing field prevents undercutting by rogue companies. Chartered Management Institute polling finds 80% of managers want workers’ rights prioritised, and 83% think better working rights raise productivity. Making this policy work is key to Labour’s growth plan, as the TUC rightly says: “The UK’s long experiment with a low-rights, low-wage economy is a complete failure.” Where’s the payoff for all these Tory years of deregulation, anti-union laws, public sector pay cuts in real terms and rising inequality? Productivity grew by just 0.4% a year in the 12 years after the financial crisis. That’s half the rate of the 25 richest OECD countries, says the Resolution Foundation. The Marmot review shows bad working lives lead to worse physical and mental health, absence due to illness and worklessness raising disability costs. The Tories dithered on the “watering down” story, from viewing it as another Labour flip-flop to labelling it as Labour obeying its union “paymasters” and saying the plans would pile “70 new burdens on employers”. Business has been mostly quiescent, asking for clarification to prevent “unintended consequences”. But that in itself raises suspicions among some Labour people too quick to believe any “backsliding” story, ever since soaring inflation and borrowing costs forced a retreat on the £28bn green investment deal until later in parliament. Natalie Elphicke’s bizarre arrival in their ranks only confirmed those expecting nothing but disappointment, spying Peter Mandelson’s hand everywhere. (My guess is he’s actually miffed at being left out, hence his snidery about Starmer’s weight.) Employment law is a thicket where every detail matters. Today’s meeting, and the final policy paper shortly to come, need a resounding reaffirmation from Labour and the unions that well-designed rights, made law in the first 100 days of a Labour government, will mark a seismic shift in power from employer to employee, with rising union membership and rising wages.

2024-04-29T05:00:25Z,There’s a hard-right tidal wave about to hit Europe – and it will only make the economic crisis worse | Gordon Brown,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/29/hard-right-tidal-wave-europe-economic-crisis-worse,"By the time of the European parliament elections in June, this year’s rightward drift in European politics will have turned into a tidal wave. Ultra-nationalist demagogues and populist-nationalists are now leading the polls in Italy, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, and running second in Germany and Sweden. There are two hard-right groupings in the European parliament – Identity and Democracy and European Conservatives and Reformists. Between them, they could secure as much as 25% of the June vote. But even more ominously, in almost every part of Europe including Britain, these factions are forcing the hand of the traditional centre-right parties – which, one by one, are capitulating to ever more extreme anti-immigration, anti-trade and anti-environment positions. The rightward shift is, of course, a western and not just European phenomenon, with Trump 2.0 advocating a far more aggressive protectionist and nationalist agenda than Trump 1.0. But Europe stands out from the US in one important respect. While the US economy roars forward – even if the average American voter does not feel the full benefits – Europe, and especially its industrial engine-room, Germany, continues to suffer from near-zero growth and stagnation in terms of living standards. And having lived through a decade of consistently low growth, the continent is now divided between an optimistic but declining minority, who still hold to the expectation that a rising tide lifts all boats, and the growing and more pessimistic majority who now see life as a zero-sum game. The latter is a mindset that, recognising the economic pie is not growing, leads people to an erroneous conclusion: “I will only do well if someone else does badly.” Once embraced, this adversarial view is hard to shake. The supporting evidence is clear: in the largest western European countries, many people are pessimistic about their prospects, believing that their generation will do worse than their parents. Only 26% of French people and just 33% of Italians think they will do better in future, according to a seven-nation poll by Focaldata. In the Netherlands and Germany, as many are pessimistic as optimistic. While Ireland and Sweden top the league for optimism, only 46% and 40% respectively feel they will fare better, with 39% and 35% taking the opposite view. In no country are a majority of people optimistic about their future. The pollsters also tested the classic zero-sum proposition that you can only get rich at the expense of others. In every major European country, the results are dramatic: 59% of British respondents believe they can only enhance their personal wealth if others do badly, and just 17% disregarded this notion. Similarly, in Germany and the Netherlands, 60% and 58% respectively hold this view, compared with only 16% and 15% who rejected it. In almost all countries, more than 50% displayed a zero-sum mentality. There are good reasons why these trends are becoming entrenched. A low-growth economy creates a doom loop as pessimism begets a blame culture – and the more we blame others, the more pessimistic we become. Once people convince themselves that the state of their economy is so weak that they can only improve their lot at someone else’s expense, they vote for parties that specialise in targeting those they think are holding them back – immigrants, foreigners and minorities. These parties offer nothing in terms of economic policies to generate long-term growth. The result is that zero-sum politics exacerbates the downward economic trends, and this, in turn, intensifies and widens the appeal of zero-sum thinking. The problem Europe now faces is that the very measures it must adopt to escape this doom loop – new investment in technology, clean energy and medical advances – are being rendered impossible by its policy of fiscal retrenchment. The European growth and stability pact rules out member states having deficits above 3%, and perhaps as importantly, makes no distinction between public spending on consumption and spending on investment. Added to that, Germany has a debt brake enshrined in its constitution which limits the government’s structural deficit to 0.35% of GDP. This casts a shadow over the whole of Europe, with the German people facing severe cuts in public spending – cuts that will torpedo any chance of repairing the country’s beleaguered infrastructure and frustrating its transition from heavy engineering to IT and AI-based industries. While China can subsidise to the point of undercutting Europe on electric cars, batteries and other new technologies, and Bidenomics is running huge deficits that are stimulating the economy, Europe is stuck in a fiscal bind. The European recovery and resilience facility ends for good in 2026, with no replacement. The stability and growth pact, which has restrictive conditions that were suspended during the Covid crisis, resumes its tough regime next year. France and 11 other European countries are already in trouble, unable to invest more because they are already running allegedly unsustainable deficits. So, at the very time that investment needs to increase, it is likely to fall. And the European election results are unlikely to make things any better. Essential green investment will fall down the agenda as anti-environmentalist parties gain an upper hand. Protectionism will become the order of the day with trade wars, which hit Europe harder than anywhere else. Unless something gives, a low-growth Europe will remain stuck in its rut – and the populist xenophobes will triumph. The nationalist timebomb is ticking. Across the continent, Europeans need a plan for better jobs through economic and environmental transformation. When the Polish trade union Solidarity was first formed, its anti-Soviet slogan was “No solidarity without freedom”. But soon many realised that free-for-all neoliberal economics would mean rising inequality and low living standards for the mass of people, and so a new slogan soon rang out: “There is no solidarity in freedom.” If progressives want to prevent an election campaign dominated by anti-immigrant propaganda, they will have to stand up to protectionism and xenophobia by showing the benefits of cooperation.

2024-05-10T16:48:52Z,‘Hard truths’: how far will Starmer push to show Labour has changed?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/10/how-far-starmer-push-show-labour-changed,"Two days after defecting to Labour, the former Conservative Natalie Elphicke stood in front of a pure red backdrop as she introduced Keir Starmer in her Dover constituency – on the frontline of the battle over stopping small boat crossings. Before a slogan stating “border security”, Labour’s newest MP railed against her former Tory colleagues for having failed to control migration, and praised Starmer for stepping into the centre ground that Rishi Sunak had “abandoned”. The problem for Labour is that many within the party are unsure they want to stand on that same centre ground as Elphicke, whose staunch rightwing views while a Conservative MP made her one of the last people suspected of planning to cross the floor. And unusually for a defection, it angered more people in Elphicke’s new party than her old one. On top of tension over the leadership’s stance on Gaza and whether it is watering down some leftwing policies, some party insiders wonder whether Starmer is pushing the base and parliamentary faithful too far. Labour MPs were particularly upset about Elphicke’s controversial defence of her ex-husband, a convicted sex offender. A series of leftwing MPs publicly criticised the decision, but for the most part those in the centre of the party shared their concerns privately. One figure in the Labour leader’s office accused the parliamentary party of “talking about itself”, adding dismissively that it was “not Keir’s job to go round managing how they feel”. But after an angry response, a Labour spokesperson swiftly distanced the party from the “unauthorised and unacceptable briefing”. Starmer aides believe the political benefits of taking on Elphicke are worth a bit of internal turmoil and that most voters will just see headlines about another defection. That it was the MP for Dover, a constituency dealing with the effects of the small boats crossings, was a bonus. There are already hints that, after two Tory defections in the last fortnight, there could be more to come. However, perhaps in a nod to the unhappiness inside the party over Elphicke, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, suggested on Friday there were limits. “If Liz Truss were to want to cross the floor, and I don’t imagine she would, I would rather take the lettuce,” he said. Labour insiders acknowledge that on some issues, Starmer is pushing not just MPs and members, but also the party’s base, to the limits. “We’ve got to show that it’s a changed party and that we can win in places and with people who wouldn’t have come near us with a barge pole five years ago,” said one. At the heart of the strategy is demonstrating fiscal responsibility, even if that means dishing out some “hard truths” on what Labour can deliver in office. “I’m under no illusions about the scale of the challenge that I would inherit if I become chancellor later this year,” Rachel Reeves said in a speech in the City of London earlier this week. “The worst economic inheritance that any chancellor has faced since the second world war in terms of taxes, growth, living standards and the public finances.” Within weeks of taking office, Reeves would have to announce a one-year spending review, spelling out how much she intends to give each Whitehall department for Labour’s first year in power. A combination of tax cuts already announced by the Tories, which Labour has promised to retain, low growth forecasts and high debt costs mean real-terms spending cuts for many departments are on the cards unless she can find the money elsewhere. Some in the party are talking about holding an emergency budget immediately after taking office. There are tensions within the party, however, about whether a new Labour administration should adopt a tough plan to get the economy back on track or try to give people some reasons for hope in the early months. “Our research shows us that people want honesty as much as they want hope,” one party insider said. “If you promise the earth they don’t think you can deliver it.” The party is expected to deliver some “early wins” on the economy, they added, with planning reform and a national wealth fund likely to be introduced as soon as possible. Labour has already rowed back on some commitments, in part because of the fiscal backdrop and to make sure they work in government, but also to stem Tory attacks. So far, these have included watering down pledges on the £28bn green investment fund and workers’ rights, and refusing to commit to scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Yet some MPs are suspicious that these developments are not just about “bomb-proofing” policies, and suggest some in Starmer’s office see them as an opportunity to take on MPs. “Keir wants to push as far as necessary and he doesn’t take any pleasure from it but there are people around him who want to go as far as they can go,” said one Labour frontbencher. “It feels like they take joy from punishing the PLP and Labour members.” They added: “There are times we’ve got the balance wrong and we don’t make a principled argument about what we’re doing. “On the two-child policy, for example, our body language was that we didn’t mind the policy rather than saying we want to get rid of it but that we can’t afford to now … “It seems designed for the media, rather than the voters we need to win. They want to see a party that is confident in its values and its vision for the country. We’ve had enough internal warfare with the Tories.” On the Gaza conflict, however, the leadership appears to recognise that it pushed its core support too far, after local elections showed some voters were willing to express their anger at the ballot box. Reeves became the latest senior party figure this week to acknowledge concerns among some voters, including in Muslim communities, over the party’s position, which insiders admit was initially clunky and took too long to be reached. She said she regretted whenever people said they could not bring themselves to vote for Labour and that the party would “seek to rebuild the trust” it had lost. One of the biggest issues Labour is grappling with is deep levels of mistrust among voters that politics can bring any level of change. “Time and again, we find in research that many voters do not trust government and think all politicians are all the same. Labour must change that,” said Josh Simons, the director of the Labour Together thinktank that has conducted focus groups on this. “That requires honesty and frankness with a public who are tired of false dawns and a singular focus on demonstrating that voting can secure real change.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; Immigration and asylum; Economic policy; Rachel Reeves; Welfare; Foreign policy; UK news,Politics
2024-02-11T18:30:43Z,Labour’s green rowback: honest politics or a costly mistake? | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/11/labour-green-rowback-honest-politics-or-a-costly-mistake,"You excoriate the Labour leadership for “a humiliating rowback” on the green transition (Editorial, 8 February). But hold on! When the £28bn ambition was declared in the autumn of 2021, interest rates on government debt were about 1% but are now 4.5%, with repayments of debt coincidentally increasing by around the same proportion of GDP. Last December, the repayments hit £119bn. In realistic household terms, since 2021 your mortgage payments have soared, and your family income has stagnated, so don’t plan to buy a big electric car for some years. What the statement by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves makes clear (Opinion, 8 February) is that they are not going to promise to spend £28bn using power that they don’t yet have and might not get access to because of the dire state of the economy and public finances that they will inherit. That’s not “hawkish”, it’s plain honesty. And it’s better than emulating the ostrich or repeating a boosterish Johnsonian pyramid of piffle. You say many traditional Labour voters will “be left asking what the party is for”. It’s for Great British Energy (£7bn), the National Wealth Fund (£8bn), green steel (£3bn), and a housing and planning programme that can change the scale and strategy of public investment in generating growth, skills and jobs, and combating the climate crisis. That, as you say, “cannot wait” – but it cannot be fought by glowing, though notional, promises from a party still in powerless opposition. Better to have the truth about what will be done to secure the reality – not just the “hope” – of a “better life”. After years of corroded integrity and economic and social impoverishment, surely that can “inspire a generation”. Neil Kinnock Labour, House of Lords • You note of Labour’s retreat from its green investment strategy that some will argue that “economic credibility is the rock on which everything redistributive rests”. That was the view of Labour first chancellor, Philip Snowden, exactly 100 years ago too. Unfortunately, it led in quite short order not to a mildly more equal society but to the 1931 national government. Keith Flett Tottenham, London • Investing in a green future can’t be a mere ambition, it has to be a necessity. We have to do everything possible to reduce carbon emissions, but do so in a way that creates a more equal society. This is the essence of a just transition. By training a green army of workers to insulate every house in the country that needs it, we lower emissions, reduce the worrying burden of heating bills and provide good, well-paid jobs to people across the country who need them. Labour simply cannot be allowed to backslide on the commitment to such a just transition. Not just because it’s the right thing to do; it’s also the popular thing to do – 82% of potential Labour voters believe investing in renewable energy should be a priority. The pressure to cave in to the demands of rightwing politicians and the media is a direct consequence of our first-past-the-post voting system. Proportional representation creates a level playing field for ideas such as a just transition to flourish. To decarbonise, we must democratise. Labour has to put climate and equality first – and that means putting democracy first. Neal Lawson Director, Compass, Clare Short Former secretary of state for international development, Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords, Carla Denyer Leader, Green party, Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion, Tim Farron MP Former leader, Liberal Democrats • As a longstanding member of the Labour party, I am appalled by the apparent decision to abandon abolition of the House of Lords (Remaining Labour policies face ‘bombproof’ test to finalise manifesto, 9 February). The case for ridding us of this ludicrously bloated, undemocratic, archaic and expensive institution is surely overwhelming. Is it too cynical to suspect that part of the reasoning lies in the hope among those responsible that they too might one day enjoy the luxury of being members? That they could follow in the footsteps of the likes of Mandelson, Darling and Blunkett, to mention just a few? Dr David Mervin Emeritus reader in politics, University of Warwick • With Keir Starmer’s ditching of the £28bn green pledge, I am left wondering, as I look back from my seat in the Emirates Stadium towards his, whether a belief in Arsenal is the only thing left that we have in common.

2024-06-07T07:00:42Z,There is no ‘change’ for Britain without a massive injection of cash. Why won’t our politicians admit it? | Frances Ryan ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/07/no-change-britain-without-injection-cash-politicians-admit-it-labour,"Anyone who has the fortune to see the Labour “battle bus” in their town this week will be hard pressed to avoid the party’s “change” slogan. Keir Starmer’s team have not exactly been subtle with their messaging: the word is emblazoned across the bus’s rose red backdrop … and then rewritten over and over and over again. In the coming weeks, expect the same phrase to be repeated ad nauseam in every interview with the Labour leader. You can see why. After 14 years of Conservative government – albeit with a revolving door of prime ministers – the one thing that can resonate with British voters across the board is the desire for something different. And yet the simplicity of Labour’s slogan also points to the campaign’s biggest weakness. A promise for “change” is not necessarily a promise for anything. Delivering it does not require a commitment for more resources for hollowed-out public services, or a significant shift in material conditions for the millions of people struggling to pay their bills. Indeed, it provides no clear outline of what the change will be – just the vague implication that things will be different to how they are now, and perhaps (slightly) better. This is partly because any disciplined election campaign knows not to overcommit or rock the boat, not least when the past decade has been defined by chaos. It is also, though, a consequence of the economic box Starmer’s Labour has trapped itself in. Conscious of being labelled irresponsible with the public purse and eager to appear pro-business, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has opted to set strict fiscal rules for the party while simultaneously ruling out taxing higher earners, outside introducing VAT on private school fees and changes to the status of non-doms. Last week, Reeves emphasised again that the upcoming manifesto would include no increases to income tax, national insurance, corporation tax or any form of wealth tax, despite shadow cabinet members reportedly pressing her to change capital gains tax. The result is a Labour party that has voluntarily put a stranglehold on policies that would provide the transformation the country needs. Or to put it another way: real “change” costs money, and Labour seemingly has little interest in raising it if it involves asking the wealthy to pay their fair share. This is a sign of the wider fantasy at the heart of the election: both major parties are promising they can fix broken public services while insisting they can do it without raising taxes (and in the case of the Conservatives, saying they can cut them for pensioners). A new report by the Institute for Government sets out the scale of the crisis any new prime minister will face: from hospital waiting lists at a record level to prisons on the brink of collapse, all while growth has stagnated and taxes are at a historic high. But it is also a problem that is specific to a Labour government. The electorate expect (and accept) a certain level of inequality under the Tories but – fairly or not – generally hold Labour to a higher standard. At a time when public services are on their knees and living standards have plummeted, all while the ultra-rich’s wealth has soared, it is understandably of particular concern that Britain’s centre-left party is squeamish about the redistribution of wealth. At the start of the campaign, Starmer named “wealth creation” as his number one priority if elected. But there was notably no mention of how that wealth would “trickle down” to the families currently queueing in their local food bank. From the two-child benefit limit and green investment to tuition fees, the party’s default setting is that – as much as it would like to spend money – it can’t afford it. All the while feigning ignorance that there could possibly be other ways to raise funds than the much-touted “growth”. You see this each time Starmer responds to questions about overturning Conservative policies by stressing Labour will not make spending pledges it can’t deliver on – as if the choice is always a simple binary between uncosted investment and costed inaction. Such language attempts to frame improving ordinary people’s lives as frivolous and wasteful, while perpetuating the myth that Labour’s hands are tied from using power to achieve it. It buys into the idea that taxing wealth is not a legitimate tool for funding services the majority of society rely on, even as grandparents die on the floor waiting for an ambulance. This becomes worse still when you consider that the party has effectively signed up to a period of austerity in the next parliament unless it finds new revenue, with a report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank this week warning that on current forecasts, the next government will have to make £19bn of annual cuts to unprotected departments by 2028-29. So, let’s acknowledge some truths. First, after more than a decade of starved resources and growing need, there is barely a single crisis facing this country – from NHS waiting lists and bankrupt councils, to child poverty – that can be solved without a significant injection of cash. Second, if the growth Reeves is banking on does not emerge and the coffers remain low, there is only really one viable way to rebuild the public realm: tax the super-rich. A small wealth tax of 1-2% on those with assets of more than £10m – that’s just 0.04% of the population – would raise £22bn annually. That’s enough to pay three-quarters of the entire social care bill for a year. Go one step further and – as recommended by the Wealth Commission in 2020 – introduce a one-off wealth tax for five years and you’d raise a colossal £260bn. You don’t have to be especially left wing to see the merits of this. A key New Labour adviser, Prof Patrick Diamond, and his academic colleague Colm Murphy, told the Observer there was an “overwhelming economic and ethical case” for Starmer to introduce wealth taxes if elected. Far from losing the party votes, this would be a widely popular policy: polling from YouGov found that 78% of the electorate support an annual wealth tax on the super-wealthy, including 77% of Tory voters and 86% of Labour voters. In a country where Conservative rule is the norm, the triumph of Labour entering Downing Street in July should not be underplayed. But winning is only the beginning. As the scale of the task of Britain’s regeneration becomes clear and with goodwill thin on the ground, a Labour government will find itself in need of a base it has alienated and the backing of a public restless for the change they were promised. To avoid such a state of affairs, the party would be wise to make the case now for a redistribution of resources. That the latest polling predicts a landslide bigger than Tony Blair’s suggests there has never been a better time for Labour to take a stand. Starmer is keen to describe himself as “ruthless”, but perhaps it is time to be brave. There are numerous ways to finance the change the country needs – all that is required is the nerve to take them.

2024-03-18T21:00:11Z,"Sunak and ministers stoking division over UK’s net zero target, warns Ed Miliband ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/18/sunak-and-ministers-stoking-division-over-uk-net-zero-target-warns-ed-miliband,"Ministers are stoking the fires of the culture wars over the UK’s net zero target instead of addressing the urgency of the climate crisis, Ed Miliband will say. The shadow energy secretary will make a pitch directly to Conservative voters who are concerned that the party has made major U-turns on cutting greenhouse gas emissions amid increasingly anti-green rhetoric. “If the tree on their logo was real, no doubt they would cut it down and challenge Labour to support them,” he will say of the Tories in a landmark speech at a Green Alliance thinktank event in London on Tuesday morning. It is the first time Miliband has made a public speech on the climate crisis since the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, decided to cut back on the party’s pledge to spend £28bn a year on cutting emissions and building a green economy, a move that was widely criticised by green campaigners. Miliband is expected to say that Labour will create the conditions for private sector investment in renewable energy, grid upgrades and clean technology. He will accuse the Tories of failing to grasp these opportunities because of an obsession with appeasing rightwing voices who have fixated on net zero as a culture war issue. “Families across the country are united in their desire for lower bills, cleaner water, and a green and pleasant home that we can leave for our children,” Miliband will say. “Instead of embracing this mainstream majority, Rishi Sunak is willing to give up the fight for lower bills and energy security because he wants to stoke the fires of a culture war.” Sunak announced the roll back of several key pledges on the climate last September, including postponing the phase-out of sales of new petrol and diesel cars, and stepped up plans to license new oil and gas fields in the North Sea. His rhetoric has been seen by campaigners, as well as former Conservative ministers and serving “green Tory” MPs as increasingly anti-green. Last week, the government delayed by a year its plans for a clean heat market mechanism to encourage the take-up of heat pumps. Labour is still planning an end to new licences for oil and gas in the North Sea, and to decarbonise the UK’s electricity supply by 2030. But the party faces key questions over its approach and will have to confront the “culture war” that even Conservative former ministers have said the government is pursuing. For instance, ministers have issued new edicts over what they term anti-driving measures taken by local authorities and devolved administrations, such as 20mph zones and low-traffic neighbourhoods. Starmer appeared rattled on transport issues last year in the wake of Labour’s failure to take Uxbridge in the byelection created by Boris Johnson’s resignation, where plans by Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, for an ultra-low emission zone were a major issue on the doorstep. Miliband believes many Tory voters are deeply concerned that the government has abandoned or rowed back on climate measures. He will say “there is nothing Conservative” about the approach taken by Sunak and refer to “a deeply honourable Conservative tradition that cares about climate and nature”. A key plank of his argument is that failing to invest in renewables, home insulation and energy efficiency is leading to higher bills. “Five more years of failing to invest in homegrown clean energy and failing to tackle the climate crisis under the Tories would mean rocketing energy bills, our national energy security undermined, and our children further exposed to the dangers of rising temperatures, floods, and droughts. There is nothing conservative about that,” he will say. Miliband will say: “If you want a government that will protect our home for future generations against the existential threats we face, if you want a government that will make Britain energy independent once again, and if you want a government that will fight every day to cut your energy bills, if you want a government that thinks we must do the right thing by future generations, then that choice is Labour. ” Responding to Miliband’s pitch to Tory voters, Claire Coutinho, the energy secretary, attacked Labour over its former £28bn target for a green industrial strategy. She added: “Their mad 2030 promise is not based on what industry or consumers want – they would see costs implode, mean higher taxes on working people and take us back to square one on the economy.” Labour did not claim it would decarbonise the economy by 2030 – rather, that is the target for decarbonising electricity, which is less than a fifth of overall UK emissions, and the former £28bn investment target covered the whole of the green economy. Jamie Peters, the climate coordinator at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Labour party must put the environment at the heart of its general election campaign, with a comprehensive and fully funded plan to retrofit the UK’s heat-leaking homes and ambitious targets to develop the UK’s huge homegrown renewable energy potential.” Areeba Hamid, the co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s great that we have shadow cabinet buy-in to a bold green industrial strategy, now we need Starmer and Reeves to demonstrate their commitment as well. Ultimately, the leadership must lay out Labour’s plans on green investment to give clear signals to businesses who want to invest in the growing green economy here.”",Green politics; Ed Miliband; Conservatives; Labour; Environment; Climate crisis; Politics; UK news,Environment
2024-02-04T07:00:38Z,Penury and decay mark Brexit’s miserable anniversary | William Keegan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/04/penury-and-decay-mark-brexits-miserable-anniversary,"So we pass the fourth anniversary of Brexit. The trade barriers mount, with the UK “reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels” in order to become poorer, and Chancellor Hunt prefers tax cuts to relief of the squeeze on public spending; this latter when local authorities all over the country are threatened with bankruptcy, having already pared vital services to the bone. Even the International Monetary Fund points to the need for a letup on austerity – a far cry from the 1976 crisis, when James Callaghan’s Labour government was besieged by IMF requests for spending cuts. There is something characteristically pernicious about this shameless government blaming local authorities for supposed profligacy. The true blame lies with the 40%-plus reduction in the central government grant to councils imposed by George Osborne under the 2010 coalition government, and which has continued. In their desperation, councils resort to all manner of ways of making money, which only serve to make them unpopular. Now, I am familiar with the observation that people have a natural preference for tax cuts they can feel rather than public spending increases whose benefits to them are somewhat amorphous. Nevertheless, recent surveys suggest that public anger over the dilapidated state of the public services is so intense that the majority would prefer Hunt to desist from trying to appease the lunatic right, and take decisions that actually alleviate the pressures on the public weal. However, the chancellor has toned down his promises on the tax cut front. In addition to the limitations on his freedom of manoeuvre likely to be placed by the Office for Budget Responsibility, he must have taken fright at a wild front page story in the Mail on Sunday recently. This was promising a “Lawson boom” tax-cutting bonanza, but Jeremy Hunt is old enough to remember how the Lawson boom of 1988 ended in one of the worst recessions since the second world war, and the pound’s ignominious ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. The combination of the government’s cynical approach to the public spending crisis and its insouciant attitude towards the manifest economic and social harm wreaked by Brexit makes me long for the British public to voice the kind of “savage indignation” expressed about other matters by the Roman poet Juvenal. As the bureaucracy associated with the latest stage of Brexit negotiations takes effect, making life harder for exporters and importers – and guaranteeing delays and higher prices – some Brexiters are beginning to run for cover. I was surprised when my friend the Keynesian economist Roger Bootle opted for Brexit. His latest column in the Daily Telegraph was headlined “No, Brexit was not a terrible mistake”. But the article sounded defensive – almost apologetic. He concluded: “Admittedly, if the UK makes a mess of its independence while the EU gets its act together, then we will have paid a not inconsiderable price for our exit.” He says that “on the balance of the evidence that is unlikely. But only time will tell.” Well, I think it is pretty obvious that time has already told. Our act of self-harm has not yet reached the stage which, according to Plutarch, led Caesar to abandon his conquest of Britain because “the islanders were so miserably poor that they had nothing worth left to plunder”. But a succession of recent governments has been working on it. As for Labour, I find that a disconcerting number of natural Labour sympathisers are not so sympathetic to the leadership’s ultra-defensive tactics. This applies to everything from the open goal of Brexit to the thorny subject of bankers’ bonuses. Labour’s concentration on relatively peripheral issues calls to mind Proust’s passage in Swann’s Way about Charles Swann’s approach to life: “Thus he had grown into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which enabled him to disregard matters of fundamental importance.” I am told it will all be very different when – or if – they win the election. Let us hope so! Meanwhile, they are even backtracking on such important initiatives as their £28bn green investment plan and taking fright at Neil Kinnock’s well-thought-out wealth tax proposal, calculated not to frighten the horses or even wealthy horse owners. This is a different kettle of fish from the question of changes to inheritance tax, the possibility of which seems to be worrying the Tories. However, I have said it before and I shall say it again: the revenues lost to the hit from Brexit will severely constrain a Labour chancellor.

2023-06-09T08:08:15Z,Labour postpones £28bn green plan as it seeks to be trusted on public finances,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/labour-government-would-have-to-delay-28bn-green-fund-rachel-reeves-says,"Labour has scaled back plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry as the party’s leadership looks to review its spending in an attempt to prove its fiscal credibility. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delayed plans for a green prosperity fund to start in the first year of a Labour government, saying it would “ramp up” by the middle of a first parliament. She said the decision had to be taken as a result of the poor economic backdrop and rising interest rates, after Liz Truss’s short premiership crashed the markets last autumn. The Guardian understands Labour has also been looking closely at how to keep other areas of major spending within its fiscal rules. Insiders said the party had been looking to “make sacrifices” in areas it had already flagged as important to demonstrate its focus on economic credibility. The decision on the £28bn is another sign of the spending discipline being enforced by Reeves, as the Conservatives increase their attacks on Labour before the general election, which is likely to come next year. Reeves, who announced the delay to the prosperity fund on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said Labour would now build up to the annual £28bn plan by halfway through a first parliament. The party had promised to spend £28bn a year on green investment until 2030 from the first year after coming to power. However, Reeves said she could not have predicted the market crash caused by the former prime minister Liz Truss’s plans for unfunded borrowing for tax cuts last autumn, which created the difficult economic conditions including higher interests rates affecting the cost of debt repayment. She said the priority was sticking to Labour’s fiscal rule, that debt must be falling as a share of national income after five years. “No plan can be built that is not a rock of economic and fiscal responsibility … I will never play fast and loose with the public finances,” Reeves said on Friday. She said her fiscal rules would be non-negotiable, so Labour would move to the £28bn green investment gradually rather than immediately if the party won the next election. Reeves said she was “on the same page” as Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, regarding the need to scale back the ambition of the plan. One senior Labour source said: “There’s been a recognition for some time given the change in interest rates from when Rachel made the original announcement to where we are today that a clarification was required. It seemed to make sense to get out there and say it explicitly.” While Reeves stressed the fiscal discipline of the move, Miliband later told the BBC’s World at One that also it was partly a matter of practicality, as it could take some time to get supply chains ready for the £28bn of spending. The party is “100% not abandoning our plan”, he added. The Guardian revealed this month that shadow cabinet ministers had asked Reeves to expand the fund’s green mission and use it to pay for a series of capital spending projects, such as housing or transport infrastructure. Reeves had indicated to colleagues there would be no additional money to pay for major infrastructure spending, leaving shadow ministers battling to claim a share of the green fund for their own projects. However, other shadow cabinet sources stressed that Miliband had always made clear that the £28bn of spending on clean energy and decarbonisation would be spread across many sectors from housing to transport. They said Reeves’s announcement showed a firm commitment to the party’s goals on net zero, highlighting the commitment to no new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. The Conservatives responded by claiming that shadow ministers had realised the policy would lead to “disaster” and sought to stress that Labour’s ultimate goal remained to reach the £28bn figure, which they said would worsen the economy. The Conservative party chair, Greg Hands, said: “Keir Starmer’s main economic policy is in tatters, after even he and Rachel Reeves realised it would lead to disaster. “It doesn’t matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour’s plan remains to stick £28bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates.” But George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, suggested he thought Labour was being too “safe and boring”. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: “The good thing is that the shadow chancellor is getting a grip on the spending promises of the Labour party. The bad news is it’s removed one of the few ideas that Labour actually have for being in government. And, you know, on the one hand, I would say the Labour opposition is being more reassuring that it’s not going to take wild risks with the economy. But, on the other hand, it is not telling us really what it would do. It’s telling us what it wouldn’t do. And I think to win an election, it’s not enough to be sort of safe and boring. You have to be a bit exciting, and you have to have something to offer the country about the future. I don’t yet hear that.” Some experts suggested it had never been credible that Labour would find £28bn for green investment in the first year after entering office. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Bit too much excitement on ‘Labour waters down’ £28bn green investment plans. New phrasing is ‘£28bn/year in the second half of the parliament at the latest’. Anyone thinking a new government was going to be able to ramp up £28bn a year from day one hasn’t met the British state.” Environmental groups responded with dismay to the delay. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “Any U-turn would be a huge mistake. Without the necessary immediate investment, we will lose out on the creation of thousands of jobs needed as we phase out fossil fuels, and we will lose out on the opportunity to put green tech industries at the centre of our economy. “Rachel Reeves rightly cites the opportunities of green growth, but this prevarication on confirming the scale of investment needed from the start of a new Labour government risks throwing in the towel on the global race in green tech, with the US, China and the EU already far ahead.” Others within Labour said the move underlined the case for more wealth taxes instead. Richard Burgon, a Labour MP and former shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: “It’s increasingly clear that a wealth tax has a key role to play in providing the resources needed to invest in our public services and to tackle climate change. An annual tax of 1.5% on wealth above £10m would raise £15bn per year.”",Labour; Rachel Reeves; Green politics; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2023-12-04T16:00:12Z,"Public spending is not the only lever Labour can pull, says Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/04/keir-starmer-economic-stagnation-political-extremism-labour,"A Labour government must shed the assumption that public spending is “the only lever that can ever be pulled” to improve people’s lives, Keir Starmer has said, as he refused to rule out keeping planned cuts to government departments if he won power. Answering questions following a speech on Labour’s plans for the economy, Starmer said his party had a record of investing in public services, but twice declined to confirm he would reverse significant cuts set out in Jeremy Hunt’s autumn statement. Asked how his economic strategy differed materially from that of the Conservative chancellor, Starmer gave no policy specifics, saying instead that the Conservatives had “a plausibility problem” over the economy, and that a government led by him would have defined missions. After a speech in which he talked up the central role of economic growth and better productivity in providing extra money for services, the Labour leader reaffirmed his plan to spend up to £28bn a year in the second half of a parliament on green investment, but cautioned against expectations of greater spending. “We will borrow to invest subject to our fiscal rules,” he said. “That’s what the £28bn in the second half of the parliament is all about. But I do think it’s a mistake to think that this is all that you need to do to trigger growth. I think sometimes all of us get into this habit – and this is a habit the Labour party has had for a long time – which is thinking the lever that is spending, investment, is the only lever that can ever be pulled. I don’t accept that.” Instead, Starmer said, significant barriers to growth could be tackled without extra spending, such as changes to the planning system and more efficient public services. Questioned on how voters could hope for a rapid turnaround in their economic fortunes when such projects inevitably required time, Starmer said that while he would promise to improve living standards in the first few years of a Labour government, the benefits of policies such as home insulation schemes were not instant. “If all you do is say, I’m only prepared to do things that are relevant for the next six months, we will continue with decline for a very, very long time,” he said. In his speech to a conference organised by the Resolution Foundation thinktank in London, Starmer said there were grave dangers in being unable to turn things around. Many people were facing “a loss of the future”, Starmer said, adding that the economic contract under which he grew up – life could be tough but the future would improve and the country was fundamentally fair – had come unstuck. That precondition, which had been “a comfort” for his parents, no longer existed, he said. “A political consensus that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will get on, a glue that binds British society together, has become nothing short of a lie – for millions. It’s a well from which so many political horrors can spring.” Starmer said the position he might inherit would be so difficult that everything depended on growth bringing in more money so services could be improved without adding to the tax burden. “Never before has a British government asked its people to pay so much, for so little,” he said. “That’s why growth is everything. It’s not just the quickest way out of this – it’s the only way. The path to public service investment and keeping taxes competitive. It will be a hard road to walk – no doubt about it.”",Keir Starmer; Labour; Economic policy; Politics; UK news; Economics; Resolution Foundation; UK cost of living crisis; Business,Politics
2024-02-16T10:27:27Z,Starmer says ‘fantastic’ byelection wins show Labour is trusted to deliver change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/16/keir-starmer-byelection-wins-labour-wellingborough-kingswood,"Keir Starmer has hailed Labour’s “fantastic” results in the Kingswood and Wellingborough byelections after the party secured two victories that suggest the party is on course for a majority at the general election this year. The Labour leader said the gain of two relatively safe Conservative seats showed voters wanted change and trusted his party to deliver it. The party secured a near-record swing of 28.5 percentage points in Wellingborough and a more modest one of 16.4 points in Kingswood, both of which would give them a secure majority if repeated at a national vote. Starmer said in a statement: “These are fantastic results in Kingswood and Wellingborough that show people want change and are ready to put their faith in a changed Labour party to deliver it.” Separately, he told BBC Breakfast: “I was very pleased last night to see that we were clearly getting Tory switchers, in other words, people who hadn’t voted for the Labour party before, coming out last night and voting for the Labour party in a byelection.” Rishi Sunak said the circumstances around both byelections had been “particularly challenging”. He added: “We’ve clearly been through a lot over the past couple of years as a country, but I genuinely believe at the start of this year we’re pointing in the right direction.” The swing in Wellingborough, where 28-year-old Gen Kitchen overturned a Conservative majority of 18,000, would be enough that if repeated at a general election it could see the Tories win just four seats. It is Labour’s biggest swing from the Tories since 1994, and the second biggest since the war. Kitchen said: “This is a stunning victory for the Labour party and must send a message from Northamptonshire to Downing Street.” The circumstances in that vote were unusual, however, given the Conservative candidate, Helen Harrison, is the partner of the former MP Peter Bone, who was recalled by voters after being found to have bullied a member of staff. In Kingswood, where Damien Egan won with a majority of about 2,500, the swing to Labour would give it a majority of about 60 seats if repeated nationally. The victory was more modest, however, than its wins in three byelections last year, reflecting a slight drop in Labour’s poll lead since then. The results will provide welcome relief for Starmer, who has endured a bruising two weeks after dropping his pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment and suspending two Labour candidates who were recorded making derogatory remarks about Israel. Starmer said on Friday: “I’ve taken two tough and ruthless decisions in the last 10 days. Has it been bumpy? Yes, of course. It’s been bumpy but were they the right decisions is the question I asked myself, and they were the right decisions.” Conservatives said on Friday they could still win a general election, pointing out the low turnout and the strong results for Reform UK, which won more than 10% in both seats. Some Tories believe they will boost turnout and squeeze the Reform vote when voters are forced to decide between Starmer and Sunak. Richard Holden, the Tory party chair, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “People know in a byelection, they’re not voting to change the government. And I think to extrapolate from that to a general election isn’t quite right.” The result is likely to exacerbate divisions about the future direction of the party. Some want the prime minister to shift to the right in an effort to recapture Reform UK voters, while others warn that doing so would put other more centrist seats at risk. The former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the prime minister to “reunite the right wing of politics”. “I think we win their support by concentrating on the areas where we [the Tories and Reform UK] agree,” he said. “That means getting into a position where taxes are reduced [and] dealing with the ridiculous net zero proposals that are becoming unaffordable and are closing down industry in this country.” Holden said Sunak’s focus would remain on cutting inflation. “It doesn’t really matter if your taxes are coming down if you’re seeing inflation eating away at your wages,” he said. Scott Brown, a Conservative councillor in Wellingborough, told the BBC: “We’re losing any kind of identity at the moment. You’ve got the Nat Cons coming in and all kinds of other little subgroups, and that makes it difficult to get a consistent message.” Tim Montgomerie, the founder of the grassroots website Conservative Home, tweeted: “It’s over for the Tories. Absolutely over. We didn’t do what we said we’d do and did the things we said we wouldn’t. The longer Sunak delays the election date the angrier the electorate are going to get.” Even if Sunak does decide to chase Reform voters, pollsters say they are unlikely all to switch to the Tories. John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: “[These results provide] yet further evidence tonight that the Conservatives are in trouble – that wasn’t particularly new. It’s just that there’s a new aspect of that trouble.”",Byelections; Keir Starmer; Labour; Local politics; Conservatives; Northamptonshire; Bristol; England; UK news; Politics,Politics
2024-01-27T17:00:42Z,"To get to net zero, we may have to sell off the UK’s future",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/27/to-get-to-net-zero-we-may-have-to-sell-off-the-uks-future,"If Labour forms the next government, as polls suggest, it must provide the private sector with the kind of incentives that will lift investment in Britain’s economy, making it more productive and environmentally friendly. Joe Biden has done it for the US. Why not Keir Starmer in the UK? Transforming the economy will come at an outsize cost. Worse, it’s an escalating cost that is way beyond the public finances of Britain and possibly even the EU. There is money on offer from the private sector: the world is swimming in cash looking for a home. It’s the demand for super returns that makes a much-needed upgrade of UK infrastructure – from hospitals to the electricity grid – look unaffordable. Biden is finding this out. His Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is the US’s main vehicle for spurring a move to lower-carbon energy consumption, works alongside, and overlaps with, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips and Science Act, which boosts the US semiconductor industry, at a cost over 10 years of about $2tn (£1.57tn). IRA subsidies and tax breaks on their own, which were originally estimated to cost $385bn, are, according to some analysts, on track to hit $3tn if the US reaches one of the legislation’s main targets – reducing the electricity industry’s emissions to 25% of its 2022 total. To rival the US effort, the EU has put together the £600bn NextGenerationEU fund to finance the green and digital transitions. It sounds large but is stretched over 27 countries and will need to be supplemented by private funds to achieve its aims. The UK, meanwhile, is taking a piecemeal approach with one-off subsidies that amount to a few billion pounds. Labour’s £28bn green investment fund is larger – if it is not scaled down any further before the election – and based on a more coherent industrial strategy, yet still looks puny in a global context. That leaves the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, like all her counterparts in the industrialised world, needing huge amounts of private capital to get investment moving. The subsidies demanded by the owner of British Steel, China’s Jingye Group, and the Port Talbot steelworks owner Tata to switch from coal to electric furnaces have been eye-watering, and give a taste of what is to come. Green bonds and infrastructure bonds, which generate money for projects that aim to reduce emissions, are seen as a significant funding source, but have proved to be very expensive and the price is likely to stay high, limiting their attraction. Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, has flagged a solution that is likely to become increasingly popular in government circles: offering credits in return for green commitments from the private sector. That’s what the London climate resilience review, authored by former Environment Agency boss Emma Howard Boyd, suggests can be used to generate investment in the capital. In an interim report last week, she suggested offering credits to buyers such as private landlords, local authorities, or utilities companies such as Thames Water, if they undertake work at their own cost to produce “a measurable reduction” in the area of impermeable surfaces that exacerbate flooding. These credits could last decades and be used to offset the bad behaviour of the buyer – say, the carbon-generating aspects of the business – as it seeks to achieve net zero. Carbon credits have been around for some time and are not uncontroversial. The credits are based on markets that critics say price them too cheaply, meaning large industrial firms can afford to buy them and carry on much as before. Howard Boyd says there are ways to make sure credits connected to infrastructure projects in London would not be abused. She also recommends further research into “financial models that create markets for investment in nature-based solutions”. In the 1980s, the UK paid its way by selling – at a huge discount – dozens of state-owned assets, from North Sea oil and gas rights to British Telecom, BP and British Airways. In the 1990s came the privatisation of the rail network and National Grid. The Blair government, realising much of the past wealth had been sold, turned to the future, selling licences (to mobile phone companies) and long-term contracts, such as the ill-fated private finance initiative. There is even less state cash to play with these days if we accept that entrenched political interests prevent reform of the tax system and that state borrowing has limits. It leads politicians of all colours to consider innovative ways to raise finance. Infrastructure credits might work, but they can’t disguise the huge effort needed – expended today or tomorrow – to reach net zero.",Economics; Green economy; Privatisation; Demutualisation; Business; Economic policy; Environment; Politics; Tax and spending,Business
2024-04-22T05:00:17Z,"Ravaged by austerity, chastened by Brexit, how can Britain have a ‘place in the world’ when it’s destitute at home? | Nesrine Malik",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/22/austerity-brexit-britain-foreign-office-politicians,"Deciding on what the UK’s place in the world should be has been like watching politicians spin a wheel. Then spinning it again when the option they landed on doesn’t work out. First, it was the imperial power projections of Brexit, the reassertion of Britain’s place in the world unshackled by the limitations of equal partnership with Europe. You don’t hear so much about this any more (funny that). Instead, we now find ourselves in an era chastened by the embarrassing bombast of the past few years, but still trying to work out where we “fit”, what our role is, in a world where the country’s status has taken a beating. Earlier this month, former diplomats proposed that the Foreign Office be abolished altogether and be replaced by a new Department for International Affairs. As it stands, the Foreign Office works like “a giant private office for the foreign secretary” and should be replaced by a new independent institution, one “less rooted in the past”. The new body they propose would be a more modern place. The colonial art would go, and with it, other outdated ways of working and thinking about foreign policy. There is something in this. A department that is isolated from the rest of the civil service machinery and serves one minister is a hangover. The paintings don’t help. The whole building feels like a movie set (and is actually used as one), a cosplay of past imperial standing. And in keeping with the stubbornness of that view, and how often it is resurrected in particularly rightwing storytelling, it feels like a re-enactment of a former era. The fact that the office has not been repurposed, both in building and in style, is part of something bigger. “The British state,” the sociologist Paul Gilroy once told me, “is a machine for running and exploring the world, which doesn’t work very well when it comes to the business of the modern nation.” So how is British foreign policy to work, now that its Brexit ambitions have been dashed? The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has a suggestion – “progressive realism”, which reads to me like an acceptance of Britain’s new place in the world, but with an added dash of divestment from any sort of underlying values. Or as Lammy himself puts it, “the pursuit of ideals without delusions about what is achievable”. This new progressive realism recognises that Britain still has some chips to play with. It is a permanent member of the UN security council and the world’s sixth largest economy, and “our universities, legal sectors, creatives and businesses continue to be world leaders”. These great strengths can be leveraged to make Britain a player once again, but without delusions of grandeur. This tinkers around the far edges of the problem. It is impossible to carve out a role for Britain in the world without first reckoning with what it has become at home. The country’s colonial past is not the only thing that has been resigned to history. This modern, progressively realist nation that policymakers are trying to project into the world is also a fantasy. A nation’s foreign presence is built on the foundations of its domestic state. And after years of defunding and shrinking of the public domain, that state is a weakened and subdued one, unrecognisable in Lammy’s reaches for “optimism”. Austerity does not only diminish practical things. It doesn’t just affect buildings, services and the amount of money those who are vulnerable have access to. Austerity takes apart the very fabric of national identity, removes the spaces in which it can be forged, and eliminates people’s dignity. Flags, the royal family, the army – all relentlessly paraded and namechecked by Conservatives and Labour as symbols of our national pride – are poor substitutes for what brings people together and gives them a sense of optimism about the future. Even if Britain is the sixth largest economy in the world, too many people within it are browbeaten and isolated. Nearly a fifth of the population struggles with basic needs – 300,000 children were plunged into a state of absolute poverty in the past year alone. Since 2010, five-year-olds have been displaying signs of reduced growth. As Britain seeks to stand taller in the world, its children are getting shorter. How then, are politicians and diplomats to face the world with any sense of swagger or idea of what we would like to achieve, both for our own national interests and any progressive goals globally, when a much more basic role, that of providing for your citizens, grows increasingly unfulfilled? And how to do so when the sibling of austerity, hostility to immigration, treats the world as some global recruitment pool for the jobs governments do not want to train for or spend on, and then restricts those who do come from bringing their families? Take a peek beneath the hood of our world-leading universities and business, and you will see recruitment crises, underfunding that overseas students plug (but again, without their families), and a property sector increasingly treated as a hedge fund by wealthy global investors. The very organs of state, the ones that together should form the building blocks of the country as it represents itself abroad, are being defunded, automated, and their roles outsourced to private providers, with little promise of reform or reversal of the damage that has been done. Lammy’s own progressively realist goals of countering the climate crisis and tackling inequality are particularly hollow, given the party’s slashing of its green investment pledge and refusal to end poverty-triggering policies such as the two-child benefit cap. After Labour failed its biggest foreign policy test so far by fumbling an early question on whether Israel has the right to cut off power and water from the civilian population of Gaza, and only calling for a ceasefire under duress and amid party turmoil, Labour should again look, and start, closer to home. And so what remains? If there is no moral standing at home, there can be none abroad, only the meaningless language of what is “achievable”, which is always a byword for what there is the will to achieve. If there is a fractured, underfunded, uncoordinated public domain, then our role in the world can only be as committed as we are domestically in creating a coherent system of peace and equality. We can remove the paintings of a triumphant Anglo-Saxon empire with an Africa represented by a black child carrying a fruit basket. And we can try to draw a line under a Conservative regime that, particularly under Boris Johnson, was pugnacious and comically out of touch. But these are cosmetic exercises, wrapped in fancy language and good intentions. Behind them lies a truth, still revealing itself in scale and depth, about how changing the economy to the exclusion of many bedraggles the nation as a whole.

2024-01-04T17:58:59Z,Political realities constrain Sunak over when to call an election,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/04/political-realities-constrain-rishi-sunak-election,"One of the few political powers to rest almost entirely in the prime minister’s hands is the decision over when to call an election. Rishi Sunak invoked that power on Thursday to put himself back on the front foot after several weeks dominated by speculation – often fuelled by senior Labour MPs – that there could be a vote as soon as May. The prime minister told broadcasters on Thursday it was his “working assumption” that an election would happen later in the year, adding: “I’ve got lots to get on with and I’m determined to keep delivering for the British people.” In a day that otherwise would have been dominated by headlines about the speech given by Keir Starmer in Bristol, it was a blunt display of prime ministerial power. But it is also a sign of the political realities that constrain Sunak. With the Conservatives 18 points behind in the polls, having an election later in the year gives the prime minister more time to turn the economy around by increasing growth and further reducing inflation. He can also use the extra time trying to kickstart his scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which Labour officials worry would put them on the back foot over one of the most prominent issues of the campaign to come. Labour, which had attempted to embed the narrative that a spring election is inevitable, seized on Sunak’s words as indicating cowardice. “If he’s not going to set a date, what’s he hiding from the public?” said Starmer. Labour MPs accused Sunak of “squatting” in Number 10, an echo of the Sun front page that accused Gordon Brown of doing the same after the 2010 election. But while Labour is hoping for an earlier election, it might also benefit from being granted additional time. The extra months will allow the party’s policy chiefs to continue honing their pre-election pledges, with internal party battles continuing to rage over important policies such as spending £28bn on green investment schemes. An autumn election will mean Sunak has to go through what is likely to be a bruising set of local elections in May, which could weaken his position within the Conservative party. This will also mean more people will roll off their fixed-term mortgages and begin to feel the pain of higher interest rates for the first time. But strategists in both parties also say that waiting for longer to call an election makes it harder to predict what the campaign will be fought on. “It is very difficult to predict what is going to be the main issue facing voters in six months’ time,” said one. “Joe Biden won the US election on one issue – Covid – which was unknown just a year earlier.” If Sunak does call an autumn election as he suggests, he has a range of options for the date. The prime minister could call an October election, but given this would probably mean cancelling lucrative party conferences, he might choose to wait until November. If Sunak does what some expect and announces the date during his party conference speech it will mean a vote in mid-November. Anything later than that risks forcing campaigners to go door-knocking in the dark depths of winter, and is likely to prove unpopular with the party’s rank and file. One other option remains open to the prime minister: he could choose to go to the polls in May anyway. He repeatedly refused to rule out doing so on Thursday, while simultaneously dismissing such a possibility as unlikely. Labour officials insist they are still planning for a spring election, not least because the Tories have set a slightly earlier date than normal for the budget, in early March. “I’m not sure anything has changed,” said one Labour strategist after Sunak’s comments. “All the evidence is still they’re planning a May election, otherwise why hold the budget so early?” But if Sunak does decide to call a spring election after all, it will have one added bonus that would not have been the case until Thursday: the element of surprise.",Rishi Sunak; Conservatives; Labour; Keir Starmer; UK news; Politics,Politics
2024-01-22T06:00:49Z,"UK should invest in green economy instead of tax giveaways, Lstudy shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/22/uk-should-invest-in-green-economy-instead-of-tax-giveaways-lstudy-shows,"The UK should invest £26bn a year in a low-carbon economy to revive prosperity instead of planning tax giveaways that will only lead to further stagnation, leading economists have advised. Investing in energy infrastructure, transport, innovation in new technologies such as AI, and the natural environment would boost the UK’s economy rapidly, the research found. Public investment at that level would be likely to generate about twice as much accompanying investment from the private sector, and would quickly pay off in higher productivity, efficiency savings, economic growth and carbon reductions, according to a major paper by Lord Stern, a former chief economist of the World Bank, and colleagues from the London School of Economics. Current government plans to stifle investment, by contrast, would lead to a “continuation of stagnant productivity and weak economic growth”. The findings are strikingly similar to the commitments made repeatedly by Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to invest £28bn a year in a “green prosperity plan”. Those commitments have come under sustained attack from the Tories, and are now to be reviewed by the opposition leadership this week, as some figures within the party are understood to favour dropping the pledge. The authors of the LSE paper, entitled Boosting Growth and Productivity in the UK Through Investments in the Sustainable Economy, published on Monday, arrived at their conclusions independently, by examining the fitness of the UK’s crumbling infrastructure, the challenges and benefits of low-carbon investment, the broader economic environment and international competition. Dimitri Zenghelis, lead author of the paper, said: “This does indeed mean that Labour’s £28bn-a-year green investment plans are of the right magnitude, consistent with investing in the structural change associated with a sustainable and resilient transition.” But he noted that the investments required – equivalent to an increase in public investment of roughly 1% of GDP – were also similar to those espoused by the former prime minister Boris Johnson, when he held the presidency of the G7 group of advanced industrialised nations. Zenghelis said the research suggested that any “fiscal headroom” within the public finances, owing to better than expected economic performance, would be better allocated to investment than to tax cuts, which the Conservative government is planning. “The evidence suggests that [such an uplift in public investment], after more than a decade of underinvestment, gives the UK the best chance of staying in, and possibly ahead of, the global innovation, efficiency and productivity game,” said Zenghelis. “High taxes do constrain private activity, but the evidence shows that in the UK the far bigger constraint is deficient core infrastructure and underinvestment in produced, human, intangible and natural capital.” Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, who was not involved in the LSE report, said: “The UK has been underinvesting for the last 45 years. The consequences are evident all around us, in failing infrastructure, costly energy and a depleted natural world. “Lord Stern and his colleagues are absolutely right. Public investment must be stepped up if we are to achieve net zero, restore nature and compete with countries around the world who are investing in the green industries of the future. It is what the private sector is looking for to give it the confidence to invest.” Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said: “While the Tories refuse to invest in the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century, now Jeremy Hunt’s economic advisers are saying they are dead wrong. Britain needs investment to grow our economy, cut energy bills and deliver energy security for our country. “Labour’s green prosperity plan will get Britain out of the doom loop of 14 years of low growth and stagnant living standards under the Tories, by rebuilding the strength of British industry with clean, homegrown power that we control in this country.” A government spokesperson said: “This government is focused on long-term decisions to strengthen our economy, which is why at autumn statement we announced a business investment package which could raise investment by around £20bn a year in a decade’s time. “We’re leading the world in our transformation of the energy industry towards more clean and renewable energy, with over 80,000 green jobs being supported or in the pipeline since 2020, and our plans to power up Britain are expected to attract a further £100bn investment in green industries of the future.”",Green economy; Environment; UK news; Economics; Economic policy; Keir Starmer; Labour; Conservatives; Politics; Business; Renewable energy; Infrastructure; Public finance,Environment
2024-03-11T13:55:40Z,Portugal election: leader of winning centre-right party calls on rivals not to stand in his way,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/11/portugal-election-leader-of-winning-centre-right-party-calls-on-rivals-not-to-stand-in-his-way,"The leader of Portugal’s centre-right Democratic Alliance, which won the narrowest of victories over its socialist rivals in Sunday’s snap general election, has called on leftwing and far-right parties not to stand in his way as he attempts to form a minority government. The Democratic Alliance – an electoral platform made up of the large Social Democratic party (PSD) and two smaller conservative parties – finished first in the election, winning 79 seats in the 230-seat assembly. The Socialist party (PS), which has governed Portugal for the past eight years, came second with 77 seats, while the far-right Chega party enjoyed a surge in support and quadrupled its seat count from 12 to 48 to finish third. As his victory was confirmed, Luís Montenegro, the leader of the PSD, which heads the Democratic Alliance, said the Portuguese people had spoken and demanded “a change of government and of policies”. Addressing supporters early on Monday morning, he added: “My expectation is that PS and Chega will not form a negative alliance to prevent the government that the Portuguese wanted.” He also said that while he did not expect the Socialists to “adhere to our government’s proposals”, he hoped they would “respect the will of the Portuguese people”. Montenegro is now waiting for Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, to formally invite him to try to form a government. The numbers, however, are not in the PSD’s favour. Montenegro has repeatedly ruled out any deals with Chega, which is keen to extract maximum leverage from its strong result on Sunday. During the campaign, he made it clear there would be no agreement with the far-right party because of what he termed the “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic” views of its leader, André Ventura. But the PSD leader is expected to come under significant pressure from some within his party to reach a deal with Chega in order to guarantee a centre-right government. Ruling out any pacts with Chega means the Democratic Alliance’s only other allies would be the small, centre-right Liberal Initiative party, which won eight seats. But even that partnership would yield only 87 seats in total – far short of an assembly majority of 116 seats. The arithmetic means that any resultant centre-right minority government would be heavily dependent on Chega’s votes to get its legislation through parliament. Montenegro said he was fully aware that “on many occasions the implementation of the government’s programme will have to go through political dialogue in the assembly of the republic”, and asked all political parties to assume their responsibilities, “starting with the PS”. However, Ventura – a former football pundit who left the PSD to found Chega five years ago – is still pushing for a role in government. “Chega asked to become the centrepiece of the political system and it achieved that result,” Ventura said late on Sunday. “We want to give Portugal a stable government.” Sunday’s results prompted European centre-right politicians to hail Montenegro’s victory and far-right leaders to congratulate Ventura. Manfred Weber, the leader of the conservative European People’s party in the European parliament, said voters had chosen Montenegro “because he can lead the change Portugal needs, towards a better future”. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the leader of Spain’s conservative People’s party – which has joined forces with the far-right Vox party to run five Spanish regions, and which had hoped a national coalition with Vox would help topple Spain’s socialists last year – also congratulated Montenegro. “I’m delighted to see our Portuguese brothers have chosen the only credible project for change in Portugal,” he said. Jordan Bardella, the president of France’s National Rally, hailed Chega’s “great breakthrough”, saying the Portuguese people were “defending their identity and their prosperity, and sweeping away the corrupt socialists.” In Hungary, Ádám Samu Balázs, the head of the international secretariat for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party, also called Chega’s results a “great breakthrough”. He added: “The fight of our friend and ally André Ventura against the globalist left and for the protection of national sovereignty and the defence of Europe is exemplary.” The early general election – Portugal’s second in three years – was triggered after the socialist prime minister, António Costa, resigned in November after an investigation was launched into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa – who had been in office since 2015 and won a surprise absolute majority in the 2022 general election – has not been accused of any crime. He said that while his conscience was clear, he felt he had no choice but to step down because the “duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. He also announced he would not be running for prime minister in the election, leaving the Socialist party in the hands of Pedro Nuno Santos, a former infrastructure minister from the left of the party. Santos acknowledged his party’s defeat early on Monday, saying: “We will be the opposition, we will renovate the party and we will seek to win back the Portuguese who are dissatisfied with the PS.” The Socialists’ hope that the threat of the far right moving closer to government would rally centrist voters as it did in 2022 did not pay off the second time around. Despite the party’s strong economic record in office, it has been tarnished by a string of corruption scandals in recent years. Widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties – coupled with a housing crisis, stressed public services and low wages – has driven many voters to Chega, which campaigned on a promise to “clean up” Portugal.",Portugal; Europe; The far right; World news,World news
2024-05-17T16:26:07Z,"Beware the Biden factor, Keir Starmer: you can govern well and still risk losing the country | Jonathan Freedland",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/17/keir-starmer-joe-biden-donald-trump,"The smile was the giveaway. Asked whether he was “just a copycat” of Tony Blair at the launch of his Blair-style pledge card on Thursday, Keir Starmer positively glowed. He was delighted with the comparison, which the entire exercise was surely designed to encourage. Blair “won three elections in a row”, Starmer said, beaming. Of course, he’s thrilled to be likened to a serial winner. And yet the more apt parallel is also a cautionary one. It’s not with Starmer’s long-ago predecessor, but with his would-be counterpart across the Atlantic: Joe Biden. It’s natural that the sight of a Labour leader, a lawyer from north London, on course for Downing Street after a long era of Tory rule, would have people digging out the Oasis CDs and turning back the clock to 1997: Labour election victories are a rare enough commodity to prompt strong memories. But, as many veterans of that period are quick to point out, the circumstances of 2024 are very different. The UK economy was humming then and it’s parlous now. Optimism filled the air then, while too few believe genuine change is even possible now. And politics tended to be about material matters then, tax and public services, rather than dominated by polarising cultural wars as it is now. All of which partly explains why it’s a comparison to the US president that Starmer should be thinking about – even if it’s not nearly so encouraging. Start with those aspects of the Biden story that can give Starmer heart. The veteran Democrat showed it is possible to win office thanks less to a wave of popular enthusiasm than a hunger for change after years of chaos. He proved that you can make a virtue of a lack of swash and buckle, offering steady solidity as a respite after frantic drama. In 2020, Biden demonstrated that dependable and capable can be enough to win when voters have had enough of charismatic and crazy. It worked for him after the era of Donald Trump, just as it’s working for Starmer after an era that, for all Rishi Sunak’s efforts, is defined by Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. In other words, in 2020, Biden showed that playing a hand much like the one dealt to Starmer can be enough to win. The trouble is, in 2024 he’s showing why that might not be enough to win twice. Take a look at the New York Times poll published this week. The headline findings are bad enough, with Biden trailing in five of the six battleground states where the election will be decided. Behind in Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan, he’s ahead in Wisconsin alone. The underlying numbers are worse still with, improbable as it may seem, Trump gaining among Black, Latino and young voters especially. Most alarming for Biden is the finding that 70% think the US political and economic systems need major change – or should be torn down altogether. It makes the 2024 contest a change election in the US, just as it is in the UK – and for an incumbent such as Biden, that is dangerously bad news. Put another way, the US appetite for change is so great that it is causing the unravelling of key parts of the Obama coalition – minorities and the young – and its reassembly behind Trump. Barack Obama offered himself as the change candidate in 2008, an outsider who would challenge the establishment, and Trump, even though he is a self-described billionaire and a former president less than four years out of office, is successfully making the same rebel pitch. What’s more, those Americans itching for something new are prepared to use as their agent of change a man who incited a violent insurrection against the US government, sought to overturn a democratic election, has made no secret of his dictatorial ambitions for a second term, has been found liable for sexual abuse and is now standing trial on criminal charges in New York. When so many Americans are willing to flock to that person as the alternative, it tells you how much they dislike what they have now. There is a warning here for Starmer. Not for his prospects in the coming election – Biden’s success in 2020 tells him he can be confident – but for the election after that. The former Conservative cabinet minister David Gauke thinks Priti Patel is a decent bet as the next Tory leader, perhaps offering to keep the seat warm for the return of Boris Johnson. If Trump makes the comeback to end all comebacks in November, do not think Johnson will not be tempted to repeat the trick. How is it that a second Trump presidency is even conceivable; how is it that Biden can be lagging behind such a flawed, widely loathed rival? The US economy is improving; the stock market is roaring; inflation is falling. The US is set to grow at double the rate of its fellow G7 nations this year. More to the point, through a series of landmark legislative achievements – a record that outstrips Obama’s – Biden has spread the jobs and investment around, even to those parts of the US left derelict by decades of post-industrial decline. Take his gargantuan infrastructure package, the poorly named Inflation Reduction Act: more than 80% of its green investment dollars have gone to counties with below-average wages. This is levelling up made real. And yet, Biden is struggling, even in those places he has helped most. It’s a reminder of a core fact that is so often forgotten. That politics is an emotions business, one that turns not on what people think but what they feel. All the economic data in the world won’t help you if voters feel squeezed and reckon the country is on the wrong track. As the US commentator Joe Klein puts it, politics often comes down to “the art of competitive storytelling”. The successful politician tells a story that goes beyond the practical matters of pay and public services, speaking instead to voters about the way they see their own lives and the future, for themselves, their families and the country. In that competition, Trump beats Biden. His story is dark and vengeful, pitting his people against a menacing other, but it is compelling. Biden has a narrative, too – he will protect democracy and abortion rights from the Trump threat – but it is defensive. This is the gap Starmer needs to plug – and you can see how he might do it. One Labour luminary says that too many Britons “don’t just feel a loss of income, but a deficit of dignity” and that politicians have to address that. Starmer gets close when he speaks of “dignity at work”, of the human need for respect. It sounds authentic, as if it might even be his animating purpose, when he recalls the way his father, a toolmaker who worked in a factory, “always felt … that he was looked down on. Disrespected.” Whatever the story is, he needs to tell it. Right now, what Keir Starmer offers will almost certainly be enough to get him into No 10. But the lesson of Joe Biden is that, if he wants to stay there, it will take much more.

2024-02-01T19:00:58Z,Labour stresses stability and no surprises as it courts business leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/01/labour-stresses-stability-and-no-surprises-as-it-courts-business-leaders,"There was an elephant in the room as hundreds of business leaders gathered at the Oval cricket ground in south London to hear Labour’s pre-election pitch to captains of industry on Thursday. The opposition party had made much of its plan to sweep away zero-hour contracts and reverse many of the Conservative government’s employment laws in recent months. But it was barely mentioned at the conference until Keir Starmer fleetingly declared in his speech that not everyone was likely to be on board. Starmer said it was a key part of “levelling up workers’ rights in a way that has not been attempted for decades”. The policy received a mixed reception. One senior business executive, who asked to remain anonymous, was uncertain about the promised employment laws giving staff greater protection. “There is an intent, but still very little detail, so it is something where we don’t really know the knock-on effects,” they said. A director of an energy company said that while most of his employees were on high wages and generous terms of employment, they used contractors who might be affected. But Peter O’Driscoll, the managing director of the parking app RingGo, said it would have no effect on his business, which mostly employs specialist technology workers and complies with the high standards set by its main partners – local councils. “We are part of a group run out of Sweden and it’s safe to say the main business has much higher standards than the UK already,” he said. Helen Brocklebank, the head of the lobby group Walpole, which represents 250 luxury brands including Burberry and Aston Martin, said her members were unlikely to be affected. “Our members employ highly skilled people who are valued in the way Keir Starmer talked about,” she said. More than 400 executives attended Labour’s conference, which provided a succession of shadow ministers for an eager audience keen to find out what is in store from the opposition before the general election this year. A morning breakfast with the shadow City minister, Tulip Siddiq, set the tone, with some of the biggest beasts in the financial sector on the panel talking about how Labour could overcome the instability and uncertainty caused by Brexit and the prospect of four UK prime ministers in as many years. Brioche rolls stuffed with sausages and bacon were served to accompany Siddiq’s speech, in which she spelled out how Labour would seek to boost the City and promote the financial sector more broadly. Small but tasty portions remained the theme for the rest of the day, and not just in relation to the food. Speeches were kept short, with plenty of time for questions at the £1,000 a head conference. Rachel Reeves’s commitment to cap the level of corporation tax at 25% was followed by some challenges to her plans for £28bn of green infrastructure investment. She stuck by the pledge, but in terms that meant it could be watered down if Jeremy Hunt spends all the Treasury’s spare cash in his budget next month. Sponsored by the financial data provider Bloomberg, and with Microsoft, Google and the heads of all the leading business lobby groups in attendance, there was a big company theme at the conference. Against the backdrop of the cricket pitch, the National Grid chair, Paula Rosput Reynolds, interviewed Starmer after his speech and the question of the £28bn green investment pledge was raised again. Starmer joked that it was Reynolds’ company that was going to take the UK towards an electric future and he should be asking questions of her. In the time left for audience participation, Starmer was pointedly asked what he would do for small and medium-sized firms, but while he lauded the efforts of owner-managers, it was clear his need to boost the economy would rely on seismic shifts in investment that only the major corporations can deploy. Dan Hogan, a director of the communications firm Blakeney, said many of his clients were energy companies and feared the £28bn pledge would be rolled back. “But the message of stability and certainty if Labour comes to power is one they will like,” he said. O’Driscoll said he was at the conference to check with Labour’s transport team that a government plan to develop a national charging scheme that brings together parking and EV charging would be embraced. Like so many projects under the current administration, it won’t be finished before the election and would need the approval of a future Labour government. “It’s a huge project that will be a big step forward, if it can continue,” O’Driscoll said. The evening ended with a party for 200 ambassadors and investors who were expected to be offered wine and beer, but not champagne. Maybe Labour’s budgeting in opposition is much as it would be in government.",Labour; Economic policy; Workers' rights; Business; Politics; UK news; Rachel Reeves; Financial sector; Zero-hours contracts,Politics
2024-03-11T15:40:24Z,"Whoever forms Portugal's government, this is a victory for the far right. Will Europe ever learn? | Joana Ramiro",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/11/portugal-elections-chega-far-right-europe,"If the westernmost nation of mainland Europe was once seen as a paragon of sensible governance, it is now set for months or even years of political instability. Neither Portugal’s outgoing Socialists (PS) nor the centre-right Social Democratic party (PSD) were able to garner a majority in Sunday’s elections, ending the night barely one point apart and with a two-seat difference in the Assembleia da República. All eyes are now on the third force, the far-right party Chega (“Enough”), which quadrupled its parliamentarians from 12 to 48. Here is the real headline: an unprecedented victory for the far right in Portugal’s democratic history. Snap elections were called last November after the Socialist prime minister, António Costa, resigned after the launch of an investigation into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. (Costa was not accused of any crime, saying that while his conscience was clear, he felt he had no choice but to step down.) After more than eight years of eventful but unwavering leadership, the nation was left adrift. The opposition leader, Luis Montenegro, had been in place for just over a year when the government fell. The Socialists quickly, yet overwhelmingly, elected former infrastructure minister Pedro Nuno Santos to be their new leader. On the campaign trail, both men proved similarly unimpressive, bordering on dull. Santos, known as a boisterous character, played the part of young but sensible leader. Montenegro wavered between platitudes and the inescapable shadow of Chega. Poll after poll, Sunday’s gridlock was long foretold. It was one of those great ironies of history. Just short of 50 days before the 50th anniversary of the Portuguese revolution, which toppled an almost 50-year dictatorship, the nation woke up to nearly 50 newly elected far-right lawmakers in parliament. To give you a sense of Chega’s politics, it ran on a platform advocating the creation of a new crime of “illegal residence” on Portuguese soil and “reviewing” police regulations on the use of force. Pundits are now struggling to envision a governmental combination that does not include Chega. Montenegro has so far explicitly ruled out any deals with Chega because of what he calls the party leader’s “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic” views – the question is now how much strength is left in that cordon sanitaire. Many supporters of PS hoped for a repeat of 2015, when the Socialists came second in the election but successfully formed a government through a confidence and supply agreement with other parties. But this gangly coalition, aptly nicknamed the “contraption”, would be hard to reproduce today. The Communist party is weakened, with just four MPs now where it had 17 at the time. The anti-capitalist Left Bloc, which peaked in 2015 at 19 seats, now clasps on to the five it has had since 2022. The pro-EU Livre had more luck, going from one to four MPs. But, in total, the left fared badly, with just under 40% of the vote share. The Chega founder and leader, André Ventura, branded the night “the end of the two-party system”. A catchy slogan, for sure, evocative not only of the party’s power as kingmaker, but also of the fact that Portuguese people have indeed grown tired of the two parties that have, alternately, governed the country since 1974. PS was not only fighting a war of attrition after eight years in power (marred by a series of influence-peddling and mismanagement scandals), but also fell short on its promises. Despite winning an absolute majority in 2022, the Socialists did little that could truly be called socialist. Between 2015 and 2019, PS conceded on a handful of simple social and economic demands from its far-left partners, while bolstering a limping economy with tourism revenues that injected much-needed cash but caused rents to spike, triggering an ongoing housing crisis. Since 2019, with two comfortable majorities, Costa successfully steered the ship during the pandemic but was unable to meet the demands of the economic aftermath of Covid. Minimum wage increases were never able to meet spiralling prices; rent controls were always out of the question. In a country where 12% are living in food poverty, people felt plundered, and while Costa’s replacement, Santos, led his campaign with a sort of mea culpa approach, to the electorate it felt like too little, too late. Conversely, voters have also not forgotten about PSD’s last administration, from 2011 to 2015, which wrought hardship through a series of austerity measures that went from cutting pensions to abolishing bank holidays. Indeed, sightings of the former Conservative prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho on the campaign trail were received with frostiness and even heckling. Chega’s success is the result of letting the beast of social discontent grow, feeding on the rapidly deteriorating living and working conditions. In a Portugal where incomes are the sixth lowest in the EU but “non-habitual residents” (read: expats) enjoy various tax exemptions, the most vulnerable are easy prey to an ultra-nationalist political project that promises higher wages and public spending but also lower taxes. A mere three months ahead of the European elections, democrats in Brussels should take notes from Portugal’s change in fortune. But maybe it is too late. The paradigmatic shift isn’t so much the end of the two-party system, but the end of the electorate’s faith in a socioeconomic model that has for many decades failed to sustainably deliver for the average working Jane and Joe. Last night, Chega was receiving messages of congratulation from far-right parties in Hungary, Spain, France and Germany. Democracies that fail to learn this lesson are doomed to open the door to the Chegas of the world.

2024-01-13T17:00:03Z,Economics’ old guard gangs up on Rachel Reeves’s spending plans | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/13/watch-out-rachel-reeves-the-old-guard-is-ganging-up-on-your-borrowing-ambitions,"One by one, they stamp all over your dreams. In this election year, the dashed hopes will belong to Rachel Reeves. In 2010 the victim was Alistair Darling. Reeves wants to increase spending on the UK’s crumbling infrastructure should Labour win at the polls. Her commitments have become less ambitious as pressure mounts from mainstream economists and those in high finance worried about current debt levels escalating. The experts who feel the need to pour cold water on higher spending plans avoid direct criticism of Labour’s £28bn green investment package. Instead there is general concern about the level of government debt, supporting Jeremy Hunt’s view that debt must fall, come what may. Such is the weight of argument against Reeves that Labour has scaled down its ambitions, and the investment plan will only reduce, rather than reverse, the dramatic fall in public investment as a proportion of national income mapped out by the current administration over the next five years. Sir Robert Stheeman, who runs the government’s Debt Management Office (DMO), is the latest expert to portray his intervention as a display of technical profundity when in reality it is a swipe at those who want to end a century of underinvestment. Before we hear from Stheeman, it should be remembered that, as governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King set a precedent when he said that Darling’s budget before the 2010 election had not gone far enough to bring down Britain’s debt. It was the boost George Osborne needed to persuade many waverers that Gordon Brown’s government could not be trusted with the nation’s finances. Many economists at the time said there was a clear case for borrowing at historically low interest rates to invest in Britain’s infrastructure and its education, health and welfare systems to raise productivity and national income. But King was joined by the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the major credit ratings agencies, which arbitrate on the value of government debt, in his praise of austerity. They won the day. Stheeman is due to retire next year from the DMO, which acts as the government’s mortgage broker, managing the thousands of bonds that amount to the government’s total borrowings. Last week he warned Financial Times readers that ministers should be wary of provoking a backlash in financial markets by increasing borrowing too quickly. “In a world where we have debt to sell,” he said, “policymaking cannot be divorced from the reality of the market.” Later in the interview, the DMO boss said the current level of borrowing – £2.7tn, or almost 98% of gross domestic product – was manageable, but appeared to argue that £2.8tn or £2.9tn would trigger a panic. He can be forgiven for referring to Liz Truss’s attempt to spend tens of billions on tax cuts almost overnight, paid for with borrowing, when she and Kwasi Kwarteng took control of Downing Street in 2022. But Truss is history and Stheeman was telling us about the future. He will know that Reeves is the future, and his warning shot looks to be aimed at Labour’s spending plans. The DMO boss went on holiday after his interview. A spokesperson said that on his return he would be in pre-budget purdah and questions from the press would have to wait until after 6 March. As the year progresses, other prominent voices will put pressure on the government, and future governments, to reduce borrowing. Clare Lombardelli, the former Treasury official who is now the OECD’s chief economist, said last summer that while a few countries might have exceptional circumstances, “on average, we do need to get debt levels down”. The credit ratings agencies say borrowing levels need to fall and the IMF, amid concerns about inequality and climate resilience, will probably also warn about debt levels. Compared with the aftermath of the 2008 crash, western economies are paying much higher interest rates, which makes investment harder to justify. Nevertheless, the French government has borrowed 112% of GDP and the Spanish 111%, much higher than the UK’s 97.5%. The US has borrowed 120% of GDP, while Italy and Japan are on 142% and 220% respectively. It’s not the level of borrowing that matters so much as what the nation does with the money. That’s where the UK’s reputation falls down. So Labour voters need to accept that the weight of mainstream economic opinion, and a recent history of squandering what money there is limits Reeves’s room for manoeuvre.

2023-08-22T12:19:03Z,UK factory output tumbles to lowest level in nearly three years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/22/uk-factory-output-lowest-cbi-bank-interest-rate-economy,"UK factory output has fallen sharply over the summer to its lowest level in nearly three years in the latest sign that interest rate increases by the Bank of England are slowing the economy. The monthly snapshot of manufacturing from the CBI showed production at its weakest since the economy was emerging from its first Covid lockdown in 2020. The employers’ organisation said its members had been surprised by a slowdown in activity over the three months to August in which twice as many firms said output was falling (37%) rather than rising (18%). Amid evidence of widespread problems for industry, the CBI said production fell in 15 of 17 subsectors in the latest three months, with marked drops in motor vehicles and transport equipment; mechanical engineering; paper, printing and media; and chemicals. A survey of 277 manufacturers revealed that domestic and export order books were seen as below normal but price pressures continued to ease. The CBI said the balance of firms expecting to raise selling prices over the coming months was at its lowest since February 2021. The Bank of England raised interest rates from 5% to 5.25% – its 14th successive increase in official borrowing costs since December 2021 – during the period the survey was being conducted in late July and early August. The Bank is attempting to curb high inflation through the rate rises. Martin Sartorius, a CBI economist, said: “With output volumes contracting at their fastest pace since the Covid-19 pandemic and order books deteriorating, this survey makes for gloomy reading for manufacturers. “However, easing price pressures will bring some relief to many manufacturing firms and the broader economy.” He added: “The weak outlook for manufacturing activity underlines the need to double-down on delivering sustainable growth. With fierce levels of international competition, the race is on for the UK government to offer targeted incentives to attract green investment and support firms’ decarbonisation efforts.”",Economics; Economic policy; Bank of England; Interest rates; Manufacturing sector; Manufacturing data; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Business; Politics,Business
2024-02-13T19:29:06Z,Labour suspends second parliamentary candidate over Israel comments,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/13/labour-suspends-second-parliamentary-candidate-over-israel-comments,"Labour has suspended a second parliamentary candidate over their remarks about Israel, as Keir Starmer struggles to contain the fallout from the leak of a private meeting of party activists in Lancashire last year. Party sources said on Tuesday that Labour had suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn, less than 24 hours after the party withdrew its support from Azhar Ali, its candidate for the Rochdale byelection later this month. With the party now looking for two new candidates for the general election, senior Labour figures were fighting among each other on Tuesday over who was to blame for the escalating crisis. One Labour activist called the party’s handling of the controversy a “shitshow”. A senior Labour peer called it a “car crash”, adding: “We should be more careful in who we have as our candidates.” Starmer defended his decisions on Tuesday, after a damaging 48 hours in which he had initially backed Ali before changing his mind when new recordings emerged from the meeting. “Certain information came to light over the weekend in relation to the candidate [and] there was a fulsome apology,” he said. “Further information came to light yesterday calling for decisive action, so I took decisive action.” The recordings all come from a single meeting in October, which sources have told the Guardian was held between Ali, Jones and a group of Labour councillors who were threatening to quit the party over its stance on Gaza. The Middle East crisis has proved one of the most divisive issues for Labour in recent years, with many MPs, councillors and activists accusing Starmer of not going far enough in condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza. In the latest recording, which was first reported on Tuesday by the Guido Fawkes website, Jones appeared to try to defend the Labour leader, but did so by expressing views that were condemned by Jewish Labour supporters as “appalling”. Jones said during the meeting: “I’m sure when [world leaders] go home, like me, pardon my French [they say] ‘fucking Israel’ again.” He went on to criticise British people who choose to fight for the Israel Defense Forces, saying wrongly that doing so was against the law. “No British person should be fighting for any other country at all, full stop,” he said. “It is against the law and you should be locked up.” The Jewish Labour Movement issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying: “Graham Jones’s comments about British-Israeli Jews are appalling and unacceptable within the Labour party.” Jones’s suspension came a day after the party withdrew its support for Ali over comments made at the same meeting, in which he said he believed Israel had deliberately allowed the Hamas attack on 7 October to happen as a pretext for its assault on the strip. Starmer initially backed Ali over his comments following a rapid apology from the Rochdale candidate, with one shadow minister saying Ali had “fallen for an online conspiracy theory which does not represent his view”. But the Labour leader reversed that decision on Monday night after further details emerged from the meeting showing Ali had also blamed “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” for the suspension of the Labour MP Andy McDonald. While electoral rules mean Ali is technically still the Labour candidate for the Rochdale byelection later this month, the party is no longer giving him its support, meaning Labour officials and MPs will not travel to the constituency to help him. Starmer’s supporters say there was no way the Labour leader could have known about remarks made at a private meeting long before the Rochdale byelection was called – though many are now concerned about the prospect that George Galloway, the controversial former Labour MP, will win instead. One Labour activist said: “My guess is Galloway wins unless Labour wants to be really brave and say vote for the Tory. It’s the worst outcome.” Bookmakers have now made Galloway the favourite to take the seat. Some have accused Starmer of fuelling factionalism within the party by acting more slowly against Ali than he has against party members on the left who have been punished for less extreme breaches over Israel. Jamie Driscoll, the mayor of the North of Tyne, who was blocked from running again as a Labour mayoral candidate after appearing onstage with the pro-Palestinian film-maker Ken Loach – months before the Hamas attacks – said: “This all shows if you are on Team Keir you can behave how you like.” However, others say Starmer’s actions have been fuelled not by factionalism but by his slow decision-making process and a failure of political instinct. One Jewish Labour MP said: “In retrospect it would have been the right thing to take a bold decision on Saturday.” A senior party adviser said: “I don’t know why we ever thought we would be able to get away with claiming that one of our candidates had ‘fallen for’ a conspiracy theory he didn’t believe in.” Some in the party are comparing the row of the last few days with the long-running saga over Labour’s plans to spend £28bn on green investment, which Starmer publicly dropped last week after weeks of reports saying he had already decided to do so. Sue Gray, Starmer’s chief of staff, is conducting an inquiry into the source of those reports. But the inquiry itself is threatening to further exacerbate tensions within the party, with some staff members having filed a complaint about Gray’s behaviour.",Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; Israel-Gaza war; Antisemitism; Byelections; North of England; Lancashire; UK news; England,Politics
2023-06-12T16:51:47Z,How Labour could keep its £28bn-a-year green promise | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/12/how-labour-could-keep-its-28bn-a-year-green-promise,"Your editorial (9 June) is correct to call Rachel Reeves’ retreat from her £28bn annual commitment on green investment an example of the renewal of a failed economic consensus. This has seen Labour aping Jeremy Hunt’s ludicrous emphasis on reducing the national debt. Instead, Labour must become leader of a pack of opposition parties all demanding a massive increase in expenditure on social and green infrastructure, and on the wages and conditions of those working in these areas. One recent estimate suggests that to achieve this, the next government will need to invest £220bn per year. All opposition parties should promise the next parliament will use its powers to provide the money needed to fix broken Britain. This can come from three sources. First, the estimated £55bn a year of tax breaks for pension savers must be redesigned to support employment-creating investment with social and environmental goals, as should some of the £70bn a year saved tax-free in Isas – a much-needed exercise in intergenerational solidarity. Second, increased revenue from a fairer taxation system, where the wealthier contribute far more. Finally, as a backstop for any funding shortfalls, quantitative easing should be restarted. What Labour and indeed all the opposition parties have got to grasp is that you can’t have the necessary equivalent of Roosevelt’s New Deal without a massive increase in new debt. The £28bn is a mere down payment. Colin Hines Convener, UK Green New Deal Group • Rachel Reeves would have more fiscal headroom for increased green investment if she introduced an overseas tax liability for British citizens, avoiding vast amounts of tax, including on offshore-owned British assets. This could be similar to the US Internal Revenue Service requirements for Americans and resident aliens living abroad. They are expected to pay taxes according to the Internal Revenue Code, which includes tax credits for paying foreign taxes where you are living, deductions and exclusions. We cannot afford to repeat the 1997 Labour government’s mistake of sticking to fictional Tory spending plans, rather than bringing our economy gradually towards sustainable German levels of taxation, and this time really invest in decent public services. David Nowell London • Your report (9 June) on Labour’s plan to delay the £28bn-a-year spend on addressing the climate crisis until halfway through a first parliament makes no mention of the associated risks. These were cogently described by Rachel Reeves in 2021, when she told Labour’s conference that if the government did not invest now then the costs of climate change would be greater. Under Labour, there would “no dither, no delay” in tackling the crisis. At the time, Labour referred to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s 2021 fiscal risks report, which said “delaying decisive action to tackle carbon emissions by ten years could double the overall cost”. For example, on costs associated with delayed investment until 2030 compared with immediate action, the report estimated that “debt in 2050-51 is 23 per cent of GDP higher than in the early action scenario”. Labour may have decided that its political interests outweigh the risks of passing problems on to our children and grandchildren. But that is a political judgment. There should at least be transparency and honesty about the real risks associated with this choice. Mike Sheaff Plymouth • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2023-11-09T15:24:06Z,National Grid increases investment plan but warns of clean energy logjam,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/09/national-grid-steps-up-clean-energy-plans-amid-35bn-record-spend,"National Grid has increased its investment plans to £42bn by 2026 as the backlog of clean energy projects waiting to connect to the UK’s power networks continues to grow. The FTSE 100 monopoly, charged with running most of the UK’s power grids and some networks in the US, spent a record £3.5bn in the first half of the financial year as a result of the momentum of green policies on both sides of the Atlantic. It also set out new plans to invest a total of £42bn in the UK and US in its five-year spending framework running up until the 2025 to 2026 financial year - £2bn more than it had planned in May. However, the company’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, warned that “fundamental reform” of the UK’s electricity network planning was still required to help tackle the growing logjam of clean energy projects waiting for a grid connection. The UK plans to run its grid entirely on clean electricity by 2035 but many renewable energy projects have been told they face a 10- to 15-year wait for a connection before they can begin providing the network with clean power. Pettigrew told the Guardian that the queue of power projects grew by 50 gigawatts in the last quarter to around 400GW in total, well above the UK’s existing power capacity of around 65GW. Many of these projects are understood to be speculative applications that are unlikely to move forward. National Grid has undertaken a string of new reforms to ease the green energy gridlock, which has raised concerns over the future of billions of pounds of green investment and could derail the UK’s progress towards its climate targets. It offered energy developers an “amnesty deal” earlier this year to urge developers to get on with their projects or get out of the queue for a grid connection with no financial penalty. Pettigrew said this had shaved 5GW from the backlog. The company has also retained a legal firm to help move aside delayed developments to make way for viable projects and is working with the regulator to tweak existing rules that developers can build their own grid connections which could take another 40GW from the backlog. Pettigrew said the UK needed “fundamental reform” to create a connections regime “which is fit for purpose”. He said the UK could tackle the problem of “zombie projects” by moving away from a first-come, first-served queue system and putting in place higher standards that projects must meet before developers can make a grid connection application. National Grid outlined its record investments alongside its financial results for the six months to the end of September, which revealed a profit of £1.4bn, down from £1.7bn in the same period last year. The company has stepped up investment in 17 major onshore and offshore transmission projects in the UK that were fast-tracked by the energy regulator, Ofgem, earlier this year. In the US, the company said it was working on “a number of major transmission projects to unlock renewable generation”. Pettigrew said: “We’re ready to meet the opportunities, and are set up to tackle the challenges ahead, to deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy future for all.”",National Grid; Energy industry; Utilities; Business; UK news; Energy; US news; Environment,Business
2024-02-27T13:01:01Z,Why does Labour need to suck up to the City? Britain’s economy is stifled by too much finance | Nicholas Shaxson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/27/labour-city-britain-economy-finance-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves,"Before the 1992 general election, Labour leaders facing a tight race embarked on a self-abasing tour of the City of London, mocked as the prawn cocktail offensive. “Lunch after lunch, dinner after dinner, the assurances flow,” trolled Michael Heseltine. “All those prawn cocktails for nothing. Never have so many crustaceans died in vain.” He was right: the Conservatives won a fourth consecutive victory. Five years later, Tony Blair’s New Labour genuflected deeply to the UK financial sector and was elected, but its “light-touch” regulatory approach helped trigger the biggest global financial crisis in nearly a century. We still feel the aftershocks in the form of economic stagnation, inequality and pent-up rage. John McDonnell, then shadow chancellor, tried a “tea offensive” in 2018 to listen to City leaders’ concerns, but, alongside Jeremy Corbyn’s promise to “take on the power of finance”, it got nowhere. Now, once again, Labour, under Keir Starmer, is bending the knee. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, promises to “unashamedly champion” the City. Labour’s “plan for financial services”, unveiled last month, is heavily influenced by City grandees. It contains plenty that is sensible, including a push for “inclusive growth” and a promise there is “no going back” to the disastrous deregulation of the past – but it is still something of a love letter to the City. Labour is refusing to reinstate a cap on banker bonuses that Liz Truss had unwisely removed. It is ruling out a windfall tax on bank profits, and promising to cut the “regulatory burden”. It is watering down its £28bn green investment plan, in a City-pleasing display of “fiscal rectitude”. Ominously, Labour also embraces “competitiveness” for UK finance. This C-word sounds great – who wants to be uncompetitive? – but unpack it and a vast can of worms opens, as 58 leading international economists explained in a powerful letter in 2022, urging Rishi Sunak not to force a “competitiveness” mandate on to financial regulators. One problem is that “competitiveness”, in City-speak, means transferring wealth from other parts of the UK economy to the financial sector, to help “our” poor financiers compete globally. Finance, predominantly located in London, competes against other parts of the UK economy: not least via a “brain drain”, sucking talent out of manufacturing and services into high-paying City firms. It also captures policymaking, bending it from supporting non-financial businesses or the broad public interest towards narrow City profits. We do need a financial sector – but only up to a point. Some international studies suggest that once credit to the private sector by banks and shadow banks hits 80-100% of GDP (the UK is running closer to 145-165%), then further expansion weakens GDP growth. It’s called a “finance curse”, which in some ways resembles the “resource curse” afflicting commodity-rich nations in the global south. It’s not just about size, of course: it’s what kind of finance. Today, businesses from food delivery to funeral homes to dentists to music are increasingly financialised, whereby financial investors use powerful financial tools, tricks and levers to suck money out, often leaving fragile “hollow firms” in their wake. For example, a private-equity firm may buy a company owning care homes, load it with debt – then use a “dividend recap” to snaffle the proceeds of that borrowing for itself, then put the company through the wringer to repay those debts: forcing care workers to work punishing hours, stiffing its suppliers or running its finances through tax havens to dodge tax. Finance is also the handmaiden of rising monopolisation, whether it’s investment bankers pushing and facilitating mega-mergers and acquisitions; or banks throwing cheap capital at profitable monopolists while starving their smaller, weaker and riskier competitors. Meanwhile, private-equity firms “roll up” obscure economic niches, such as buying all three vet practices in a medium-sized town, then jacking up prices and cutting wages once pet owners and skilled staff have few other options. City lobbyists tell us that UK finance is the engine of our economy, showering jobs and tax revenues on happy citizens. Labour is toeing this line, saying its goal to secure the highest growth among G7 countries can only happen “if we champion the UK’s role as a global leader in financial services”, with finance as our “engine of growth”. But this “engine” story is City propaganda. It describes (and overstates) the gross benefits of the City to the UK – the banks’ tax payments and so on – but airbrushes out the costs and the hidden flows in the other direction, away from children’s care homes, from vet practices, or from homeowners, and into the pockets of financial investors based in rich parts of London, overseas and offshore. Praising these gross contributions, as if this is the end of the story, is like letting someone swipe your wallet then thanking them for handing half your money back. What should matter to our elected leaders is the City’s net contribution to the economy, taking into account the damage. There’s no way to measure this precisely, but a Sheffield University study estimated that “excess” finance cost the UK economy a cumulative £4.5tn between 1995 and 2015. Is it any surprise that Britain, with its bloated and distorted financial sector, has been such a laggard among OECD economies on investment, productivity and growth? Starmer himself has warned that Poland’s economy is on course to overtake ours within a decade. Unlike in previous elections, Labour doesn’t need to bend the knee: it is set for a crushing victory over a comically unpopular Conservative party. If Starmer and Reeves stay this course, telling finance exactly what it wants to hear, the ensuing economic malaise will create openings that dangerous political forces will be only too happy to fill.

2024-02-10T19:09:33Z,"We’ve given up the fight, say top Tories as byelection defeats loom",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/10/tories-conservative-byelection-defeats-sunak-leadership-death-spiral,"Conservative MPs on Saturday night predicted fresh attacks on Rishi Sunak’s leadership within days, as they accused their own party of surrendering to Labour without a proper fight in two formerly safe Tory seats where byelections will be held this week. MPs from across the party complained that losses in Wellingborough and Kingswood on Thursday had already been “priced in”, as one senior figure said defeatism had set in, with the party having descended into a “death spiral”. Ministers and MPs said they had not faced any of the normal demands to go to the two seats this weekend to drum up last-minute votes as is customary before byelections. One Sunak ally said the contests had been deliberately timed in the parliamentary recess to reduce the chances of anti-Sunak “chatter and plotting” at Westminster if the Tories lost. But senior MPs said not properly contesting the seats risked demoralising an already deflated party during the run-in to a general election, and at a time when Labour was vulnerable after performing a massive U-turn last week over its green economic plans. “The party hasn’t really tried,” said a former cabinet minister. “They’re expecting defeats. [It’s] rather demoralising.” Another influential figure said of the byelections: “They are very much priced into the death spiral.” In Wellingborough, the Tories are defending a majority of more than 18,000 while in Kingswood, its majority was in excess of 11,000 at the 2019 election. With Tory morale low, Sunak used an interview this weekend to champion tax cuts, while also insisting that he was “up for the fight” despite Labour’s stubbornly large poll lead. He also argued his plans for the economy were working, saying it was “pointing in the right direction” and that the “future is going to be better”. But economists say they expect data on whether the economy has gone through two successive quarters of negative growth – the definition of a recession – to be on a knife-edge when it is released this week. A senior MP added that there had been no indication the party believed it could retain the two seats: “A number of people have commented that normally you are inundated with messages from the whips’ office requesting – and in some cases requiring – that you go to each byelection on at least three occasions. That hasn’t happened in either seat, which is quite incredible. “It’s going to be a difficult week. You’ve got the potential of the country going into recession and you’ve got the potential of inflation going up. Trouble is brewing for Rishi, I’m afraid.” Labour, meanwhile, was trying to play down suggestions that it will win easily in both byelections, as it sought to maximise turnout. Chris Bryant, the Labour frontbencher who is the “political lead” in Kingswood, said: “Everybody is assuming that, just because we have won a few byelections recently, that we are going to win here. A lot of people are undecided. We have to fight for every vote, door by door.” Tory strategists say that instead of pouring resources into the byelections, they are prioritising the party’s general election campaign. Rightwing Conservatives are increasingly focusing their hopes on chancellor Jeremy Hunt cutting tax in the budget, with their focus being inheritance tax. The party is also trying to coordinate attacks on Labour’s economic policies. However, a report on Labour’s windfall tax on oil and gas companies, published on Saturday, appeared to admit it referred to a policy that Labour no longer held. “This policy costing was completed and signed off on 22 January 2024,” it states. “Since then further announcements have been made by the Labour party, which would impact the costs of this policy.” Labour said the Tories had “costed somebody’s policy, but it is not Labour’s”. The news comes amid initial signs that Labour’s huge U-turn on spending £28bn a year on green investment has not dented the party’s poll lead. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that Labour’s lead stands at 18 points – up 2 points from a fortnight ago. Keir Starmer now has an 11-point lead with regard to who voters think would make the best prime minister. The Tory campaign has been hamstrung in Wellingborough, where the local party insisted on selecting the partner of ousted Tory MP Peter Bone, who was removed after a watchdog found he had bullied a staff member and exposed his genitals to them, which Bone denies. “It has not gone well,” said one senior Tory. “MPs would rather that we had more resources to put into their seats that they have to defend at the general election.” In Kingswood, South Gloucestershire, where Conservative MP Chris Skidmore resigned over Sunak’s plan for a new law that “promotes the production of new oil and gas”, Labour is also the strong favourite in the seat. Over the past week Tory MPs were left frustrated by a series of errors by Sunak. Some complained of the prime minister’s decision to deride Starmer in the House of Commons over Labour’s position on transgender people while the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery. Others despaired of a party political broadcast in which Sunak used a whiteboard to explain his plans for the country. One departing MP said the week had been “very bleak”.",Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Byelections; Politics; UK news; Labour; Keir Starmer; Local politics,Politics
2024-01-22T10:22:50Z,"UK needs ambitious green plan to keep up with allies, says Labour frontbencher",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/21/uk-needs-ambitious-green-plan-keep-up-allies-labour-frontbencher,"Britain needs its own ambitious green investment plan to keep up with its allies, a Labour frontbencher has said, amid an increasingly bitter row over whether Keir Starmer should stick to his £28bn pledge. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said the UK should come up with a version of Joe Biden’s $369bn (£290bn) Inflation Reduction Act, which has provided support to a range of technologies including electric cars and renewable power. Speaking from Davos, Reynolds warned that the UK risked losing business to the US if it did not commit to a significant plan of its own, even as some around the Labour leader said it would risk damaging the party in the polls. As Labour officials race to finalise the main manifesto commitments in time for its 8 February deadline, the fate of its green prosperity plan remains one of the main unanswered questions. Reynolds’s comments will bolster the arguments of those who have urged Starmer not to drop it in the face of a sustained Conservative attack. Reynolds said Biden’s act was “probably the most significant disruption to investment capital markets in 40 years – a greater impact than the pandemic and the global financial crisis … we’ve got to respond to that. We’ve got to increase our competitiveness, we’ve got to understand there’s a huge offer there from the US.” Labour officials will meet this week to discuss the £28bn promise, and further meetings are planned between shadow ministers in the coming weeks. Some in the shadow cabinet believe the policy, launched in 2021, should be ditched given that the UK faces much higher borrowing rates and Labour is desperate to avoid making unfunded spending commitments. However, others say the policy is the party’s main economic and environmental offer to voters and that dropping it will only intensify accusations that Starmer cannot be trusted to keep his promises. Like Reynolds, they make the point that the UK could lose business to the US if it fails to come up with its own version of the US act. “What’s so significant about the Inflation Reduction Act is, they have recognised that if you just do it in the cheapest way … that’s going to be Chinese,” he said. “This [the act] has been a huge disruptor, sucking away from Europe a whole range of exciting companies and technologies.” Reynolds said the precise sum mattered less than what it was being spent on. “We’ve the same view as Rachel [Reeves] and the [shadow] Treasury on this,” he added. His words echo the recommendations of a group of leading economists, who said in a paper on Monday that Britain should invest £26bn a year in the low-carbon economy rather than using the money for tax cuts. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said over the weekend the party was sticking to the policy, after a report in the Sun that it would be dropped. But he added it would not spend the full £28bn if economic circumstances did not allow it. Matt Wrack, the head of the Fire Brigades Union, told the Guardian the public would be at risk if a Labour government did not follow through on its investment promises, given the increasing number of floods and wildfires to which his members are having to respond. “If Labour doesn’t spend this money, it will put our members at risk. But it will also put communities at risk, especially in areas which are at risk of wildfires or major floods,” he said. “It will increase the strain on the fire service and the risk to firefighters.” Among those making the decision over the party’s green policies are two shadow cabinet ministers whom Starmer has asked to “bomb-proof” the manifesto so that it does not fall apart in an election campaign. The Labour leader has asked Jonathan Ashworth to see how the proposals will withstand media and opposition attacks, and Lucy Powell to check whether they will be able to form coherent legislation. Their roles mirror that played by David Miliband for Tony Blair before the 1997 election, when the young policy chief was tasked with making sure that the party had not made any promises that it could not defend from opposition criticism. If Powell and Ashworth sign off individual policies, they will be checked by Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, to see if they have been costed, before getting the final signoff from Starmer. Ravinder Athwal, the Labour leader’s policy director, is in charge of writing the manifesto. Shadow cabinet ministers have been told to have their headline policy proposals ready by 8 February, even if finer details need to be ironed out at a later date. As policy officials continue to wrangle over the fate of the £28bn green plan, Reynolds said the party remained committed to “a degree of public investment and bringing in private investment”. But he also warned against making short-term decisions that could have negative long-term consequences. “Growing up in the north-east in the 1980s, I know what getting a transition wrong looks like. This is about getting it right,” he said.",Labour; Green politics; Keir Starmer; Green economy; Climate crisis; Environment; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-05-01T18:20:05Z,Labour’s ‘new deal for workers’ will not fully ban zero-hours contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/may/01/labours-new-deal-for-workers-will-not-fully-ban-zero-hours-contracts,"Labour is facing criticism over plans for a loophole that would allow employees to work under zero-hours contracts, despite the party having pledged to ban them entirely. Keir Starmer’s party is preparing to announce details of its promise to overhaul workers’ rights if it gets into power – a centrepiece of its early plans for government, but subject to fierce lobbying from businesses. Labour has repeatedly promised to ban zero-hours contracts, under which an employer is not obliged to provide any minimum number of working hours. But as part of its revised plans, although employers would be required to offer a contract based on regular hours worked, workers could opt to stay on zero hours. The move has triggered fears of a power imbalance that employers could exploit to pressure workers into accepting insecurity around pay and working hours. The IWGB union, which represents gig economy workers, said they feared anything less than an outright ban on the practice would leave scope for exploitation. “Workers are often forced to accept poor conditions and precarious contracts across sectors due to desperation and extreme power imbalances between employers and employees in the UK,” the union’s general secretary, Henry Chango Lopez, said. “This power imbalance would persist under these new proposals.” Labour’s “new deal for working people” was first announced by Starmer’s deputy, Angela Rayner. But Starmer and his chief of staff, Sue Gray, have come under pressure internally to drop the commitment to begin legislating for it within 100 days – including from some senior party figures – in order to give more time to consult on the different and complex definitions of employment status. The Unite union said Labour should “explicitly recommit to what they have already pledged”, including legislating within 100 days of power. A Labour spokesperson said: “We see this as a central plank of the election campaign and what we hope to do when we get into government. The updates to the green paper [published in 2022] have been agreed by the National Policy Forum. That is what we will be sticking with and implementing in government. “If you choose to carry on with a zero-hours contract, you can do so. It is a right [employees will have] to have that contract, and it would not be able to be abused … The law will set out the minimum standards that are expected and that will be enforced in the way all employment law is enforced.” Other trade unions, and the TUC, are prepared to embrace the current iteration of the new deal, which Starmer has promised will not be “watered down”. But officials said they would not tolerate any further weakening of the proposals, which some business groups have been lobbying for. The TUC’s Paul Nowak said the new deal was urgently needed, adding: “We expect Labour to deliver it with an employment bill in the first 100 days.” Unison, the UK’s biggest trade union, said it was only “exploitative bosses that have anything to fear” from the changes. “Consolidating the promised measures is fine, but any watering-down of the contents won’t be,” a spokesperson said. Labour is understood to be finalising a dossier for the implementation of the new deal, combining the original proposals in the green paper and the changes that were agreed at the National Policy Forum (NPF), including on zero hours. Affiliated trade unions have signed off the proposals, apart from Unite, which abstained at the NPF vote. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “If Labour do not explicitly recommit to what they have already pledged, namely that the new deal for workers will be delivered in full within the first 100 days of office, then a red line will be crossed. “Labour’s vow to deliver a straightforward right of access for trade unions, and a much-simplified route to recognition and therefore the right to negotiate, is the litmus test for Unite. It’s a political non-negotiable.” Labour sources defended the changes and said “zero hours” had been difficult to define in law. “This is about how you implement the headline commitment to tackle these exploitative practices so that it works in practice and guards against loopholes,” one official said. Another party source said they recognised there could be “risks” involving unscrupulous employers, but said the legislation would also tackle that concern by creating a new single enforcement body which would mean these would not just be “paper rights”. The party is also planning to do further consulting on the legislation that will be required for its most ambitious plan, to create a “single status” of worker. Under the current proposals, the need to serve a qualifying period before gaining basic rights such as sick pay, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal would no longer apply. However, Labour is expected to clarify that probationary periods for performance will still apply, even where workers are given day-one rights to sick pay and parental leave. The party will also acknowledge that seasonal workers will be a “different category” when it comes to the reforms. The party has held a flurry of meetings with business groups over the proposals, but the clarifications could revive criticism from the left that the party is watering down some of its more radical policies, months after it dropped its promise to spend £28bn a year on green investment. However, other trade union officials said they believed the party had seen off some of the more aggressive attempts by some business groups to weaken the proposals. “We do see this as a delivering an effective ban [on zero hours],” one official said. Starmer told delegates at the Usdaw trade union’s conference on Tuesday that he was not weakening any of his proposals. “We will embark on the biggest levelling up of worker rights this country has seen for a generation,” he told the conference. “That’s what our new deal for working people will achieve.” Asked if the plans were being watered down, he said “no” and added: “We’ve got the draft legislation, it’s ready to go, and I look forward to that moment when Angela Rayner stands at the dispatch box to introduce the legislation on the new deal that this movement so desperately needed and fought for for so many years.” Both Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been subject to intensive lobbying efforts from business groups, including the CBI, on some of the policies. The former New Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson is among those who had been urging a rethink of many of the proposals, telling a dinner last year that the party should not abandon flexibility in the labour market at a time of technological change. The details come after a series of meetings between senior Labour figures and the “B5” panel of business trade groups – the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, Make UK, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the Institute of Directors – as part of the party’s preparations for government. One senior source from one of the employers’ groups said: “We’re not trying to change the grain of what they want to do. We’re just trying to say, if you do this, let’s work through the consequences together so you go in collectively eyes open.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; Zero-hours contracts; Trade unions; Politics; UK news,Politics
2024-02-18T06:00:38Z,Sunak is warned spending squeeze could lead to Conservative party wipeout at election,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/18/sunak-is-warned-spending-squeeze-could-lead-to-conservative-party-wipeout-at-election,"Rishi Sunak is being warned he risks taking his party further towards disaster by sanctioning a new public spending squeeze in a desperate pursuit of pre-election tax cuts, as more Tories said they feared an election wipeout. With more infighting erupting this weekend after two huge byelection losses in former safe seats, Treasury officials are examining cuts to public spending should they be needed to fund tax cuts, demanded most vociferously by the right of the party. However, with new polling seen by the Observer showing little public appetite for raising money through further spending reductions, senior Tories warned that it risked taking the party further away from the concerns of key voters turning to Labour. John Gummer, the former Tory chairman, now Lord Deben, said the party risked alienating the critical group. “We have to look at the things that the public are really concerned about – they are concerned, for example, about the need for more nurses,” he said. “They’re concerned about radical reform of the health service. “The priority for most people at the moment is to improve public services to make sure that those who are least well off are looked after and to make it more attractive to work. Conservatives are not dogmatists. And the people who call themselves Conservative sometimes are not at all. The majority of Conservative MPs – and majority of Conservative voters – want a moderate, sensible, progressive party.” It comes with Tory moderates claiming that Sunak must not turn the party into “Reform UK-lite” in response to the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections last week. Reform UK, formerly the Brexit party, came third in both seats, prompting demands from the Tory right for firmer action on tax and immigration. Writing in the Observer, former cabinet minister Justine Greening said concerns that the party could face annihilation should it veer further to the right were valid. “Those who warn that the party faces an ‘extinction event’ at the forthcoming election are right,” she writes. “It’s because, time and time again, the party has consistently chosen to play up to the negative, simplistic, culture wars-driven rhetoric of Ukip and latterly, Reform UK. “The Conservative party has been heading down a political cul-de-sac for some time. It might have felt like moving forwards, but the reality was different for voters. Now the party is hitting the end of the road. It will be a long way back, but the journey needs to start now.” With the mood darkening on the Tory benches, one former cabinet minister said they increasingly feared a 1997 Labour landslide. “The slogan then was ‘Britain is booming. Don’t let Labour ruin it.’ It didn’t change a thing.” A loyal former minister said: “It’s going to be severe.” The budget next month is seen as one of the last chances for the Tories to seize the momentum from Labour. With chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s headroom for tax cuts becoming tighter, his officials are searching for spending cuts in the next parliament that could be deployed to fund a further giveaway if necessary. However, asked how they would like a chancellor to raise money after the election, only one in 10 voters back public spending cuts. Only 17% of those who voted Conservative in 2019 opted for spending cuts. Overall, 41% of voters preferred increasing taxes on business, according to a YouGov poll for the WPI Strategy consultancy. Meanwhile, an Opinium poll for the Observer found Labour has a 15-point lead, down from 18 points last week. A fierce internal Tory battle has intensified after last week’s byelections. John Hayes, a senior MP on the right, said time was running out for his party to close down the threat from Reform and deliver a “more Conservative” government. “We have the opportunity in the budget to show them we’re on the side of hard-working, law-abiding people – and we’re not going to continue to fund unrestricted welfare payments: we’re going to invest in British manufacturers and British businesses,” he said. “That means backing the high streets, backing British manufacturers, backing British food producers. It needs to be a patriot’s budget.” However, Damian Green, chair of the One Nation caucus of liberal Tories, said: “Anyone who thinks you can simply add the Reform party’s votes to Tory votes by adopting some of their policies is living in a fantasy world.” Nick Faith, the director of WPI Strategy, said Hunt would “go down in flames” if he opted to fund tax cuts with lower public spending. “Reducing funding into hospitals, schools and other local services would be the most unpopular thing the chancellor could do,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that targeted tax cuts are an impossibility. But they need to fall within the existing headroom set out by the Office for Budgetary Responsibility. Paying for a reduction in something like inheritance tax via reductions in public spending would literally be the definition of crazy.” While it has been a bruising week for Sunak, his team does not believe the byelection losses have revealed anything new about the challenge they face. They have also been encouraged by the difficulties Labour faced after ditching its plan to spend £28bn a year on green investment and having to abandon byelection candidate Azhar Ali after he repeated a conspiracy theory about Israel. “When we put Labour under sustained pressure, there are cracks that we can exploit – people have been reassured,” said one senior Tory source. “Back before 2015, we were losing byelections, including to Ukip. But the mission for us is building an offer at the election that we think people will back as a choice over Labour. We face a massive challenge, but we’re not despondent.”",Conservatives; Politics; Rishi Sunak; UK news; Labour; Jeremy Hunt; Tax and spending,Politics
2024-02-16T11:00:43Z,"If the government really cared about keeping Britain safe, it would care about Port Talbot and steel | Sharon Graham",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/16/britain-safe-port-talbot-steel-supplies-net-zero-tata,"After months of rumour, the giant Indian conglomerate Tata has announced a plan for 2,800 job cuts at the UK’s largest remaining steelworks in Port Talbot, the closure of its blast furnaces and, with it, a large chunk of the UK’s capacity to produce its own crude steel. The country risks making the same economic mistakes as it did in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher’s government allowed much of our critical industrial capacity to be privatised or offshored – but now we know far more about the environmental risks, too. With the future of mass steel production in Britain and our commitment to net zero at stake, it really is time to make some tough choices. Do we continue, out of step with much of the global north, surrendering meekly to the ransom notes delivered by the market? Do we give a group such as Tata an effective veto on the survival of an industry that underpins 26.6% of our GDP? Or do we choose another path – one of industrial renewal, and with it, a new framework for our security and self-sufficiency? In a globalised economy, security is not just a matter of arms and diplomacy, but one of supply chains and pinch points. To keep a country safe, its leaders need to think seriously, not only about securing imports but about the resilience and capacity of domestic production. If this capacity is lost, a trade dispute or international crisis (such as Covid-19) could render us unable to meet demand for vital defence or aerospace applications. Instead, we are seeing a familiar story play out: Tata threatens to quit, a panicked government writes a cheque and we’re asked to swallow more job losses. Under the current proposal, the government is offering £500m to boost the value of the company’s assets, without anything in return: no guarantees on jobs, and no public stake whatsoever. Inevitably, some on the right have quickly seized on the opportunity to portray the news as Port Talbot being “sacrificed to the altar of net zero”. It’s a lie. Across Europe, other major steelworks are decarbonising, including Tata’s major IJmuiden plant in the Netherlands. But only Port Talbot is doing so with no phased transition and a 40% loss of capacity. This is how, cut after cut, we’ve reached a position where the UK produces just one sixth as much steel as Germany, with 60% of domestic demand met by imports. And common sense tells us that we shouldn’t rely on any multinational conglomerate to deliver long-term investment in foundation industries. This is about basic private interests. If they can make bigger profits importing steel from India or the Netherlands, they will. That’s the law of the market. It’s time for politicians to act. We need an active industrial strategy that includes two main elements to secure a just transition to net zero, for the UK’s future and the world’s. First, serious investment to decarbonise and rebuild the Port Talbot plant, which has been run down by decades of underinvestment. Unite’s calculation is that an investment of £3.5bn over eight years is needed. Second, and equally importantly, action to tackle the main source of losses: electricity costs for UK steel producers that are 85% higher than our main European competitors. Fortunately, Unite’s campaign to stop this act of industrial vandalism is winning results. Tata has now said it is open to investing in an additional direct reduced iron (DRI) facility at Port Talbot. The Labour party, despite needlessly ditching its commitment to serious green investment, has ringfenced £3bn in the next parliament for a green steel fund. It has also told Tata not to make any “irreversible decisions” before the general election. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told Radio 4 recently that Britain’s steel industry would be “protected and preserved” under Labour. So, there are causes for hope. But only determined action can break the spiral of decline. Demand for low-carbon steel is expected to grow. We should be rebuilding domestic production, not continuing to offshore it. And we should be investing in green industrial zones: circular economies linking steel with new renewable energy and manufacturing plants. This vision – a workers’ plan for steel – would not just safeguard existing jobs, but create new, well-paid, unionised jobs to support thriving communities. These ideas are basic compared with other countries’ plans. Take the Netherlands, where Tata intends to deliver a phased transition at its IJmuiden site – replacing traditional furnaces with DRI as well as electric arc furnace capacity. No immediate shutdown like Port Talbot, but a transition that runs to 2035. Take Germany, where the government has committed €2bn (£1.7bn) for the first phase of Thyssenkrupp’s green steel plant at Duisburg, plus a further €1bn (£855m) to Salzgitter, Germany’s second-largest steelmaker, to decarbonise its steel production. Again, both these plans keep blast furnaces open in a gradual transition until they are replaced by DRI alternatives. And while Tata’s plan for Port Talbot devastates the site, at Duisburg, decarbonisation goes together with a boost to production. Germany is also proposing an 80% subsidy of its industrial energy prices, which are already significantly lower than here. So, this is the picture. The US and major European countries such as Germany, France and the Netherlands invest in the future of their critical industries. In the UK, stuck in the trap of free market ideology, we watch the last of our infrastructure crumble and with it, our industrial security and self-sufficiency. But what is clear is this. It does not have to be this way. There are other choices available. We just have to have the courage to make them.

2024-03-01T10:47:40Z,"After George Galloway’s triumph in Rochdale, urgent questions loom for Keir Starmer – and the left, too | Owen Jones",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/01/george-galloway-rochdale-keir-starmer-left-labour-muslim,"When Keir Starmer’s political project comes crashing down, as one day it will, George Galloway’s Rochdale triumph should be remembered as a portent. For hardcore Starmerites, this assertion is easily dismissed. Courtesy of the Tories’ comprehensive self-immolation, Labour is heading for a crushing landslide victory. With an average 19-point lead – an undeniably stunning turnaround from the party’s 2019 rout – there is no sign of the usual polling swingback a government enjoys in election year. Rishi Sunak is an inept prime minister leading an intellectually exhausted government, devoid of any ideas except doubling down on the same policies that left Britain with an unprecedented squeeze in living standards, stagnant growth and a shrivelled public realm. When Starmer becomes prime minister in November, as he almost certainly will, he is unlikely to be worrying much about Rochdale, which may well return to the Labour fold in a general election anyway. Well, such complacency may prove a mistake. The Labour candidate was, of course, belatedly disowned by the national leadership after claiming that Israel deliberately allowed the 7 October atrocities to happen, and deploying a crude antisemitic trope about the influence of “certain Jewish quarters” in the media. Labour – which has today apologised to the people of Rochdale for failing to offer a viable Labour candidate – will easily dismiss the candidate’s derisory vote, and yet overall turnout – nearly 40% – was actually higher for than the last three byelections. This means that, despite some demoralised voters staying at home in a farcical election, Galloway won far more votes than the Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat candidates combined: that is, he clearly enjoyed an enthused turnout, many rallied by the message summed up at his victory speech: “Keir Starmer, this is for Gaza.” Labour says Galloway won because there was no Labour candidate. That is highly debatable. This is all despite the fact that Galloway – despite being a compelling orator and a formidable campaigner – is, to say the least, a controversial figure, bitterly rejected by most of the left (myself included) on account of, say, voting Conservative in Scotland, appalling comments about rape, sidling up to Nigel Farage in the Brexit referendum campaign, and issuing statements such as: “As a father of six children, I’m socially conservative. I don’t want my children taught the kind of things Labour wants to teach them in schools.” Undoubtedly, many who plumped for him are Muslim – understandably more aggrieved than the average Briton about Israel’s slaughter of mostly Muslim Palestinians. But Rochdale has a significantly smaller Muslim population than other seats Galloway has successfully contested, and he won wider support, too. That he specifically sought support from Muslim voters has been portrayed as somehow tawdry: this itself is testament to how mainstream Islamophobia is in Britain, as though seeking to address specific concerns of Muslim voters were not legitimate. The truth is that Muslim voters are an important and growing plank of Labour’s electoral coalition, but the party treats them with contempt – as voting fodder who are otherwise an embarrassment to it. Consider the case of the former Labour minister Phil Woolas, who in 2010 had his victory in Oldham – 6 miles from Rochdale – overturned by a court when he was found to have stoked religious tensions to win by distributing a deeply Islamophobic leaflet. Some parliamentary colleagues leapt to his defence. In the brutal Batley and Spen byelection in 2021 – in which Labour defeated Galloway – party sources reportedly briefed that antisemitism among Muslim voters was losing Labour support, and boasted that they’d won Tory voters at the expense of the “conservative Muslim vote over gay rights and Palestine”. According to a survey of Muslim Labour members in 2022, 46% felt Starmer had handled Islamophobia “very badly”, with a further 18% opting for “quite badly”. When predominantly Muslim councillors resigned in disgust at Gaza, a party source reportedly bragged they were “shaking off the fleas”. But it’s not just about Muslim voters, important though that is. It was Iraq that toxified Tony Blair among swathes of Labour’s natural electoral coalition. That was after he had been prime minister for many years. For Starmer, this has happened in opposition: 52% of voters think Starmer is doing badly as Labour leader, with just 33% saying he is doing well: remarkable for a man almost inevitably destined for No 10. Why? Because Starmer deceitfully abandoned his solemn promises – “pledges”, he called them – in his leadership campaign, such as taxing the rich, public ownership of utilities, scrapping tuition fees and much else. He failed to then develop an alternative vision, even going so far as to trash his more recent flagship £28bn green investment fund. He has promised to keep Tory policies that drive children into poverty, while refusing to reintroduce the bankers’ bonus cap, and has locked the party into keeping arbitrary fiscal rules that spell continuing austerity. In comments on Gaza, Starmer said that Israel had a right to cut off water and energy; he later said that he did not believe that. He has presided over mass resignations and sackings of opponents, and he sabotaged an SNP motion condemning Israel for collective punishment. Labour’s support is soft and superficial, driven almost entirely by revulsion at the Tories’ calamitous spell in office. We can see in Germany and the US how similar political projects came to power with the promise of offering stability, but both countries face acute political crises. And so the left – hounded by the Labour leadership as it is – needs to make tough decisions. Does it wait for either the likes of Galloway or the far right to fill the vacuum when mass disillusionment with Starmer’s government inevitably kicks in? Better to start asking some tough questions about what to do next. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2024-06-07T12:40:58Z,‘People feel betrayed by Labour’: Bristol’s Green surge continues,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/07/people-feel-betrayed-by-labour-bristols-green-surge-continues,"Early June in the bohemian enclave of Montpelier in Bristol, the sun warms the tightly packed terrace houses, delis and cafes. Flashes of Labour red that may once have adorned the windows in previous general elections are notably absent. In their place are badges of green, displayed with pride. Enjoying the sun outside the Bristolian cafe on Picton Street is Norhan Nabeeh, 34, a secondary teacher of psychology and religious studies who has always previously voted Labour. She won’t be doing so this year. “It’s primarily Keir Starmer’s leadership,” she says, listing the reasons she has turned her back on Labour. “Their views and actions on Gaza and Palestine. The way they’re treating black and brown women – like Diane Abbott and Faiza Shaheen – I’m not going to vote for a party that treats women, particularly women of colour, that way. “Bristol Central is a constituency that cares most about immigration and welcoming immigration. People feel betrayed by Labour.” Montpelier sits within the newly formed constituency of Bristol Central, where the Green party is more confident than ever of gaining its second MP in co-leader Carla Denyer. She hopes to take the seat from Labour’s incumbent MP – and culture secretary hopeful – Thangam Debbonaire. Debbonaire says she is not frustrated. “I’m the first woman of colour, to my knowledge, ever to represent any seat in the south-west … [Green] supporters say they want a change in government – it’s only going to be a Labour government – but their party is choosing to target a Labour MP not a Tory MP, to campaign against the Labour party – that’s their choice. That’s democracy. Personally frustrating? It’s not about me.” The Greens’ confidence comes partly from some choice maths. Firstly, the constituency boundary has been redrawn, with Debbonaire’s current patch of Bristol West to be scrapped. The Greens believe some measures show this alone will halve Debbonaire’s sizeable majority from about 28,000 to about 15,000. Then, a little over a month ago, the local elections gave the Greens a huge boost. Every single council ward within the Bristol Central parliamentary constituency elected a Green councillor. The party gained 10 seats across the city, mostly from Labour, bringing its total to 34. The Bristol city council leader is now a Green, Tony Dyer. But why Bristol and why now? In Montpelier, voters rarely raise environmental or climate issues among their primary concerns although many do touch upon them, occasionally mentioning Labour’s U-turn on its £28bn green investment pledge. It is rather the differing positions between Labour and the Green party on the conflict in Israel and Gaza that is cited, as well as Labour’s perceived shift to the right under Starmer. Up the road from the Bristolian, Thomas Chadwick, 52, who runs the Radford Mill Farm Shop, is planning to vote Green. “When Labour turned against Palestine, that was big for a lot of people. I used to work for Thangam Debbonaire. For her not to support people in Palestine – she is happy to repeat the party line over any ethical choice. Labour just feel like Tory-lites.” The Greens have called for a “full bilateral ceasefire” and the suspension of arms exports to Israel, while Labour backs a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and has called for the publication of government legal advice on arms exports. Starmer’s approach is viewed broadly as mirroring the Tories. On Israel-Gaza, Debbonaire argues that it was only Labour that was able to push through a motion in parliament calling for an immediate ceasefire. “So everything that the Green party locally can only protest about, we’re actually trying to do nationally and our motion on that got through and, in government, we will actually be a party of government that wants that peace process back on track.” Sitting in the Merchant Arms pub in the Hotwells area of the constituency before an evening’s canvassing, Denyer acknowledges the conflict has played a role in the party’s recent improved performance but insists it is only part of the picture. Asked if the Greens would be in the same position today had the 7 October attacks in Israel never happened, she says: “I’m sure it will make a difference of a few percentage points but people were already, of course, angry with what the Conservatives have done to the country over the last 14 years, [and] they were already telling us that they were disappointed by the Labour party before October. “People sometimes bring up Gaza, sometimes bring up the climate U-turn, sometimes bring up the failure of the Labour frontbench to visit picket lines and speak to striking workers. The list goes on and on.” Denyer also cites housing as a big issue for her would-be constituents, with the Green party’s support of rent control as a major draw, especially for young voters. The average house price in the constituency is about £467,000, compared with about £313,000 across Britain. But her downplaying of Gaza as an issue does not quite sit with some of the party’s campaign tactics so far. A letter posted through doors in Bristol Central featuring the Palestinian flag and images of destruction in Gaza appeared to be from concerned residents – but the small print shows it is in fact a leaflet from Denyer and the Green party. The letter says that Debbonaire – who is referred to as “our local Labour MP” – “followed Keir Starmer’s order to abstain from voting for a ceasefire in parliament, while so many other MPs rebelled”. The shift from Labour to the Greens is evident among the party’s volunteers out in force knocking on doors in Hotwells and up the hill into the affluent streets of Clifton and its grand Georgian crescents. Among them are Rebecca Bentley-Price, 25, a classics master’s student who lives in Clifton Downs. She used to be a Labour supporter but has been volunteering for the Greens since January. “It was mainly the shift to the right I saw in Labour,” she says, clutching a clipboard, preparing to knock on another door. “The Green party was completely aligned with how I feel about how we should be treating people.” Denyer knocks on the basement flat door of Monsoon Modi, who is barely able to contain her glee at meeting the co-leader of the party. Modi, 23, works in commercial operations at the carbon-offsetting start-up Ecologi, and is soon to study for a master’s in environmental sustainability. She has lived in the constituency for just over a year and chose to move to Bristol because of its “green base”. She says: “The climate crisis is something I’m really passionate about, I definitely experience eco-anxiety. The Greens are much stronger than Labour and the Tories on the climate. The climate crisis is at the heart of the party.” Challenged over whether Modi was a plant, knowing media would be accompanying the party on the doorstep, Denyer laughs. “Not at all,” she says. “Welcome to Bristol.” The momentum does seem to be with the Greens – the party chose the constituency to launch its national campaign and Bristol heroes Massive Attack came out for the party on Tuesday – but the Labour majority and history cannot be ignored. While support for the party in Bristol Central is not as visible, the contest is going to be undeniably close. Prue Hardwick, who lives in Bishopston, home of one of Bristol’s most vibrant high streets in Gloucester Road, said Debbonaire was an “exceptional candidate”, who was “articulate, strategic, down to earth and direct”, while David Spence, 54, a school improvement lead, also in Bishopston, said he would be voting Labour. He added: “Thangam is a really committed local MP who is respected for her industry and humble approach. She’ll be a minister – hopefully – and so will be an important voice for Bristol.” There is a sense that Labour is not relishing the contest in Bristol Central. The journalist Owen Jones recently located Debbonaire on the campaign trail in Bishopston, close to Kings Lawn Tennis Club, for his independent YouTube channel but she declined to answer questions. The Guardian requested time with Labour in Bristol but the party ultimately offered an interview over Zoom with Debbonaire, during which she was nevertheless fiercely passionate about in her pitch to the constituency and country. She cautions strongly against the idea that any voter who wants to see a change in government can afford to abandon Labour. “We will need a bigger swing than we had in 1997,” she says. “It’s so far from being a done deal.” “As a party of protest, an opposition backbench MP can do so little, whereas as secretary of state with a Labour government we can actually change things, we can do what I came to parliament to do, which was to change things, to make things better.” The dividing line between the two frontrunners in Bristol Central is “the difference between protest and power,” Debbonaire says. “But it’s also the difference between an MP who would have to learn the job from scratch and one who’s learned how to do it over nine years, has been preparing for government for the last few years and is ready to get started.” • This article was amended on 10 June 2024 to remove an image from 2015 that was added in error.",General election 2024; Politics; UK news; General elections; Bristol; Green party; Green politics; Environment; Labour; Carla Denyer,Politics
2024-03-11T01:28:54Z,"Portugal election: centre-right alliance claims victory, rejects role for far right",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/10/portugal-election-centre-right-coalition-on-course-for-narrow-victory,"The leader of Portugal’s centre-right Democratic Alliance, Luis Montenegro, has claimed victory after a closely contested parliamentary election that saw the far-right surge. With almost 99% of Sunday’s votes counted, the Democratic Alliance – an electoral platform made up of the large Social Democratic party (PSD) and two smaller conservative parties – and the Socialist party (PS) were each on 28.67%. The far-right Chega party was in third place with 18%. In the early hours of Monday, Montenegro reiterated his election promise not to rely on Chega to govern or to strike any deals with the populists, although it was unclear if he could govern without their support. Montenegro told a crowd of cheering supporters it was crucial for political parties in the new parliament to act responsibly and “comply with the wish of the Portuguese people”. “I always said that winning the elections would mean having one vote more than any other candidacy, and only in those circumstances would I accept to be prime minister,” he said in an address to party supporters shortly after midnight. “It seems inescapable that the AD won the elections and that the Socialists lost,” he added after partial official results showed his side secured a slim lead over the Socialists, in power since 2015, in Sunday’s polls. The leader of the Socialist party, Pedro Nuno Santos, conceded defeat and congratulated the Democratic Alliance on its victory. “Everything indicates that the result won’t enable the Socialist Party to be the most voted party,” Nuno Santos said, according to Bloomberg. The result marked a huge surge for Chega, which was founded five years ago by André Ventura, a former TV football pundit who was once a rising star in the PSD. The party broke through in the 2019 election, attracting 1.3% of the vote and gaining its first MP in Portugal’s 230-seat assembly. Three years later, it took 7.2% of the vote and won 12 seats. The vote was triggered by the socialist prime minister, António Costa, resigning in November after an investigation was launched into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa – who had been in office since 2015 and who won a surprise absolute majority in the 2022 general election – has not been accused of any crime. He said that while his conscience was clear, he felt he had no choice but to step down because the “duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. He also announced that he would not be running for prime minister in the election, leaving the Socialist party in the hands of Nuno Santos, a former infrastructure minister from the leftwing of the party. Speaking as the results came in, Costa acknowledged his party’s performance was “far from the one we had two years ago and far from the one we had wanted”. Although Montenegro, has explicitly ruled out any deals with Chega because of what he calls Ventura’s “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic” views, he is now likely to come under considerable pressure from his own party to reach an agreement with the far-right party to help the PSD into government. Even with the backing of the smaller centre-right Liberal Initiative – which is on course to finish fourth on around 4.9% – any potential minority government led by the Democratic Alliance would probably still have to rely on Chega’s support to pass legislation, leaving its stability in the hands of the far right. According to the Expresso newspaper, Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has broken with the convention of presidential neutrality by saying he will do everything possible to prevent Chega from reaching office. He said he would reject any moves to replace Montenegro as prime minister should the right win a majority. Ventura has hit back at the president’s comments, saying: “In Portugal, it’s not the president of the republic who chooses the government – it’s the voters.” As the night wore on, other European far-right leaders were quick to toast Chega’s success and offer their support and solidarity. Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s Vox party, congratulated Ventura and “our Portuguese friends and neighbours” on “this great result”, while Maximilian Krah, Alternative for Germany’s leader in the European parliament, said Chega was on the way to a “fantastic success”. Jordan Bardella, the president of France’s National Rally, hailed a “great breakthrough”, saying the Portuguese people were “defending their identity and their prosperity, and sweeping away the corrupt socialists!”. In Hungary, Ádám Samu Balázs, the head of the international secretariat for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party, called the results a “great breakthrough”. He added: “The fight of our friend and ally André Ventura against the globalist left and for the protection of national sovereignty and the defence of Europe is exemplary.” The Socialists had been hoping the threat of the far right moving closer to government would rally centrist voters as it did in 2022. The Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, had offered the prospect of change after eight years of socialist rule, promising to promote economic growth by cutting taxes and improve squeezed public services. Chega had sought to capitalise on widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties as the country continues to suffer a housing crisis, stressed health and education systems, and low wages. “Never in the history of Portugal has there been a greater possibility of overthrowing the bipartisan system that has been killing us for the past 50 years,” Ventura told supporters at a recent Chega rally in northern Portugal. “We have never been this close.” The party had made political corruption a central theme of its campaign, putting up huge billboards around the country reading: “Portugal needs a clean-up.” The investigation that caused the collapse of Costa’s government – which examined possible “malfeasance, active and passive corruption of politicians and influence peddling” – led to searches of the environment and infrastructure ministries and of Costa’s official residence, and to the arrest of five people, among them his chief of staff. The five were subsequently released and the investigating magistrate retained only the charge of influence peddling. It is not the only scandal dogging the Socialists. The former prime minister José Sócrates is due to stand trial over allegations that he pocketed €34m from three companies while he was in power between 2005 and 2011. Sócrates has denied any involvement in fraud or money-laundering and has maintained his innocence. The PSD is also facing corruption allegations, with two prominent party officials in Madeira resigning recently amid a graft investigation.

2023-06-06T05:00:01Z,A campaign against inheritance tax led by a multimillionaire? These really are desperate times for the Tories | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/inheritance-tax-multimillionaire-desperate-tories-nadhim-zahawi,"Governing parties in their death throes thrash about, grasping for life rafts and hunting through old lists to recapture the tried-and-tested vote-winners of yesteryear. The campaign by more than 50 Tory MPs and the Telegraph to abolish inheritance tax is a prime example. Didn’t it work its magic once before, when George Osborne spooked Gordon Brown out of calling an election in 2007 by promising a £1m threshold? Surely, that means it will work again in the Conservatives’ hour of desperate need? This time, Labour is not spooked. Far from it. Nothing could be more comic than the multimillionaire Nadhim Zahawi leading this campaign, the man whose only memorable moment in his brief chancellorship was being sacked for failing to declare an ongoing investigation into his personal tax affairs. A party of zillionaires campaigning against a tax that only the likes of them need to pay looks like clueless insouciance. It shows how far their feet have drifted from terra firma. Yet again, their trusty Telegraph has led them madly astray – as it always does. True, people think inheritance tax is the second most unreasonably high tax after council tax, according to research by More in Common. Both arrive as bills, making them visible in a way that other taxes are not. Even though a tiny percentage of estates pay the tax – in 2019-20, it was fewer than 4% – there is a deep and irrational sense of injustice about “taxing the dead” and “double taxation”, even though much of the money accumulated in a property that has multiplied many times in value will never have been taxed in the first place. So will this abolition plan fly? If Rishi Sunak does seize this idea masterminded by Zahawi, Rees-Mogg and the Telegraph, this government will be walking into a death trap of its own making. What’s more, the myth that Osborne’s plan was a win for the Tories in 2010 is deeply questionable, according to Labour’s pollsters. Prof Tim Bale, an expert Tory party analyst, agrees that the ploy in 2007 didn’t “do as much for George Osborne as everyone seems to think”. Prof Rob Ford, a political analyst, adds: “That’s not what caused the shift in the polls at that time.” He tells me that people hate the tax. But the optics of Tories sheltering their wealth would see “Labour’s campaign ads writing themselves”, Ford says. Labour will shrug this off – as it has done with many of the government’s desperate gestures and culture war diversions. The current system could be reformed in all kinds of ways: loopholes could be closed for the Duke of Westminster, get-outs ended for farm land. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested replacing inheritance tax with a lifetime gift tax. Alternatively, the tax could be levied on recipients. Or it could be abolished in favour of wealth taxes (though when the Telegraph campaign points out that Sweden abolished inheritance tax, it forgets to mention that the Swedish top tax rate is 57%). Labour’s sternly disciplined messaging has prevented the party from being tempted off-piste; it is relentlessly focused on the cost of living, the NHS, public services and its “fairer, greener” plans. While the current government tinkers and fidgets, Labour seems more like a serious party of government. “‘Stop the boats’ has got them nowhere,” says Ford, as immigration falls further down the public’s list of concerns. When even xenophobia fails to deliver, the Tories really have lost their last refuge. Meanwhile, in the serious world, Keir Starmer addresses the GMB conference on Tuesday. The union, rightly interested in protecting its members, was alarmed at Labour’s commitment to block all new oil and gas development in the North Sea. Starmer needs to persuade the GMB that his pledge of £28bn a year to be spent on the party’s green prosperity plan will create far more good jobs, suitable for those same workers in Scotland. This will be the start of a huge off-shore and on-shore wind expansion, with new nuclear plants and factories making the turbines that are currently built abroad. It needs green steel and giga battery sites, as well as home insulation in a dash for clean energy by 2030. Labour’s promised fair pay agreements across every sector will boost earnings, just as the minimum wage did in the government of Blair and Brown. A union such as the GMB, admirably confronting the likes of Amazon, will find organising far easier under a Labour government, which will oblige every employer to allow union recruiters into every workplace. You can expect a steep rise in union membership. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, makes a strong case for blocking any further oil and gas development. There will be no repeat of Thatcher’s brutal programme of deindustrialisation. Labour is reindustrialising – and it’s all green. The Tories have tried to claim the £1.5m donated to Labour by Dale Vince, the green campaigning founder of Ecotricity, has shaped its anti-oil policy. Vince is a funder of Just Stop Oil – and why not? A tussle within the shadow cabinet over the sharing out of this £28bn is inevitable. Though the Times claims “Starmer may pull the plug” on the green agenda, those close to him say he has never been more adamant about green investment, inspired anew by Joe Biden’s epic green investment fund that will power the US economy. They insist there is no sliver of distinction between Ed Miliband’s net zero climate programme and Starmer’s pledge that all borrowing for investment will be green. The Tories have meanwhile vacated the green arena, badly misled again by Telegraph phobias into thinking that it is unpopular as they strive to appeal to their vanishing “red wall” seats. Their instinctive ideological aversion to all things green is a major error: Ford says he’s surprised by “how well green plays right across the board”, from Green party local election successes in Tory seats, to strong support for green industrial investment. By focusing so much on the prejudices of old people, the Tories risk forgetting at their peril that millennials are the biggest age cohort in more than half of all constituencies – and young people want green investment. The contrast between Labour’s policy seriousness and the Tories’ endless chasing of quick populist wins could hardly be stronger. Bring on Zahawi’s comic attempt to avoid inheritance tax for all his cohort. Labour isn’t worried, nor diverted from its plans for government.

2024-03-10T15:43:16Z,Portugal’s far-right Chega party eyes kingmaker role as country goes to polls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/10/portugal-far-right-chega-party-polls-antonio-costa-socialist-coalition,"The Portuguese left and right are braced for a tight race as the country votes in its second snap general election in three years, a closely fought contest that is also expected to result in huge gains and a possible kingmaker role for the far-right Chega party. Sunday’s election was triggered by the collapse of the socialist government of António Costa, who resigned as prime minister in November amid an investigation of alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa – who had been in office since 2015 and who won a surprise absolute majority in the 2022 general election – has not been accused of any crime. He said he felt he had no choice but to resign because “the duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. Voting began at 8am on Sunday and most ballot results were expected within hours of polling stations closing at 8pm. Voter turnout had reached 25.2% by midday, up from 23.3% at the same point during the last election. Polls suggest the election will be a close-run affair, with only a few percentage points between the centre-right Democratic Alliance – an electoral platform made up of the large Social Democratic party (PSD) and two smaller conservative parties – and the Socialist party (PS). A survey published on Friday, the final day of campaigning, put the Democratic Alliance on 34% and the socialists on 28%. But the poll, for the Público newspaper and the public broadcaster RTP, also suggested that socialists and other, smaller leftwing and communist parties could pull in enough votes collectively to outweigh those of the right bloc. Much will depend on Chega, the populist, far-right party founded five years ago by André Ventura, a former TV football pundit who was once a rising star in the PSD. After winning 1.3% of the vote in the 2019 elections and 7.2% in 2022, Chega is expected to enjoy a huge surge in support on Sunday, taking between 15% and 20% of the vote. Although the PSD’s leader, Luís Montenegro, has ruled out any deals with Chega because of what he has termed Ventura’s “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic” views, he is likely to come under considerable pressure from his own party if Chega’s help is needed to stop the left returning to power. According to the Expresso newspaper, Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has broken with the convention of presidential neutrality by saying he will do everything possible to prevent Chega from reaching office, including rejecting any moves to replace Montenegro as prime minister should the right win a majority. Even with the backing of the smaller centre-right Liberal Initiative, any potential minority government led by the Democratic Alliance would probably still have to rely on Chega’s support to pass legislation, leaving its stability in the hands of the far-right party. Ventura hit back at the president’s reported comments, saying: “In Portugal, it’s not the president of the republic who chooses the government – it’s the voters.” Chega is seeking to capitalise on widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties as the country continues to suffer a housing crisis, squeezed public services, low wages, and a string of corruption scandals affecting the PS and the PSD. “Never in the history of Portugal has there been a greater possibility of overthrowing the bipartisan system that has been killing us for the past 50 years,” Ventura told supporters at a Chega rally in northern Portugal last week. “We have never been this close.” As he queued to vote in the northern city of Espinho on Sunday morning, Diamantino Vieira, 86, told Reuters: “I hope life gets better than what it is now.” Bernardo Guerra, a 28-year-old personal trainer who had just voted in central Lisbon, told Agence France-Presse that things had got worse and a change was in order. “In Portugal there is a lot of corruption, Portugal has a bad image abroad,” he said. “I hope a new government improves this situation.” Pedro Magalhães, a political scientist at the Institute of Social Sciences at the University of Lisbon, said the Socialists had a battle on their hands. “Although the economic situation has become relatively favourable – regarding GDP growth, unemployment, and the country’s budgetary health – government approval has declined steeply since the last election, from more than 60% to about 25%,” he said. “This seems to be connected with the rising costs of living experienced in the last two years, especially in housing in metropolitan areas, and with faltering performance in public education and the NHS.” Magalhães said that while support for the Democratic Alliance had increased because of voter dissatisfaction, “its growth as the main alternative to the Socialists is constrained by the rise of the radical right represented by Chega”. But he also stressed that many voters were still undecided and much remained uncertain, noting that “about one out of every five poll respondents claims to be undecided about what to do this Sunday, and even among those who declare a voting intention, a sizeable minority states they can still change”. André Azevedo Alves, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Portugal and St Mary’s University, London, said much would hang on the Socialists’ ability to again rally voters amid the prospect of an electoral breakthrough for the far right. “In 2022, the threat of Chega mobilised some voters in the centre to vote for the Socialist party – and some on the radical and far left, which got historically low results – to change their vote to the Socialist party almost at the last moment,” he said. “Will it work again? I think the conditions for it to work are worse – you’ve had two additional years, with an absolute majority, that have been an absolute mess. “The Socialist party had the best conditions to govern and they weren’t even able to organise themselves internally and you had junior and senior ministers quitting almost every month because of all sorts of scandals. And ultimately, you had the prime minister quitting.” Azevedo Alves also pointed out that the absence of Costa on the ballot could hurt the Socialists. He said Costa’s replacement, Pedro Nuno Santos, – who resigned as infrastructure minister in late 2022 over a scandal around a large severance payout by the state-owned airline TAP – lacked the broad appeal of his predecessor. “Another factor is that you don’t have Costa running and Costa is vastly more popular than Pedro Nuno Santos,” he said. “Pedro Nuno Santos is on the left wing of the Socialist party, while Costa was clearly a moderate and more consensual figure.”",Portugal; Europe; World news; The far right,World news
2024-05-07T13:00:15Z,‘Labour will surpass your expectations’: the leftwing thinktank boss standing on Starmer’s agenda,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/07/labour-will-surpass-your-expectations-the-leftwing-thinktank-boss-standing-on-starmers-agenda,"Miatta Fahnbulleh has been talking about economic transformation for as long as she can remember. After she and her family fled civil war in Liberia as a child, the main topics of conversation around the breakfast table in London were politics and economics. “When other people were talking about EastEnders, we were on about changing the economic settlement,” says the 44-year-old former chief executive of the New Economics Foundation (NEF), who is standing as Labour’s candidate in Peckham, south London, at the next election. “They are the two things that shape my views about economics: the poverty levels I saw in Liberia, and talking about how we change the economic settlement at breakfast or dinner. Then you see first-generation immigrants trying to make it in this country, and it just doesn’t work. That’s what drives me.” A rising intellectual star in Labour’s ranks, Fahnbulleh is working overtime in the run-up to the election as a senior economic adviser to Angela Rayner and Ed Miliband, as well as juggling campaigning in her own patch, charity work, and school pick-ups for her 10-year-old and her five-year-old twins. “It’s a handful. But it’s also a privilege and keeps me grounded. If you have a bad day, you go home, and you’re just Mum, whatever you were doing.” Despite her prominent role running a leading left-of-centre thinktank – including regular appearances on the BBC’s Question Time – she has spent most of her career since joining the civil service under the last Labour government behind the scenes. Now she hopes to jump from talking about economic change to enacting it, in a switch that could put her on a path to the frontbench. Still, the self-identified “policy wonk” worries the task is easier said than done, warning that Labour is facing a “dire economic inheritance” from the Conservatives should Keir Starmer’s party win power, as the polls predict. “We’ve got a massive job on our hands. It’s going to take 10 or 15 years,” she says, taking time out of campaigning to chat in a cafe in her prospective constituency, where Labour has a majority of 34,000 – meaning that, even with boundary changes for the election, she will almost certainly succeed the retiring MP, Harriet Harman. “You only need to walk around Peckham to feel it. Not just to see it but to feel it. People are really ground down. “And for me, it’s not just the fact that the economy has pretty much flatlined for 15 years. It’s the fact that it’s just not working. It’s staggering that living standards have not budged in that time.” Fahnbulleh was born in September 1979 in Liberia, half a year before a violent coup. Her father, Boimah, was a politics professor before serving in the government of military leader Samuel Doe, first as minister for education, then of foreign affairs. However, he became a vocal critic as Doe transformed Africa’s first republic into a violently repressive dictatorship, and the family was forced to flee first to neighbouring Sierra Leone – the country of her mother’s birth, and where her grandfather was Liberia’s ambassador – before arriving in the UK to claim asylum. “He was at the top of the hitlist,” Fahnbulleh says of her father. “Because he was vocal, and he had a big leadership with the student movement, they saw him as a threat.” Sharing her name with her aunt, a prominent musician and activist (“who can sing, unlike me!”), Fahnbulleh says the opportunity to represent Peckham and its diverse population, including many from the west African diaspora, is a huge privilege. But while joining a growing number of black British female politicians, she remains one of very few such figures in economics. “I can count my other female black economists on one hand. It’s a bigger problem than in politics,” she says. “It’s not diverse enough. And why does that matter? If we like it or not, so much of the rules of the game, so much of our politics, is dominated by economics. “It is a very closed shop, with a very particular view of the world. And unless you diversify that … [it] only brings us one perspective.” Although she grew up in north-west London, and attended a fee-paying school in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Peckham played a big role in Fahnbulleh’s youth, with visits most weekends with her mother to its Sierra Leonean shops and restaurants. “It’s the hub for the community. It’s my home from home. “I think when I leave politics, I want Peckham to feel very different for the community. Because if we’ve done that in Peckham, we will have changed the country. That’s my test.” Fixing the cost of living crisis will, however, be no mean feat as millions of households suffer the worst hit to living standards on record, according to figures that date back to 1956 – particularly as Labour faces criticism that its toned-down tax and spending plans differ little from the Conservatives’. “You get a lot of ‘Labour has no ideas,’” says Fahnbulleh, who in her work for Rayner and Miliband is tasked with both developing bold new ideas and making sure they can be implemented in government. “But part of the challenge is that every time Labour has pushed out an idea, it’s been nicked. So you can forgive the team for saying: ‘We’re trying to give a sense of what we’re about, and a flavour of some of our policies, but we’re not going to give you the full thing now.’” Labour, in her view, will be more progressive than its critics anticipate, through plans for a transformation of workers’ rights and the creation of a state-owned energy company. Still, she admits unease over the decision to slash the party’s high-profile £28bn green investment plan. “I think every single person in the Labour party is disappointed, because it was part of our programme,” she says. “But in the end, it’s not the world we want; it’s the world we’ve been given. If it was a different inheritance, we would still have that policy.” Compromise in the face of tough economic questions, while promising a transformation of the economy, is a recurring theme in Labour circles. Not least for Fahnbulleh, who as the boss of the NEF for six years until December 2023 ran an organisation that heavily influenced Jeremy Corbyn’s economic agenda. “I think we were completely right in our analysis of the problem,” she says, reflecting on the period. “We were putting up solutions – by the way, some of which the government itself nicked – that were right for the times.” However, Labour’s 2019 manifesto was too ambitious, she says. “People aren’t stupid. Yes, they can see all the problems. But they also know governments don’t turn things around like this overnight. It was a 15-year programme for government in a five-year prospectus that no one believed.” She says the big lesson she has learned is not to ditch your principles, but to pace yourself. “Of course we have to be ambitious, but we also have to give people a prospectus they can believe. You’re better off saying ‘10-year projects’, so you know what we’re about. “I think we will surpass people’s expectations. There will be an offer there, and we will deliver more.

2023-10-01T17:32:48Z,Chancellor chooses plane over train to get from London to Manchester,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/01/chancellor-chooses-plane-over-train-to-get-from-london-to-manchester,"Jeremy Hunt flew to Manchester from London rather than taking the train or a more sustainable form of transport, the Guardian can reveal. Flying is the most carbon-intensive form of transport, and Hunt’s journey will have emitted around 40kg of carbon dioxide. These fossil fuels heat the planet and cause climate breakdown, such as fires and floods. The chancellor flew on BA1372 in economy class from Heathrow airport, and the flight took 30 minutes. The train from London takes around two hours. He is understood to have decided to fly because he had an important meeting with the Japanese ambassador on Sunday morning, and was also concerned about the rail strikes. Sunak travelled to Manchester via by car, citing the train strikes. Hunt has been criticised for his choice to take the high carbon transport option. Chris Venables, deputy director of politics at environmental thinktank Green Alliance, said: “For the chancellor to chose to fly, one of the most polluting forms of travel, on a journey that takes a couple of hours by train will rightly raise eyebrows, especially following the significant steps backwards this government has taken on the green agenda in recent weeks. “Those worrying policy U-turns have made it even more urgent that the chancellor responds as soon as possible to the global green investment race being led by the US and China, as the UK falls slowly behind.” A Labour spokesperson said: “Jeremy Hunt appears to have picked up Rishi’s love of flying. They both know that Tory economic incompetence has put the rail network under such pressure that they can’t rely on a train to turn up on time. “Luckily for them, multimillionaires can afford to fly, so, like so many of their mistakes, it’s for working people to live through and the super rich to just read about.” Paul Morozzo, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “The high-carbon travel habits of government ministers have led to doubts about their sincerity when talking about their commitment to protecting the environment. But this government, in rushing to put party before planet and people, is the first to make their environmental U-turns the main theme of their election campaign. It makes you wonder whether the chancellor’s flight is a PR gaffe or a sign of party loyalty.” The prime minister has come under fire in the past for his private jet and helicopter habit. Though he says taking private aviation to travel short distances is a more efficient use of his time than using road or rail, many have pointed out the climate – and cost – impacts of his preferred travel methods. Recent data from the Ministry of Justice showed that Rishi Sunak has used RAF jets and helicopters for domestic flights more frequently than the UK’s previous three prime ministers. The data revealed he took almost one such flight a week during his first seven months in office. Some trips included one by helicopter to Dover, which would have taken just over an hour by train, and another helicopter ride to Southampton, which would come in at one hour 14 minutes by rail.",Climate crisis; Jeremy Hunt; Politics; Environment; UK news; Conservatives; Rishi Sunak,Environment
2023-10-13T08:51:46Z,"IMF should give poor countries $300bn a year to fight climate crisis, says Joseph Stiglitz",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/13/poorest-countries-should-get-300bn-a-year-to-fight-climate-crisis-says-joseph-stiglitz,"Poor countries should be provided with $300bn (£246bn) a year from the International Monetary Fund to finance their fight against the climate crisis, the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has said. Speaking to the Guardian at the IMF’s annual meeting in Marrakech, Stiglitz said developing nations needed their equivalent of the US Inflation Reduction Act – a package of grants and subsidies designed to promote green growth and jobs. Stiglitz said the battle against global heating would only be won if poor countries were onboard but there was no hope of them coming up with their equivalent of the act, which he said was expensive and flawed but working. Instead, he said rich countries should support the creation of $300bn of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) each year to finance a global green transition. The US economist admitted it would be impossible to get his plan through the US Congress in its current deadlocked state but said he would continue to campaign for it. “As the scale of climate change impresses itself more and more on us, we are going to need bolder things. When the time comes and we are frying and somebody says: ‘How do we get out of the frying pan?’, this [annual SDR allocations] is one way of doing so.” The need for extra money to help poorer countries cope with the effects of global heating and decarbonise their economies has been high on the agenda at the annual meeting of the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, in Morocco this week. Stiglitz, a former World Bank chief economist, said he welcomed plans to provide the bank with more capital to lend for green projects but said a far more ambitious approach was needed. SDRs are an accepted international reserve asset that can be exchanged with hard currencies and can be used as a credit line. Seen as a form of money creation similar to quantitative easing, the IMF issued a $650bn tranche of SDRs in 2021 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Rich countries did not need to use their allocations and agreed to recycle some of their SDRs into special IMF funds to support poor nations. Stiglitz said of SDRs: “Basically, it is printing money. It wouldn’t be inflationary but it would be transformative.” He said the EU was planning its own version of the Inflation Reduction Act – but on a smaller scale. “Developing countries can’t do it on any scale. Unless developing countries and emerging markets reduce their emissions, no matter what pieties we do in the US and Europe, we will get global warming. The rhetoric is about doing something about climate change and then rather than getting onboard [the people] you most need to get onboard, you alienate them.” The act was originally sold by the US president, Joe Biden, as a $370bn plan to rebuild the country’s industrial base by boosting investment in projects designed to achieve net zero. Stiglitz said the actual size of the stimulus could turn out to be $1.5tn. “It is an open-ended tax credit. The good thing is that we are getting a lot of green investment.” Stiglitz said he supported the act even though it was poorly designed and included some “massively protectionist” measures that violated international rules.",Climate crisis; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Business; Economics; World news; US news; Inequality; Global economy; Environment,Environment
2024-02-20T10:00:18Z,The Tory press can publish all the tax avoidance guides they like – the rich won't flee a Labour government | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/20/tory-press-tax-avoidance-rich-flee-labour-government-britain-wealthy,"It’s a done deal – just about. Down at the bookies, you can get 14/1 on a Tory majority at the next general election, while betting on Labour to win, the odds are a measly 1/6. If you need any more confirmation that Labour will form the next government, just listen to the clamour of the wealth advisers telling their high net-worth clients that it’s time to pack their Louis Vuittons. It is tradition that as a Labour government heaves into view, a noisy and obnoxious handful of the super-rich threatens to quit the UK, taking all their treasure with them. “Labour is coming for your wealth – here’s where to escape their taxes,” says yet another Telegraph fright-piece on “options for worried middle-class earners”. Middle class? The article goes on to discuss VAT on private school fees (attended by just 7% of children) and non-dom tax (68,800 people claim non-domiciled taxpayer status in the UK). The Tory press uses “middle class” to describe the top few percent, ignoring that the actual median UK income is £34,963 – hardly non-dom territory. But it’s politically convenient to pretend Labour is coming after any homeowner, any tax payer, or anyone with an Isa, disguising the wealth of the super-rich under the cover of general middle-classness. In WealthBriefing, the “publication of record for the global wealth management industry”, a private wealth manager warns that her clients will be off. She says: “As the Labour party is looking to abolish the non-dom tax regime, other countries are seeking to attract new immigrants with favourable tax regimes … many will go.” And of course, here’s the kicker: “It is essential to get legal advice early, to plan the move and navigate the immigration, tax and lifestyle hurdles of migrating to their new country.” Labour may swear blind there will be no income tax, national insurance or capital gains tax rises, but advisers drumming up business like to warn that the shadow chancellor’s assertion that “we have no plans” for other taxes, hides untold Labour horrors. Spear’s, the wealth management and luxury lifestyle magazine, reports: “‘Fire escape plans’ are being drafted, alternative jurisdictions considered, and tax relief schemes discussed.” Here’s a salutary tale from the multimillionaire Guy Hands, who founded the private equity firm Terra Firma. In 2009 he bolted, making maximum noise about it, in fear of Labour targeting wealthy investors, as Gordon Brown struggled to cope with the financiers’ crash. He chose Guernsey, with its flat 20% income tax rate and zero capital gains tax. There was mockery as he left his wife and children behind, instructing them to come and visit him. But full marks to him for admitting it didn’t end well. He wrote recently: “Moving to Guernsey greatly impacted my ability to build and maintain strong relationships with contacts, on which my success in business relied. I lost the flow of the market and ultimately I was never able to raise a blind fund again. Deal-making and fundraising is best done face to face … I also lost connection with my team.” He added: “For me it was a disaster.” Private equity is using all its firepower to intimidate Labour out of its plan to abolish the “carried interest” loophole, which lets private equity executives describe their income as capital gains, incurring less tax. Hands has tried to frighten Labour into backing down, writing in the Telegraph that “although by some miracle the UK has largely retained the [private equity] industry post-Brexit”, EU cities “are actively vying to tempt people away from London with favourable tax regimes”. Yet he still urged fellow private equity barons to heed his experience, warning: “If tax goes up, while private equity executives may see themselves better off elsewhere on paper, they risk becoming estranged from their business ecosystem.” Against that backdrop, the FT reports that Labour is under pressure to water down its private equity reform. But reneging on yet another policy after backing off the £28bn-a-year green investment would be a serious error: capital gains tax needs to be levelled up to more closely align with income tax, as recommended by the Office of Tax Simplification. This loophole helped cause capital gains to almost triple in the last decade to £65bn: today’s research from Arun Advani’s economics department at the University of Warwick shows just 0.5% of people had a capital gain last year. One neighbourhood in Kensington earned more in capital gains than Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle combined. Taxes will rise whoever wins the next election, says the FT - because the spending cuts Jeremy Hunt has left for 2025 are impossible. YouGov finds most people expect it. But the mega-rich are right to fear that Rachel Reeves’ abolition of their many loopholes will mean vertiginous tax rises for them. If she cleans up the tax havens, there will be fewer places to hide themselves or their money. Will they flee? They are not as mobile as they pretend, with families, friends and roots that resist being dug up. Besides, tired of London, tired of life, and they fear getting very bored in these “culturally barren” tax havens, finds Sam Friedman, a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics. His team interviewed a raft of the top one-percenters and found not one planning to make Guy Hands’ mistake. Attitudes towards tax are changing, with the demise of Thatcherite small-statism. The British Social Attitudes survey found that 52% of the public are in favour of higher taxes. Listen to the Confederation of British Industry and serious businesses these days call for infrastructure investment, not cuts. Patriotic Millionaires may be a progressive vanguard, but its maxim is influential: “The country deserves proper investment; what better way to do this than through taxing the richest people?” Hunt will squander public money on tax cuts that are not on voters’ agenda. Labour has little to fear from sabre-rattling wealth advisers, though one of the very richest people most likely to flee after the general election is the prime minister himself.

2024-03-04T05:00:20Z,"The right has no fixes for Portugal’s problems, says Left Bloc leader",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/04/portugal-election-right-problems-left-bloc-leader-mariana-mortagua,"A victory for the right in the Portuguese general election this week could reverse the social advances of the past few years and herald a return to the “moral, theoretical and political bankruptcy” that followed the 2008 financial crisis, the leader of the small Left Bloc party has said. Speaking to the Guardian as Portugal prepared to go to the polls on Sunday in a snap election triggered by the collapse in November of António Costa’s socialist government, Mariana Mortágua said rightwing and far-right parties did not have viable solutions to the country’s housing, healthcare and wage crises. She also suggested hard-won social rights could be threatened, pointing out that a senior member of one of the parties that makes up the centre-right Democratic Alliance coalition had floated the idea of a new referendum on abortion, almost two decades after Portugal overturned one of Europe’s most restrictive laws. “Today, the big news is that one of the rightwing candidates wants to have a referendum to ban free abortion in Portugal, which is something we won 17 years ago,” said Mortágua. “All that is at stake right now.” The Democratic Alliance moved swiftly to distance itself from the idea of a new abortion referendum, but Mortágua said the coalition, led by the Social Democratic party (PSD), could not be allowed back into power because of the painful and destructive austerity policies it had inflicted on Portugal at the behest of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. “After the troika intervention and all the rightwing policies – not only here – the right entered a period of moral, theoretical and political bankruptcy,” she said. “What’s at stake in these elections is whether we’re able to keep the right away from power and from the place where they went after the crisis, because they had no solutions to offer the country or the people, or whether they somehow manage to recover from that bankruptcy and take power again.” The centre-right government of the PSD’s Pedro Passos Coelho was toppled in November 2015 and replaced by an anti-austerity alliance of the Socialist party (PS), the Left Bloc and the Portuguese Communist party, which was collectively known as the geringonça, or “improvised solution”. Under Costa’s stewardship, the unlikely and little-fancied geringonça managed to bring political and economic stability to a country that received a €78bn (£67bn) bailout from the EU and the IMF in 2011. “We did something important in 2015 and we need to keep that capacity to change the country, to have agreements on the left, and to have progressive measures,” said Mortágua. Although the geringonça eventually foundered in 2021 when the Left Bloc and the Communist party refused to support Costa’s 2022 budget on the grounds that it did not include measures the smaller parties had asked for, Mortágua said her party was ready and willing to support a new Socialist-led government if its voice and policies were heeded. “We’d be happy to have an agreement if that agreement means we have enough power to impose new measures for wages and the healthcare system and housing and so on,” she said. Sunday’s election comes almost four months after Costa – who won a third term as prime minister and an unexpected absolute majority in the January 2022 general election – resigned amid an investigation into alleged illegalities in his government’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa, who has not been accused of any crime and who maintains he has a clear conscience, said he had stepped down out of respect for his office, saying “the duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. Recent polls suggest the socialists and the PSD are running almost neck and neck, with the centre-right party on about 31% of the vote and the PS on 29%. The far-right Chega party looks set to finish third with 18% of the vote, and the Left Bloc and the centre-right Liberal Initiative party are competing for fourth place with between 4% and 6% each. The PSD’s leader, Luís Montenegro, has emphatically ruled out any agreement with Chega, saying the views and policies of its leader, André Ventura, are “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic”. Mortágua approves of the PSD’s decision to reject Chega, but she is sceptical as to how long it might last. “Are we completely at peace and confident that, when the time comes and they need to get power, the right won’t find a way to make an agreement between themselves?” she said. “No. No one is.” The Left Bloc suffered a huge collapse in the 2022 election, dropping from 19 seats in the 230-seat parliament to five, a dismal performance that Mortágua attributes to tactical voting and fears of the far-right driving her party’s voters into the arms of the socialists. Her party may still have the clout to help the left back into office, and she is hoping that its ideas, rather than worries about Chega, will win back voters. Among its policies are using the budget surplus to increase investment in healthcare and education, ensuring that no CEO can earn more than 12 times the salary of their company’s lowest-paid worker, lowering taxes on wages and energy, and ending the non-resident tax schemes under which non-residents pay a flat tax of 10%. The party plans to tackle Portugal’s housing crisis by banning non-residents from buying houses in cities, drastically limiting Airbnb numbers in saturated areas, and introducing rent caps and mandatory five-year rental contracts to ensure stability. Despite the tumult of the past few years, Mortágua, a 37-year-old economist whose mother is a social worker and whose father is a veteran anti-fascist activist who fought the Salazar regime, is optimistic about the state of Portuguese democracy as the country prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of the Carnation revolution. “If you think in international terms, when welfare states were being built, we were in a dictatorship, and we got out of dictatorship when neoliberalism was being imposed everywhere else,” she said. “Thatcher was doing her worst work ever and we were just getting out of the dictatorship and starting to build our welfare state. So we were always in kind of a countercycle, catching up to building the welfare state and democracy. But we did it and we did a great job.” The memory of the revolution, she said, was a useful reminder of what could be done. “We need to keep working and to show people that it’s possible to fight to move forward instead of just resisting and stopping bad things from happening. “I’m quite optimistic about this election, even if it’s against the odds. I believe in the great power of the Portuguese people.”",Portugal; Europe; World news,World news
2024-02-16T06:13:19Z,"Labour overturns 18,000 Tory majority to win Wellingborough byelection",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/16/labour-wins-wellingborough-byelection-gen-kitchen,"Labour has scored its largest swing in a byelection since 1994 after overturning a majority of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough, bolstering predictions that the party is on course for a landslide victory at the next general election. Labour’s candidate, Gen Kitchen, won with 13,844 votes, beating the Conservatives’ Helen Harrison who received 7,408 votes in the largest swing from the Tories to Labour since 1994 and second-largest since the second world war. It was Labour’s fifth byelection gain from the Conservatives overall in this parliament. The party also gained a Tory seat in Kingswood, dealing a double blow to an embattled Conservative party that has lost 10 byelections in a single parliament, more than any government since the 1960s. Labour achieved its largest swing in a byelection since 1994 with 28.5%. Turnout stood at 38.1% in Wellingborough and 37.1% in Kingswood, fairly low figures compared with other recent byelections in England. Tamworth and Somerton and Frome recorded lower turnouts but contests in Uxbridge, Selby and Ainsty and Mid Bedfordshire saw figures in the mid-40s. Speaking after her win, Kitchen said: “The people of Wellingborough have spoken for Britain. This is a stunning victory for the Labour party and must send a message from Northamptonshire to Downing Street.” The wins in Wellingborough and Kingswood will temper fears that a testing week for Labour has significantly threatened its electoral prospects and will further bolster predictions that the party stands to win a large majority at the next general election. Harrison appeared at the count about two hours before the results were announced. She was in high spirits, posing for photographs and telling reporters she was feeling “good”. She also appeared on good terms with Reform UK, at one point calling over the party’s leader, Richard Tice. After the result was announced, Harrison was swarmed with cameras while leaving the counting hall and declined to say whether her loss was Sunak’s fault, instead saying she was “disappointed”. She said she would “absolutely” be running again before complaining she could not see because of the bright camera lights in her face. A car was waiting for Harrison outside the venue which she swiftly entered as supporters caught up to applaud her before the car drove off. Reform UK achieved its best result in an election so far, winning 13% of the vote, beating the record set about an hour earlier in Kingswood, where the party reached 10% of the vote. Ben Habib, the party’s candidate in Wellingborough, said the result was a staging post for the party’s growth, adding “the world is our oyster”. When asked whether standing would lead to greater Tory losses and hand Labour a stronger mandate to enact policies the party opposes, Habib said: “I’m not into being a weathervane for the Conservative party. I’m not in it to make sure we get minor policy adjustments which suit our view of life. We need a 180 degree handbrake U-turn from the policy direction that the Conservative party has taken and that Labour will frankly continue.” The byelection in Wellingborough was triggered when voters recalled the former Tory MP Peter Bone after he received a six-week suspension from the Commons when an inquiry found he had subjected a staff member to bullying and sexual misconduct. He won the Northamptonshire constituency at every general election from 2005 to 2019, with Labour coming second in four of the five contests and Ukip doing so in 2015. His majority in 2019 was 36%. Bone did not attend Thursday night’s count. There was further controversy after Bone’s partner, Harrison, was selected as the Conservative candidate. High-profile Tory MPs have been absent in the constituency and not a single frontbencher endorsed Harrison. Last month, Rishi Sunak dodged the opportunity to endorse her after he was asked whether he was “proud” she had been selected given her connection to Bone. He said it was up to local members to select their candidate. Harrison stayed firmly out of the spotlight in the run-up to the byelection. She refused all national media interviews and has not posted on the social media platform X since 11 January, when she announced her selection. The result will be welcomed by Keir Starmer, who has had one of his most challenging weeks since becoming Labour leader after two of the party’s parliamentary candidates were suspended in the space of 24 hours over comments relating to Israel. On Wednesday, a Savanta poll had Labour’s lead over the Conservatives down by seven points, its lowest since June 2023. On Sunday, remarks made by Azhar Ali, Labour’s candidate in the Rochdale byelection, surfaced in which he said Israel had deliberately relaxed security before the 7 October Hamas attack after warnings of an imminent threat. After initially backing Ali, Starmer withdrew support for him on Monday evening. Less than 24 hours later, the party suspended Graham Jones, the candidate for Hyndburn, after a recording surfaced of him suggesting world leaders privately bemoaned “fucking Israel”. Speaking before the result, Toby Perkins, the shadow nature and rural affairs minister, said the suspension of Ali and Hyndburn did not come up on the doorstep, adding the win would give the party a lift. Last week, Starmer formally dropped his flagship target of spending £28bn a year on green investment, citing poor economic conditions, despite support for the policy from the public and warnings from business leaders to keep it. Labour last held Wellingborough between 1997 and 2005, losing it in that year’s general election to Bone. During the Tony Blair years Wellingborough was a swing seat. Labour won it in 1997 with a majority of just 187 votes and lost it in 2005 by 687. In recent years the constituency has been a Tory stronghold, with the Conservatives winning with a majority of 18,540 in 2019. For the Conservatives, the loss of another safe seat could prompt long-shot attempts by backbenchers on the right of the party – who are already at odds with the prime minister over the Rwanda bill – to replace Sunak as leader before the next general election.",Byelections; Labour; Keir Starmer; Conservatives; UK news; Local politics; Politics; Northamptonshire,Politics
2024-02-01T17:28:29Z,"To build trust with voters, Keir Starmer must be honest with them | Letters",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/01/to-build-trust-with-voters-keir-starmer-must-be-honest-with-them,"John Harris rightly warns that by trying to demonstrate that Labour has ditched its Corbynite mantle and now wears the smart suit of economic prudence and financial restraint, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves risk achieving just one term in government (Thinking small may get Labour into No 10. It could also stop it staying there, 28 January). By voting for a Labour government, people will be trusting it to tackle their most pressing concerns, such as rising hospital waiting lists, crumbling schools, squalid housing, inability to access social care, and the struggle to cover the cost of even the basic requirements of daily living. The electorate will expect perceptible improvements in these essential services within Labour’s first term in office. The trust that Starmer and Reeves seek is fragile and must be reciprocated. Therefore, in return, Starmer must trust the public and have the courage to be honest with them that in order to meet their expectations there needs to be a significant increase in the level of government spending and a fundamental reform of taxation so that those with the most contribute the most. Starmer knows this, the Labour party knows this, and the public know this. Failure to articulate this will inevitably lead to the trust that voters placed in Labour quickly evaporating. Peter Riddle Wirksworth, Derbyshire • John Harris writes that Rachel Reeves is drifting into a “tight-fisted kind of supply-side economics” which means “that the key to solving the housing crisis is a mere relaxation of planning laws”. The housing crisis isn’t a problem of supply. It’s the domination of housebuilding by commodity production, itself dominated by an oligopoly (the big builders), the huge loss of council homes as a result of the right-to-buy policy, and the abandonment of council housebuilding as a priority. Changing planning rules will not push the oligopoly into building for social need. They build at a scale and pace which maximises their profit. The key to resolving this lies in making social rent council housing the first housing priority, supported by central government grants. The more than 100,000 households in temporary accommodation and 1.2 million on waiting lists are not about to get mortgages. As the experience of the Attlee government shows, when you do what is necessary, you can find the means of paying for it. Just imagine if “getting the debt down” had been applied in 1945. We wouldn’t have been able to afford to build 1m council homes, not to mention launching the NHS. The debt to GDP ratio then was 250% compared with 100% today. I wonder what Aneurin Bevan would have said to that. Martin Wicks Secretary, Labour Campaign for Council Housing • I doubt if John Harris is right to critique the Keir Starmer project as a politics characterised by smallness. Surely what the public wants is a politics where everything is dialled down a notch or two, and Starmer’s steadiness might be excellent for this. A good Labour majority, achieved on a modest agenda, would tone things down. In actual power, Labour would have the advantage of slaying the bogeys of the right, better controlling the wider debate, and starting to diffuse the hysteria that creates paralysis. The electorate is fearful, not least because of world events. A progressive politics requires a less fearful, more reasoned atmosphere, in which people may eventually be able to venture more generous policies. Dr Stefan Hawlin Oxford • John Harris rightly mentions the “barrage of hostility” Labour will face in government from a “coalition of forces”, ranging from the Telegraph to GB News, but doesn’t say how the real “barrage” will start before the election, and will be just as virulent and malicious regardless of the policies in the manifesto. Labour’s “green investment plan”, for instance, will be exaggerated and misinterpreted by the rightwing media, and viewed as unaffordable, if it lasts till then, and Keir Starmer will be accused of lacking consistency and principle if he makes another U-turn and drops it. “Political smallness” is cowardly, but also mistaken as it inevitably leads to the Tories yet again dictating the narrative. We know that the richest 1% in the UK own 36.5% of all financial assets, with a value of £1.8tn, and that most of the CEOs of the top companies earn in excess of a hundred times the amount earned by their average employee. We know too, how economic theories such as Laffer’s curve and trickle-down economics have been debunked by modern economists, and how even during the majority of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, the top rate of income tax was 15% higher than today’s rate, and that it was deemed unfair by her long-serving chancellor, Nigel Lawson, for unearned income to be taxed at a lower rate than earned income. Going on to the front foot and promising to tackle any of these injustices will be popular electorally, and better than meekly reacting to government decisions. Rather than waiting for Jeremy Hunt’s budget, which will inevitably spend the Treasury’s “£20bn windfall” on tax bribes, Labour should publish its own alternative finance bill, spending the money on any of Larry Elliott’s excellent suggestions, or on providing decent pay for junior doctors, nurses and teachers, and those working in the care sector. With the economic multipliers quickly kicking in, the latter would be far cheaper than Tories admit, and prevent the current exodus of key workers continuing. Do voters really prefer having the cost of an extra pint a week to the provision of decent public services for years to come?

Speaking to the Guardian before a speech by his boss, Rachel Reeves, at the Labour conference, Darren Jones said the scale of renewed corporate interest in Labour meant he was spending almost the entire event meeting business leaders. After persistent government chaos and U-turns since Brexit, Jones said multinationals were “just crying out for stability and competence and they’ve not got it”, as they realised Labour was a better bet. “I think businesses started clocking that some time ago, which is why you’re seeing such a big presence of them here,” he said. “My entire schedule for conference this year bar, I think, maybe one or two fringes is engaging with business.” The Bristol North West MP, whose examination of business leaders as chair of the business select committee helped him move to the frontbench in September’s reshuffle, will spend much of this conference reassuring companies about Labour’s fiscal rules, which allow borrowing only to invest, not to improve services. With this has come choices that have dismayed some Labour members, such as refusing to scrap the two-child limit on benefit payments. Jones said such decisions were difficult. “It is insofar as, of course you would want to lift that cap, because it would have an immediate effect for people that need it,” he said. “But it isn’t in the sense that unless we are fiscally responsible with the economy, and unless we have a Labour government, we’re not going to do anything for young people across the country.” This focus means every frontbencher’s speech from the conference main stage will have been vetted in advance by either Jones or Reeves. Jones said that while Treasury teams were sometimes seen as “the blocker for reform”, he hoped to make his role more creative. “My job isn’t just about putting red lines through things that they might want to say,” he said. “It’s about working with those teams to help us get to the right place. Our fiscal rules are fundamental, but we also want to change the country. “There’s this strategic role to being chief secretary as well as being in charge of public spending, which is: how do we get the economy moving? How do we reform public services? How do we deliver capital projects better?” In her speech on Monday, Reeves will announce that Labour’s £8bn “national wealth fund” for green investment will involve projects having to attract at least £3 of private sector investment for every £1 from the fund. This would be, Jones said, a new approach to such projects: “It’s not just a case of saying: ‘Hey, I’d like to build this thing. I’m going to write you a cheque for it.’ That’s not how our investment programme is going to work.” A former technology lawyer before he won his seat in 2017, Jones is particularly keen on using tech, including AI, for “customer service reform” in public services like arranging benefits and school places, arguing this could be a boon to employees as well – potentially even bringing a four-day week. He said: “Because you do you do less of the mundane things, you’re more productive. And if your businesses are more productive, you should be getting better pay. And maybe even in the long run, working a little bit less, if that works out in the right way. So that should be a positive.”",Darren Jones; Labour conference; Labour conference 2023; UK news; Labour; Politics; Economic policy,Politics
2024-01-05T23:00:37Z,"As manifesto deadline day looms, five questions Keir Starmer must answer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/05/five-policy-questions-starmer-needs-to-answer-before-labours-election-campaign-begins,"Ravinder Athwal might have the least enviable job in the Labour party right now. As the party’s director of policy, it is up to Athwal to pull together Labour’s manifesto, a job he has until 8 February to complete. The problem for Athwal and others at the top of the Labour party is that key questions about its policy platform remain unanswered, even after the Labour leader Keir Starmer gave his new year speech earlier this week. So what questions does Athwal – and, more importantly, Starmer – have to answer before the party are ready for the election campaign to come? What to do on green spending? Starmer was clearer than ever on Friday that the pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment was no longer a pledge but instead a “confident ambition”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said last year the target was subject to the party’s rule to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output at the end of a five-year period. But it remained unclear until Starmer spelled it out on Friday that this would mean spending less if the party could not borrow the full amount, rather than finding the money elsewhere. Given the current fiscal headroom is only £13bn, should the party even be talking about the possibility of spending £28bn at all, especially given it has been subject to repeated Conservative attacks? Starmer tried to move away from the spending target on Thursday, talking instead about the party’s plan to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. But some in the party want him to go further and abandon the £28bn altogether. How much to tax? Reports this week suggested Reeves might include a promise to cut either income tax or national insurance in the party’s manifesto. Starmer appeared to pour cold water on such an idea on Thursday when he said he would look to pull “the growth lever” before cutting taxes, although he did not spell out what that would mean. One thing has become clearer, however. Starmer said on Thursday that if the Tories cut inheritance tax before the election, Labour would reverse it if it “got the opportunity to do so”. If the Tories do decide to cut inheritance tax at March’s budget, it would give Starmer room to promise to cancel that and use the money for income tax cuts instead. What to do about the asylum system? For much of the past year Labour has been happy to sit back and let the Conservatives tear themselves apart over the issue of immigration and asylum. The party says it will cancel the Rwanda scheme if it gets into government, but questions remain. The party is reported to be drawing up its own scheme to process asylum claims offshore. But where could they do this? And would it only be for people who haven’t yet reached the UK but want to come here, or could they send claimants abroad once they have already arrived? Starmer has also said he wants to help solve the asylum backlogs by working more closely with France. While the French government might be willing to take more claimants back from the UK, Britain would almost certainly have to sign up to some sort of quota in return. The question then becomes how many migrants Britain is willing to take – a question the Tories intend to focus on heavily during an election campaign. One more dilemma could yet face Labour. If the government successfully send asylum seekers to Rwanda, but the courts then deem the scheme illegal, will a Labour government bring them back home again? Will Labour replace the existing childcare system? Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, made waves last year when she gave a speech promising to scrap the existing childcare funding model and replace it with something entirely new. Phillipson argues the current model means providers having to offer almost entirely free places to millions of children without being given enough money by the government to cover their costs. Many childcare providers say they will go bust under the government’s plans to expand free hours to children aged 9 months and over. Since Phillipson’s speech, however, there has been little indication of what the new system might entail, leading some to speculate that the party is quietly shelving one of its more ambitious reform plans. How will Labour fix the NHS? The NHS uses every winter crisis to call for more money, argued Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, during a recent trip to Singapore. Labour has promised to fund 2m more hospital appointments a year and to double the number of CT and MRI scanners in an effort to get waiting times down. But apart from that, Streeting’s message has been that the health service must do things differently rather than just continuing to demand more money. Labour says one of the central planks of fixing the NHS is boosting social care so that fewer people end up in hospital in the first place, but this will cost money which Labour would need to find from somewhere. Party sources told the Observer last year they were likely to leave the social care reform package out of their manifesto altogether to avoid scrutiny. Doing so, however, might leave a hole in the NHS rescue plan.",Labour; Keir Starmer; Rachel Reeves; NHS; Tax and spending,Politics
2024-02-29T07:15:10Z,Portugal election: who are the key players and what is at stake?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/29/portugal-election-who-are-the-key-players-and-what-is-at-stake,"Voters in Portugal go to the polls on 10 March in a snap election that is expected to result in a hung parliament, with the two main parties, from the centre right and centre left, vying for the lead and a surging far-right populist predicted to collect nearly a fifth of the vote. Why has the election been called? Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, who won an unexpected third consecutive term in January 2022, resigned last November amid an investigation into alleged illegalities in his government’s handling of large green investment projects. The inquiry, into possible “malfeasance, active and passive corruption of politicians and influence peddling”, led to searches of the environment and infrastructure ministries and of Costa’s official residence, and to the arrest of five people including his chief of staff. The five were subsequently released and the investigating magistrate retained only the charge of influence peddling, but prosecutors have appealed against that decision and the men, along with four others including the former infrastructure minister and the head of the environment agency, remain formal suspects. Costa himself, who stayed on in a caretaker capacity, has denied any wrongdoing and said his “conscience is clear”. He is not accused of any crime. When resigning, he said the duties of a prime minister were “not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. Who are the key players? Costa was succeeded in December as head of the ruling Socialist party (PS) by the head of the party’s left wing, Pedro Nuno Santos. A former infrastructure minister, Nuno Santos, 46, was a vital link to far-left parties that had supported a previous Costa minority government but which opposed the 2022 state budget, triggering the last general election. He resigned his ministerial post in late 2022 in a scandal involving a €500,000 severance payment by Portugal’s state-owned airline TAP, which was in the middle of a restructuring plan. The leader of the rival centre-right Social Democratic party (PSD), Luís Montenegro, 51, led its parliamentary group when the party was in government between 2011 and 2015 and imposed severe austerity measures. An MP for more than 20 years, his refusal to entertain an alliance with the far right led him to break with the prime minister of that period, Pedro Passos Coelho. He was elected head of the PSD in May 2022 at his second attempt. André Ventura, 41, is a former television sports commentator who initially entered politics in the ranks of the PSD and first grabbed the nation’s attention when as a candidate for mayor in a town outside Lisbon he denounced the Roma community. He left PSD to launch Chega (Enough) in 2019 and has since propounded a populist, anti-establishment message that has found a fast-growing audience. Chega scored 1.3% of votes in 2019’s election and 7.3% in 2022, when it finished third. Political opponents accuse Chega of frequently resorting to xenophobia, racism and demagoguery. Ventura says his party “touches on issues that interest people”. What are the issues? Corruption ranks high among voter concerns and is a key focus of the far right’s campaign. One Chega billboard reads: “Portugal needs cleaning out.” Besides the investigation that triggered this election, another former Socialist prime minister, José Sócrates, is to stand trial over allegations that he pocketed about €34m (£29m) during his time in power from graft, fraud and money laundering. The PSD also faces corruption allegations, with two prominent party politicians recently forced to resign amid a graft investigation in Madeira. A housing crisis (housing costs have soared during the Socialists’ eight years in government), persistent low pay levels and unreliable public health services are other areas where the records of the two main parties are being challenged. Besides alleged corruption, Chega is campaigning on the kind of issues that have brought the far right electoral and polling success elsewhere in Europe in recent years: immigration, the climate crisis and culture war battles. The PS is promising industrial investment but mainly warning that a vote for anyone else risks letting the far right into power – a strategy that worked for Costa in 2022 when the party won an absolute majority but that does not seem so successful this time round. Who will form the next government? That’s anyone’s guess. Polls put the PSD ahead on about 31% of the vote, just above the PS on 29%. Chega lies in third position on about 18%, with half a dozen smaller parties from left and right projected to score between 1% and 6%. The PSD has linked up with the small conservative CDS-PP party to form Aliança Democratica (AD), and if joined by the pro-business Liberal Initiative (IL) it could have a majority with the backing of Chega. The centre-right party, however, has ruled out an alliance with Chega, which insists it will only support a rightwing government if it is formally part of a coalition. Ventura has suggested that any political instability after the elections would be PSD’s fault. On the left, the PS – which says it will not block a minority rightwing government if the would be participants finish first but without a majority – would aim to forge alliances with the Communist party (PCP-PEV, on 2%) or the Left Bloc (BE, 4%), led by Mariana Mortágua. As things stand, though, neither right nor left has an obvious route to a majority – although after eight years in opposition, analysts suspect the PSD might be tempted to ditch its pledge not to work with Chega if a deal would return it to power. Why does it matter? Portugal, which in April celebrates half a century since its 1974 Carnation Revolution ended almost as many years of authoritarian rule, has so far escaped the rising influence of the far right seen in other EU member states from Finland to Italy. Chega chemical castration for repeat rapists and wants zero tolerance for irregular immigration. It has also said it wants Portugal to have more freedom from the EU to pursue some bilateral economic ties. A strong showing by the far-right party would mark the end of a Portuguese exception. Far-right populists are in ruling coalitions in Italy and Finland and propping up a rightwing government in Sweden. Despite setbacks last year in elections in Spain and Poland, a far-right party is on track to win this autumn in Austria, while Germany’s AfD – although slipping since a recent “mass deportation” scandal – and France’s National Rally (RN) are at polling highs. In European parliament elections in June, radical-right parties are on course to finish first in nine countries including Austria, France and Poland, and second or third in another nine including Germany, Spain, Portugal and Sweden.",Portugal; Europe; World news; The far right,World news
2024-01-04T19:25:52Z,Labour will ‘fight fire with fire’ in general election as vote talk heats up,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/04/labour-will-fight-fire-with-fire-in-general-election-as-vote-talk-heats-up,"Keir Starmer has promised to “fight fire with fire” against Conservative attacks this year, setting up what is likely to be one of the longest and most bruising general election campaigns in recent history. The Labour leader said on Thursday he would not shy away from aggressive campaign tactics, hours after Sunak indicated he was planning to go to the polls in the second half of the year. “If the government want to put fire into their attacks, we will meet their fire with fire, because the stakes at this election are so high for working people,” Starmer told Sky News after his new year speech in Bristol. “They will go low. What I’m saying is if they want to go with fire into this election, we will meet their fire with fire.” Labour and the Conservatives are sharpening their attacks on each other in advance of the campaign to come. On Thursday, Sunak gave his clearest indication yet of the election date, saying it was his “working assumption” that he would call it later in the year , after weeks of speculation that he might do so in May instead. “I want to keep going, managing the economy well and cutting people’s taxes, but I also want to keep tackling illegal migration,” Sunak said. “I’ve got lots to get on with and I’m determined to keep delivering for the British people.” Labour officials dismissed Sunak’s comments as misdirection, insisting they would continue planning for a spring election. “Nothing has changed,” said a senior party official. “Sunak doesn’t want to tie himself in. But if my son told me his working assumption was that he would get his homework done today, I would not take that seriously.” Starmer accused the prime minister of “squatting in Downing Street for months on end, dithering and delaying while the country wants change”. “We’re ready for a general election, I think the country’s ready for a general election,” he told the BBC. “The prime minister is now hinting, without setting a date, that it might be later in the year. What’s he hiding? Why can’t he set a date?” Conservative MPs, however, believe Sunak is serious about waiting until almost the last minute to call a vote that could see him ejected from Downing Street. “I think he’s right to push it,” said one. “Yes, things are likely to get worse in the year to come. But still, you don’t walk into certain death – even if there is the prospect of worse death down the road.” Senior Tory sources said the party had not even yet set a deadline for completing its manifesto, adding further weight to Sunak’s claims to be aiming for an autumn election. Labour enters the election year 18 points ahead in the polls, but with big questions outstanding over how it would govern if elected. Party officials are wrangling over significant policy issues such as whether to remain committed to their pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment by the end of the next parliament. Starmer defended the party’s green credentials on Thursday, but admitted the £28bn pledge would be at risk if it stopped Labour bringing down government debt levels. He added that the party’s main ambition was to decarbonise Britain’s power sector by 2030, though experts doubt whether that can be achieved without the scale of public investment the party has previously promised. The Labour leader added that his government would bring hope to a “downtrodden” country, adding: “To truly defeat this miserabilist Tory project, we must crush their politics of divide and decline with a new Project Hope.” His later comments about the tone of the campaign, however, hint at the intensity of the political attacks that are likely to feature prominently during the year to come. Starmer said in his speech he expected the Conservatives to unleash a “gauntlet of fear” before the election. The Tories have been poring over Starmer’s record as a human rights lawyer and director of public prosecution for material to use against him. Recent press stories have focused on how Starmer acted for the radical cleric Abu Qatada in his 2008 bid to avoid deportation to Jordan, and how he defended a convicted arsonist accused of terrorising his family. The Conservatives have also been keen to highlight issues of culture and identity, including asylum and trans rights, in an effort to put Labour on the wrong side of public opinion. Meanwhile Starmer has defended a Labour advertisement last year which accused Sunak of not supporting the incarceration of adults convicted of sexually abusing children. David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, described that attack as “gutter” politics. The attacks have become so intense that Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, recently called for political leaders to avoid divisive tactics. “We have to say: ‘My opponent is never my enemy. My opponent is always my fellow human being. We disagree profoundly, we disagree on incredibly important things, but they’re human,’” he told the BBC in December. Starmer will now spend the next few weeks touring the country holding question-and-answer sessions in a series of mid-sized towns as he takes his pitch to the country, while Sunak will hold a similar event on Friday in the north-west.",Labour; Conservatives; Keir Starmer; Rishi Sunak; Politics; UK news; General elections,Politics
2024-02-04T08:00:40Z,Mathieu Flamini: ‘Football needs to stand up for climate change’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/04/mathieu-flamini-football-needs-to-stand-up-for-climate-change,"“To make a hamburger – just one burger – takes what to make?” Mathieu Flamini, elite footballer turned biochemical entrepreneur, asks the question. The answer, it turns out, is 2,000 litres of water. “Insane,” he says. The passion, the elan previously shown in midfield for Marseille, Arsenal over two spells and Milan is in full flow as the Frenchman presents his designs for life. Flamini, who eats once a day, sips hot water in a Soho vegan cafe as he espouses the benefits of an environmentally friendly lifestyle. “Climate and health are related,” he says. Turning 40 next month, he last played top-level football for Getafe in 2019 but still talks and looks like an athlete. He is also a partner in GFBiochemicals, a leader in sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, with levulinic acid replacing fossil fuels ingredients in everyday products. Swapping renewables for fossil fuels is big business and Flamini was on the ground floor, starting up the business in 2008 soon after joining Milan. The company now works with multinationals seeking to decarbonise. A long road lies ahead towards worldwide safe levels of carbon. “Climate change is being ignored,” he says. “If we talk about countries like India and China, people can’t exercise outdoors any more. Do we want to get there? “Plastic? It is everywhere in the sea. Even if I don’t care about the environment, babies are being born with microplastic in their organs. We cannot ignore it.” He believes football can play its part in averting the environmental catastrophes that threaten the planet. Football? The sport of private jets, fast cars, air-miles-busting transcontinental tournaments and petrodollar-funded club ownership? The sport where Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, has partnered with Saudi Arabia and where Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, is set to sponsor the governing body for $100m a year? Yes, football. Flamini is a frontman for Green Football Weekend, an initiative held this weekend – Sky Sports swapping their yellow for green, the BBC and TNT involved, too – that addresses the grassroots, involving schools in delivering the message that eating vegetarian food is helpful to the environment. Fans can download a cookbook featuring a Raheem Sterling cauliflower, potato and spinach curry recipe the Observer is told is particularly tasty. That eating vegetarian more often – though not necessarily exclusively – can counter the high level of carbon byproduct from mass-produced meat is a leading message. Small changes eventually equating to giant steps is the strategy. “We need to empower people,” says Flamini. “Climate change is a big and scary topic. If you are told you must save the world, you feel useless as an individual. You must break it down, tell them how they get impacted by pollution and plastics, with everyday things like shampoo and shower gel coming from fossil fuels. If you multiply people making a change by billions then you can make a big impact.” One of the campaign’s aims is to depolarise the issues of climate change that, to take the UK as an example, have become bogged down in battlegrounds such as London’s ultra-low emission zone, low-traffic neighbourhoods and Labour’s on-off pledge of £28bn on green investment. Throwing the issue back to football takes the edge off the spikiness and the UK game has not been immune to climate change, considering flooding has severely affected schedules in the lower divisions this winter. “Our game is being affected but we are not blaming anyone here,” says Flamini. “We are bringing the table out and trying to make sense. Football – and sport – is one of the last things we have that can unite people, can address everyone, from rich to poor, people from every part of the world. Football needs to stand up for climate change. What can they do? Start finding solutions. Offsetting carbon is one of those solutions. But it’s the minimum.” With men’s World Cups in North America in 2026, across three continents in 2030 and in Saudi Arabia in 2034, Flamini, on the environmental committee for the Paris 2024 Olympics, has more than a few ideas for the organisers. “Sourcing food locally, vegetarian options for the athletes and the fans, avoiding plastics, using products made more sustainably than from fossil fuels, trying to reduce transport. It’s about integrating all those solutions into planning. It’s a journey.” His own path includes giving up pescetarianism when the Arsenal doctor Gary O’Driscoll showed him high levels of mercury in his monthly blood tests; a Marseille childhood and a passion for diving had already told him the Mediterranean was full of pollutants. He freely admits he drove a sports car in the fleet of Ferraris that pulled into the Milanello training ground. “Take a young kid who has grown up in a difficult area, and didn’t always have food on the table, and imagine that the poor kid becomes a very rich athlete. That kid had a dream to play in front of hundreds of thousands of people and that became reality. He also had a picture of a sports car on his wall, it is very difficult to tell this kid he can’t achieve that dream, too. “The footballer will probably have a sports car but he can do other things, like become a vegan, or offset his carbon, or create awareness through his platform. Maybe later he’ll get an electric car.” For Flamini, the Eurostar now takes the strain of a hectic business life shared between London and Paris for a previous private jet frequent flier. A commitment to the environment can make everyone hypocrites. “What if you have family in New York?” he says. “You cannot tell people to take the boat but when people have the choice, we want them to take the green option.” If his approach to changing opinions in football and the wider business world is largely conciliatory and commercially minded he retains an admiration for the direct-action activism of Greta Thunberg and her ilk. “It’s inspiring,” he says. “At 12 or 13 I was kicking a football around. It’s a message of hope and if you push the message to corporations – to football – those kids are the consumers of tomorrow. Guys, it’s time to change.”",Football; Sport; Climate crisis; Environment,Football
2024-02-15T09:00:03Z,"Why is Labour still using the self-defeating, discredited ‘maxed out credit card’ analogy? | Yanis Varoufakis",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/15/labour-credit-card-analogy-mendacious-tory,"Rarely has a lacklustre policy been abandoned for a reason so bad that it threatens to inflict long-term damage on a society. Independently of whether the £28bn green investment programme was the right policy for the next Labour government to commit to, Rachel Reeves’s reasons for ditching it were an undeserved gift to the Tories and a partial vindication of their disgraceful flirtations with an austerian, anti-green political narrative. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today shortly after her U-turn on Labour’s headline £28bn green transition programme, the shadow chancellor explained her decision by claiming that, under Jeremy Hunt, the Treasury is “planning on maxing out the credit card”, adding for good effect that the Tories are “maxing out the headroom ahead of the next general election” thus limiting “what an incoming Labour government will be able to achieve”. By comparing the state’s coffers to an overladen credit card, Reeves endorsed an insidious fallacy. If we owe George Osborne anything, it is irrefutable empirical evidence that using the analogy of a credit card for a nation’s budget (along with inane “belt tightening” and “fixing the roof when it is sunny” metaphors) is a terrible basis for prudent fiscal policy. It is true that the Tories will leave scorched earth behind for the next government, with a budget dripping in red ink and a pitiful level of investment in the technologies and services the UK needs to escape a long-term slump. But this is precisely the reason why Labour must reject the austerian urges that, inevitably, spring from the credit card analogy. When your credit card is “maxed out”, you do indeed need immediately to tighten your belt. The reason why parsimony works for you, and helps limit your debt, is that you are blessed with an income that is independent of what you decide to spend money on. In other words, if you don’t buy the shoes or new phone you covet, your income will not diminish, and so your deficit will shrink reliably. But the state’s budget is nothing like a credit card. As chancellor of the exchequer, your (tax) income is highly dependent on your (public) spending. Limit your spending and you have limited your income too. This is why the more Osborne slashed public spending in the 2010s, the more money he needed to borrow. By adopting the “maxed credit card” narrative, Reeves endorsed Osborne’s flawed logic and, indirectly, absolved the Tories for the wanton damage they have inflicted on a generation of Britons. Austerity, and the credit card analogy that provides its thin veneer of logic, is not just bad for workers and people in desperate need of state support during tough times; it also depresses investment. By hastening the stagnation of a society’s aggregate income, it signals to businesses that they would be mad to put money into building up the capacity to produce the output that society is too impecunious to buy. That’s how austerity undermined investment in Britain and that’s how it will annul Labour’s ambition to draw in private green investments, now that Reeves has ditched her modest green public investment plan, replacing it with wishful thinking that the private sector will, magically, make up the difference. But none of this means that the ditched £28bn policy was optimal or, indeed, that an incoming chancellor can safely commit the Treasury to borrow and spend unlimited amounts. The difficulty that any British government faces today is that, since President Biden inaugurated his expansive green transition spending spree (improbably labelled the Inflation Reduction Act), the UK is caught up in a subsidy war between the US, China and, to some extent, Germany and France. This is a multitrillion-dollar subsidy contest that the UK cannot win and, thus, should not enter. In this context, were it to be spent as planned (ie, as Inflation Reduction Act-like subsidies for private business), Labour’s £28bn would be a mere drop in the ocean, incapable of diverting the torrent of capital rushing into the US and China. If subsidies are a fool’s wager when competing with the US, whose central bank mints the world’s reserve currency, what should Britain do? Having dropped the fantasy that subsidies can attract battery manufacturers and microchip producers to the UK in numbers consistent with a British green industrial revolution, a Labour government should do two things. Set aside a modest sum (say, £6bn) to subsidise energy conservation and, critically, found a public investment bank to inject green investments into green tech enterprises directly (private or public) to the tune of up to 3% of national income annually. These large sums can be raised, not through Treasury bonds that need to be repaid by taxpayers, but by bonds issued by a new public investment bank – to be repaid from the proceeds of the green enterprises they fund. The Bank of England could also help with an announcement: if the price of these green bonds were to fall below a certain point, it would buy them second-hand – even while selling off its stock of Treasury bonds. This mere announcement would ensure it would not need actually to buy them because investors would rush in to snap them up, thus leaving Britain’s public debt servicing costs unaffected. In 1942, John Maynard Keynes proclaimed: “Let us not submit to the vile doctrine of the 19th century that every enterprise must justify itself in pounds, shillings and pence of cash income … Assuredly we can afford this and so much more. Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” Britain’s conundrum, today, is that the next government, whose job will be to fix the Tories’ mess, is led by politicians who share neither Keynes’s aims nor his innovative approach to public finance. Judging by Reeves’s recent performance, they seem to care more about the fiscal hawks in their midst and in the Tory press. So much so that, to prove their mettle as bona fide austerians, they adopt the most pernicious allegory to have disgraced economic thinking.

2024-03-15T16:43:43Z,This Tory long goodbye is toxic for the country – and making Labour’s job ever harder | Jonathan Freedland,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/15/tory-country-labour-general-election,"We’re at the fag-end of this government, but it’s going to burn for a while longer yet. Those who hoped it might finally be stubbed out of its misery on 2 May were set straight by Rishi Sunak on Thursday, when he killed off speculation that he might add to the clutch of local elections scheduled for that day by calling a general one. The long wait for this government to be flattened under the voters’ collective shoe goes on. We’ve lived through fag-end administrations before, but this one is more toxic. Back in the dog days of the John Major era, it was bonking backbenchers and brown-envelope cash for questions that pointed to the political terminus. This time, the rot is graver. We have a prime minister who took more than 24 hours to concede that comments made by the party’s biggest donor – suggesting Diane Abbott be “shot”, and that the Hackney North MP made you “want to hate all black women” – were, in fact, racist. Until then, it seems, Downing Street accepted the health tech magnate Frank Hester’s insistence that citing Abbott when speaking about hating people who are female and black “had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin”. Still, the belated admission has come with no promise to return the £10m Hester is confirmed to have given, nor the reported additional donation of £5m. The Tory position seems to be: guilty of making racist remarks he might be, but Hester’s money is good and we’re clinging to it. What secret trysts and Paris Ritz hotel bills were to the Major years, race and racism are to the last days of Sunak. On Thursday, Michael Gove unveiled a new definition of extremism, by which he hopes to target neo-Nazi groups and organisations with what he called “Islamist orientation and beliefs”. His move comes just as the Tory right has spotted a culture war opportunity in exploiting anti-Muslim sentiment, casting Labour as either too weak in the face of, or even in thrall to, Islamist extremism. Lee Anderson’s defection to Reform, after he said the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamist “mates”, has led some Conservatives to conclude there is a risk of being overtaken on the Islamophobic right – and that that is a constituency that needs to be fed. In this climate, it’s hardly surprising that the government is moving to offer people denied asylum up to £3,000 to “encourage” them to move to Rwanda, a scheme that, to quote the Labour peer Stewart Wood, suggests “a government that is so determined to nail the people traffickers that it has decided to subsidise them”. The same elements recur: a governing party whose time is running out and that has concluded, in its desperation, that the last seam of votes to be mined is among those who demand an ever harsher face be turned toward refugees and minorities. The longer this goes on, the worse it is for the country. While governments in their death throes might not be able to do much good – announcing long-term plans they will never implement – they can do much harm. But this period is also bad for Labour. Roy Jenkins’ Yoda-like advice to the young Obi Wan-KenoBlair in the mid-1990s has now become weary through overuse, but it remains true: an opposition leader with a hefty poll lead is like a man carrying a priceless Ming vase across a polished floor. That task is already hard and Keir Starmer has been at it for at least 18 months, since Tory support cratered after the Partygate revelations, the ousting of Boris Johnson and the debacle of Liz Truss. By ruling out 2 May, Sunak has made that walk across the shiny floor that much longer. It’s messing with Labour heads. They have three or four different versions of “the grid”, where they schedule key policy announcements and the like, one for each potential election date. “It’s mind-mushing,” says one close Starmer adviser. But the problems are more substantial than mere timetabling. For one thing, the longer this goes on, the more time the Conservatives have to steal what might have otherwise been defining campaign pledges for Labour. Labour cherished its extension of the windfall tax on the fossil fuel companies and had made its tax on non-doms totemic. In his budget last week, Jeremy Hunt nicked both. Worse, the long goodbye to the Tories requires Labour to maintain the posture it has to adopt before every election – constant reassurance on those areas the party defines as its “core brand weaknesses”, namely the economy, national security and, more recently added, borders and immigration – for so long, the muscles start to ache. In its quest to prove fiscal prudence, Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have already announced the halving of what had been billed as Labour’s big idea: an annual £28bn of green investment. The trouble is, the longer the election isn’t called, the more reassurance Reeves has to provide. Witness her response to that act of political larceny by Hunt. Reeves said that she would find the £2bn she had planned to take off non-doms to spend on the NHS and school breakfast clubs – and which Hunt diverted instead to a cut in national insurance – by cutting other spending. She couldn’t oppose Hunt’s NI cut; nor could she propose another tax in its place. The god of pre-election fiscal rectitude, devotion to which was forged by the experience of serial Labour defeat, demanded she shrink her spending plans instead. And it can push even a trained, experienced economist such as Reeves to hint, as she did this month, at the old Thatcherite catechism that managing the public finances is like balancing the books in a household budget – a notion that enrages Keynesian social democrats who know that sometimes it makes sense for governments, unlike families, to spend their way out of a crisis. The result is that Starmer and Reeves spend a lot of time telling voters what they won’t be able to do rather than what they will, the latter just last weekend explaining that a Labour government would not be able to “turn things around straight away”. I truly understand this need for reassurance, but it does come at a cost. Voters know the country is in desperate need of investment, massively and urgently. They know there is so much that doesn’t work or is cracking under the strain, whether its GP surgeries or the courts, mental health services or the transport system. When they hear Labour talk so cautiously when the situation is so severe, they either end up hoping that the party is lying just to get through till polling day – and that, once in office, they might do a Joe Biden and spend much more than they promised – or they give up hoping altogether. It’s true that for Labour to win an election, it’s more important to generate trust among doubters than enthusiasm among supporters. I see that. But, if Labour does win, it will also need a mandate to act. If it keeps paring back an already modest offer in the name of reassurance, eventually there will be nothing left. It desperately needs this fag-end period to end. Election day cannot come soon enough – for Labour’s sake and the country’s.

2024-02-14T14:15:39Z,Labour’s cynical handling of the Azhar Ali affair will come back to haunt it in government,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/14/labour-azhar-ali-rochdale-byelection,"Keir Starmer’s team attempted to rescue the political career of a 7 October “truther”, because he belonged to his faction. Cut out all the noise, and this is the core of the scandal involving Labour’s belatedly disowned candidate Azhar Ali in Rochdale. Ali had, after all, told Labour members that Israel “deliberately took the security off” to knowingly allow the 7 October attack to happen to “give them the green light to do whatever they bloody want”. When these comments were leaked to a newspaper, Ali apologised, which the Labour leadership presented as a retraction and thus the matter was settled. This is an insult to any reasonable person’s intelligence. After much uproar and further comments emerged, Labour belatedly withdrew support from his candidacy. This is an episode that offers profound lessons about the leader’s operation. Starmer told broadcasters that he had taken “decisive action” by withdrawing support for Ali. The facts tell us otherwise. Hours after this apology, shadow cabinet minister Lisa Nandy was dispatched to campaign alongside him. Meanwhile, her colleague Nick Thomas-Symonds took to the airwaves to make a passionate case of mitigation. He emphasised how apologetic Ali was, even making a plea for sympathy on the grounds that “people can get things very wrong” and that the candidate had fallen for an “online conspiracy theory and that does not represent his view”. The former Labour MP Louise Ellman condemned Ali’s “outrageous and deeply offensive conspiracy theories”, but added she had “known Azhar for over 20 years and he consistently supported me when I was subjected to antisemitic attacks”. Here was an obvious operation by the Labour leadership to retain Ali as an officially backed candidate. It was only after protracted uproar and further leaked comments – where Ali was overheard accusing “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” of inflating claims of antisemitism – that Starmer was left with no option but to abandon the candidate. The double standard here isn’t subtle. If Ali had been a man of the left, the leadership would have booted him, not only immediately, but with relish, and furiously denounced him in the process. The contrast with leftwinger Andy McDonald – a bete noire of the leadership after he resigned from the shadow cabinet in protest at Starmer’s reneged policy pledges in 2021 – is itself revealing. McDonald’s offence was declaring at a Gaza protest: “We won’t rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea can live in peaceful liberty.” This was a plea for peaceful coexistence. The claim that “between the river and the sea, Palestine will be free” is racist is passionately rebutted by supporters of Palestinian emancipation – it should be noted that the founding charter of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party declares: “Between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.” But in any case, McDonald clearly used a formulation emphasising inclusivity, yet was immediately suspended. Fellow leftwinger Kate Osamor similarly had the whip withdrawn after describing Gaza as a genocide, the very day on which the international court of justice ruled that it was “plausible” Israel’s actions could be classed as such. Both of these cases involve entirely defensible positions, and neither McDonald nor Osamor can credibly be accused of antisemitism. Ali’s case is of an entirely different order. His defenders point to his immediate apology and retraction, but the lack of credibility aside, leftwinger Diane Abbott also offered an immediate apology and retraction for comments she made in a letter to the Observer. But no one around Starmer sought to read her comments charitably and she was suspended immediately. Her suspension has lasted 10 months with an investigation into her comments clearly in the long grass. The truth is, Starmer’s team are simply aching for excuses to boot out leftwingers. When former leader Jeremy Corbyn was purged for his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism, Starmer’s allies boasted it was a “clause IV” moment – that is, an excuse to define the party against the left. That has nothing to do with antisemitism at all. Indeed, Martin Forde – commissioned by Starmer to investigate claims of racism and sexism in the party – said in reference to his report that one of his enduring concerns was the way in which antisemitism was weaponised “along factional lines”. Starmer’s delay in suspending Ali shows a clear factional double standard – which Forde warned the party must avoid to be taken seriously on anti-racism. Starmer has so far avoided many hard questions because of his polling lead. But the brutal truth is that he could not have been a luckier general. He secured the leadership by offering a leftwing political prospectus he swiftly discarded, yet suffered no political consequences for doing so. The Tories’ comprehensive self-immolation – from Partygate, to Liz Truss’s calamitous economic experiment, to a considerable squeeze in living standards – has gifted him the next general election. But while a large majority remains probable, it may well be team Starmer’s obsession with crushing the left that hobbles them in government. As veteran journalist Michael Crick notes, the desire to parachute only ultra-loyalists into parliamentary seats has left candidates of questionable quality, as Ali’s shockingly conspiracist comments underline. It must be remembered with a wry smile that, back in 2021, a Labour source justified the rampant exclusion of leftwing candidates with: “This isn’t factional. We just aren’t insulting voters with piss poor candidates any more.” That parliamentary candidate Graham Jones – a staunch leadership loyalist – has been suspended for opposing Britons joining Israel’s army is absurd. But Starmer has now dug a hole big enough that his own cheerleaders will begin to fall into it. The obsession of Labour’s ruling faction with defining themselves against the left leaves them bereft of a clear vision, underlined by their junking of their flagship £28bn-a-year green investment pledge. The Labour establishment – so scarred by their period in retreat during the Corbyn years – have been in triumphant mood after securing their absolute factional victory over the left of the party.

2023-10-10T16:53:04Z,Key points from Keir Starmer’s speech at the Labour conference,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/10/five-key-points-from-keir-starmers-speech,"In what could be his final conference speech before the next election, Keir Starmer has set out his case for why voters should back Labour to run the country. Here are the key points he made: The protester Starmer was just a few words into his speech when he was confronted with a protester scattering glitter and shouting incoherently towards the microphone. It gave the Labour leader a chance to shed his jacket, brush himself off and deliver the well-judged line: “Protest or power, that is why we changed our party.” The contrast between the protester and the Labour leader who believes he was heading for power was so perfect that one observer joked it must have been staged. Israel The first standing ovation the Labour leader received was not something about tackling the climate crisis, building more houses or spending more on the NHS. It was for his insistence that “Israel must always have the right to defend her people”. Labour party officials could not have hoped for a better symbol of how much the party has changed since it was riven by accusations of antisemitism. The pebble-dashed semi Starmer was under pressure to show more of his own personality, to talk more about how he had come from a relatively humble background to become a successful barrister, director of public prosecutions and now Labour leader. He did not do much of that, but he did find a way to update some of his stock phrases to present them in a more lighthearted way. “I’m trying really hard not to mention the house that I grew up in again,” he said, to laughter. “But seriously, that pebble-dashed semi was everything to my family.” An appeal to Tory voters Starmer’s most pressing electoral challenge is to persuade people who voted Conservative in 2019 not just to abstain at the next election, but to switch to Labour. To that extent he made a direct appeal to Tory voters: Labour will fight for the union, will defend family life, will keep taxes down and will be pro-business. After the speech, Labour spinners sent out a series of congratulatory quotes from business, almost all of which came from the housing industry. Bashing the Conservatives The corollary of the above section was a series of often brutal attacks on Rishi Sunak and his party. These included the humorous, with Starmer saying that after Sunak’s year inside No 10, “I’m beginning to see why Liz Truss won”. But he also warned of a Tory party “that has so completely severed its relationship with the future, that is prepared to scorch the earth just to get at us – they will be dangerous”. The scale of the task A repeated refrain of recent Labour speeches, Starmer argued that as prime minister he would face a tougher task than Tony Blair, because as well as fixing a 1997-style decline in public services he also needed to channel Harold Wilson’s mission to modernise the economy in an era of change, and Clement Attlee’s 1945 imperative to build a new Britain “out of the trauma of collective sacrifice”. He added: “In 2024 it will have to be all three.” The cost of living crisis In one of the more personal sections, Starmer again touched on his own background to reminisce about meeting a woman who is a single mother while on a family holiday in the Lake District this year. He said the woman told him she was in “survival mode” due to financial pressures, with no scope to think about the future. Starmer added: “I could see the hurt in her eyes as she told me. That’s what this cost of living crisis does – it intrudes on the little things we love, whittles away at our joy.” Climate mission There were no major new policy announcements in the speech, but Starmer’s full-throated defence of Labour’s climate policies marked a change in tone. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has already scaled back the party’s promise to spend £28bn on green investment, while Starmer has insisted that Labour’s clean-air policies should not appear “on each and every Tory leaflet”. This had led some in the Labour party to believe that Starmer and Reeves might ditch their green plans altogether. Doing so would be much harder however after Tuesday’s speech.",Keir Starmer; Labour; Labour conference; Labour conference 2023; Politics; UK news,Politics
2023-11-25T19:00:02Z,"Britain needs a growth plan, not magical thinking | Observer editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/25/the-observer-view-on-the-magical-thinking-behind-jeremy-hunts-autumn-statement,"Jam today, austerity after the next election – that was the thrust of the chancellor’s heavily trailed autumn statement last week. As expected, Jeremy Hunt announced tax cuts that the country can ill afford. But despite his claims to be focused on the long term, he is paying for these cuts by raiding the money that should be reserved for public services after the next election to help them cope with rising inflation. If this further round of spending cuts is imposed, it will blight the lives of the people who disproportionately rely on Britain’s public infrastructure – children from disadvantaged backgrounds, older people with care needs, women suffering domestic abuse. It will also continue to suppress the country’s future growth prospects, perpetuating the austerity fallacy that cutting public spending makes good economic sense despite the fact that it inevitably shrinks future tax revenues. Hunt could claim to have the money for these tax cuts because of the illusory impact of inflation, and its effect on nominal wages. Higher-than-expected inflation has driven nominal wage growth as employees seek to minimise the impact of the rising cost of living. These higher wages lead to a higher forecast tax take-up over the next three years. Hunt has spent virtually all of this forecast windfall on two big tax cuts: 2p in the rate of national insurance for employees (1p for the self-employed) and making permanent the full expensing of plant and machinery investment – meaning that businesses can claim back as tax relief anything they spend on this in the same tax year. The telltale sign that these are illusory gains, delivered as a result of inflation rather than real economic growth, is that, despite wages increasing and delivering a nominal windfall to the exchequer, this is the first parliament over which average living standards are forecast to decrease; households will on average be £1,900 poorer by the end of this parliament compared to December 2019. Weekly earnings are not expected to recover to their 2008 level until 2028, an unprecedented two decades after the financial crisis. This cash should rightfully have been channelled towards public spending, to help the public sector meet the rising costs of inflation. By diverting it to tax reductions, Hunt is loading a further round of painful real-term spending cuts on to public services after the next election. Analysis from the Resolution Foundation shows that outside the protected areas of health, education, overseas aid and defence, this would mean real-terms per-person public spending falling by 14% a year between 2022-23 and 2027-28. To put that in context, the equivalent amount cut by George Osborne during the coalition government amounted to 15% per person per year. The difference between then and now is that our public services are already in a fundamental state of disrepair thanks to 13 years of neglect by Conservative chancellors. NHS waiting lists are at record highs; some school buildings are crumbling and the attainment gap between poor and more affluent children is again widening; children’s services and adult social care for older and disabled people simply cannot meet needs; and cuts to policing and the broader criminal justice system mean it can take years for even serious crimes to reach trial, if they do at all. Moreover, despite the tax-cutting boasts, the figures show that as a result of “fiscal drag” – whereby growing numbers of people are pulled into higher tax brackets because thresholds do not rise with inflation and an anaemic economy – the tax burden as a share of GDP is going up. And Hunt’s giveaway disproportionately benefits the better-off – about 80% of the gains of the national insurance cut go to the most affluent half of households. If the chancellor were going to distribute cash ahead of the next election, it should have been targeted at disabled people and low-paid parents with children, who have suffered significant reductions to tax credits and benefits over the past decade. Hunt’s illusion has left a nasty political trap for Labour if they win the next election. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending; if Labour sticks to that promise it will have to fund any additional spending through tax rises. She has said that Labour will provide extra funding for public services through the rising tax receipts from economic growth. But the gamble here is how will Labour drive growth while the state of NHS waiting lists, adult skills provision and support for children falling behind will act as such a firm brake on the economy? This will be compounded by a fall in public investment that dwarfs the increase in business investment driven by full expensing; Labour’s promise to borrow to channel £28bn a year in green investment by 2027 does not come close to making up that gap. Short of an economic miracle, no one expects any government, Conservative or Labour, to be able to stick to the spending envelope outlined by Hunt. It is magical thinking, and magical thinking from which there is little electoral incentive for Labour to deviate. Voters deserve a return to a politics that is honest about the trade-offs we face as a country: without funding to improve our public infrastructure, Britain will long be locked into a painfully low-growth future.",Autumn statement 2023; Tax; Austerity; Public finance; UK news; National insurance; Money; Public sector cuts; Jeremy Hunt; Economics,Opinion
2024-01-12T16:32:12Z,"Vote for SNP if you believe in Scottish independence, Humza Yousaf says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/12/vote-snp-scottish-independence-humza-yousaf-says,"Voters who believe in independence must vote for the Scottish National party in the coming general election, Humza Yousaf has said in a direct appeal to wavering supporters. Earlier this week, in his first major speech of the new year, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, urged independence supporters to defect from the SNP to “boot the Tories out” of Downing Street. But the SNP leader, launching his party’s general election campaign in Glasgow on Friday, had a blunt message for those whom polls indicate are drifting towards Labour: “If you believe decisions about Scotland should be taken in Scotland – if you believe in independence – then you must vote SNP. If you want to see an independent Scotland, you have to get out and vote for it.” Yousaf said Keir Starmer “doesn’t need Scotland to win the election”. This has been a consistent Labour argument, with Starmer himself describing the party’s victory over the SNP at the Rutherglen and Hamilton byelection last October as a “milestone” on its route back to Downing Street. The SNP leader said “Scotland does need SNP MPs to make sure we aren’t ignored,” and that his politicians would “keep [Starmer] honest”. Telling assembled MPs, MSPs and activists that Rishi Sunak was “done” and claiming it was clear that Starmer would be the next prime minister, he offered to “work constructively” with a Labour government to prevent backsliding on green investment or the creeping privatisation of the NHS. Countering Sarwar’s pledge that electing more Labour MPs would “maximise Scottish influence”, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, said that any Scottish Labour MPs elected would “take independence off the table” as soon as they got to the Commons. Yousaf set his party an ambitious target of winning all six Tory seats at the forthcoming general election, which Sunak has suggested could take place in the autumn, in order “to wipe the Tories from Scotland’s electoral map”. He added that, in more than half of the SNP-held seats, it was the Tories who were in second place. Yousaf said: “So to people right across the country, our message will be very clear: vote SNP for a Scotland free from Tory MPs.” Regardless of his certainty about a Labour victory, the SNP leader said Labour and Tories were “offering more of the same”. He added: “History has shown us that the only certainty of a Labour government is that it will be followed by another Tory government. Scotland needs more than just a brief respite from the damage of Tory rule.” While urging activists in the room to “work harder than ever to ensure Scotland gains her independence”, he offered no concrete sense of how independence would be achieved, beyond the multifaceted and – according to some senior SNP politicians – over-complicated strategy passed at party conference last October. The conference agreed that, if the SNP wins a majority of Scotland’s seats at the general election, it will have the mandate to negotiate independence with the UK government, but this does not address the likely scenario of a continued block on a second referendum from Westminster. He told reporters after the launch: “If you want the independence cause to be advancing, then the SNP should be winning … if that’s not the case, then those who oppose independence will say that’s a mandate for further Westminster control.” Both Yousaf and Flynn also urged Sunak to recall parliament to allow for debate on UK military action in Yemen, and reiterated calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Challenges for the SNP heading into a general election 1. UK Labour’s electability With polls indicating that Scottish Labour and the SNP are toe-to-toe in Westminster voting intention, focus groups suggest that Sarwar’s increasingly direct appeals to independence supporters are working. Sarwar and Starmer’s message is simple enough: now is the time for Scottish voters to unite, regardless of previous differences over independence or Brexit, and vote for change. In contrast, after 16 years in government in Edinburgh and with voters’ once cast-iron belief in SNP competence dwindling amid crumbling public services, Yousaf is struggling to offer a similarly appealing story. 2. Voters are in no hurry for independence While the Scottish government continues to publish its series of papers setting out the updated case for independence, these are increasingly prone to accusations of fantasy, while voters make it plain that even though supportive of separation in the long term they want politicians’ immediate focus to be on the cost of living crisis. This sea change in Scottish politics over the last year or so, as voters decouple their constitutional preference from party preference for the first time since the 2014 referendum, is a serious headache for SNP strategists. The multi-pronged independence strategy agreed at SNP conference offers little to counter the continuing hard fact that a second referendum requires the agreement of the UK government. 3. Taxing the rich? Yousaf’s political rivals are already taking every opportunity to attack him on tax. The Scottish Tories are warning of brain-drain after the new tax band for higher earners introduced in December’s draft budget. Scottish Labour has asked how progressive it is that anyone earning more than £29,000 in Scotland already pays more tax than they would in England and Wales while council tax remains frozen, benefiting those with larger properties while starving councils of funding for services that low earners rely upon. If Jeremy Hunt reduces income tax rates in England and Wales as expected in his spring statement, the tax gap north of the border may widen further. The SNP government argues these tax increases will help offset the effects of real-terms funding cuts in Westminster’s block grant for Scotland, but with deep cuts announced in the budget across sectors, this will be a tough sell. 4. Police inquiry into SNP finances It may have been out of the headlines in recent months, but Operation Branchform, the Police Scotland investigation into claims that the party misspent £600,000 of donations, is yet to conclude. Already the subject of countless memes, the image of the forensic tent in former party leader Nicola Sturgeon’s garden – and the suspicion of at best mismanagement and at worst criminal wrongdoing – is likely to figure on plenty of campaign material. The effect is not only on voters: the party has also struggled to persuade stalwart activists, usually the backbone of its campaigning, to knock on doors, with many disillusioned by the fallout.",Humza Yousaf; Scottish National party (SNP); Labour; Scottish politics; Politics; Scotland; UK news,Politics
2023-07-25T05:00:31Z,The Tories have laid a ‘cut the green crap’ trap for Keir Starmer. He must not fall for it | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/25/tories-cut-green-trap-keir-starmer-policies-bills-labour,"Perversely, a spectacular week for Labour somehow ended up with an assault on the party’s green policies, amid hints of internal wobbling. Despite a record Labour trouncing of a Tory majority in Selby and Ainsty, a 7% swing to Labour in Uxbridge and South Ruislip became a story about Labour in trouble, over a seat not even won in Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide. Labour always struggles to make its narrative heard against the wall of sound from the massed foghorns of the Tory media, but the party needs more nimbleness to duck being defined by the enemy. Keir Starmer’s public rebuke to Sadiq Khan to “reflect” on his Ulez policy was a badly pitched red-on-red news story. Instead, they should have publicly agreed more generous car-scrappage schemes so that the cost of cleaning up child-killing pollution doesn’t have to fall on lower-paid drivers. Having also lost a council seat in Cambridge this month to a Conservative who stood on a platform of fighting a proposed congestion charge, Labour knows its green policies need to fall fairly on the broadest shoulders. Instead, it has allowed the Uxbridge result to distract from an electoral success that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. Those around Starmer swear there is no green wobbling: if there was any briefing to the Murdoch press against Ed Miliband’s greenery, it must have come from some strutting loose-lipped junior. But the gossip had legs after that delay to Labour’s £28bn green investment plan – a delay devised as proof of Labour’s iron fiscal discipline. In reality, getting spades in the ground, battery factories built, workforces trained for new green jobs and wind turbines ready to whirl will take time anyway: capital spending can start rolling out as needed. Here’s why there will be no green retreat: Labour’s green policy is no nice-to-have decoration separate from its economic strategy. That “fairer, greener future” slogan at the last Labour conference is the very heart of Starmer’s “growth, growth, growth” plan. Modelled on Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, it’s an even bigger green investment per capita than Biden’s. Those billions are why Starmer dares promise to outdo the G7 on growth, with job-generating renewables publicly owned by Great British Energy, and by building new and insulating old homes. Michael Gove set the tone for the most recent Tory attacks, accusing Labour of a “religious crusade” as he sheds his own green policies. Grant Shapps vows to “max out” Britain’s North Sea oil reserves, against Labour’s pledge to give no new licences. But if the Tories insist on green warfare, more fool them. Labour has green policies designed to bring savings, not new costs, to voters’ energy bills. Remember, Gove was there in 2013 beside David Cameron when he cut the “green crap” and abandoned subsidies for renewables, despite all that “vote blue, go green” husky-hugging designed to de-nasty his party. Cutting “the crap” added £2.5bn to UK household bills, while the number of homes getting their lofts insulated fell by a shocking 92%, and those getting cavity wall insulation by 74%. Abandoning the zero-carbon homes standard meant most new homes have been built with lower energy-efficiency standards – and higher energy bills. Worst of all was barring onshore wind to appease his nimby MPs: failing to use the cheapest energy costs households £180 a year – and onshore wind, even in people’s back yards, is popular. If Labour needs more green ammunition, Gove’s attack on Natural England, undermining basic environmental standards for new developments, goes against public sentiment: Tory voters tend to like nature and hate sewage in their rivers. If the Tories are mad and bad enough to want green wars, the public will be on Labour’s side because its green message is not about sacrifice, but about growth-inducing investment, cutting costs. Ed Miliband, who has been close to Starmer over many years, has been masterly in setting that tone as the guarantor of Labour’s green intentions. (No, Starmer never said he “hates tree-huggers” – that was a Tory lie, according to his team.) Lisa Nandy is the other pillar of Starmer’s growth strategy, with her huge house-building ambitions, planning for 70% of people to own their own homes and the majority of the rest to have secure social housing. Decent homes standards will apply to private as well as social landlords, sparking widespread repairs – another engine of growth. It’s a bit late for Gove’s promise to complete a million homes in this parliament, as the Conservative manifesto pledged in 2019: Knight Frank says it’s “unlikely to have a meaningful impact on housing supply”. Under the 15 Tory housing ministers since 2010, housebuilding in England is due to fall to its lowest level since the second world war, Nandy points out. Since the government caved in to its nimbys and abandoned compulsory local housing targets, 58 local authorities have delayed or withdrawn their local housing plans. On Monday, Gove managed to simultaneously boast of exempting developments from planning permission and promise lots more planners to unblock the backlog of planning applications. But that backlog was created by his own government’s 43% cuts to the planning system since 2010. Abandoning local planning rules may please some developers, but not most voters who care about their neighbourhoods. The very word “planning” horrifies out-of-touch libertarian and anti-green Tory MPs. Bereft battalions of old Brexiters now resurrect themselves under the anti-net zero banner, apparently oblivious to public opinion. God help us, the Sunday Telegraph is even calling for a referendum on net zero. In spirit, these MPs ally themselves to countries among the G20 who this weekend disastrously blocked a plan to phase down fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity – mainly Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. These Brexiters turned climate ignorers will try to drum up anti-Labour fears among Aberdeen oil workers and the few miners elsewhere who may not believe in Labour’s new green jobs until they see them. They will try to frighten drivers, so Labour needs to be sure-footed about explaining who pays for transition costs. Just Stop Oil is the Tories’ convenient target: protesters need more cleverness in engaging the public without enraging them. But as the world boils for all to see, a back-woods Tory campaign against good climate policies is a losing cause. The latest Office for National Statistics public opinion survey finds top issues “continued to be the cost of living (92%), the NHS (88%), the economy (79%), climate change and the environment (62%) and housing (62%).” No complacency, but the Tories are dead in the water on all of those. Labour can make common cause with those beleaguered Tories who see sense on the climate, but they have nothing to fear from the Jacob Rees-Mogg cadre of unelectables in pursuit of the unsurvivable. Any Labour advisers urging green retreat should be sent to spend their summer holiday on the island of Rhodes.

2021-04-17T06:00:27Z,Green investment bond offers 9% return – but there is a risk,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/apr/17/green-investment-bond-climate,"Green-minded individuals with an appetite for risk are being targeted by a new investment paying an eye-catching 9% interest a year. This five-year green bond, launched this week by the crowdfunding platform Abundance Investment, seeks to raise £4m for a private company called Iduna to finance the installation of 50 new electric vehicle charging points in Greater Manchester, provided in partnership with Transport for Greater Manchester. However, this is very different to putting your money into a savings account. With a 9% return, the investor’s capital is clearly at risk – ultimately, if things went wrong, you could lose some or all of your money. So this is probably not for the faint-hearted. The minimum investment is £5, and those who put their money in will be buying tradeable debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, debentures are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. According to the offer document, someone investing £1,000 now would be in line to receive a total of £1,499 at maturity in June 2026, made up of their original £1,000 capital and £499 of investment income. Greater Manchester has a strategy to be carbon neutral by 2038, and the proceeds of the investment will fund public charging points that will run on 100% renewable electricity supplied by Octopus Energy. Abundance says those who sign up to the scheme will be helping to fund Greater Manchester’s “green transport revolution”. The investment offer will be backed by revenues from electricity sales and advertising at the sites, it adds. These debentures are secured, in contrast to some other Abundance investments that are unsecured. However, the offer document includes five pages on the risks involved, and states: “Every investor in the debentures should be aware that by investing … he or she risks losing the entire or part of its investment in the event of our [Iduna’s] liquidation or insolvency. Security does not provide debenture investors with certainty of a partial or full recovery of their investments.” Some will take the view that a safer bet would be an ethical fund investing in many different companies.",Ethical money; Investments; Investment funds; Money; Climate crisis; Manchester; Greater Manchester; Environment; UK news,Money
2023-10-06T13:45:43Z,Green energy magnate to switch support from Just Stop Oil to Labour,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/06/green-energy-magnate-dale-vince-to-switch-support-from-just-stop-oil-to-labour,"Dale Vince, the green energy magnate, has said he is to stop funding direct action climate groups such as Just Stop Oil and instead funnel money towards getting the vote out for Labour at the next general election. The Ecotricity founder, who has funded a string of disruptive environmental protest groups, has supported Just Stop Oil since its inception, and has previously said his funding for the group has totalled “some hundreds of thousands”. This summer, Vince took to the streets with the climate protesters, joining their campaign of slow marches in central London. He said that even though he was still “comfortable with their methods”, Just Stop Oil’s tactics had not worked fast enough and it was time for a new strategy. “The next general election is the most important of our lifetimes,” he wrote in the Guardian. “And what the Tories will do if they get another stretch in power is crystal clear: abandon net zero, open new coalmines and oilfields, and continue presiding over spiralling living costs. And so today I announced a change of direction: I am no longer going to fund Just Stop Oil. Under the current government, protest cannot work. I would go so far as to say that anything that could feed the Tories’ culture-war narrative is counter-productive. “The dividing lines have been drawn: Labour is green, the Tories are not. A vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government – this time with a mandate to pursue its anti-green crusade. Preventing that from happening is the only way to ‘just stop oil’.” As well as funding direct action protest groups, Vince has given at least £1.5m to Labour over the past decade. His funding for both had led to accusations from the prime minister that “eco-zealots” were writing the opposition’s energy policies. Labour has said that if elected it would grant no new licences for oil and gas projects, a key demand of Just Stop Oil, as well as begin a programme of retrofit insulation for 19m homes, which was a key demand of the environmental activist group Insulate Britain. A green policy offering led by Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, also includes plans to quadruple off-shore wind, change planning rules to ease the way for more on-shore wind projects and an upgrade to the electricity grid, create a new public-private energy company and reach £28bn in green investment by the end of the second half of a Labour-led parliament. By contrast, Rishi Sunak last month announced U-turns on a number of green initiatives, pushing back the deadline for ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers, in an effort to draw populist dividing lines between the Conservatives and Labour as his party trails in the polls. Just Stop Oil said most of its funding came from private individual donations. An initiative by Vince to match donations over 48 hours in May raised £340,000 for the campaign. It has also received significant sums of money from the Climate Emergency Fund, a US philanthropic fund that directs money from donors to direct action groups around the world. Margaret Klein Salamon, the executive director of the Climate Emergency Fund, said: “Climate Emergency Fund is proud to be a funder of Just Stop Oil because we believe that non-violent disruptive protest is the fastest way to create transformative change. While these activists are controversial, they are correct about the science, about the efficacy of their approach, and they are morally righteous. “It’s time to wake up. These are not normal times. The climate emergency is accelerating, and all of us should be looking for the most effective ways to deploy our time and resources. We thank Dale Vince, and anyone who is willing to support these brave and effective activists, and we hope more funders will join us.” A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: “We are grateful to Dale Vince for his amazing financial and moral support over the past year. He has willingly given up his time to help mobilise people to take action to end new oil and gas. We can all see the need to remove this genocidal government from office and so we wish Dale well in his next campaign. However, we remain convinced that politics is utterly broken and the Labour party is tinkering around the edges while the world burns. More and more people are coming round to what really works – civil resistance.”",Environmental activism; Labour; Just Stop Oil; Environment; Politics; UK news,Environment
2024-02-02T17:09:15Z,A message to Starmer from the US: ditching your £28bn climate plan isn’t just cowardly – it’s bad politics | Kate Aronoff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/02/keir-starmer-ditching-28bn-climate-plan-cowardly-labour,"It’s hard, from the US, to feel all that confident about the state of our climate policies. The Inflation Reduction Act – the Biden White House’s trademark legislative achievement, which revolved around green investments – was a major accomplishment. Still, the US is breaking new records for its production and export of fossil fuels, last year extracting more oil and gas than ever before. Even more worrying is just how tenuous the country’s modest progress on the climate feels in advance of November’s presidential election: Donald Trump continues to lead Joe Biden in just about every poll. However, at the very least, the Biden administration has set a bar for the scale of green investment that centre-left parties should undertake. The same can’t be said of the Labour party, which has reportedly now scrapped its laudable £28bn green spending pledge in favour of some bizarre fealty to its leadership’s own strange idea of fiscal responsibility. So what can Labour learn from the Democratic president’s approach? To his great credit, Biden took seriously the need to win over progressive supporters of his main opponent in the Democratic primary in 2020. Bernie Sanders was an early adopter of the climate movement’s calls for a “green new deal”, laying out an expansive $16tn plan to tackle global heating and inequality. Biden’s $3.5tn Build Back Better agenda, produced with Sanders and his supporters in consultative roles, was decidedly not a green new deal. It did, however, reflect that platform’s most valuable components, positing climate action as a job creator and driver of 21st-century economic dynamism. Inherent in that was a willingness to spend lots of money, fast, on the things that matter. Almost as soon as Biden took office, however, climate advocates in the US watched the White House’s already too modest jobs and climate agenda get whittled down to what eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act’s roughly $400bn in new spending on climate and environmental priorities. It’s a shamefully slender programme, given how wealthy the US is, and its outsized historical responsibility for the climate crisis. But it’s also the best we might have hoped for, given the political influence of a fossil fuel industry that’s captured the Republican party virtually wholesale, along with key Democrats such as the West Virginia senator, Joe Manchin. Without the idiosyncrasies that weakened US climate policy, why do some members of the Labour party seem so keen to negotiate against themselves? The party’s £28bn a year green prosperity plan has now been dropped, thanks to the political cowardice of people such as the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who was already distancing herself from the policy in an interview with LBC earlier this week. The Labour veteran and podcast host Ed Balls suggested the problem with the plan was the number attached to it – urging Starmer and Reeves to “U-turn” away from it, so as to project fiscal responsibility and deflect repeated attacks from the right that Starmer would raise taxes to fund it. The party establishment is clearly spooked by the spectre of rightwing attacks, as Labour’s latest move so clearly shows. If the US can offer any lessons about how to deal with a right wing yammering on about how green policies allegedly hurt “ordinary people” while preaching painful austerity, it’s that it won’t give you a lick of credit for giving in to its ideas. Neither, moreover, will voters. The planet is even less forgiving. The costs of the climate crisis far outweigh the costs of acting on it. Under present policies, the climate crisis could cost the UK 3.3% of GDP a year by 2050. By 2100, that jumps to 7.4% of GDP a year; in today’s terms, that would be about £168bn. Labour needn’t look to the future, though, to make a straightforward case for going big on green spending. The Conservatives’ long-running war on good climate policy has already made life more expensive for working-class Britons. David Cameron’s bid to cut the “green crap” entailed doing away with a successful home insulation programme in 2013. And the average household could be paying gas bills of up to £400 lower if the Tories hadn’t axed the energy price guarantee scheme. While Labour’s green prosperity plan was designed with the Inflation Reduction Act in mind, there was an opportunity for Starmer to improve on it by emphasising the short-term benefits, such as the money households could save from national home insulation projects. Though it’s a hot topic among wonkish types in the US, UK and other parts of Europe, very few people here could tell you what the Inflation Reduction Act actually is. As of last August – a year on from the act’s passage – 71% of US residents said they knew “little or nothing” about it. Why is the White House’s high-profile accomplishment so far from most Americans’ minds? For one, the consultancy McKinsey has found that $216bn of the act’s $394bn in climate and energy-related tax credits will flow to corporations. Meanwhile, many benefits, such as incentives for pricey items such as electric vehicles and solar panels, are completely inaccessible to lower-income people and renters, who account for about 36% of US households. Driving investment in low-carbon energy and technologies makes a lot of sense: green industries grew four times faster than the rest of the British economy in 2020-21. But courting private-sector investment in green industries above all else – a sadly salient critique of the Inflation Reduction Act – threatens to leave voters in the dark about the benefits of climate action to their pockets. An active green industrial strategy should go hand in hand with an expansion of the public goods, services and planning capacities it will need to succeed. Upgrading public transit infrastructure and ensuring an abundant, affordable supply of low-carbon energy will be key to the success of the emerging green industries. More important, though, is that these can be the foundation on which Labour – should it ever choose to – builds both a broadly shared green prosperity and its electoral mandate for ever-stronger climate policies. The last few years of climate policymaking in the US point to at least one clear conclusion: Reeves and those who pushed to kill Labour’s green spending pledge are dead wrong. Labour should be sparing no expense on reducing emissions and improving livelihoods; if anything, £28bn a year is much too little. If party top brass can summon even an ounce of political courage they’ll make another U-turn away from disastrous, outdated economic orthodoxy and revive their more ambitious climate plans. Should that happen, the party can make voters acutely aware of the choice before them – to live a good, green life under Labour, or to let another Tory government take away more of their hard-earned money. Otherwise, the differences between Tory and Labour rule will keep getting harder and harder to spot.

2023-07-26T13:57:06Z,"Ministers should fund ‘proper scrappage scheme’ for Ulez, says Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/26/ministers-should-fund-proper-scrappage-scheme-for-ulez-says-keir-starmer,"Keir Starmer has backed Sadiq Khan’s call for the government to put money behind a more generous scrappage scheme to help Londoners upgrade older vehicles as the party seeks to limit the electoral fallout of the policy. The Labour leader said that ministers should help fund a “proper scrappage scheme” for owners of more polluting cars affected by the London mayor’s plans to expand the clean air zone, as they have done for similar schemes in Bristol and Birmingham. He also said that Khan should “look more broadly” at extra support and mitigations that could be put in place, after the expansion of the mayor’s ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) was blamed for Labour failing to seize Uxbridge and South Ruislip in last week’s byelection. However, Starmer refused to say whether he supported the extension of the scheme, which is the subject of judicial review at the high court by outer London councils. He pointed to the mayor’s legal obligation to improve air quality in the capital. Conservative strategists believe they can use discontent about the Ulez in last week’s byelection as a weapon to save a raft of Tories under threat in the city’s outskirts. Rishi Sunak has indicated the government could delay or even abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers as he attempts to create dividing lines with Labour at the next election. Downing Street said the government would “continually examine and scrutinise” measures including a ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, phasing out gas boilers by 2035, energy efficiency targets for private rented homes and low-traffic neighbourhoods. Further questions have been raised about Labour’s commitment to measures to tackle the climate crisis after Starmer delayed plans for his £28bn green investment fund by two years because of economic turmoil. In BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in, Starmer said: “I want [Khan] to reflect on the impact it’s having on people … to look at the scheme and see whether there are things that can be done to make it easier for people. “The first is the scrappage scheme, the money that people get if they actually change their car. The government has put money behind similar schemes in Birmingham and Bristol but not in London. A proper scrappage scheme massively helps people. But the government at the moment won’t do it. That’s one measure, but I want the mayor to look more broadly.” However, Starmer added: “We can’t pretend that this is a simple political decision. You can’t just say yes/no without regard to the legal context. If the law requires a measure to be taken, it is not in the gift of the mayor to say ‘I’m simply not going to do it’.” Khan is under mounting political pressure to rethink his plan to extend the Ulez at the end of August. He told the Financial Times: “The government has given other cities hundreds of millions of pounds for scrappage schemes and clean air zones. All we are asking for is fairness and that London gets the same.” He added: “It’s not right that the government hasn’t provided a penny for Londoners while giving so much to other cities.” Transport for London, chaired by Khan, has set up a £110m vehicle scrappage scheme for small businesses, charities and Londoners in receipt of child benefit or universal credit affected by the Ulez. However, drivers have complained that the £2,000 on offer for cars is only a fraction of the cost of replacing their vehicles.",London; Labour; Keir Starmer; Sadiq Khan; Road transport; UK news; Politics; Air pollution; Environment; Low emission zones,UK news
2024-01-21T12:00:28Z,"Goodbye Mr Kerry, farewell Mr Xie: end of an era in global climate politics",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/21/goodbye-mr-kerry-farewell-mr-xie-end-of-an-era-in-global-climate-politics,"As the final fraught hours of the Cop28 UN climate summit approached last December, a small but vital meeting was missing from the official agenda. While thousands of grumpy delegates trooped the vast and glitzy Dubai venue, a private gathering in a quiet corner marked a joyful milestone. John Kerry, the US presidential envoy for climate, celebrated his 80th birthday, and guest of honour was his 74-year-old Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua. It was a warm and familial occasion: even Xie’s eight-year-old grandson was present. “Why are you still working so hard, at your age?” he asked of Xie and his “good old friend” Kerry. “Because we are all passionate about this common cause of addressing climate change,” was Xie’s answer, recounted at an unusual joint US-China press conference after the summit ended. For both men, who have been pivotal to climate negotiations since before the signing of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, that hard work is now over. First Xie and then, last week, Kerry announced his retirement, leaving a global climate stage that their close personal relationship has helped to define. Despite rising tensions between their countries, they forged a US-China collaboration on climate action that has been essential to reshaping the global economy – but also a frustrating barrier to climate progress. The world’s two biggest emitters – China, with about 30% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and the US with about 14%, plus the world’s biggest oil and gas production – hold the planet’s future in their hands. Relations between the countries were traditionally strained, with the US seeing in China a dangerous growing rival and China building its own alliances and power bases, fuelled by its increasing economic might. “The relationship on the climate between the US and China is super-important,” says Todd Stern, former US climate envoy, who worked first with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, and then with Kerry for the Paris agreement. “It has been for a long time the most important bilateral relationship in the world, on the climate.” Both countries have been alternately praised and criticised for their climate actions. China has been the engine of global green growth, with its massive investments in wind, solar and electric vehicles driving down costs dramatically, and has been a hero to developing countries, offering aid and investment. But the world’s second biggest economy remains highly dependent on coal, and has sometimes obstructed progress – at the Durban UN Cop in 2011, holding out until the final moments on accepting the roadmap that eventually led to the Paris agreement, and at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, forcing a last-minute weakening of the commitment to phase out coal into a phase down. The US has also played a dual role: pushing for the 2015 Paris agreement and unveiling $369bn in green investment under the Inflation Reduction Act but simultaneously ramping up its oil and gas production to become the world’s biggest producer. It has also signally failed to provide the vital climate finance that developing countries have long been promised, and stalled on the “loss and damage” rescue funds that are life and death issues for the world’s poorest. It was good to have a “grownup” back in the role after Trump, said Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, but the US is still a major disappointment on climate action. “Kerry and the US fought hard against the creation of the loss and damage fund, and too often it acts as a major blocker when it comes to progressive climate agreements. Hopefully the new envoy can have a better legacy than Kerry,” he said. And Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, argued that both countries need to do more: “Their claims of climate leadership ring hollow with continued investment in fossil fuels.” Nevertheless, the Xie-Kerry relationship, which goes back more than 25 years, has brought what many argue are rich dividends for the climate talks and for much of the past decade – with a large gap for Donald Trump’s presidency – Kerry and Xie, both keenly and seriously interested in climate change, spearheaded their countries’ climate engagement and helped to turn it into an arena for cooperation. “Xie built a set of lasting partnerships with US officials that underpinned the relationship of the world’s largest economies, and saw them through good times and bad,” said Rachel Kyte, former World Bank climate chief and UN special representative. “Kerry is probably one of the few people in the US who could bring the Biden administration and the wider body politic together to do a deal with China, when so many others in Washington just saw danger everywhere.” “The Paris agreement would not have happened without those two,” economist Lord Stern told the Guardian. “They built up a relationship of trust between their two countries that was essential. That has in turn given stability and a sense of commitment.” Both men have shown a deep understanding of the climate crisis and its urgency, and political nous in navigating climate action through the shoals of economic rivalry and diplomatic tensions. “They are also very nice guys, real human beings, with a deep, deep sense of decency, both of them,” added Lord Stern. Their warm personal rapport was frequently in evidence. At Cop28, the US and Chinese delegations were housed strategically near to each other, with the back entrance of the US offices opening on to the Chinese pavilion, facilitating an apparently impromptu meeting between the two men as the conference began, to their mutual and clear delight. Both men, while driven and energetic, have been showing signs of fatigue at recent climate meetings, however. Xie has spent the last few wearing trainers for his bad back and suffered a serious but undisclosed illness last year. Kerry contracted Covid in the late stages of Cop27, in Sharm El-Sheikh, and had to conduct the final hours of negotiations from his hotel room, though his punishing work schedule resumed soon after. They leave the stage at a crucial juncture. With Donald Trump again threatening to upend US action on the climate, as well as a host of other issues, the looming US presidential election is of primary importance. But China is just as critical: Bernice Lee, of Chatham House, pointed out that the country is deploying vast amounts of low-carbon technology, adding: “The Xi administration wants to be regarded well on the world stage – climate is the best platform for them to assert leadership.” Xie’s apparent successor is Liu Zhenmin, a top diplomat who views climate as a vital brief, while the Biden administration has yet to indicate who will replace Kerry. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with American University’s Center for Environmental Policy, said the Kerry/Xie relationship should be the model for their governments, to act before it is too late. “With luck, their successors will realise that Kerry and Xie together just barely began to put the world’s two largest economies on paths toward far lower emissions and greater climate cooperation, in a shared determination to prevent global destabilisation and climate calamity,” he said.",Environment; World news; Cop28; John Kerry; China; US news,Environment
2022-02-09T10:47:17Z,Campaigners fear net zero could be a casualty of Boris Johnson’s weakness,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/campaigners-fear-net-zero-could-be-a-casualty-of-boris-johnsons-weakness,"Green campaigners are increasingly concerned that the push for net zero emissions has been undermined by a series of recent government actions. Ministers and government bodies are considering extending a coalmine in Wales and a new one in Cumbria, have approved a new oilfield in the North Sea and the expansion of the airport at Bristol, and are making cuts to public transport services. These decisions have come while the Treasury is reported to be seeking ways to cut the green levies from fuel bills, which would reduce support for home insulation for poor households, and as some rightwing commentators have clamoured for increased gas production as a solution to soaring energy prices. Jamie Peters, the campaign director at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government are saying one thing and then doing something completely different in a string of recent decisions, and the climate emergency is too important to be treated this way. “Their approach to net zero demonstrates either a lack of understanding or a lack of interest in how climate breakdown will affect people here in the UK.” The Abigail oilfield licence was approved by the Oil and Gas Authority last month, despite a UK-commissioned report from the International Energy Agency last year that found no new oil and gas exploration could take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. Similarly, the extension of a coalmine at Aberpergwm in Wales is now under consideration, as is the licence for a new mine in Cumbria that would supply coking coal. After international outcry last year, the government called an inquiry on the Cumbrian plans. That meant a pause while ministers hosted the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow, but the issue is still live and is expected to be resolved soon. Mark Jenkinson, a local Conservative MP who has campaigned for the mine, has called green campaigners “climate terrorists” and is a member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, a group of about 20 MPs and peers who want to curb or reverse the government’s commitment to reaching net zero emissions. As president of Cop26, the UK has a continuing duty to ensure its resolutions are met, until Egypt takes over as president of the next round of talks this November. That means asking other countries, some of which have large fossil fuel industries, to come up with national plans to reduce their emissions. That will become more difficult if the UK appears to renege on its domestic carbon-cutting plans. Peters said of the recent decisions: “No reasonable person can say that this adds up to a government that understands the scale of action needed. The [net zero] strategy should be strengthened, and rewritten if necessary, to recognise the realities of the climate and ecological emergency. That means no new coal, no new roads, no new airports, and this must be the backbone of everything Whitehall does: it’s not an incidental nice-to-have.” Transport remains another sore point. Rail fares are rising while public transport plans have been scaled back with cuts to rail services and buses. Norman Baker, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “The government claims it wants public transport to be the ‘natural first choice for all who can take it’ but funding cuts to the rail and bus network will make public transport more expensive, less convenient, less reliable and ultimately less attractive to millions of people who have a choice to drive.” Hopes for a green recovery from the pandemic, which could create jobs in areas from home insulation and renewable energy generation to tree-planting and building flood defences, were also dealt a blow by the levelling up strategy, which relegated green investment to the bottom of its long list of priorities. Ed Matthew, the campaigns director at the climate change thinktank E3G, said this was a mistake, as an insulation programme alone could help to reduce energy bills, create jobs, improve the health of people in cold homes, and reach net zero. He said: “As energy bills go through the roof due to the rocketing cost of gas, it is worth remembering that the most energy-leaking housing stock in western Europe is in the north of England. Fixing it would slash energy bills and emissions while boosting the economy of the north. Failing to put that at the heart of this levelling up strategy is a spectacular own goal.” With Boris Johnson’s premiership hanging by a thread, and his potential rivals courting the right wing of his party, there is widespread concern among green analysts and campaigners that the push for net zero could become a casualty of his weakness. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “For all the government’s claims to be climate leaders their weak record on delivery in key sectors leaves you pondering just where is this leadership? Recent developments raise real questions about delivering on the promises we made to the international community in Glasgow last November.” He added: “The government has felt quite at home making grand climate statements on the international stage but with Cop26 over, the focus needs to move on. Attention has to turn to the real graft needed to deliver drastic emissions cuts here at home.”",Climate crisis; Boris Johnson; Environment; Politics; Conservatives; Mining; Fossil fuels; UK news; Energy; Green politics,Environment
2024-03-21T06:00:23Z,The Labour party is in my blood. Here’s why I’ve just cancelled my membership | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/21/labour-party-cancelling-membership-policies,"It’s difficult to disentangle Labour from my sense of self. Grew up in Stockport, looks a bit like Macaulay Culkin, bad dress sense … the Labour party always seemed to fit in there somewhere. My great-grandfather, a railwayman who had his wages docked in the General Strike nearly a century ago, was a Labour councillor. So was my grandmother; her proudest achievement was stopping a family being evicted by a private landlord over Christmas. My parents met at an open-air Labour meeting outside Tooting Bec in the 1960s (romantic). My mother bought me a Labour membership as a 15th birthday present. Under every Labour leader in my 21 years of adult life, I’ve plumped for the party’s candidates at local, national and European level, and campaigned for them to boot. And yet, after a uniquely calamitous 14-year stretch of Tory rule, just as Labour looks set to reconquer No 10 by a landslide, I’ve just emailed the party cancelling my membership. My committed critics will understandably seek to link the two: Labour has shed its aversion to electability, and off sulks Home Alone’s patron saint of unelectable ideas. But my decision isn’t based on a desire to see Labour for ever in the wilderness. Reaching it has been a gradual, painful process of realising the party won’t even do the bare minimum to improve people’s lives, or to tackle the crises that have led Britain to catastrophe; and that it will, in fact, wage war on anyone who wants to do either– making anyone with politics to the left of Peter Mandelson feel like a pariah on borrowed time. Yes, my relatives had conflicted relationships with the party, and were often frustrated by its insufficient radicalism. But they could always point to policies that transformed the lives of the people Labour was founded to represent, from the welfare state to the minimum wage and the NHS, where my grandmother worked for her whole life. The premise of Keir Starmer’s leadership bid in 2020 was that popular policies such as taxing the rich to invest in public services, scrapping tuition fees and promoting public ownership were not to blame for the party’s 2019 electoral rout. Jeremy Corbyn’s 2017 election manifesto, Starmer declared, was the party’s “foundational document” – centred around such commitments and credited with the party’s biggest surge in vote share since 1945, even if it wasn’t enough to win two years after a shattering defeat. “Jeremy Corbyn made our party the party of anti-austerity,” Starmer told shattered Labour members, “and he was right to do so.” Though I didn’t vote for him, his pitch gave hope for the broad church my ancestors believed in. In response, I wrote a column titled: “Starmer can succeed, and he deserves our support.” Yet five years on, Labour has become a hostile environment for anyone believing in the very policies Starmer relied upon to secure the leadership. Sure, Tony Blair’s leadership bid didn’t include laying waste Iraq, but he didn’t pretend to be a slicker version of Tony Benn either. “Circumstances changed,” plead Starmer’s defenders. Weird, then, that according to Margaret Hodge, she was led to believe by a Starmer ally during the leadership election that he was “lying” in order to get the job. Weird, too, that during that same campaign Starmer told Andrew Neil that nationalisation of utilities would feature in a Labour manifesto, but 18 months later said: “I never made a commitment to nationalisation.” Ah, the luxury of a Guardian columnist, goes the predictable retort, demanding the most vulnerable pay the price for his lofty principles. Consider, though, that ending the two-child benefit cap would lift 250,000 children out of poverty, and lessen the effects of poverty on a further 850,000, but Starmer backed keeping it anyway. Why? To sound tough, presumably. On who? Impoverished children, like those I grew up with in Stockport? This is the same Labour party that has ruled out bringing back a cap on bankers’ bonuses or instituting a wealth tax. The same Labour party committed to Tory fiscal rules that lock the country into dismal austerity policies that have delivered collapsing public services and an unprecedented decline in living standards. The same Labour party that gutted its one distinctive flagship policy, a £28bn-a-year green investment fund, not because it came under pressure, but because it feared it might. Some argue that Labour is doing a Clark Kent, and will unveil its hidden progressive Superman upon assuming office. Yet those fiscal rules make that approach impossible, even if you disregard the propensity of Labour governments to become more rightwing in office. The assault on Gaza, the great crime of our age, adds moral indecency to the pile of dishonesty and vacuity. When Starmer declared Israel had the right to cut off energy and water to Palestinian civilians, he did so as a human rights lawyer who understands the Geneva conventions. After letting shadow cabinet ministers defend him, he claimed it “has never been my view that Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines”. We all have political red lines: mine is supporting what would amount to war crimes against innocent civilians, toddlers and newborn babies among them, then gaslighting the public over doing so. Where is my gratitude for Starmer delivering a now inevitable landslide victory, you may ask? Well, he didn’t force Boris Johnson and his cronies to violate their own pandemic rules, or to trash the NHS, or oversee the worst squeeze in living standards in history. Nor did he propel to power Liz Truss, whose unhinged economic experiment crashed the economy – the moment when the electorate turned on this Tory party for good. The absolute power a landslide victory will give Labour should scare you. When Starmer allies deployed antisemitic tropes – with one joking about a “run on silver shekels” when two Jewish businessmen missed out on peerages, and another calling a Jewish Tory donor a “puppet master” – an apology was deemed to be sufficient. When another racially abused a journalist and had a sexual harassment complaint upheld, they were reinstated after investigation. Contrast this with Diane Abbott, Britain’s first Black female MP, who was suspended after immediately apologising for an Observer letter in which she argued that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people are not subject to racism “all their lives”. She has been left in limbo for 10 months and counting while the party investigates – only for Labour to use the racist abuse directed at her by a Tory donor for political capital, while still refusing to reinstate her. Another fellow leftwinger, Kate Osamor – again, a Black female MP – was suspended for describing the assault on Gaza as a genocide on the day the international court of justice placed Israel on trial for alleged genocide. Questions of racism, then, seem to be judged on whether they have a factional use – a sure sign of moral bankruptcy. This leadership style is crude in opposition; with an overwhelming majority, it will be chilling. That is why I think those who believe in real change from the Tories’ bankrupt model should vote for Green or independent candidates. A new initiative – We Deserve Better – is raising money to support such candidates, judged on whether they believe in, say, taxing the well-off to invest, or public ownership, or opposing war crimes, even if they differ on this or that. Those seeking transformative policies are now fragmented, but they don’t have to be. The premise of this new initiative is simple: if the left doesn’t band together, the only pressure on Labour will come from the migrant-bashing, rich-worshipping right. The Tories’ chance of winning is infinitesimally small. What matters now is whether anyone who wants to redistribute wealth and power is denied a voice in Starmer’s administration. That is certainly the ambition of his lieutenants. When inevitable disillusionment with a government rooted in deceit and lacking any solutions to Britain’s woes seeps in, it will be the radical right that stands to benefit.

2023-10-10T16:18:22Z,Starmer brushes off the glitter to make coherent case for a Labour government,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/10/starmer-brushes-glitter-coherent-case-labour-government,"Keir Starmer would not have wanted a rogue protester to cover him in glitter as he stood up to give his crucial conference speech. But the overall image of a Labour leader sparkling from the stage for an hour ended up doing him no harm. Jacket off and sleeves rolled up, Starmer recovered immediately and made the incident into a virtue, with huge applause from the hall. “This is why we changed our party. Power, not protests,” he quipped. It was not a showy, glittering speech in tone, but over the course of the hour Starmer built up a coherent, overarching case for why Labour should be in government. Although there were no major new announcements, he set out core policies where there is clear difference with the Conservatives. Labour would build 1.5m new houses and overhaul the planning system, “speed ahead” with green projects, and bring in a package of improvements to workers’ rights. It was the strongest statement from Starmer so far on scrapping zero-hours contracts and banning fire and rehire – after finding that the party’s promise of reforms to make work pay went down well on the doorstep in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West byelection. But more than the policies, Starmer’s speech was about his messaging: that Labour understands the concerns of voters, is here to serve them, and solve Britain’s problems. The Labour leader spent his past few conference speeches making the case that the party has changed since the Jeremy Corbyn era and then critiquing the Conservative government. His goal this year was properly answering the exam question of what Labour would do differently: ending the age of insecurity and anxiety, opting instead for stability and national renewal. Starmer also made his pitch to voters that he is ordinary and understands their concerns in a way the multimillionaire, helicopter-riding Sunak can never do. There were the mentions of his family’s pebbledash semi, his toolmaker father, of football and fishing, and holidays in the Lake District. In contrast, he directly mocked Sunak for having to borrow a shopworker’s car for a photo opportunity and called him “shallow” for being unable to see, listen or stand in the shoes of voters. Addressing concerns about the cost of living, he spoke of meeting a woman in a cafe who told him she could never think “let’s do something nice any more”. “The cost of living crisis intrudes on the little things we love. Days out, meals out, holidays: the first things people cut back on. Picking up a treat in the supermarket to put it back on the shelf … we have to be a government that takes care of the big questions so working people have the freedom to enjoy what they love. More time, more energy, more possibility, more life.” There was plenty in the speech for core Labour supporters and the trade unions, especially the pledges on workers’ rights. But at the same time, Starmer was keen to broaden the party’s offer to all voters – making the case that his party would get businesses and workers in partnership, tackle NHS changes and go for economic growth. He made direct appeals to Tory voters that Labour stood for the rule of law and conserving what is good, while also reaching out to Scottish National party voters, promising that Scotland would “lead the way to a Labour government”. After a speech spent planting himself firmly in the centre ground of politics, he warned the Tories had become “dangerous” with their decision to swim in the “murky waters of populism and conspiracy”, painting the governing party as the extremist outlier and Labour as the mainstream. Threaded through the speech was a promise to “get Britain’s future back”, with a subtle echo of the Brexit campaign’s promise to “take back control”. Starmer was relentlessly focused on Labour’s plans for the future, but the slogan also contained a nod to those who want to return to a time in the past when things in Britain worked and life did not feel so tough. The narrative arc was all there and the positioning of Starmer as a candidate for change. But before the next election, he may well need more voter-friendly policies to persuade people that they will be tangibly better off under Labour – especially in the pocket. There is little wriggle room in the public finances for expensive, eye-catching policies but the Tories will undoubtedly go into the next election having found room for tax cuts. At an election, voters will look at promises of housebuilding and green investment saying: “That’s great, but what will help me right now?” With a year to go, there is still time for that to be set out in an election campaign and manifesto. But that is the final piece of the puzzle Labour will need to find.",Labour conference 2023; Keir Starmer; Labour; Labour conference; Politics; Housing; Green politics; Zero-hours contracts; Rishi Sunak; UK news,Politics
2024-06-21T11:00:03Z,We’re young people from across Britain – here’s how politicians can win our vote,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/21/youth-takeover-panel-verdict-what-matters-election,"Bethan Williams: Labour’s ‘GB Energy’ plans are vague and insubstantial In 2019, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party embraced the concept of the green new deal, a comprehensive set of integrated policies ranging from creating green jobs to improving home insulation. I was a young climate activist about to vote in a general election for the first time, so a concrete programme for tackling the climate crisis was the push I needed to vote Labour. It’s been a long five years. During this time, I have graduated twice, worked full-time for 10 months, and watched the Conservatives arguably become the laughing stock of climate policy. Meanwhile, the Labour party has undergone significant transformations, many of which I believe are for the better. However, these changes have resulted in the demise of the green new deal in mainstream UK politics. In February, Labour announced that it would cut its £28bn green investment pledge by half. “GB Energy” dominates its promotional material, yet it’s a concept I struggle to make sense of, even as someone working in the renewable energy industry. It feels as if I’m reading a proposed policy where every other line is missing. The green new deal provided a practical, tangible roadmap for tackling the largest problems facing Britain. In contrast, Labour’s current plan to tackle the climate crisis seems vague and insubstantial, relying on ambiguous plans such as GB Energy accompanied by weak climate policies. I am pleased that Labour is committing to achieving clean energy by 2030, but we can’t settle for a piecemeal approach when the survival of our planet is at stake. Bethan Williams lives in Cardiff Niall Hignett: Labour is the only party serious about building homes My biggest issue going into this election is the housing crisis; I’m fed up with being further down the political priority list than “possible” damage to trees. The reality is, we aren’t building enough homes. Tinkering around with renting rules isn’t going to fix it. Britain desperately needs planning reform. Someone who buys organic quinoa from Waitrose, hops into a 4x4 to drive to their acreage and unloads their grass-fed beef into a fridge with a built-in screen gets to object to planning at every turn, lecturing everybody else about environmentalism. Without a hint of irony, our politicians too often nod along, emulating the wrong Churchill. The frustration this causes in the planning system means sky-high rents for dodgy housing are the new norm. As things stand, I’ll probably never be able to own a home, and renting will likely eat up more than half my take-home pay. Every party talks the talk on housing. The Tories promised rent reform and 300,000 homes a year in their 2019 manifesto. Neither happened. That’s why I’m voting based on parties’ records, not promises. This means I won’t be voting Conservative, and the Liberal Democrats and Greens won’t be getting my vote either. I’ve never seen a Lib Dem leaflet that doesn’t brag about blocking housebuilding, and Ed Davey tried to dump the party’s housing targets last year. The Greens are cosplaying as a radical party of the young without any substance to back it up. Their sole MP’s crowning achievement is creating a GCSE in natural history, having spent 14 years objecting to nuclear power, HS2, and housebuilding. That leaves Labour. I only have to look to Andy Burnham’s record in Manchester to be convinced the party is serious about sorting out the housing crisis. The party’s target of 1.5 million homes strikes me as unambitious, but it’s at least presented with conviction. Starmer is even a self-professed yimby, which is far stronger rhetoric than any other leader has managed. So I’ll be voting to give myself the chance of affordable rent and, eventually, home ownership. Starmer’s Labour gets my support on 4 July. Niall Hignett is a law student and freelance writer based in Durham Hassan Ali: Starmer’s lack of backbone on Gaza will cost him votes It looks increasingly likely that Starmer will stumble into No 10 on the back of historic dissatisfaction with the Tory government. But as far as world events are concerned, Labour’s stances – particularly on Gaza – leave a lot to be desired. I grew up watching the adults around me supporting Labour because, as the mantra states, it was the party for the many, not the few. Much of the Muslim community felt not only heard but listened to, and there was a tangible connection between the needs of the masses and the solutions actioned by the party. Now, however, the connection seems to be hanging on by a thread, if at all. Keir Starmer’s weak stance on Gaza is costing him in constituencies up north, and will quite frankly be costing him across the country. I, for one, cannot in good conscience vote for a leader who can sit comfortably while condoning the deprivation of power and water while so many suffer. Despite later taking it back, I still find it ironic that someone who was once a human rights lawyer could make such a remark. Had he instead shown some backbone and spoken out against Israel’s actions, perhaps called for an unequivocal ceasefire earlier, he might have re-engaged voters who already felt alienated by Labour’s rightwards drift. Instead, he remained complicit, ducking and swerving any real accountability for his words. Although my local seat is a safe Labour one, I will vote. And I encourage others feeling similarly disenchanted to vote as well. Even if you don’t feel represented, at the end of the day it’s these numbers that matter to parties the most. Hell, spoil your ballot if you must, but the onus is on you to make sure you’re using your vote, even if it is just to say “I’m here, I will vote, and I’m disappointed in the whole lot of you”. Hassan Ali is a student from east London Paris Haigh: From climate to education, the SNP has lost young voters The SNP has always been good at saying the right things, but not actually following through on its promises. Its recent announcement that it will be ditching its 2030 climate targets just shows how empty these promises really are. Young people are tired of politicians throwing away our future while they cosy up to fossil fuels. Just last year, with fellow activists from Green New Deal Rising, I spoke to several SNP politicians, including former first minister Humza Yousaf, who told me himself that there is no future for Scotland in oil and gas. Earlier this year, the SNP announced that the first decade after independence will be bankrolled by oil and gas revenue. The science is clear: if young people are to have a livable future, no more oil and gas projects can be allowed to go ahead. It’s not just the climate crisis that’s endangering our future but the lack of funding for education, with strike actions happening across Scotland. Chatting with fellow students, it’s clear that, despite the negative impact on our learning, we support our lecturers as they demand fair pay. We want to know that we can trust our leaders to secure our future, but right now, the SNP isn’t offering us that. Many young people have lost faith in the SNP, so it will have to prove to us that it will do everything in its power to protect our future, if it is to earn our votes. Paris Haigh is a student and organiser with Green New Deal Rising, living in Scotland Tiger-Lily Snowdon: I’ve seen the impact of the social care crisis on family members We all know that our NHS is in crisis, and a major part of this is the lack of social care. Across the country, thousands of hospital beds are occupied by people waiting for care to be put in place. Roughly 62% of people currently or previously providing unpaid care say they had no choice in taking on the role because no other care options were available. This is an issue close to my heart, both as a young disabled person and as someone who has watched family members become unpaid carers and older relatives go through the care system. Ed Davey’s experience as a carer has been at the forefront of his campaign. The Liberal Democrats’ pledges to introduce free personal care (so no person would have to sell their house to pay personal care costs), a higher minimum wage for paid care workers, and to give unpaid carers a fair deal are impressive. The Green party has also prioritised this issue, with similar pledges including free personal care and increased rates of pay for carers. Although Labour was disappointingly quiet about the topic until its manifesto was released, it does highlight the impact of social care on healthcare and the need for deep reform. Its favouring of a “home first” approach and a fair pay agreement is encouraging, but it neglects to mention unpaid carers. Even the Conservatives mention the invaluable role of unpaid carers, although the issue of social care takes up only one paragraph in the “health and social care” area of their manifesto. It’s disappointing that the two major parties are failing to address and tackle the issue head-on. They appear to be leaving it to the smaller parties to propose the bold moves needed to have a significant impact on the crisis. It’s undeniable that social care is expensive, taking up at least 65% of council budgets (2023-24), but budgets will have to be increased to cope with the demands of our ageing population. Our health and social care systems have crumbled under the Conservatives, and one cannot be fixed without improving the other. Tiger-Lily Snowdon is a student and lives in rural Devon Daniel Cadel: Our relic of a voting system urgently needs reform A significant flaw of our democracy is the continued use of first past the post voting in elections. As can be clearly seen in the UK, this system has led to a two-party state. The result of this for the country is that both Labour and Conservative have become lax and unimaginative. Everyone predicts that Labour will win the coming election, but this is arguably because of the sole alternative performing poorly, rather than because of genuine interest or support for the party or its policies. In our system, a winner is created by one party doing worse than the other, rather than a party garnering genuine support. Reforming this system in favour of proportional representation or another voting method would remove the need for tactical voting. Although there are many issues in our country that affect people’s lives more, I truly believe fixing our democracy will lead to a brighter future for us all in the longer term. It would mean a future where politicians had to take responsibility for their mistakes and their actions, or face real electoral consequences. As a result, they might actually aim to fix the country, rather than continue what we’ve had for the past few years. With first past the post, the politicians who have done little to resolve the cost of living crisis, partied during Covid while people’s loved ones died and gave us the ineffective and expensive Rwanda scheme, still have a chance of remaining as MPs, or even to be re-elected in five years’ time. If this relic of a system was reformed, all these people would face the deserved consequences of their actions.

2023-10-08T21:32:34Z,"‘Covid corruption commissioner’ would seek to recoup lost billions, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/08/covid-corruption-commissioner-recoup-lost-billions-labour,"A Labour government would create a powerful Covid corruption commissioner to help recoup billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money that has been lost to waste, fraud and flawed contracts during the pandemic, Rachel Reeves is to announce. The new commissioner would be given the power to bring together public agencies including HMRC, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency to pursue at least £2.6bn of “lost” public funds. They would examine contracts line by line and would have to update parliament on their progress in clawing back money. An estimated £7.2bn was lost in fraud from Covid support schemes including from business loans and grants, furlough and “eat out to help out”, although the figure could be as high as £10.8bn, according to the House of Commons library. Labour believes a lower estimate of £4.7bn could be achieved if losses are contained. In her conference speech in Liverpool on Monday, Reeves will announce that Labour would review sentencing on fraud and corruption conducted against UK public services, as well as reform public procurement rules to include a strong “debarment and exclusion” regime for those complicit in fraud against the state. There would also be more robust oversight of public grant and loan schemes in future with counter-fraud experts, data management and analytics all involved to prevent financial losses. “The cost to the taxpayer of Covid fraud is estimated at £7.2bn with every one of those cheques signed by Rishi Sunak as chancellor and yet just 2% of fraudulent Covid grants have been recovered,” Reeves will say. “We will appoint a Covid corruption commissioner equipped with the powers they need and the mandate to do what it takes to chase those who have ripped off the taxpayer, taking them to court and clawing back every penny of taxpayers money that they can. That money belongs in our NHS, it belongs in our schools, it belongs in our police and conference – we want that money back.” During the pandemic the government suspended its usual procurement processes and introduced a highly secretive VIP “fast lane” for procurement of goods including protective equipment. It later wrote off £8.7bn it had spent on defective or overpriced PPE. Jolyon Maugham, the founder of the Good Law Project campaign group, said: “The scale of PPE waste and corruption is sickening: over £10bn lost; more than four in every five pounds spent. If you’re serious about looking after public money – yours and mine – you want those billions back. Recovering them starts with political will. Until now that has been sorely lacking – so this is a very positive development.” In her speech to party activists, Reeves also will announce that a Labour government would accelerate the planning process for critical national infrastructure as part of plans to revive the sluggish economy. The changes would include updating all national policy statements, some of which have not been revised for over a decade, within the first six months of Labour entering office. These would detail what types of projects the country needs while weaving considerations about economic growth and net zero into the planning system. Planning applications would be fast-tracked for battery factories, laboratories and 5G infrastructure. Decision times for major infrastructure projects have increased by 65% since 2012, now taking four years, she will say, promising a “once-in-a-generation” set of reforms to speed this up. However, there would be a push to win over residents so they feel that construction is in their interests. There would be a menu of potential incentives such as cheaper energy bills to help communities welcome clean energy projects. Labour would tackle time-consuming litigation by setting clearer national guidance for developers on consulting local communities. Local council planning departments would receive a boost with the appointment of 300 new planning officers, funded by raising the stamp duty surcharge on non-UK residents. In her speech, Reeves will address criticism of Labour that it has been too focused on providing reassurance to voters, and not giving them enough to inspire them, with senior party figures saying that the £28bn green investment plan will be key to this. “Labour’s task is to restore hope to our politics,” she will say. “The hope that lets us face the future with confidence, with a new era of economic security because there is no hope without security. You cannot dream big if you cannot sleep in peace at night. The peace that comes from knowing you have enough to put aside for a rainy day and the knowledge that, when you need them, strong public services will be there for you and your family. “The strength that allows a society to withstand global shocks because it is from those strong foundations of security that hope can spring.”",Labour conference 2023; Coronavirus; Labour; Rachel Reeves; Health policy; Conservatives; Labour conference; Health; Politics; UK news; Public services policy; Society,Politics
2024-02-18T06:00:38Z,Starmer allies gripped by fear of Labour complacency amid byelection triumphs ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/18/starmer-allies-gripped-by-fear-of-labour-complacency-amid-byelection-triumphs,"For the past few months, with Labour enjoying a stubbornly large double-digit lead in the polls, close allies of Keir Starmer remained obsessed with the notion that complacency will slip into the mindsets of MPs, advisers and activists. In a breathless week that saw Labour veer from having to abandon one byelection before scooping previously safe Tory seats in two others, the obsessives were given three opportunities to drive their point home. The first was the most alarming. When it emerged that the party’s experienced Rochdale byelection candidate Azhar Ali had told a private meeting that Israel “allowed” the 7 October attacks by Hamas, an initial decision was made to stand by him – a move described as “terrible” by some in the shadow cabinet. After it was then revealed he had said “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” were fuelling criticism of a pro-Palestinian MP, the decision was taken to cut him loose. “The truth is, they’re just a bit slow at decision-making,” said one shadow minister. “It’s as simple as that.” For a leader who listed changing the party and weeding out antisemitism as one of his central achievements, it could scarcely have been worse. For the complacency hawks, it served as a reminder of the vigilance needed. “You’ve got to use all these things to strengthen what you do,” said one senior figure. “We’ve changed the party at an absolute rapid speed. But you can just tell in the last week why the risk of complacency around party change is there. There’s a reminder for the whole party: it’s not that long ago we were a party Jewish people feared about getting into government.” There was also fury within the leader’s office over comments from Ed Balls. The former shadow chancellor defended Graham Jones, another candidate suspended for comments made at the same meeting attended by Ali. Balls said Jones was “not a Corbynite, not hard left – absolutely not anti-Israel”. That angered those dealing with the row. “It is a sign of an organisation that is not voter-focused,” said one. “Irrespective of what wing of the party you come from, party change needs to be a permanent change. You can’t backslide.” The second moment for complacency hunters came as Labour’s bad week suddenly ended in celebration, as the party scooped two more previously safe Tory seats in the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections and watched a beleaguered Rishi Sunak blame “midterm” difficulties (the election is now just months away). Once again, it was taken by several shadow cabinet ministers as a cue to reprimand those celebrating too early. “You just keep getting people talking as if the next election has already been won at all levels – whether that’s MPs, party members, Labour party supporters. There’s a sense of: ‘The next election is won – so why aren’t we doing more of this or more of that’, including whatever their pet project is,” said one shadow cabinet member. “The election hasn’t happened. Not a single vote has been cast. Byelections have been fantastic, but byelections are not a general election.” The third moment came in the form of new analysis passed to Starmer’s team last week. It contained fresh modelling designed to answer that ultimate question: whatever the polls say now, how may voters behave when the election arrives? In a counter to models based on current polling, such as one in the last week that put Labour on course for an improbable 254-seat majority, the document examines several scenarios. Its central scenario is one that many Labour pessimists believe is the most likely – where many voters who say they “don’t know” who they will back return to the party they supported at the last election, while wavering Tory switchers head back to Sunak. It leaves Labour with a workable 78-seat majority – roughly the size of that enjoyed by Boris Johnson, but not 1997 all over again. It also contains a scenario of a Reform UK collapse. That would see Labour with 312 seats and no majority at all. It was “very helpful in concentrating minds”, said one senior figure. Josh Simons, director of the Labour Together group, which conducted the analysis, said: “For years, the evidence has shown that months out from an election, voters answer a different question to the one pollsters intend. They report dissatisfaction with the government, not the judgment they will make alone in the ballot box on polling day. He added: “The Westminster bubble thinks Labour has it in the bag. But in recent years the bubble has had an excellent track record of getting it wrong. Those who want a new government in Britain would be unwise, even for a moment, to be complacent.” Even as party officials worry away about how and when things can go wrong, they do not have to wait long for a new threat. This week, the Scottish National party (SNP) plans to hold a new Commons vote calling for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza – a demand that goes further than Starmer’s backing for a “sustainable ceasefire”. A series of frontbenchers have already had to step down in order to back a similar SNP motion in November. Labour has not yet announced how it will order MPs to vote, but the issue is causing agonies for many Labour MPs this weekend. “People are seriously worried – we’re talking about a Labour rebellion of 100 plus if we don’t have a decent amendment,” said one MP who backed the previous motion. Others were anxious to know if they were going to be ordered to oppose or abstain. One senior MP said there would be a serious backlash from MPs and voters, including liberal voters the party relies on in some seats, should their party not back the motion. “People like me will back that unless they are going to threaten us with suspension,” they said. While Labour’s strong poll lead means analysts do not believe seats will be lost because of its position on Gaza, MPs with large Muslim communities and big groups of leftwing, liberal voters – already concerned by Labour ditching its pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment – are nervous. Discipline will be severely tested. In an open letter to Labour MPs seen by the Observer, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, made a direct appeal to them. “Since Westminster rejected a ceasefire in November, more than 28,000 Palestinian children, women and men have been killed – and huge swathes of Gaza have been obliterated, including hospitals and family homes,” he writes. “More than a million Palestinians have been displaced – and the population is facing a growing humanitarian crisis. “The intolerable situation in Gaza is far more important than any narrow party loyalties – and it places a moral duty on all of us to act … For those Labour MPs who are wavering, I urge you to press Keir Starmer to change his position. “If he won’t, I urge you to be on the right side of history and join us in doing the only right thing by voting for an immediate ceasefire now.” And beyond the immediate problems posed by the SNP vote, there is the prospect of the Rochdale byelection later this month that the party will now not contest. Labour’s withdrawal of support for Ali means there is a much better chance for George Galloway, the former Labour MP who has previously displaced the party in two other seats. He is campaigning relentlessly on Gaza and Starmer’s refusal to back an immediate ceasefire. Should Galloway claim victory, he will have six months to heap pressure on Labour MPs over the issue in the House of Commons. If that is the case, the party’s ability to deal with crises – while maintaining that prized poll lead – may soon be tested to an even greater extent within weeks.",Labour; Byelections; Keir Starmer; Conservatives; Local politics; Politics; UK news; Rishi Sunak; Local government,Politics
2024-03-08T05:00:44Z,‘We have never been this close’: Portuguese far right aims for election breakthrough,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/08/portuguese-populist-andre-ventura-chega-aims-for-election-breakthrough,"Tempting as the tables of savoury pastries were, and strong as the voice of the shaven-headed singer belting out Phil Collins was, they were not the lure that had drawn 200 people to a remote wedding venue in northern Portugal on a cold and ink-black Wednesday evening. Despite the sign at the opposite end of the hall reading “Let’s get this party started”, the audience’s attention was more focused on a huge campaign poster behind the singer that offered a less hedonistic exhortation: “Portugal needs a CLEAN-UP.” At the side of the stage, ringed by colleagues, admirers and a skittish security team that counts a former Olympic shot-putter among its muscle, was the man wielding the political mop. For many disgruntled Portuguese voters, André Ventura, the former football pundit who founded the far-right Chega party five years ago, is the obvious choice as the country prepares to head to the polls in Sunday’s snap general election. While his political opponents warn that Ventura and his populism will drag Portugal back to the past, his supporters see him as the champion of an electorate that is weary of the business-as-usual bipartisan system, as the scourge of corruption and as the only politician willing to call things as he sees them and shout “Chega!” (“Enough!”). Polls suggest that although Chega is set to finish third behind the centre-right Democratic Socialist party (PSD) and the ruling Socialist party (PS) in the election, it could take 15% to 20% of the vote, making it a potential kingmaker for a new rightwing administration. If the atmosphere in the large function room was not quite that of a stadium rock concert – it felt more like an odd collision of family wedding, open-mic night, barn dance and political lecture – the welcome extended to the Chega leader was full-throated. As soon as he arrived in a dark suit, striped shirt, pink tie and customary stubble, Ventura, 41, was greeted with chants of “Por-tu-gal! Por-tu-gal!” and “Che-ga! Che-ga!”. By the time he took his seat, fans were jabbing the air with their fingers splayed in victory signs and chorusing “Ven-tu-ra! Ven-tu-ra!”. Diamantino de Sá Alves, 73, a retired member of Portugal’s gendarmes, the National Republican Guard, had been waiting for Ventura’s arrival, a Chega scarf around his neck and a party banner in his hand. “The reason I’m here tonight is very simple,” he said. “I’ve voted for every party out there but I think that currently Chega is the one that offers the best option for change.” He said Ventura was the only politician in parliament “whose words the Portuguese people can truly understand”. The Chega leader is certainly frank when it comes to his bugbears. Over the course of his 20-minute speech in Mouçós, he railed against road tolls, rapists, paedophiles, political cronyism, called the rightwing electoral platform the Democratic Alliance a “Spanish brothel”, and told the audience they were the country’s “last hope”. Ventura said Sunday’s election was about challenging “50 years of corruption” since Portugal’s return to democracy, “50 years of taxes that were used to support parasites” and a stale political status quo that had destroyed the country’s self-esteem. Notably absent from Ventura’s jeremiad were any new attacks on Portugal’s Roma population, a community he has previously attempted to demonise as having “a chronic problem of dependence on benefits, delinquency and violence”. Nor was immigration – a big issue for many Chega voters – on his mind that night. He chose instead to focus on his party’s possible breakthrough. “Never in the history of Portugal has there been a greater possibility of overthrowing the bipartisan system that has been killing us for the past 50 years,” he said. “We have never been this close.” Ventura’s leveraging of political disenchantment and fears over corruption is hardly surprising. Dissatisfaction with the PS, which has run the country for the past eight years, has been exacerbated by Portugal’s housing crisis, stressed public services, low wages and a series of corruption scandals. The early election was triggered by the collapse of the socialist government of António Costa, who stepped down as prime minister last November amid an investigation into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects. Costa, who has not been accused of any crime and maintains he has a clear conscience, said he felt he had to step down because “the duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”. Although Ventura was once a rising star in the conservative PSD before leaving the party to form Chega, he now seeks to portray his former colleagues as part of an old problem that only he can solve. André Azevedo Alves, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Portugal and St Mary’s University, London, attributes Chega’s continuing ascent – it took 1.3% of the vote in the 2019 elections and 7.2% in 2022 – to its adept harnessing of the prevailing mood. “It’s Ventura sensing that there is a political opportunity because of this widespread discontent with the political class, left and right,” he said. “I think that’s one of the main things that Chega feeds on.” While immigration may be a concern “for a significant chunk of the voters who would align with Chega”, he added, housing, public services and wages remain the key issues in the election – hence Ventura’s efforts to hammer the two biggest parties for their failure to improve things for the average Portuguese person. The other important factor in Chega’s rise, said Azevedo Alves, was Ventura himself. “I think part of the reason why you have had this Portuguese exception of not having a successful radical-right party is because until 2019, when Ventura first got into parliament, there wasn’t a skilled enough political entrepreneur who was able to capitalise on this,” he said. “You have had radical-right and far-right parties in Portugal in the past 50 years, but they’ve always failed to get into parliament. To be frank, it’s because they’ve been really odd.” Ventura, in contrast, is slick, plausible – and pragmatic rather than deeply ideological. “He knows how to shift his pitch to appeal to different groups of voters,” Azevedo Alves said. “Personally, I don’t think he’s very ideological at all – and I think that’s also an important difference when you compare Ventura with other radical-right leaders in Europe.” That flexibility may be one of the drivers of Chega’s growth. While the typical Chega voter at the last election was disproportionately male and in their mid-30s to mid-50s, things are moving, especially among younger people. The party’s most recognisable face after Ventura is a 25-year-old MP and self-declared anti-feminist called Rita Matias, who was also rapturously received in Mouçós. Surveys suggest Chega’s social media push and campus events are paying off: according to polls, it is now the most popular party among Portuguese people aged 18-34. Among those attending the Mouçós event was Cátia Baptista, a 21-year-old law student who said she felt her post-graduation future would probably lie elsewhere. “Portugal is a country where it seems that only the PS and the PSD exist but Portugal is also not a very good country to live in,” she said. “The people who can afford it go abroad to work.” Although the PSD’s leader, Luís Montenegro, has categorically ruled out any deal with the far-right party, dismissing Ventura’s views as “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic”, Chega is quietly confident that it has the momentum it needs to play a major role in ushering Portugal’s next government into office. Azevedo Alves said: “If there’s a clear majority on the right, I don’t think Montenegro will go back on his word and reach out to Ventura for a deal. But I do think that there will be huge pressure on the right not to allow the defeated socialist party to continue in power because the parties on the right can’t find any form of agreement.” Prematurely or not, the mood in the banqueting hall in Mouçós was jubilant and the event included a post-dinner dance. One of the last songs played – and heartily sung along to – was not a Phil Collins number but Da Vinci’s Conquistador. Portugal’s catchy 1989 Eurovision entry, the song speaks of “raising proud flags”, lists Portugal’s colonial conquests, from Brazil to Angola and from Goa to Macau, and reminds the listener “I was once a conqueror”. Earlier in the evening, while waiting for the guest of honour to appear, one of the attenders said he was sick of hearing Chega described as a bunch of far-right extremists. “We all have the right to have a voice, and when people criticise us and write us off, they’re discriminating against us,” said Luís Teixeira, 32, a salesperson. “We’re not the ones who are backing away from the PSD, it’s the PSD that has backed away from us. We’ve given them a lot of chances but they don’t represent us. What André Ventura wants is to bring that party towards our ideas and into our fold.”",Portugal; The far right; Europe; World news,World news
2023-12-04T07:00:37Z,My generation can’t wait any longer for climate action – and Europe could hold the key | Alexander Hurst,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/04/climate-crisis-europe-eu-emissions-us,"Something flipped last summer in both the visibility of the climate crisis and in the space the media devotes to it. Apparently, all it took was for the air to turn orange and unbreathable above Wall Street and for smoke to smother holidaymakers in Greece. And yet, despite the fact that the conversation finally feels like it is approaching the level of ubiquitousness that the crisis merits, the solutions being proposed leave me deflated. And that’s not merely because of the lunatic hypocrisy of holding the Cop28 in Dubai, where it will be presided over by the CEO of the world’s 12th-largest fossil-fuel company. In Europe, where the right still seems to inhabit a reality shared with everyone else, it is nevertheless pushing back against the still-insufficient commitments the EU has made. (Despite being insufficient, these are the most serious large-scale commitments to cut emissions in the world.) Critiquing US Republicans on climate policy seems as pointless as criticising Dr Evil for planning world domination. But even among the US left, there is a disconnect between the gravity and global nature of the crisis, and policy proposals more focused on banning certain behaviours to relatively small-scale effect than on driving systemic change. Without seeking to discourage anyone from living a more climate-virtuous life, individual choices are not enough. Not when global greenhouse gas emissions are primarily about generating electricity and heat (around 38%), non-aviation transport (21%), and agriculture (23%). And at worst, the focus on individuals may even be purposeful distraction. As Michael Mann, one of the climate scientists responsible for the “hockey-stick curve”, points out: “British Petroleum gave us one of the first individual carbon footprint calculators because BP, the fossil fuel industry, wanted us so focused on our own carbon footprint so that we ignored theirs.” I see a growing despair in my own age cohort and the one behind us. We desperately want creative, ambitious and systemic action, and in its absence, there is rage. I’m not sure if western governments truly grasp the extent to which their demographic future is losing faith in institutions across the board – even as liberal democracy itself is a house of cards built on little more than the faith of the people who live in it. And yet, at the same time, those governments are caught in a trap, because the maths of global emissions is no longer just about Europe (7%) and the United States (13%), even if it historically was. I’m not saying this to excuse European or American inaction – if blame is what we’re after, then let’s be clear about who is responsible: the fossil-fuel executives who knew, for decades, what their products would do and intentionally obfuscated, misled and blocked regulation; our grandparents, who blew the chance in the 80s and 90s to “leave a better world to their children” and instead elected leaders who did the environmental opposite; and our boomer parents, who did know better, but dawdled too long to do things decisively and at scale. I’m saying it because, if Europe is going to take a serious step towards corralling global action on climate change, it will have to do so in a way that influences what happens beyond its borders. And not simply by setting a good example, but by incentivising others to follow suit. Where Europe does have weight is economically – especially if it were to pursue a coordinated, climate-focused trade policy with the United States. At a recent panel at Sciences Po’s Paris School of International Affairs, Daniel Esty, an environmental lawyer who helped negotiate the original 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (which gave birth to the annual Cops), was hopeful that at the World Trade Organization’s next round of talks, countries would put sustainability at the centre of global trade by ending fossil-fuel subsidies while allowing subsidies and industrial policy that promote sustainability. If it plays out that way, great. But if it doesn’t, we don’t have time to wait fiddling at the edges. In the event of failure, the EU must be even more ambitious with its carbon market: the emissions trading scheme (ETS) and impending carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), a first-of-its kind mechanism known as the “carbon border tax”. In the ETS, there is an economic incentive for everyone to reduce emissions. EU companies regulated by the scheme must purchase permits to account for each tonne of carbon they emit; polluters pay, non-polluters can sell permits they didn’t need to use. The CBAM, meanwhile, obliges importers to pay tax on “embedded emissions” in goods entering the EU’s single market. When I asked, Esty said that he considers both mechanisms to be “conceptually correct” when it comes to driving emissions reductions. What if the EU built on these initiatives by creating a “climate club”? Inside the club, the ETS would reign, subsidies that promoted sustainability would be allowed, trade would be open and the proceeds from the sale of carbon permits could be directed to financing green investment in lower-income members. After all, people in developing countries should not be paying the price, be it economic or environmental, for a crisis they did not create. On the flipside, many developing countries stand to benefit in the long run from a trade regime that prices emissions, notably because many have huge renewable energy potential. The virtuous behaviour inside the “club” would be protected by a beefed-up CBAM, which would become progressively more punitive as time went on. As the club grew, so would the benefits of joining – and the costs of remaining outside. This would amount to throwing down a gauntlet to the United States, which, under a second-term Biden presidency, may be coaxed into reversing its historic stance and joining. If it did, it would result in the type of gamechanging “mega-Brussels effect” that Peter Orszag, former director of the US Office of Management and Budget, recently wrote about. Under a hypothetical president Trump, the challenge posed by a European climate club would certainly backfire. But then again, a hypothetical president Trump would leave Nato and launch a trade war against the EU anyway. So, as Trump himself said often on the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, “What have you got to lose?” The answer, we know, is “our planet”. Alexander Hurst is a Guardian columnist.

2023-09-26T05:00:27Z,"‘Staggering’ green growth gives hope for 1.5C, says global energy chief",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/26/staggering-green-growth-gives-hope-for-15c-says-global-energy-head,"The prospects of the world staying within the 1.5C limit on global heating have brightened owing to the “staggering” growth of renewable energy and green investment in the past two years, the chief of the world’s energy watchdog has said. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, and the world’s foremost energy economist, said much more needed to be done but that the rapid uptake of solar power and electric vehicles were encouraging. “Despite the scale of the challenges, I feel more optimistic than I felt two years ago,” he said in an interview. “Solar photovoltaic installations and electric vehicle sales are perfectly in line with what we said they should be, to be on track to reach net zero by 2050, and thus stay within 1.5C. Clean energy investments in the last two years have seen a staggering 40% increase.” But Birol also noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector were “still stubbornly high”, and that the extreme weather seen around the world this year had shown the climate was already changing “at frightening speed”. The IEA, in a report entitled Net Zero Roadmap, published on Tuesday morning, also called on developed countries with 2050 net zero targets, including the UK, to bring them forward by several years. The report found “almost all countries must move forward their targeted net zero dates”, which for most developed countries are 2050. Some developed countries have earlier dates, such as Germany with 2045 and Austria and Iceland with 2040 and for many developing countries they are much later, 2060 in the case of China and 2070 for India. Cop28, the UN climate summit to be held in Dubai this November and December, offered a key opportunity for countries to set out tougher emissions-cutting plans, Birol said. He wants to see Cop28 agree a tripling of renewable energy by 2030, and a 75% cut in methane from the energy sector by the same date. The latter could be achieved at little cost, because high gas prices mean that plugging leaks from oil and gas wells can be profitable. But Birol warned that the geopolitical situation, with many nations at loggerheads over the war in Ukraine, and still frosty relations between the US and China, would make for a difficult summit. He said: “The most important challenge [to limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels] is the lack of international cooperation. Cop28 is a critical juncture, and should send a strong signal to energy markets that governments are taking the climate seriously. They should move to reduce the consumption of unabated fossil fuels.” He also called for Cop28 to agree a doubling of energy efficiency. “To reduce fossil fuel emissions, we need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. This is a golden condition, if we are to reach our climate goals,” he said. Birol stopped short of endorsing the call that some countries have made for a full phase-out of fossil fuels by 2050 to be agreed at Cop28, but he said all countries must work on reducing their fossil fuel use. Rishi Sunak, the UK’s prime minister, last week reaffirmed his commitment to net zero by 2050, but reversed and delayed some key policies that would help to attain the goal. Sunak is also planning a large new round of North Sea oil and gas licences, despite clear advice from the IEA that no new upstream oil or gas projects should be built on the road to net zero. Birol also refused to single out any countries, but made it clear that the richest countries should be moving much faster on renewable energy, energy efficiency, reducing fossil fuel use and bringing forward their net zero targets. Birol said: “Advanced economies have special responsibilities in fighting climate change. What I would expect advanced economies to do is to increase their ambition further, rather than reducing it. Clean energy would create lots of new jobs and employment, and build a modern industry [needed] to have a competitive position with other countries. Industry knows that the next chapter of global industry is based on clean energy technologies.” Tessa Khan, executive director at Uplift, a campaigning organisation, said: “This [IEA report] is yet more confirmation from the world’s energy experts that we can’t have new oil and gas projects if we’re going to stay within a safe climate, and that massively scaling up renewables is key to achieving that. “Yet the UK is part of a tiny club of wealthy countries that while professing to lead on climate is massively expanding oil and gas production. Just five nations – the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK – are responsible for over half of all planned oil and gas field developments from now to 2050.”","Green economy; Green politics; Energy; Climate crisis; Environment; Solar power; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Greenhouse gas emissions; Travel and transport; Renewable energy",Environment
2023-09-24T04:00:13Z,‘This is just a Tory line – they don’t care about us’: Taunton’s voters refuse to buy into Sunak’s net zero U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/24/this-is-just-a-tory-line-they-dont-care-about-us-tauntons-voters-refuse-to-buy-into-sunaks-net-zero-u-turn,"Emergency worker Alice Bowen pauses for a moment in the golden autumnal sunshine warming the bustling centre of Taunton. She should be exactly the kind of voter receptive to the prime minister’s efforts to help struggling families by junking what he claims are costly net zero pledges. “We are a family of four. We cannot afford to get an electric car,” she says, as shoppers and office staff queue for sandwiches and bags of chips in Somerset’s county town. “It is not feasible for us. We both work full-time. He is a civil servant and I’m in emergency services. It’s not like we have bad jobs – it’s just that the cost is very prohibitive.” But Bowen, 34, does not for a second buy into Rishi Sunak’s attempts to position himself as a friend of hard-pressed families – and plans to vote for the Liberal Democrats, who are seeking to overturn an 11,700 Conservative majority in Taunton Deane. “Sunak is not relatable in any way, especially when you know what his wife does,” she notes, referring to the wealth of Sunak and his heiress wife, Akshata Murty, who are among the richest people in Britain. This is echoed by other parents on the high street, where union jacks and Somerset red dragon flags flutter in a gentle breeze. Grounds maintenance worker Terence Lowe, 38, who is out shopping with his daughter, scoffs at Sunak’s suggestion the old net zero goals would have imposed unacceptable costs on the British people. “That’s just the line [the Tories] give you to make out that they are doing it for you, but they don’t care,” he says, resting on his crutches, which he is using to recover from a sporting injury. “Just look at the amount of private jets [Sunak] takes. He doesn’t care about the cost of living crisis. Let’s be honest … he lives in a totally different world than we do.” There are also fears here that delaying the transition to a zero-carbon economy could jeopardise the green investment starting to come into the county. Tata, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, is building a giant electric vehicle battery factory in Somerset, creating 4,000 jobs and many more in the supply chain. “As soon as you take your foot off the accelerator, which they’re doing, then it will risk investment, because firms will go elsewhere,” says a steward at Somerset cricket ground, who asks not to be named. “They will go to other countries working to make the world a greener place.” Even those who wholeheartedly support delaying green targets cannot bring themselves to vote Conservative again. “Sunak has made the right move politically for the party but whether it would make any difference for us … probably not at this point,” says Vivien Bowers, strolling with her husband, Tim, towards the muddy waters of the River Tone. The couple plan to spoil their ballot papers at the general election, which is expected next year. “We both voted Tory last time,” says Tim. “But we are disillusioned with politics. At the moment, we’re going to go in and write ‘politics is not working’ and spoil the ballot – at least that would be noted.” Yet there are some staunch Conservative voters who are pleased that Sunak is delaying a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars. Andy Smith, 78, says electric cars are too expensive and the changing infrastructure will not be ready by 2030: “He’s done the right thing to put it off for a while because we cannot afford it.” His friend Teresa Lawrence, however, is not convinced by Sunak’s big reset. “I don’t know if he understands because of his privileged life.” Lawrence, 78, may switch from Conservative to Labour. “I always was Conservative but I’m not in the financial situation where I should be voting Conservative. I’m torn.” There is no shortage of ideas about how Sunak could actually help those such as Lawrence feeling the pinch of rising costs. David Waddilove, 69, who is a member of a local climate action group, says: “If it was actually about helping with the cost of living, then there were a lot of other things they could be immediately doing, including bigger windfall taxes [on oil and gas producers] and reorganising the tax system so the ultrarich are paying a little bit more and the rest of us could get by a little bit more.”. Tory-supporting residents feel like the time might be up for Conservative environment minister Rebecca Pow, who has seen her majority in Taunton Deane slip from almost 15,500 to 11,700 since she won in 2015. Retired maths teacher Geraldine Brearley, 72, will still be voting for Pow but she suspects the Conservatives will lose the seat: “I think people are struggling and when you struggle you think: ‘I’m going to try and change this.’”",Green politics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Politics; Liberal Democrats; Local elections,Environment
2023-09-20T06:58:31Z,Senior Tories express unease over Sunak’s intention to roll back climate policies,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/20/rishi-sunak-climate-green-policies-tory-mps,"Rishi Sunak’s determination to roll back some of the UK’s key climate policies risks opening up rifts within his own party, as senior Conservatives expressed their deep unease at the move. Proposals to delay or water down green measures, such as pushing back the dates for ending sales of petrol and diesel cars, and gas boilers, are likely to be fleshed out later this week. The move is intended to drive a “green wedge” between the Tories and Labour, whose leader, Sir Keir Starmer, vowed this summer to “throw everything” at the climate crisis. But there are strong indications that the wedge could end up being driven into the Tory party itself. Many senior Conservatives, who have championed policies to support the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, are furious at what they see as a U-turn and betrayal. Ben Goldsmith, the chair of the Conservative Environment Network, told the Guardian: “Any decision to backtrack in our efforts to tackle the greatest challenge of our time would be on the wrong side of history, and of the polls too. People of all political persuasions want immediate action. They want nature restored and the climate problem solved. They know that the solutions are cleaner, better and increasingly cheaper than the polluting industries which stand to benefit from continued inaction.” Alok Sharma, the former cabinet minister who led the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, is in New York for the UN secretary general’s climate ambition summit, taking place on Wednesday, alongside the UN general assembly. He wrote on Twitter: “For any party to resile from this agenda will not help economically or electorally.” Chris Skidmore, the outgoing Tory MP and former minister who wrote a review of the Tories’ net zero approach, also warned of the economic consequences. He said: “If this is true, the decision will cost the UK jobs, inward investment and future economic growth that could have been ours by committing to the industries of the future. It will potentially destabilise thousands of jobs and see investment go elsewhere. And ultimately, the people who will pay the price for this will be householders whose bills will remain higher as a result of inefficient fossil fuels and being dependent on volatile international fossil fuel prices.” The Guardian has seen evidence that Conservative MPs are privately discussing sending letters of no confidence in the prime minister to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee, with a view to gathering enough support for a vote. Voices on the right of the Tory party, and in sections of the rightwing media, have been urging the prime minister to take an anti-net zero tack since he took office last year. They want to generate a “culture war”, akin to that seen in the US where most of the candidates hoping to bag the Republican party nomination for president have refused to affirm climate science, or shrugged off the need for climate action. Whether such a culture war could work in the UK is a matter of doubt. In polls, large majorities of voters consistently say they want to see strong action on the climate. Young people are particularly engaged, citing the climate as a top priority. Businesses, too, have long geared up to fulfil their part in net zero – many will have their plans thrown off course by any U-turn, and will be exasperated by a recurrence of the political turmoil they thought had been settled with the defenestration of Liz Truss. Sam Richards, a former Tory Downing Street adviser under Boris Johnson, now founder of the Britain Remade thinktank, contrasted Sunak’s actions with the green investment strategies of Joe Biden in the US, the EU and China. “At the very moment [they] and others are investing trillions in building new clean industries, the government now appears set to inject more uncertainty for businesses and put Britain further behind our rivals,” he said. When at the Treasury, Sunak frequently obstructed or watered down green policies put forward by Boris Johnson, including hobbling measures to insulate Britain’s homes. But when he took over after the disastrous leadership of Liz Truss, who sought to roll back green measures and cast doubt on the net zero target, he appeared willing to restore a moderate approach. His cabinet contained several proponents of climate action, including the self-identified green Tory Jeremy Hunt, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, and the former environment secretary Michael Gove. However, members of cabinet previously identified with green issues seem to have swallowed their misgivings. Zac Goldsmith, the former MP ennobled by Boris Johnson, carried on as minister under Sunak until his resignation in late June. Shortly after his resignation, he criticised those he felt were back-pedalling. “I don’t think you can understand and care about the gravity of this issue and at the same time be willing to take your foot off the accelerator for political expediency,” he told the Guardian at the time. “I just think that would require you to be a monster.”",Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Politics; UK news; Green politics; Environment; Climate crisis,Politics
2023-09-20T19:48:38Z,Sunak’s net zero U-turn is so toxic that it’s united Greens and car manufacturers against him | Caroline Lucas,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/20/rishi-sunak-net-zero-u-turn-green-mps-car-manufacturers-caroline-lucas,"It’s quite a moment when a Green party MP finds herself on the same side of an argument as the chair of Ford UK – but here we are. Claims reported by the BBC yesterday evening that Rishi Sunak is planning to weaken some of the government’s key climate commitments have managed to unite businesses, the energy sector, car manufacturers, environmental groups and the general public against him. His leaked programme appears not to be a couple of minor delays here and there but instead a coordinated, calculated and catastrophic roll-back. According to the leak, energy efficiency targets for private rented homes will be dropped; the ban on new petrol and diesel cars will be pushed back to 2035; the phasing out of gas boilers will be delayed; plans for taxes to discourage flying ditched; recycling schemes cancelled. The leak from the BBC was big enough news for the prime minister to make a highly unusual late-evening statement, anticipating – and seeking to defend himself from – an almighty backlash. Several lines from this proclamation are enough to make you rub your eyes in disbelief. “Our political system rewards short-term decision-making that is holding our country back,” is one such line. For years now, the environment has been a priority – right up until it’s not. David Cameron was hugging huskies for years, until he decided to slash solar panel subsidies and impose a de facto ban onshore wind because of an ill-perceived lack of popularity. Not long after his election in October, Sunak created the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero – a name which now rings hollow as we expect him to renege on crucial pledges that will help us deliver it. “Real change”, as Sunak’s statement puts it, is always thwarted in favour of appeasing a handful of rightwing Tory backbenchers. “Politicians … have not been honest about costs and trade-offs,” laments Sunak – and they most certainly haven’t. I haven’t heard the prime minister once outline how green investment will not only pay for itself over time, but pay literal dividends – switching from fossil fuels to clean energy could globally save as much as £10.2tn by 2050. But the even greater crime is that no politician is willing to outline what the cost of not tackling the climate emergency will be. Cameron’s decision a decade ago to cut the “green crap” ended up adding an average £150 annually to every household’s energy bill. The Office for Budget Responsibility says that continuing to rely on fossil gas for power and heating in the UK could end up costing double the public investment required to phase down gas use and reach net zero. Meanwhile, the Treasury currently supports the fossil fuel industry through tax breaks and subsidies to the tune of £10bn a year. Where’s the honesty about these costs? Sunak’s claim that “Britain is leading the world on climate change” requires some serious scrutiny. Because where we are succeeding, it’s certainly not as a result of any of his efforts. Yes, we’ve passed the Climate Change Act; yes, we’ve increased offshore wind power; and yes, we were the first country to declare a climate emergency. That’s the easy stuff, and he didn’t do any of it. England installed only two onshore wind turbines last year – Ukraine managed more. His government approved the first new coalmine in a generation. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) recently said the government’s climate progress is “worryingly slow”. This isn’t “world-leading”, by any stretch. Sunak will argue, as he does in his statement, that we must prioritise the “long-term needs of our country before the short-term political needs of the moment”. Oh, the irony! Thinking in the long term would mean rolling out a street by street, local authority-led, mass home insulation programme to cut energy bills and carbon emissions now and long into the future – yet he’s now rolling back measures to deliver it. It would mean providing climate finance to the global south – yet this pledge is teetering on the brink. It would mean adapting to the emergency – yet the CCC says the government is “strikingly unprepared” for this scenario. What this all reveals is that Sunak really doesn’t seem to care about the climate in the slightest – it’s little more than an afterthought. When asked by ITV recently if it was one of his top five priorities, he brushed the question aside, as if it would be ridiculous to make it so. Yet polling shows it has long been one of the public’s top three priorities, let alone top five. If Sunak mistakenly thinks the climate is merely a political device to draw dividing lines between his party and Labour, he will fail on his own terms. All it will do is draw an ever-greater divide between him and the people he seeks to govern.

2023-11-06T17:00:43Z,This king’s speech will deliver the final blows from a Tory party facing oblivion | Polly Toynbee ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/06/kings-speech-tory-party-homeless-people-labour-rishi-sunak-britain,"The silk bag holds the government’s plans not just for a year but for “the next 70”, says the prime minister, whose sands of time are fast running out. Improbably he promises to “address the challenges this country faces” with no “short-term gimmicks”; yet we expect a king’s speech short on the long-term and scattered with infantile banana skins that Labour will skip over lightly. Little that is announced on Tuesday or in the autumn statement will even touch the edges of what troubles everyone most: the cost of living, rising NHS waiting lists, the climate crisis, declining public services, deepening hardship, regional inequality and immigration. Watch out for announcements that ignore all that matters, or make things worse. A country teetering in a permacrisis – part accidental, but mostly of the government’s own making – suffers from austerity, Brexit and maladministration. Four prime ministers and five chancellors in five years, with inadequate ministers in a fast-spin cycle, have brought us to this. Paying bills tops public anxiety, but inflation won’t drop to the “normal level” of 2% until the end of 2025, says the Bank of England, which expects food price inflation to still be around 10% at Christmas, with the UK’s inflation the highest in the G7. Despite an almost identical growth rate, France is unhindered by a tax-to-GDP ratio of 48%, compared with the UK’s tax take of 33.5%. And it shows. You get what you pay for, and the Institute for Government’s survey of UK public services reveals that almost all of them are declining, crippled by underinvestment since 2010. Councils’ services, such as social care, care of children, homeless accommodation, libraries and leisure centres are collapsing, as they tumble into bankruptcy. Spending plans for after 2025 make the outlook even worse for all services, yet Tories clamour to use the £13bn the Treasury gains from extra tax receipts owing to inflation for tax cuts. That’s a “fiscal illusion”, says the Resolution Foundation, since it’s needed to cover inflation in all departments; or else yet deeper spending cuts will have to be made. Expect some sensible measures: reform of feudal leaseholds (watered down) and a renters bill to end no-fault evictions (but not until solving an impossible court case backlog). A for ever smoking ban, in which the legal age will be raised by a year, every year, is the one policy Sunak can genuinely call “long-term” for the next “70 years”. Anti-terror security for venues may come with the draconian banning of speech that “undermines” British values, one of which is free speech. A crime and justice bill extending whole-life sentences and jailing shoplifters will add to overflowing prisons. The Mail on Sunday got a tasty morsel with a “new law to crack down on airlines’ sneaky add-on charges”, while the Sun got “cops to be handed powers to bust into phone thieves’ homes without a search warrant”. The rest will be “traps” for Labour, notably increasing North Sea oil drilling. Is Rishi Sunak’s anti-green, anti-rail, anti-Ulez, pro-car, pro-oil posturing a winner? Planet-boiling indifference is not “long-termism”, while voters will see weaponising the climate as political cynicism: drivers also worry about fires and floods. A bill banning councils from boycotting other countries, actions often targeted at Israel, may taunt Labour, as may Michael Gove’s ban on four-day weeks for council workers regardless of staff retention. His threats to council CEOs earning £100,000 are a useless decoy to explain council bankruptcies. These aren’t even “sticking plaster” policies for any of the country’s critical injuries. Sunak licenses Suella Braverman as his outrider from hell to propose random cruelties. But are there really enough people who want to rip the tents off homeless people to force them to change their “lifestyle choices”? Enough who want even harsher disability tests to drive people into jobs, when the UK has the longest working hours in Europe, according to a Fabian report this week? Or enough who want to cut benefits yet again, despite rising poverty? Showing the “true Tory Rishi” is reportedly No 10’s plan. But that’s the true Tory chuckling along with Elon Musk about AI killing off everyone’s jobs. Focus groups discussing that event last week were shocked, say Labour researchers: people saw mega-rich Sunak on another planet from those struggling to pay bills, as he told Musk he wanted people to be risk-takers “unafraid to give up the security of a regular pay cheque”. Sunak has sunk too far for any revival, when everything he does only confirms a settled public opinion. Watch Labour sidestep this ragbag of gestures as it enters its third stage on Keir Starmer’s long march. Stage one was remaking the party. Stage two confronted a flailing government with a trustworthy shadow cabinet. Now is the stage for laying out Labour’s own programme. His own and his frontbenchers’ conference speeches were policy-rich compared with the government’s thin offerings: doubters should peruse Labour’s growing menu. Housing and building, new towns and green investment are centrepieces, with insourcing public services and employment rights in the first 100 days to end the Dickensian gig era. No 10’s “red meat” to entice undecideds looks pretty rancid. Everyone sees where the Tory party is heading, with 70% of its members telling Conservative Home they want Nigel Farage let in. It will be no surprise if those who elected Boris Johnson and Liz Truss choose Farage next. Nothing in Sunak’s leadership nor in his meagre prospectus leads his party away from this abyss; nothing to compare with Starmer leading his party out of its own electoral no man’s land.

So what social forces will he unleash?, 16 July). At last a journalist is challenging the Labour/Tory nonsense about spending money on our cash-starved public services being “unaffordable”, because there is “no new funding available”. Of course, when Keir Starmer writes or speaks, the 13 years of unnecessary austerity are “pretty much unmentioned”, as Harris says, as they were the result of political choices which, it seems, the Labour leader is about to replicate. Starmer’s insistence that what is needed is “reform” is correct, but not of our underfunded education, health and care services, where cash injections are needed immediately, if only to stop the outward flow of essential staff. Where reform is really needed is in the taxation system: the rich and high earners have to pay more; the oft-suggested equalisation of capital gains and income tax has to become a reality; the tax gap of £32bn has to be reduced; all tax reliefs need assessing; and all loopholes, especially those in inheritance tax, have to be closed. Bernie Evans Liverpool • I was deeply disappointed to read John Harris’s piece on Keir Starmer’s Observer article published the day before. Starmer’s talk of “growth … creating wealth, attracting inward investment and kickstarting a spirit of enterprise” is the same political dogma we could have heard anywhere over the last 40 years. Growth? Now Rachel Reeves is rowing back on a green investment fund, leaving in place the economic model that has been destroying the natural world for the last 200 years. Creating wealth? Huge amounts of wealth have been created, even during Covid, but it’s gone to the same few at the top of the pyramid. Inward investment? We’ve already sold off much of our infrastructure to “investors” – what more can we do? A spirit of enterprise? Plenty of people are involved in devising means to funnel money upwards and retain the status quo. It’s not easy, I realise, to sell the idea of change to much of the electorate – it can be a worrying prospect. But if politicians have no inkling of a vision of a fairer society, how can we ever start that process? Hilary Lang Frome, Somerset • A Labour leader who, after 13 years of Tory austerity, isn’t prepared to commit to spending more on public services is a bit like a pope who no longer believes in God. Just because so many of us disliked Jeremy Corbyn, it doesn’t mean we want Labour to renege on its promises on Brexit, fair wages, Green reforms and the nationalisation of private monopolies. Keir Starmer’s fiscal conservatism is beginning to look more like political conservatism every day, and, if he cannot find a way of supporting increased public spending after so many years of Tory cuts, many Labour voters will conclude that he isn’t really Labour. Stephen Porter London • The articles by Polly Toynbee (Listen up, critics: first let Labour win power. Then scrutinise its real record, 17 July) and Owen Jones (There’s no point to Labour as a party if it won’t pay to pull children out of poverty, 17 July) look incompatible: either you vote for Keir Starmer’s Labour party or else you oppose it. But socialists whose memories go back further than New Labour might recall Raymond Williams in 1974. Believing both that the Tories must be defeated and that Labour’s socialist credentials were hopelessly compromised, he settled for the slogan “Elect them on Thursday; fight them on Friday.” Peter Womack Norwich • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2024-06-09T10:00:13Z,Centre forward: Sunderland sets sights on a revival by bringing homes and jobs to its inner city,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jun/09/centre-forward-sunderland-sets-sights-on-a-revival-by-bringing-homes-and-jobs-to-its-inner-city,"When Richard Marsden looks across the Wear gorge to the centre of Sunderland, he has never seen so many cranes. His design and build firm, BDN, is rushing to renovate an old stable block in the shadow of the city’s football stadium. “Now there’s a bit of a resurgence, I want to be part of that,” he says of Sunderland, as joiners and carpenters fit out bars and a microbrewery ready for the new season. The 140-year-old building was once the stables for horses used to take coal to the railway from the mines directly beneath what is now Sunderland’s Stadium of Light. For years the stables stood derelict, roofless and neglected, only a few hundred metres from Sunderland’s city centre – albeit on the other side of the deep river gorge. Marsden is hoping those days are over. His bet is not a one-off. Sunderland’s gorge-top skyline is changing rapidly as the city’s leaders try to reverse decades of hollowing out of the city centre. It is an experiment in local government intervention, and also in a form of industrial strategy that looks to cities and the UK’s dominant services economy as well as eyecatching factories as a way of reviving the sluggish economy. Sunderland’s leaders are hoping that the intervention can serve as an example for other parts of the country. If it succeeds, it could also be watched with interest by Keir Starmer, who, polls suggest, will lead a Labour government working out its approach to industrial and economic strategy. Some Labour activists have expressed frustration over what they describe as a lack of difference with the Tories, particularly after the party backtracked earlier this year on green investment plans. But the election still offers a clear choice between the parties, with the Conservatives under Rishi Sunak excising any reference to industrial strategy, and going cold on the “levelling up” agenda to address regional imbalances. The Nissan model Sunderland is already a beacon for one type of industrial strategy. In the early 1980s Margaret Thatcher played a key role in persuading Japan’s carmakers to build factories in the UK. Nissan chose Sunderland for its plant, bringing thousands of jobs that helped to fill the gap left by the decline of shipbuilding and coal mining. Nissan’s factory is now seen as arguably the most successful example of British industrial strategy, spurring an automotive supply chain in the north-east and persuading rival Japanese carmakers Toyota and Honda to follow it to the UK. The Conservative government under its four prime ministers since Brexit – including Sunak, despite his apparent aversion to the idea of industrial strategy – has pursued a similar approach. It has delivered juicy subsidies to Nissan to persuade it to upgrade its factory to produce electric cars. In the factory, workers talk of their pride – tinged with relief – that the plant will be part of the electric vehicle revolution. Nissan is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to increase the productivity of the plant, with robot arms that wave an elegant pattern to cover car bodies with paint, and upgraded car carriers able to hold the extra weight of a battery as workers slot fittings in. The automated lines move constantly on by far the UK’s busiest production line: of the 905,000 cars made in Britain in 2023, a third were produced in Sunderland. The battery maker AESC, a part Chinese-owned, Japan-headquartered manufacturer, is also building two giant “gigafactories” next door to supply the car industry. Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at Centre for Cities, a thinktank, says Nissan’s arrival on the edge of town in the 1980s was a “good thing because the city was in a pretty bad place when they came in”. The cluster of Japanese companies in the surrounding area is evidence of how one inward investment can lead to more. But attracting one big company is not enough to sustain a city, says Swinney, who also happens to be from Sunderland. (Centre for Cities is based in London.) “The key thing about Nissan is that Sunderland is still in need of being levelled up 40 years on from Nissan coming in,” says Swinney. “It hasn’t really shifted things. We’re still in the same problems.” Clear evidence of discontent with Sunderland’s economic lot came in 2016. Concerns over Brexit disruption to Nissan made Sunderland a symbol of the tensions at the heart of the referendum. That was confirmed when images of a Vote Leave supporter borne aloft with her arms raised on referendum night were shown around the world. Unlike in some parts of the so-called red wall, Labour’s three MPs for Sunderland held on to their seats in the 2019 wipeout. Labour’s Kim McGuinness knows that her job is to deliver for voters who rejected the status quo in the 2016 referendum, and again four and a half years ago. She was elected last month as the first mayor of the North East Combined Authority, which stretches from Northumberland to Durham, via Tyne and Wear. She is a keen proponent of devolution, which she believes has not gone far enough, leaving cities such as Sunderland struggling for attention from Westminster. “It’s about determining our own priorities,” she says, such as her immediate move to take the region’s bus network under public control, and extending the Tyne and Wear metro to nearby Washington. While Nissan, which sits between Sunderland proper and Washington, has been a success, its nearest city been unable to fully capitalise on that economic boom. Many of the 6,000 workers at the factory commute from outside the city – in some cases they live far away. Sunderland’s decline in the second half of the last century was “particularly comprehensive”, according to a 2009 Centre for Cities report, because of a reliance on coal mining, shipbuilding and glass manufacture (the city hosts the National Glass Centre). It also suffered from the larger gravitational pull of Newcastle, its close neighbour, which won much of the growth in financial and business services. McGuinness highlights the challenge of child poverty in particular, which she blames on underinvestment by government. Seven of Sunderland’s city wards are among the 1,000 poorest of England’s 32,800 wards, according to the government’s indices of multiple deprivation. People moved out, as it was easier to build on greenfield land outside the historic centre rather than brownfield land in the middle of town left by departing industry and older housing. The council built an out-of-town business park, Doxford International, to host call centres and back offices for the likes of Barclays bank and the mobile network EE. The business park has a sculpture referring to the city’s shipbuilding past, but in truth the expanses of car parks and utilitarian offices could be anywhere. Reviving the riverside The city’s new plan is a 180-degree reversal. It will put 1,000 homes right by the River Wear, alongside office developments, plus a hillside park to make the underused riverside more attractive. The site itself was formerly the giant Vaux brewery, until that was knocked down in the late 1990s. Supermarkets considered buying it, but the council eventually decided to make it a central focus, opening a new city hall there in 2022. Patrick Melia, Sunderland city council’s chief executive, says the authority wants to double the population and number of jobs in the city centre. (Only 1% of the population lives there now.) It has aggressively courted private sector investments, as well as the limited pots of levelling up money from central government where they have been available. “We knew we wanted a diversified economy,” he says, standing beside a model showing the new city centre as the council imagines it, pointing to the mix of proposed housing, offices and a new eye hospital. The council fights hard to keep Nissan, but “we didn’t want to be all in automotive and advanced manufacturing,” he says. Usually a Marks &amp; Spencer closing down is a bad sign for a city centre’s prospects, but in Sunderland Melia says the council is planning to knock down the ageing building and replace it with the second phase of offices. It has revived an old fire station as a theatre and restaurant, and is also seeking to link the developments for pedestrians, who will be able to walk easily from the high street to central Keel Square – overlooked by the headquarters of Hays Travel – and across to the new development. John McCabe, head of the North East Chamber of Commerce, welcomes the focus on attracting services jobs, as well as the support for the factories on the city’s edge that garners the most attention. “There’s got to be a place for both,” says McCabe. “It would be ill-advised to put all of your eggs in one basket. For probably too long we thought, ‘as long as Nissan is there, that’ll be OK.’” Local authorities have been through cash-straitened times of austerity since the Conservatives first took power in coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010. Under financial pressure, some councils – notably Woking in Surrey and Thurrock in Essex – were lured into bankruptcy by commercial property that promised high returns but ended up as unfinished monuments to local politicians’ hubris. Melia is confident that Sunderland will avoid that fate. For one thing, unlike some of the disastrous council schemes, the riverside plan has attracted £100m in funding from Legal &amp; General, a major stamp of approval from the UK’s biggest investment manager. Nigel Wilson, L&amp;G’s influential former boss, cited it as an example of the investor backing the UK economy. A new footbridge links the new offices directly in a straight line across the river to the Stadium of Light. Sunderland AFC has the ninth-largest football stadium in England, even if it has faltered during seven years out of the top flight (including a disastrous double relegation). But the fans keep coming. The bridge will make landfall right by the Sheepfold Stables in 2025, providing what Marsden hopes will be a steady stream of punters looking for somewhere to have a drink on match days. But he also hopes to attract people from outside Sunderland. Another key part of the city’s hopes is a mile up the Wear, where Leo Pearlman, the Sunderland-born co-founder of the production company Fulwell 73, is behind Crown Works Studios, an ambitious plan to create 8,500 film and TV jobs in the north-east. That could diversify the economy further. Pearlman says it could have a bigger impact on the Sunderland economy than the gigafactories being built next to the Nissan plant. The council granted the £450m project planning approval in March. The development is being carried out by FulwellCain, a joint venture between Fulwell 73 and Cain International, a London investment firm. Pearlman wants government to think of support for the UK’s services economy (which far outstrips British manufacturing on every measure apart from hard-hat photo opportunities) in the same way as it does for factories. The nearby gigafactories being built by AESC have garnered grants and loans worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Pearlman says of Crown Works Studios: “This is a factory – that’s exactly what it is. The impact that it will have is exponentially bigger than a gigafactory, for example.” Small business owners are starting to feel a difference in the mood. Ian Wright, whose New World Designs uses arrays of cameras to make Matrix-style “bullet time” videos, says his sports and fashion advertising clients “can’t grasp how desperate it was” for the city once industry left. He arrived in Sunderland in 1999 to study, but his adopted city was “derelict” and “dead”. Resentment about the lack of investment and local budget cuts fed the Brexit vote, he believes. Wright is relatively optimistic about Sunderland’s future, and the media businesses that could come if Crown Works Studios succeeds. “It’s starting to look like a proper city,” he says. “It’s the first time seeing that many cranes. You can almost see the tide turning.” Yet he cautions that “it’s got a long way to go”. The true test of Sunderland’s success will not be the factories, however impressive they are, but whether higher-paying jobs come. Nissan again offers a salient example. It provides good manufacturing jobs in Sunderland, but many of the best-paid engineering and design roles are in London or Cranfield, Bedfordshire. “Would [a company] put its high-value stuff as well as its low-value stuff there?” asks Swinney. “If the answer is ‘no’, then you haven’t levelled up.” • This article was amended on 10 June 2024 to reflect the fact that the battery maker Envision AESC has rebranded as AESC and it is not a joint venture.",Sunderland; UK news; Regeneration; Planning policy; Architecture; Communities; Nissan; Automotive industry; Business,UK news
2023-06-18T07:00:37Z,"Mortgage ‘catastrophe’ will lose us the election, warn Tory MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/18/mortgage-catastrophe-will-lose-us-the-election-warn-tory-mp,"Tory MPs in marginal seats are already sounding the alarm over an “interest rate catastrophe”, amid claims that the party has not understood the impact of spiralling mortgages. With the Bank of England likely to increase interest rates again this week and major mortgage lenders raising their own rates in the last few days, there is a growing nervousness among Tories about the impact this will have later in the year as the main parties begin to shape their campaigns for the next election. In the most direct intervention to date, Lucy Allan, the Tory MP in the traditionally marginal constituency of Telford, questioned her party’s attitude to the issue. “I don’t think we have quite understood the interest rate catastrophe,” she said shortly after announcing she would not run again at the next election. “People [are] telling me their monthly mortgage payment is exceeding their salary. That is unsustainable. “Constituents do ask about ‘support for unaffordable mortgages’. I say ‘talk to your lender,’ but the reality is they need to sell sooner rather than later and that’s a hard message to hear.” Other Tories said they had not had many cases so far, but were on alert for the issue to become more serious later in the year. While ministers are acutely aware of the problem, Rishi Sunak and chancellor Jeremy Hunt primarily want to tackle inflation – making any package designed to help those struggling with their mortgage difficult. Another Tory in a marginal seat said: “It is very hard because there aren’t many levers we can pull.” Allies of Boris Johnson are already seeing the coming mortgage crisis as the issue that will sink Sunak’s attempts to recover in the polls before the next election. “When you look at what is happening to mortgages, it’s really killing our own people,” said one Tory. “It feels like this is the end of a cycle – 13 years coming to an end.” An alarming report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that UK households coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals next year will face an average £2,900 increase in their annual payments. It estimated the average two-year fixed mortgage rate will be 6.25% this year. A slew of new data backing up the concerns is expected this week. How best to respond to rising mortgage costs is also a challenge for Labour, which has opted to prioritise fiscal discipline over all other demands. It recently scaled down a pledge to spend £28bn a year on green investment, opting to instead build up to that figure over time. So far, only the Liberal Democrats have backed a special package aimed at mortgage distress in the form of a £3bn “mortgage protection fund” for people facing repossession. In response to the Resolution Foundation report, the Treasury said: “We know this is a concerning time for mortgage holders, which is why the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] requires lenders to offer tailored support to borrowers struggling to make their payments, and we continue to support mortgage holders through the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme. “Behind this, though, is global inflation, continuing to eat away at incomes around the world, which is why the single biggest thing we can do to help families is to halve the rate this year.”",Economic policy; Mortgage rates; Mortgages; Bank of England; Inflation; Economics; Politics; UK news; Business; Money; Banks and building societies,Politics
2023-10-09T10:56:59Z,Dear Keir Starmer: here’s what you should know about Sunak’s attack on climate policy – he lied and lied | Fiona Harvey,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/09/keir-starmer-sunak-attack-climate-policy,"Keir Starmer faces a challenge at party conference that no UK opposition leader has faced in more than 30 years. He will have to defend his climate policy against a bitter and sustained attack. Since the late 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher became the first UK prime minister to vow to tackle the climate crisis, a cross-party consensus on the issue has endured. In the last eight general elections, there has been no serious debate over whether to try to cut greenhouse gas emissions, only over how. That consensus is now broken. At their party conference last week, the Conservatives openly turned the climate into a culture war, with attacks on net zero, the roll-back of key green policies, and bogus claims that Labour’s eco-zealots wanted to impose draconian new laws, such as meat taxes and rationing trips to the shops. Rishi Sunak claims to be still committed to the UK’s legally binding target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but refuses to show how that is possible, while his anti-green rhetoric ramps up. It’s now up to Labour to respond. Starmer will be faced with a barrage of claims – from the Tories, but also from voices within his party, including some powerful unions – that net zero is unaffordable. He should rebut those falsehoods. As the extreme weather around the world, and the woeful state of the UK’s own environment, show, net zero and environmental policies are much less expensive than the alternatives. Sunak’s own words at the Tory party conference show how Labour should fight back. Sunak told the conference of how he “learned the reality of what people were being asked to do [for net zero], the thousands of pounds people would need to pay, all of it falling on the shoulders of the poorest in our society”. The prime minister is a former banker, so he knows these claims are simply untrue. Reaching net zero does require some upfront investment, though it will be quickly paid back in energy savings. Treasury analysis shows that the cumulative cost of net zero by 2050 will reach £1.3tr – but £1tr will be offset by savings, and the remainder is fast being wiped out by high energy prices and new technology. It is not the market, or some universal law of physics, that decides where those upfront costs should fall: it is the government, and this government has taken political decisions that have deliberately – and sometimes cynically – shunted the costs on to those least able to bear them. Take housing. Why are houses still being built without solar panels? The government insists it is because of the need to be “technology neutral” – as if some other as-yet unknown invention might burst on to the scene, though none have in the 70 years since photovoltaics were invented. There is an alternative explanation. As Guardian analysis revealed this week, building a new house with solar panels, heat pump and high-grade insulation adds more than £8,000 to the construction cost, paid by the developer. Retrofitting it costs about £33,000 on average, paid by the homeowner. Rules that would have required developers to meet low-carbon standards were scrapped soon after the 2015 general election, a move that has saved housebuilders about £15bn at a conservative estimate. Housebuilders and developers are among the biggest donors to the Tory party, donating about 20% of all party donations. Or look at water. Lax regulation since privatisation has allowed water companies to kill our rivers and poison beaches with sewage. Meanwhile, water shareholders have received about £72bn in dividends. But the government is set to allow households and taxpayers to pay for cleaning up their mess. Car ownership is another example. The government is claiming to be fighting a “war on motorists” – but motorists have been treated with extraordinary favours. Fuel duty has been frozen since 2011, at a cost of £80bn, while £27bn on new roads was a cornerstone of the last Tory manifesto. Axing the northern leg of HS2 is set to unleash a fresh torrent of money for new roads, while UK public transport availability is among the worst in the developed world. Across a range of green and net zero policies, the government has worked hard to minimise the costs to certain sectors – its donors, businesses it favours, and people the Conservative party regards as its natural voters – while the costs to poorer people and society as a whole are allowed to accumulate until they reach crisis point. Sunak will make it as difficult as possible for Starmer to change any of this. Some of the costs – such as the savings to housebuilders and water companies – are now irrecoverable. On HS2, ministers are selling off the land they expensively bought, so an incoming government would find it near-impossible to revive the plans. Expect more of this, as Sunak seeks to heap costs on an incoming Labour government. Yet the economics, as well as the moral imperative, are clear. Net zero is the only economic growth story now feasible for a developed country, as the US and the EU are demonstrating. Done properly, net zero swiftly reaps dividends, as renewable energy costs have plunged while fossil fuels continue to rise. Energy efficiency and insulation not only cut emissions but reduce bills for hard-pressed households. Public transport, if made widely available and cheap, would increase productivity. Green investment brings new jobs and the health benefits of clean air and water. Net zero, and green policy more widely, are not the problem. It is the way this government has chosen to implement its policies, protecting vested interests while disregarding vulnerable people, that have made environmental policy appear expensive. Labour can make different choices. • Fiona Harvey is an environment editor at the Guardian",Green politics; Labour conference 2023; Keir Starmer; Rishi Sunak; Environment; Labour conference; Politics; Labour; UK news; Conservative conference 2023; HS2; Water; Privatisation; Solar power; Renewable energy; Construction industry,Opinion
2023-10-09T16:03:46Z,To all the doubters who still think Labour too tame: read its policies – and finally believe | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/09/labour-tame-policies-clean-energy-employment-housing-rachel-reeves,"Holding their breath, curbing their enthusiasm, Labour people do their best not to burst out singing. High command bans glee and gloating, yet everywhere people exchange jubilation and frank astonishment at last week’s Tory conference bedlam. That ship of fools reminds all who fret at Labour’s disciplinarian tight ship what the alternative looks like. Captain Ruthless at the wheel has taken them on a gruelling journey from the Corbyn cataclysm, throwing overboard any crew with a hint of mutiny in their eye, all new candidates on-message vetted. Yet Labour has been oddly bad at spin, allowing the lazy trope that it lacks policy vim. But Rachel Reeves ratcheted up the decibels. The shadow chancellor had them on their feet over and over for her policy-rich green building surge, a magnificent mix of serious chancellor, punching politics and depth of purpose. Here’s the real divide: not culture war trivia but the battle for growth, and she wins hand down. For journalists, last week was more fun: rows make news. So they eke out the tired line that Labour is too cautious, where’s the radicalism? But look at each jam-packed meeting room to hear policies ready to roll from day one. Angela Rayner promises an employment rights bill within 100 days, to make work pay. Ed Miliband’s pledge to run the electricity system on 100% clean energy in six years would be a triumph. Wes Streeting’s national care service for England is an early starter, Bridget Phillipson fast off the blocks with early years plans, and “the biggest boost in affordable and social housing for a generation” includes Keir Starmer’s 1.5m homes built in five years. To those doubters who still think Labour’s plans tame, take time to read the national policy forum document. The mood music will remind you how a victory for this Labour party would herald a sea change. “Breaking the class ceiling” was never said by Tony Blair. Jobcentres will stop the venomous culture of sanctions against “scroungers”, with positive support into work instead. Cutting child poverty is what every Labour government does. Gone will be meanness to children, and that Gradgrind fixation with exams designed to eliminate, not encourage. It’s good to see the words “bolster the BBC’s independence”, and a hundred other things a world away from Torydom. Doubters pull a long face and say there’s no money. Reeves’s fiscal rules say no spending beyond income, only borrow to invest, debt must fall. She’s locked herself into a straitjacket: no tax rises or wealth tax, and every new minister will have to hold out an empty begging bowl to her. Grim, grim, grim. That rigour is the Starmer-Reeves price for winning public trust in a remarkably short time. But that’s not the whole story. Expect Reeves, Houdini-like, to find escapes without breaking her rules. She drops hints and clues. The taxes on non-doms and on private equity are just samples, like appointing a Covid corruption commissioner to chase billions lost to waste, fraud and flawed contracts: Labour estimates £7.2bn. Margaret Hodge MP provides plentiful evidence in her all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax to hunt down evaded taxes hidden offshore. (Reeves should appoint her as tax evasion tsar.) These things no Tory chancellor would do, but Reeves looks ready to dig for gold wherever she can. I was delighted to see she brought with her to conference Follow the Money, the acerbic and witty book on tax perversities and deformities by Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. A fountainhead of fiscal wisdom, he points to bad tax reliefs needing reform, which would bring in sizeable sums. His book will add to her own inventory of warped tax-relief barnacles on the bottom of the Treasury boat. Just before the conference, I asked Johnson where Reeves might hunt for funds without breaking her rules. Last week it emerged that freezing tax thresholds would bring the Treasury £40bn, instead of the £7bn predicted. Johnson reckons it could be more. He reeled off ripe plums: self-employed people and landlords should pay the same tax as the rest. Capital gains should be taxed at the income tax rate, he said. I told him that Reeves had specifically ruled that out. “Any chancellor would have to say that,” he said. “If she pre-announced it, everyone would take their gains out overnight.” He suggests council tax revaluation: Wales is already doing it. Freezing fuel duty cost £80bn in 13 years: “She will have to tax electric cars.” Other billions can be had, and she’s reading about them in his book. Of course, tax alone is no long-term economic answer to the country’s plight. As she stressed, only growth can rescue us from decline. Her £28bn green prosperity plan will be a hefty kickstart to lever in many multiples in private green investment. But right now, there’s money to be plucked. The first harvest should go straight to hungry children: Scotland already pays £25 a week for each child and has lower child poverty rates than in the rest of the UK. Starmer and Reeves need people to trust they will do more than they promise, as Blair and Gordon Brown did. Both are more radical by nature than they get credit for. Reeves’s forthcoming book on female economists is full of Keynesian admiration for Beatrice Webb, with contempt for austerians and monetarists. But some won’t believe that until they see it done. As Reeves said to me briskly: “Do you think we’ll have waited 14 years to do nothing when we get there?” Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Labour conference 2023; Labour; Labour conference; Rachel Reeves; UK news; Keir Starmer; Economic policy; Tax and spending; Council tax; Money; Politics; Tax,Opinion
2023-09-17T12:02:07Z,Key ‘Bidenomics’ architect calls for spending ‘race to the top’ on green tech,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/17/biden-adviser-calls-for-spending-race-to-the-top-on-green-tech-heather-boushey,"Governments around the world must drastically increase public investment in green technologies to combat global heating and drive sustainable economic growth, a top adviser to President Joe Biden has said. Heather Boushey, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, said countries including the UK needed to ramp up green investment to reboot economic growth, boost energy security, and protect against future inflation shocks. Speaking in an interview with the Guardian, she said the Biden administration’s decision to plough billions of dollars of public money into infrastructure and renewables was “crowding in” private investment – helping to put the world’s largest economy in a stronger position to avoid recession. “We’re working with our friends and allies to incentivise them to do the same – because we all need to make these investments,” she said. “Billions of dollars of investment all around the country – private dollars, in semiconductors and clean energy – has been incentivised by this public spend. Actually a lot of the public money hasn’t even gone out yet and the private sector is swooping in.” Her comments came on a tour of European countries including the UK that included meetings with Ed Miliband, the shadow net zero secretary – underscoring the ties between Labour and the Democrats ahead of pivotal elections for both parties next year. The White House is investing $369bn (£289bn) in clean energy and low-carbon technologies through Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with the aim of tackling global heating and laying the groundwork for greener economic growth. “The question is how can the UK, Europe, how can other countries rise up and meet the challenge,” Boushey said. “We think about this as a ‘race to the top’ – to incentivise everyone to do the same.” Labour had promised to borrow to invest £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry if elected to power, but rowed back from the pledge this summer by saying it would “ramp up” to this figure in 2027 in an attempt to prove fiscal credibility. Boushey said that while it was important to show investments were “paid for”, there was a strong case for green spending because it could pave the way for more resilient economic growth in future – helping to bolster the public finances “The president has not increased the deficit over his tenure. And he’s actually lowered the deficit because we got the economy back on track so quickly. So tax revenue started coming in, and growth came back,” she said. In a riposte to critics of higher government spending to meet net zero, Boushey warned failure to take “bold action” risked nations falling behind in a global race to decarbonise. “It’s an enormous economic opportunity. And if we don’t do it, we’ll end up importing these products from abroad.” A key architect of “Bidenomics” as one of the president’s closest advisers, the economist said investing public money was helping to create jobs, while building US domestic capacity to produce clean, reliable energy. Doing so could protect against future inflation shocks by limiting exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices and fragile international supply chains. “As we’ve seen with the war in Ukraine, access to energy is everything. If you don’t have energy you can’t power your factories, you can’t keep your homes warm, you can’t keep the lights running,” she said. “Building the green energy economy will be able to deliver lower prices over time and less volatile.” Last Friday, the UK government agreed a £500m support package for Tata Steel to help its Port Talbot steelworks switch to greener forms of steelmaking using electricity rather than coal. But the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, insisted Britain was not about to adopt Biden’s economic approach. “We are very clear – we won’t pursue the Inflation Reduction Act subsidy bowl approach to economic policy,” Hunt told the Financial Times. Critics have warned that Biden’s agenda amounted to a new protectionism that could unsettle relations with America’s allies, while breeding inefficiencies and adding to living costs. However, Boushey said the scale of the challenge to decarbonise in countries around the world meant there was “plenty of work to go around”. “We are so far from capacity that the idea there is not going to be enough production to go around, is not where we need to start this conversation.” Figures from the International Energy Agency and the OECD suggested up to $6.9tn of annual global investments may be needed to meet the Paris agreement’s emissions reduction target. The IEA estimated about 70% would probably need to come from the private sector. Boushey’s comments coincided with growing concerns about a possible US recession a year out from the next presidential election, driven by persistent inflation and higher interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. Despite an uptick in inflation in August, the US central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged at its next meeting on Wednesday after 11 previous increases. Boushey dismissed concerns over a recession, while arguing the longer-term path for inflation was “moving in the right direction” despite last month’s rise. Asked whether a recession could be avoided ahead of the election, she said: “I don’t have a crystal ball, but the US economy is strong and resilient.”",Economics; Green economy; UK news; US news; Climate crisis; World news; US politics; Joe Biden; Politics; Ed Miliband; Business; Renewable energy; Energy; Global economy; Environment; Europe; Investing; Infrastructure,Business
2023-09-13T14:06:24Z,Fossil fuel companies have a secret weapon. Here’s how Britain can help take it away from them | Cleodie Rickard,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/13/fossil-fuel-companies-britain-international-charter-treaty,"If Labour wants an energy transition in which working people don’t foot the bill, it has to address fossil fuel companies’ secret weapon against national climate laws: the energy charter treaty (ECT). The treaty is a multi-country investment deal for the energy sector that contains the notorious investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), a mechanism written into international agreements that companies can use to sue governments over policy changes they allege could affect their profits. The cases are heard in secretive tribunals outside the national legal system. The ECT is increasingly used by fossil fuel companies to make billion-dollar compensation claims against governments introducing climate policies. The Netherlands has been sued over its coal phase-out law, and Slovenia for its fracking ban. Last year an oil company won a case over Italy’s ban on offshore drilling, and was awarded six times the amount it had invested in the project. It has said it will use those winnings to fund new oil exploration. On 5 Septemberthe rebel Tory MP Chris Skidmore put forward an amendment to the energy bill to scrap Britain’s membership of this deal. While it didn’t pass, the government has formally announced it will consider leaving the “outdated” treaty if modernisation is not agreed by November. It is crucial that Labour takes the opportunity to outpace the government’s dithering, and comes out unequivocally for exit. With no evidence that ISDS attracts foreign investment, its only function is to drive up the cost of transition and heap huge financial risk on to the taxpayer. The IPCC has also warned of “regulatory chill”, where just the threat of being sued deters or delays necessary legislation. Denmark and New Zealand confess to this already happening. These seem to be precisely the “legal obligations” Keir Starmer cited in a Times article on 6 August as reasons for Labour not committing to revoke the current government’s new oil and gas licences – a fear the taxpayer could end up on the hook for the cost of revoked licences. But this is an irrational capitulation when there is an easy and legitimate way out: by following other major economies in withdrawing from the energy charter treaty. Starmer would hardly be going out on a limb: the ECT is already crumbling. Eleven countries, from Germany and France to Poland and Ireland, have decided to exit the treaty. Recently, the European Commission announced it was formally recommending a coordinated EU withdrawal. Inaction in the UK rests on both the government and opposition refusing to commit to withdrawal while they wait to see if the treaty is reformed by the states that remain in it. But with so many countries deeming any modernisation proposals wholly inadequate, and voting with their feet, the reform is dead in the water. The time to act is now. By joining a coordinated withdrawal with other countries, the UK can neutralise the sting in the ECT’s tail – a sunset clause that maintains the treaty’s provisions for 20 years after a state leaves it. Withdrawing countries are currently negotiating an agreement that should extinguish the effect of the sunset clause for that group. “Investor certainty”, or ensuring business has a stable climate to operate, is clearly an important goal for the Labour party – but that could easily be achieved if Starmer clearly signals that a Labour government would rescind dangerous oil and gas licences. The sooner the party nails its colours to the mast, rather thandithering like the Tories, the less time fossil fuel companies, aware of their obsolete projects, will have to “treaty shop” and find new avenues for lawsuits – that is, using or setting up subsidaries in other countries that may still make use of ISDS. Neither is the ECT the right tool to support green investment, as some claim. Renewable investors have reported they don’t consider investment treaties with investor-state dispute settlement, such as the ECT, to be a factor when they are making decisions. In fact, the European Renewable Energies Federation even penned an open letter calling on countries to exit the ECT. Renewables companies are clear they want an agile and responsive set of policies and incentives, not a mechanism that tightens a straitjacket around a narrow set of expectations. Committing to exit the ECT would be a no-costs-attached signal of Labour’s climate ambition, massively reduce the UK’s financial risk of being sued, and give investors certainty that nothing will prevent us implementing our climate obligations. If the party wants to ensure there is space for an ambitious future government programme, it is senseless to keep our hands tied. The key question that Labour needs to answer when it comes to the green transition is: who pays? If the energy charter treaty and its archaic mechanisms of corporate power continue to restrict our move away from fossil fuels, then workers and taxpayers will be paying the polluters to phase out the projects that threaten a livable future on our planet. That’s potentially billions in public money going to some of the most profitable companies on the planet. Where is the fairness in that?

2024-07-03T09:00:04Z,An (incomplete) list of every terrible policy the Conservatives have inflicted on Britain since 2010 | Jonn Elledge,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/03/list-terrible-policy-conservatives-britain-2010,"Before he entered Downing Street, David Cameron spent several years campaigning on the slogan “Broken Britain”. “The challenge for the modern Conservatives,” he said in 2008, “is reviving our society.” Such language seems horribly ironic now. Britain had its problems in 2010 – not least the impact of the 2008 financial crash – but it had strong public services and a visibly improved public realm. In the same way, the Tory government that left office in 1997 may have presided over crumbling public services, but it could at least point to an economic boom. The government that looks set to lose office next month has failed on both counts. “Broken Britain”, it turns out, was a campaign promise. It felt like it might be fun, in the run up to voting day this Thursday, to catalogue the failures that brought us here: to collate the policy mistakes that created the condition for what looks set to be a punishment election. After spending some time trawling the Guardian’s archive for examples, it rapidly turned out that this wasn’t fun at all. Brace yourselves. What follows is draining. The original sin Let’s start with the cuts. George Osborne, chancellor from 2010 to 2016, announced in his first budget that every area of government apart from the NHS and overseas development would need to cut its budget by an average of 25%. Some of this would be achieved by efficiency savings. Much of it was not: in many areas, the state simply gave up. So: Sure Start centres, which offered childcare, play, and parenting and employment advice for new mothers, massively had their funding cut, storing up demand for special education and health services as children aged. Connexions, an agency offering advice and support for teenagers, suffered the same fate. Reductions in the legal aid budget meant the number of providers dropped by nearly 60%, while the number of cases funded fell by nearly 90%: vast numbers of people on lower incomes no longer have access to justice. In an attempt to “devolve the axe” – to make others take the blame for Osborne’s cuts – local government budgets were slashed by about 40% over a decade, resulting in reductions of everything from buses to libraries to bin collections to street lighting (some have been switched off). At the same time, demand for statutory services provided by councils – mainly adult social care – has continued to soar. As early as 2012, councils were sharing the “graph of doom” that showed the cost of those services outstripping council funding by the early 2020s: this is why there are now suddenly quite so many isolated instances of council mismanagement. It probably didn’t help that the government axed the Audit Commission, whose job it was to monitor such things. Or that it gave the public the power to veto council tax increases beyond a ceiling set by MPs. Government bodies were not the only ones facing cuts: so were welfare recipients. Local housing allowance was capped at the 30th percentile of local rents, meaning that from as early as 2014 people were being priced out of the housing market in many areas and pushed into homelessness. Payments that allowed disabled people to live independent lives were slashed. In 2016, working age benefits were frozen (pensions, of course, were excluded), even as rents and other costs continued to rise. In 2017, the government introduced the two-child benefit cap, claiming it would deter parents who couldn’t afford children from having them. It didn’t. It just cast children into avoidable poverty. By 2020, charities were calling for an investigation into the link between benefit cuts and avoidable deaths. Young people, with their stubborn refusal to vote Conservative, were hit particularly hard. The educational maintenance allowance, a weekly payment to support 16- to 19-year-olds to stay in education, was scrapped in 2010. Two years later, university tuition fees were tripled to £9,000 a year: these would be repaid in a way that, against all previously known mathematical laws, loaded costs on to students without benefiting either universities or the taxpayer. No matter: in 2016, grants for students from low-income homes were replaced with loans, too. There are other ways in which this government has, in exactly the manner of which it once accused Labour, failed to fix the roof while the sun shone. Labour’s Building Schools for the Future scheme was another early victim of austerity; by 2023, when ceilings in postwar schools were literally falling in, this was beginning to look like a mistake. This, though, was only one aspect of the vast cuts to departmental capital budgets – in the short term, such things have lower political cost – which has meant a failure to build everything from power stations to flood defences to transport infrastructure to the prison places necessary to match the tougher sentencing rhetoric. And then there’s environmental policy. After winning a majority in 2015, Cameron vowed to “cut the green crap”. His government abandoned subsidies for larger solar and onshore windfarms, and introduced rules that in effect banned the latter altogether; scrapped its “green deal” home efficiency scheme, which helped pay for home insulation; removed tax incentives for drivers to switch to cleaner cars; and privatised the Green Investment Bank. (There’s more, but that’s quite enough.) By 2022, analysis by Carbon Brief has found, all this had cost the average household as much as £150 a year in increased energy bills. Within a few months, though, this had been largely forgotten. The prime minister had made a rather bigger geopolitical mistake. Brexit, and everything after It may have been an error on Cameron’s part to hold a vote on a potentially nation-wrecking policy he had no desire to carry out to solve an internal party problem. It may also have been a mistake to instruct the civil service not to plan for a vote to leave. But let’s put all that aside and think instead of everything that has followed. Losing our right to live and work elsewhere on our continent. The loss of British students’ access to the Erasmus exchange programme. The career-ruining barriers now faced by British bands or orchestral musicians hoping to ply their trade in Europe. The loss of the European Medicines Agency or the decline of the City, with the impact this has had for key economic sectors such as pharmaceuticals and finance. All these things hit the professional middle class that once provided a sizeable share of the Tory voting block. That fluttering you hear is the sound of chickens coming home to roost. This was but a fraction of the damage Brexit did to the Conservative party’s reputation. Consider Theresa May’s lengthy refusal to guarantee the right of the 3.2 million EU citizens who’d made their homes here to remain in Britain, despite the consequences for Britons who lived in Europe. Or the years of debate over whether there’d need to be border posts on the island of Ireland (which went almost entirely undiscussed pre-referendum), or in the Irish Sea (which would split the UK in two). All this because Cameron wanted to neutralise the threat posed by Nigel Farage, a man the bookies have as the overwhelming favourite to be elected the MP for Clacton. Some of the trends intensified by Brexit, such as hostility to anyone seen as an outsider, were an amplification of a performative cruelty already present in certain parts of government. The “go home” vans were launched by May’s Home Office back in 2013. They were part of a suite of policies known as the “hostile environment”, which aimed to make Britain a harder place to survive in as an illegal migrant, but ended up making it harder to be in as any person of colour, whether British or not. In the most extreme example, the Windrush scandal, the Home Office detained, persecuted and even deported dozens of Black British citizens just because they didn’t have the appropriate piece of paperwork. The Home Office itself had destroyed them. Whatever its root, though, governmental hostility towards both foreign people and human rights has increased markedly these past few years. The UK has ramped up its visa fees. It’s upped the minimum income requirement required for British people to bring home foreign partners. Less ruinously but more absurdly, the then immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, ordered an asylum centre to paint over murals of cartoon characters, presumably to stop foreign children from plotting to illegally enter the UK because they’d heard it had pictures of Tom and Jerry – a policy as absurd and as arbitrary as Chris Grayling’s unlawful and soon reversed attempt to ban people from sending books to those in prison. Brexit also unleashed something else: a politics that cared less for the British constitution or rule of law than for near-mystical invocations of the “will of the people” – a will that always accorded, somehow, with the desires of the rightwing press. The results of this have included, but not been limited to, the failure of multiple lords chancellor to defend the independence of the judiciary from attacks by hostile newspapers; Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of parliament; new restrictions on the right to protest; and the Elections Act – a naked attempt to help the governing party. All these trends have culminated in the Rwanda scheme, in which parliament passed a law declaring that country a safe destination for refugees – in defiance of not just international law but of objective reality, purely so that ministers could be cruel towards some of the most desperate people in the world. This sucked in a vast amount of political energy at a time when poll after poll has shown that voters’ real priorities are the cost of living crisis and the NHS, about which ministers were doing nothing. And it hasn’t even “stopped the boats”. Things can only get worse There’s another type of government failure: the things that can’t necessarily be attributed to a single bad policy, but where multiple policies or a failure to act have contributed to a sense the country is going backwards. For instance, in many policy areas, there’s been a creeping centralisation of power in Westminster – coupled with the aforementioned weakening of local government – which has surely contributed to the general sense of alienation from politics that has characterised this election. There’s also been the repeated failures to get Britain building and price-inflating schemes such as help to buy; house prices have soared and home ownership rates tumbled; and our housing now offers the worst value for money of any advanced economy. This too has been bad for the Tories’ electoral prospects. Those who can’t start families are less likely to grow more conservative – why support capitalism if you can’t accumulate capital? The government has remained unpersuaded to improve the lot of renters, even so. Wages have stagnated for more than a decade, meaning living standards in the UK have fallen behind those in peer nations. Nearly a fifth of the population are in poverty, including 3.6 million children; more and more families now rely on food banks. There are 74% more people sleeping rough than there were in 2010, and more than 150,000 families are now homeless – a record number. The ONS is considering no longer recording their mortality rates. Meanwhile, hospital waiting times are at a record high. (The then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, actually scrapped the targets in 2010, but it went so well the government U-turned within 18 months.) The government has attempted to blame this on Covid, and that clearly was a factor – but stories about record waiting times had been a regular feature of the domestic news pages long before any of us ever heard the phrase “novel coronavirus”. While we’re doing healthcare: ambulance waiting times have soared, in large part due to bottlenecks elsewhere in the health service that leave vehicles queueing outside hospitals. In 2022, more than 500 people died while waiting for one. Demand for GPs’ services has also risen, but the shortage of doctors has meant an increase in practice list sizes and growing difficulty getting an appointment. (Many people have stopped trying, either letting problems fester, which will pile up more costs for the health service down the line, or where possible going private.) NHS dental deserts mean that, in February of this year, a new practice in Bristol made headlines when 1,500 people queued for hours to sign up. Through all this, the government came up with plans for neither the funding nor workforce of adult social care – May did try; it cost her her majority – and its failure has had a direct impact on the NHS, swallowing much of the recent panicked increase in its funding. Even once you are dead, the waiting lists don’t stop. Covid, cuts and a dodgy computer system have all meant that the time families wait for the grant of probate – access to a late family member’s estate – has increased from a couple of weeks to as much as a year. All these things have broken Britain – but they’ve created the conditions for an unprecedented Tory wipeout, too. The Faustian bargain offered by previous iterations of the Conservative party was that it might damage the social fabric, but it could, at least, make the middle classes rich. After 14 years of alternating lethargy and crisis, that very clearly no longer applies. And the rest The list above is in no way comprehensive: my word count was simply not that long. I’ve not even mentioned academisation, the radical overhaul of England’s school support and accountability structures, because there’s some evidence standards have improved (even if some studies have found that council schools outperform academies). Nor have I risked getting lost in the weeds of the complex and disastrous deckchair-rearranging exercise that were Lansley’s NHS reforms over half a decade, which burned through vast quantities of goodwill and energy for no clear benefit. I’ve missed the 2020 A-levels scandal in which students’ lives were wrecked by a badly designed algorithm. And the exclusion of several million self-employed people from any and all pandemic support. And Grayling’s privatisation of probation, which increased the risk to the public so markedly that it was reversed by his successors. And the ministerial merry-go-round in which the UK’s already brief average ministerial tenure collapsed from a couple of years to only eight months, meaning that even those less out of their depth than Grayling were never likely to get a handle on the job. I’ve not even mentioned Liz Truss. But the point is clear: in a vast number of ways, in almost every realm of government activity, this lot have made life worse. The policies referred to in every sentence in this article have damaged untold thousands of lives. The Conservative party has created exactly the broken Britain it claimed its mission was to repair. You may not think this Labour party deserves to win. But it’s hard to refute the idea that, after the last 14 years, the Tories deserve to lose.

2023-09-22T12:00:02Z,Sunak’s net zero U-turn will hurt those he says he wants to help – Labour must stand up for them | Fatima Ibrahim,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/22/rishi-sunak-net-zero-u-turn-climate-crisis-keir-starmer,"On Tuesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN general assembly that on the climate crisis, “actions are falling abysmally short” and that leaders should take “drastic steps now”. He also reminded the world that G20 countries were responsible for 80% of greenhouse emissions and that “they must lead”. But Rishi Sunak was elsewhere, the first British prime minister in a decade to miss this opportunity to show international climate leadership. And just hours after the speech, news broke of his plans to weaken domestic climate commitments. The Conservatives are clearly using net zero as a way of drawing a dividing line between themselves and Labour in an effort to revive their dwindling electoral hopes. Labour must remember that popular consensus, science and moral authority is on its side and it can offer hope, after a year of underwhelming climate summits and escalating impacts, instead of yielding to pressure to tack closely to the Tories to avoid losing votes. So far it’s been a mixed bag from Keir Starmer. At the Labour party conference last year he centred his pitch around a “fairer, greener future”, announcing clean power by 2030 and a new publicly owned energy company, as well as restating his commitment to spend £28bn annually on a green transition. But since then, no new announcements have been made and instead the Labour leader has delayed his spending commitments until two years into a new parliament. The party wants to blame this move on the economic climate, but given that green investment is one of the safest ways to grow our economy, the argument for these decisions seems flimsy. Domestically, we run the risk of losing out to the EU, the US and others who are investing now via the European Green Deal and the US’s Inflation Reduction Act. Climate action consistently ranks among the top issues concerning the electorate. But despite this, there has been a concerted effort from a constellation of rightwing media outlets and the far right of the Conservative party to represent opposition to net zero as the view of the wider British public. This week, the prime minister defended his U-turns, saying that he did not want to burden working people – but it is his shortsightedness that will actually hurt families, pensioners and the poorest in society. Starmer must speak out clearly and consistently about the many challenges the public are facing, such as costly or inaccessible public transport, low-paid and precarious employment and sky-high energy bills. He should be making the point again and again that many of the solutions to the climate crisis, whether that’s creating good green jobs in the industries of the future, insulating our cold homes or investing in homegrown renewable energy, would ease the cost of living crisis. As well as action at home the public also want leadership on the global stage. A new poll commissioned by Green New Deal Rising from Opinium shows 45% of voters believe rich countries have the responsibility to help poor, more vulnerable countries tackle the climate crisis. Labour could once again play a pivotal role – as it did almost 20 years ago – by advocating for multilateral debt relief, enabling nations to prioritise climate resilience and development. The same poll showed that twice as many people believe that the UK should cancel some or all of the debt of countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change as do not (52% v 26%). Labour should focus on popular ways of raising money such as implementing a 95% windfall tax on fossil fuel companies or redirecting fossil fuel subsidies – something 60% of Britons support – and a wealth tax which could be levied on those holding assets in excess of £10m. Currently shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is ruling out wealth taxes, going against public sentiment and the political realities of the economy she may inherit. By tying the Labour party’s hands in this way she is severely limiting the scope of what a new government can do before it has even started. These kinds of progressive taxes could be used to provide a fair contribution to the financial support necessary for poor and climate vulnerable countries to reduce emissions, adapt to changing conditions, and address the devastation wrought by climate disasters. Finally, given that the climate crisis is projected to displace 1.2 billion people by 2050, the UK has a dual responsibility as a colonial power and a significant historical emitter to establish safe routes for migrants, expedite asylum cases and support UK migrants, in line with international obligations and compassionate public sentiment. But so far, Starmer has provided neither moral leadership nor a sensible plan to tackle this issue. Here again it seems he is bending to pressure from an organised rightwing press rather than public sentiment which would prefer a welcoming, flexible, and fair migration system. The UN secretary general finished his speech by saying to protesters in New York and around the world: “I want you to know that you are on the right side of history.” This week, Sunak gave the opposite message, proving himself to be on both the wrong side of UK opinion and the wrong side of history. It’s time to put the era of Conservative party half-measures and empty promises behind us. The Labour leadership should take this opportunity to align itself with the demand for bold and transformative action on the climate crisis.

2024-07-01T10:43:07Z,North Sea oil decline: ‘We can’t have a repeat of what happened to 80s miners’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/01/north-sea-oil-transition-plan,"“In this city, everyone feels the decline of the North Sea,” says Chris Douglas, 39, who has lived in Aberdeen his whole life and began working as a taxi driver in the Granite City 20 years ago. He now has his own cab company, which in the past was entirely reliant on bookings from the oil and gas industry – today it’s “maybe 50%”, he says. “You only have to look around: there are industrial estates decimated, hotels no longer trading. The good days are long gone,” he says. “And no political party is coming along to say they are going to rejuvenate the industry. There are just different plans for how to close it down.” The oil and gas fields in the North Sea are in terminal decline. Last year, the oil basin produced 34m tonnes of oil, its lowest since production in the North Sea was established in the 1970s. As its accessible fossil fuels dwindle, big oil companies have pulled out of the ageing oil basin. And despite the government issuing a rush of licences since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the amount of oil set to be extracted is rapidly shrinking. Meanwhile, the climate crisis – fuelled by gas, oil and coal extraction – is accelerating at a frightening speed and the world’s leading scientists and energy analysts are clear: there can be no new oil and gas projects if humanity is to avoid catastrophe. In the far north-east of Scotland, this combination of factors could spell disaster for the almost 60,000 workers supported by the oil and gas industry, their families and communities. For the past four decades they have prospered on the well-paid, secure jobs North Sea oil has provided. But now they are looking into an abyss. “Most of my friends went into the North Sea industry because for them, and for their fathers and their grandfathers, it has always been seen as a sure thing. Does the green economy offer that same security, the same pay?” Douglas says. This is a crucial moment for these communities, according to Joe Rollin, a senior organiser at the union Unite, which represents tens of thousands of oil and gas workers. “We simply can’t let these workers be the coalminers of this generation, with all the devastation to lives and communities that would entail,” he says. This is the challenge facing politicians in Westminster and Holyrood before this week’s general election. How do they manage the inevitable and urgent decline of North Sea oil and gas – and can they ensure a just transition to new low-carbon jobs that are fully unionised, well-paid and secure? For Mika Minio-Paluello, a policy officer at the Trades Union Congress (TUC), there is a lot on the line. “Whatever happens to the people working in North Sea oil and gas, it is being closely watched by those in different industries and sectors – not just across the UK but also in other countries – to see if we can take working people on this journey. “It is a test case in some ways, for the whole idea of a just transition, of what happens when we decarbonise … we simply can’t have a repeat of what happened to coal workers in the 80s.” The spectre of the miners’ plight after the pit closures in the 1980s hangs over this debate. The communities that were decimated when the then Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher closed the pits and smashed the coalminers’ union never recovered. Arguably the stakes now are even higher. The escalating climate crisis demands a rapid end to fossil fuel production, but the populist right across Europe is on the rise and it has climate action in their sights – describing it as a remote, elite project being done at the expense of ordinary workers. The UK’s main political parties are divided on the issue. The Conservative party is still promising to “max out” oil and gas in the North Sea by granting licences for new exploration every year. Meanwhile, Labour has promised to put an end to new licences, and raise taxes on the large profits being made by companies operating in the North Sea. The party is also promising “not a single job” will be lost during the transition. In response, the Scottish National party has U-turned on its pledge to phase out fossil fuel licences and is trying to tread a “middle ground”, saying it will approve licences if they meet strict climate conditions – although most experts struggle to see how this could be possible. Nigel Farage, the leader of the insurgent populist Reform UK party, is waiting to capitalise, vowing at his manifesto launch last month to axe net zero policies and fast-track licences to open up the North Sea. “If we fail to do this transition in a way that takes communities with us, then we leave the way open for Farage and the far right,” said Minio-Paluello. “The risk of the far right culture wars building a wave of support on the back of our failure is very, very real.” There is little doubt the writing is on the wall for the industry. Experts point out that the number of jobs supported directly and indirectly by oil and gas has more than halved in the past decade – from 441,000 to 214,00 – during which time the government has issued roughly 400 new licences in six licensing rounds. According to the former head of the oil and gas regulator, new licences would make a difference to gas production only “around the edges”. Even BP’s former chief executive has said North Sea drilling is “not going to make any difference” to Britain’s energy security. Ajay Parmar, a director at ICIS, a commodity data provider, says:“The UK’s oil supply decline has been in the works for decades. Labour’s policy will hasten the decline but only marginally.” Critics of the Tory pitch to “max out” North Sea oil claim it is part of a culture war framing what will only result in workers being stranded in a declining industry with no plan to save their livelihoods or communities. Analysts and trade unions agree that unless it is managed properly, the transition will have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy. According to a report by the consultancy EY, which was commissioned by the Scottish government, North Sea workers have an annual average salary of £88,000, while those working in the oil and gas supply chain earn an average of £51,000 a year. This is well above the average annual salary of £29,000 in Scotland – and above the £42,600 average wage of employees in the clean energy sector, according to figures from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. As high-wage oil jobs are replaced with clean energy roles, the gross value of Scotland’s employment sector could plummet from £19bn a year in 2019 to £12bn by 2050, according to the report. For people like Dale Green, who has been working on the rigs for the past 22 years, those statistics could be life-changing. “When I was growing up, the only option for me really if I wanted a good job, good money, was to work on the rigs,” says the 39-year-old scaffolder. “It has allowed me to move on from the council estate where I grew up and to be able to afford a decent life – to look after my children, get a house, get a car.” Dale fears that unless the transition is properly managed the chances he has had will be denied to future generations. “Taking away opportunities that someone like me has enjoyed, a scaffolder from a working-class community who grew up on a council estate, it could just decimate certain areas,” said Green. If it wins the election, Labour plans to set up a taskforce with Scottish Labour, the big energy companies and the unions to “secure a future for every oil and gas worker”. It says the new jobs will mostly be in renewables, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen. The shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband, has promised to base Labour’s planned state-backed green power firm, Great British Energy, in Scotland. And part of the party’s £7bn “wealth fund” will be earmarked for wind power. But Labour has dropped its expertly costed £28bn-a-year green investment pledge, sparking concerns among unions and environmental campaigners about whether it had set aside sufficient funds to ensure a smooth transition from fossil fuels. Critics say the party’s plans are vague, that there is little or no industrial base in Scotland, and that there are few renewable jobs to transfer workers to. They argue a well-funded, pro-active industrial strategy will be required to create the jobs in wind turbine manufacturing, installation and maintenance, as well as in the wider supply chain for renewables. Unite says much more needs to be done. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, refused to sign off the party’s manifesto at its “clause V” last month – in part because of fears Labour’s plans for oil and gas workers in the North Sea were too vague. “We should not be letting go of one rope until we have hold of another,” Graham said earlier this year. “These types of transitions must have workers at the heart. Unite will not stand by and let these workers be thrown on the scrap heap.” The union is running a grassroots “No ban without a plan” campaign across north-east Scotland, urging Labour to outline more detailed and funded proposals before banning new licences. Last week, more than 200 small businesses published a letter backing the campaign and calling on Labour to spell out exactly where the jobs will come from. Previously, this position might have seen trade unions pitted against climate groups calling for a rapid winding down of the industry. However, behind the scenes there has been an unlikely alliance emerging. Last week, 60 leading climate organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Oxfam UK and Extinction Rebellion signed an open letter calling for a “clear and funded” transition plan for workers and communities reliant on the oil and gas industry. The letter, which was sent to all party leaders, is based on a report created in consultation with workers and backed by Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and Unison Scotland. A spokesperson for Unite says the union welcomed “support from the climate movement”. “We are fully behind a transition to greener energy, but this must be a fair transition, one that has workers and communities at its heart … we will continue to work with climate groups who are calling for ambitious government action on a just transition.” Ruby Earle, from the campaign group Platform, which helped coordinate the letter, says it shows “how far the climate movement and unions have come in building relationships”. “Government support for a just transition cannot be an afterthought. A clear and funded industrial strategy, alongside publicly owned energy, is not only essential for workers, communities, and the millions of people living in fuel poverty, but also to ensure the transition happens within climate limits.” Jake Molloy, a former oil and gas worker and trade unionist for almost 20 years, who now sits on the Scottish government’s Just Transition Commission, is at the sharp end of this emerging coalition. “If I had suggested, 20 years ago [to his colleagues in the industry] that they go and meet Greenpeace or another climate group, they would have thought I meant for a fight because these groups were seen as wanting to destroy our jobs, our communities.” But he says that has changed in recent years, with a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes. Molloy says this has resulted in more climate groups recognising that the necessary transition away from fossil fuels cannot be done at the expense of ordinary working people. At the same time, some unions and workers have accepted that the transition is necessary and – if done correctly – positive. “More and more people on both sides are realising that this is an industrial revolution on an unprecedented scale and that we need change – change so fundamental as to strip away the ideology that we’ve worked in for the last 40 years.” Molloy warns that many of the much-heralded “new jobs” in renewables do not exist in Scotland – citing a recent windfarm development that has been built, installed and maintained entirely by overseas companies and governments. Tessa Khan, the director of campaign group Uplift, says the next government needs to “get everyone around the table – the Scottish government, trade unions, worker representatives and affected communities – to come up with a coherent plan that works in everyone’s interests”. Crucially, she says, the transition plans must be taken out of the hands of the oil and gas industry. “The majority of operators in the basin invest nothing in UK renewable energy, but nor are they investing in UK oil and gas production. The record profits of recent years have gone to their shareholders, not to investment in the transition. [They] aren’t interested in creating clean jobs and growing the UK economy but in making as much money as they can for themselves, for as long they can get away with it.” Last month the supreme court in London ruled the climate impact of burning oil and gas must be taken into account when deciding whether to approve projects. Experts say this is likely to be another nail in the coffin of North Sea oil and gas, making it it harder to secure new licences. It could even threaten some of those that have been approved, including the controversial Rosebank oil and gas field, to be operated by the Norwegian company Equinor. A Labour source said if the party did form the next government, and Rosebank was still in the balance, then ministers could refuse the remaining consents it needed to operate. Molloy, who has spent years working on a just transition for his colleagues in the industry, says whatever the result in the election it is essential that politicians and corporations are not able to pit those worried about the climate crisis against those who want to ensure a decent future for workers, their families and communities. “I’ve got four grandsons who will never forgive me if I get this wrong, and I’ve been trying for considerable time to get it right, because their future – and that of millions around the world – relies on us getting this right.”",Oil; Fossil fuels; Scotland; Energy; Environment; UK news; General election 2024; General elections; Politics; Fossil fuel divestment; Climate crisis; Renewable energy; Scottish politics; Labour; Conservatives; Business; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Communities; Society,Environment
2023-06-09T17:30:00Z,The Guardian view on broken Britain: it won’t be fixed with the status quo | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/the-guardian-view-on-broken-britain-it-wont-be-fixed-with-the-status-quo,"The gap between the political narrative and life as experienced by the average voter is widening dramatically. The United Kingdom faces serious economic, environmental and social crises that will deepen without shifts in policy. Yet there is little sense of impending doom among the country’s politicians. A decade of upheaval has produced not radical change, but a renewal of a failed consensus. This suits the Conservative party, which, after 13 years in power, offers the dead weight of bankrupt intellectual habits. However, Labour’s U-turn over one of its rare transformational policies, to spend £28bn a year from day one of being in office on green investment, leaves it looking pusillanimous and complacent about its poll lead. Significantly, there is now a shared understanding, whatever the differences between political parties, that austerity is acceptable and budget deficits unthinkable. Given that this risks condemning the country to a low‑growth, carbon-intensive economy with stagnating wages, one must hope that this is a strained compromise that only holds for so long. The UK is not a failed state, but it is failing. And others can see that is the case. People furious about the pollution of their rivers and coasts voted with their feet in many parts of the country in May’s local elections. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, warned in April that new laws curtailing peaceful protest were “incompatible” with the country’s international obligations. The UK once prided itself on its democratic stability. However, our model is badly broken. Other nations have elections in which politicians seek the top job by being at odds with an old orthodoxy so that they can preside over a new one. By contrast, Britain now changes its prime ministers without elections. Edward Heath was the last UK prime minister who was voted into that position only after their party won a general election, remained as party leader for the whole time in office and then left at a general election. That was five decades ago. The economy is teetering on the brink of recession, inflation remains stubbornly high and pay strikes are disrupting railways, schools and even hospitals. Most countries that fall apart do so because they are unable to take advantage of their people’s potential. Britain is travelling down that road. Its “extractive” economic institutions openly operate for the benefit of elites at the expense of voters. So large is the chasm between the haves and the have-nots that the richest 50 families in the UK, it was revealed this week, have more wealth than the 33 million people found in the bottom half of the UK population. Our closest neighbours do things differently and often better – with a more interventionist state. About two-thirds of people in Vienna, the capital consistently voted the best place to live, reside in social housing – a secure tenure abjured in Britain. Finland has for decades provided every schoolchild with a warm, healthy lunch, a precondition for happy learning that the British state is too miserly to fund. France’s government is building four gigafactories for electric vehicle batteries while the UK can’t manage one. The priorities of the City, and Treasury worries about investor confidence, should yield substantially to the unnecessary suffering and insecurity far too many people face. Labour ought to be making the case that it will “borrow to invest” – and challenge the Treasury view that Britain gets a poor economic return on public investment. Rishi Sunak hasn’t made any impact on a floundering economy. With democracy in retreat across the globe, just muddling along from one disaster to another won’t do. The status quo is far more dangerous than the new ideas to replace it.",Economic policy; Rivers; Environment; Politics; Keir Starmer; Labour; UK news,Politics
2023-09-17T16:00:03Z,Unite launches ‘red wall’ campaign in push for radical Labour policies,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/sep/17/unite-leader-sharon-graham-labour-has-to-shift-on-key-policies,"Labour’s biggest union backer, Unite, is launching grassroots campaigns in scores of industrial constituencies across the UK demanding more radical policies on energy, steel and green jobs. Unite’s leader, Sharon Graham, who has been publicly critical of Keir Starmer, said funding earmarked for Labour would instead be funnelled into stoking public pressure for the party to shift its position on key issues including energy nationalisation. “What we are doing is, we are diverting some of the money that we would probably have given to Labour, to have three major campaigns that we are starting, in the ‘red wall’ seats where these are the issues for those constituents,” she said. “There will be billboards, there’s wraparounds, there will be one-to-one conversations: so when they come into those towns, people will be saying, that’s what’s important to them – and if Labour don’t pick the baton up, I think that will be difficult for them.” Unite still pays significant affiliation fees to Labour, amounting to almost £1.1m in 2023 so far, but Graham said additional resources from the union’s political fund would now go into campaigning on specific policies. She cited energy nationalisation, oil and gas, where Unite wants Labour to reverse its decision not to grant new North Sea licences, and government support for steelmaking. “In Wales, in Scunthorpe … there’s 16 steel towns where we are taking our policies to the people of those towns and saying: ‘Whoever comes in here needs to give this commitment to steel,’” she said. Unite is calling for Labour to allocate some of its £28bn a year of green investment funds to greening the steel industry – and promise to use British steel in all public infrastructure schemes. Similarly, the union will target Scottish constituencies where there are oil and gas workers, calling for energy nationalisation, and a continuation of North Sea extraction until workers can move into new green jobs through a “just transition”. “I don’t think there’s a family in Scotland that’s not connected to the oil and gas industry,” she said, claiming that many are “absolutely furious” about Labour’s policy on energy. “I’m not saying, vote Labour, vote Tory, vote this or vote that – I’m saying, this is a core issue,” she said. “Somebody asked me the other day: ‘How will you move Keir Starmer on these issues?’. For me, it’s the electorate: they’re the decision-makers. That is the reality. And so if the electorate moves, he moves – it’s as simple as that.” In her speech to union delegates at the TUC Congress in Liverpool last Monday, Graham conceded that renationalising energy, including the National Grid, would cost £90bn but insisted a future Labour government could afford it. Some of Labour’s green policies, spearheaded by the shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, have proved controversial with trade unions representing oil and gas workers. Some fear their members could face the fate of coalminers in the 1980s unless the shift away from fossil fuels is carefully managed. The GMB shares Unite’s scepticism about halting new North Sea licences – but its general secretary, Gary Smith, said he would continue to make that case directly to Starmer. “Labour are just wrong on this: they’re wrong on oil and gas, and we will continue to argue and debate on it,” he said. Smith, many of whose members work in the energy sector, rejected the idea of nationalisation, however. “There is an argument for public ownership of some parts of strategic infrastructure; but the idea we were ever going to nationalise retail energy is nonsense: there’s not a lot of money in it,” he said, pointing to the fact that some energy providers have recently had to be bailed out. Unite irked some delegates at the TUC’s annual gathering by publicly attacking some of Labour’s policies, when most unions affiliated to the party have been publicly supportive – in particular of a raft of workers’ rights measures reaffirmed by the deputy leader, Angela Rayner. Graham has accused Labour of watering down some aspects of the package, including unions’ access to workplaces, blaming corporate lobbying. “Most of these policies cost no money, it’s not financial. So it was done for a different reason and I assume it was done for business,” she said. “We have put a lot of money into Labour through the bad times – they weren’t in government, so we’ve got nothing for it. And then of course the business lobby show up late for the party, and of course it’s: ‘We’ve got to be careful.’” She also urged Starmer’s party to take a more radical approach on issues including tax and spending policy – a view shared by some other unions. “If they’re too cautious, I think that will be a problem, because I think people are crying out for something,” she said. Graham’s predecessor as Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, was closely involved in Labour politics during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, and she has deliberately taken a more arm’s-length approach. Unite gave Labour £3.5m in the run-up to the 2019 general election, making it by far the biggest contributor to the party’s campaign. Graham did not rule out providing more financial to support to Labour in the run-up to a general election. “I’m sure we’ll have discussions – why would we give them any money if we didn’t want them to win: of course we want them to win – but we can’t just put a blank cheque into central Labour and say, ‘do with it as you will’, when the very issues we’re trying to get them to agree to, they’re not agreeing to,” she said. Labour has been recruiting new donors among business leaders and philanthropists in recent months as it seeks alternative sources of funding. A Labour spokesperson said: “A Labour government will change the lives of working people for the better, and everything we do is focused on that. “A core part of our plans is our new deal for working people which will strengthen workers’ rights and tackle insecure work. That is good for workers and good for employers.”",Unite; Labour; Trade unions; Steel industry; UK news; Politics; Environment; Scotland; Energy industry; Party funding,UK news
2024-04-22T04:00:14Z,"‘They’re patronising, arrogant …’ Caroline Lucas on fighting the Tories, leading the Greens and leaving parliament",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/22/theyre-patronising-arrogant-caroline-lucas-on-fighting-the-tories-leading-the-greens-and-leaving-parliament,"On a Monday afternoon in a bamboozling warren of offices next to the Palace of Westminster, Caroline Lucas is in yet another hurry. Forty-five minutes into the first part of our conversation, she reminds me that she has to sprint to the House of Commons to make sure her voice is heard in a debate – this time about Iran’s attack on Israel, and the RAF’s role in shooting down some of the drones involved. As usual, there is an inescapable obligation to fulfil: as the sole Green party MP, she says, she has no choice but to be there. A few hours later, I watch her contribution online: an eloquent, confident, slightly weary voice, delivering an argument unheard from either the Tory or Labour frontbenches. “Like the whole House, I condemn the attack on Israel by the tyrannical Iranian regime, just as I deeply condemn the atrocities of Hamas, but I am also incredibly concerned that our prime minister has now pitched the UK into a perilous war,” she says. When Rishi Sunak gets to his feet, his reply lasts all of 10 seconds: “I am completely comfortable that what we did over the weekend was the right thing,” he says. And that’s that: the point Lucas was making, it seems, was not even worth considering. Here, perhaps, is a perfect example of why, after 14 arduous years – and stints as her party’s leader and co-leader – Lucas, 63, is calling time on being an MP. “I’ve been the Green party’s frontbench spokesperson on absolutely everything for 14 years and it is exhausting,” she says. “I’d love to continue talking to you now, but I’m the only person who can be there for the Green party to hold Rishi Sunak to account. There’s been no debate or discussion: we’re suddenly potentially on the edge of world war three, without any scrutiny. So someone’s got to be in there.” What she says might suggest something close to absolute futility: taking important and principled stances while the people in power blithely wave her interventions away. She herself talks about her endlessly condescending treatment from highups in the government who are often not just “patronising and arrogant”, but downright rude. The fact that Lucas’s parliamentary career has coincided with all those long years of Tory-led government and the chaos and tumult that have come with them – not least Brexit, which she passionately opposed – has made her job all the harder. But when I ask her to name her achievements as an MP, she rattles through them without missing a beat. She was first elected to represent the Brighton Pavilion constituency back in 2010, with a majority of just over 1,200 votes, but at the last election the figure was almost 20,000. She talks about using her time in the Commons to “put things on the political agenda that simply wouldn’t have been there without me being here” – such as fracking, and the political establishment’s constant fetishisation of economic growth. One of her proudest achievements, she says, is the creation of a new GCSE in natural history, the result of four years’ work in partnership with the author and conservationist Mary Colwell, assisted by Conservative ministers including Michael Gove, and unveiled in 2022. But on her party’s most defining political issue, for every step forward, there has always been at least another in the opposite direction. “When I first came into parliament in 2010, whenever budget day came around, I knew what I would say, because I knew that there was going to be a climate-shaped hole at the heart of it,” she tells me. “And to some extent that’s changed: the people in charge do now at least pay lip service to those things.” Her face then darkens. “But when you actually look at what they’re doing, this government in particular is rolling back climate commitments. And that’s been just so demoralising. And dangerous.” There’s then a pause, followed by a word that she pronounces like a profanity. “So cynical.” To coincide with her exit from the Commons, Lucas is promoting a new book. Another England is straplined: “How to reclaim our national story”, and represents her contribution to a long-running conversation that has largely taken place on the political fringes – about why the left is so allergic to thinking seriously about the UK’s largest nation and its lack of a coherent political voice, and how it thereby lets rightwing Tories and populists have that terrain to themselves. One obvious result of that imbalance, she says, was Brexit. On the Friday morning when the result of the 2016 referendum was announced, she recalls waking up in central London and experiencing an overpowering feeling of disaster. “I felt like I’d been punched,” she says. “It felt really physical. I felt really sick, and disorientated. Like we’d really, really fucked up. And we had. That was the sadness of it: that we didn’t run a very good campaign.” Soon enough, she began to make sense of what had happened by visiting a handful of Brexit-voting localities around England – the Isle of Wight; the Midlands town of Dudley; Huddersfield in West Yorkshire; and Dagenham in outer London – and listening to people explain why they supported leaving the EU. Under the banner of Dear Leavers, this resulted in a series of videos that combined a sense of those places’ powerlessness (“London could have been on another planet in terms of decision-making; there was this just real sense that people had been totally ignored for a hell of a long time”) with glimpses of their history and traditions. It was this experience that seems to have planted the seeds of the book. Partly, it’s a manifesto, setting out the case for a universal basic income, radical devolution, an English parliament, drastic climate action and more. It is also her answer to what she calls “Anglocentric British nationalism” – or, put another way, “the Boris Johnson version of England; just blathering on about everything being world-beating”. But its big sources of inspiration lie a long way from the world of Westminster: again and again, the arguments she sets out begin with the work of such authors and poets as William Blake, HG Wells and Zadie Smith. In that sense, the book reflects aspects of its author’s backstory that she has very rarely talked about. Lucas was born and raised in the elegant town of Malvern in Worcestershire, which nestles under the towering Malvern Hills. Thanks to the time she spent at Exeter University, she has not only a degree in English literature, but a PhD, for which she focused on a sub-genre of Elizabethan chapbooks: short romances aimed at female readers, whose plots were borrowed by Shakespeare for such plays as A Winter’s Tale. “A lot of them were stories in which women were incredibly powerful,” she says. “But without exception, they were killed off on the penultimate page. The moral was always kind of upended: ‘Dear reader, it really doesn’t pay to be a feisty, awkward woman.’” Her husband is an English teacher – and, just to emphasise the sense of village-green tradition that runs through some of her personal biography, a former professional cricketer. Lucas’s life before politics also includes other interesting details, such as the year she spent as a student at the University of Kansas in the small city of Lawrence, where she volunteered at a feminist bookshop called Spinsters – “the only one for hundreds and hundreds of miles around”, which people would make long pilgrimages to visit – and took modules on such subjects as modern art, Buddhism and folk stories. You can detect all these influences in a book that comes close to suggesting that the left should adopt a completely new mindset. “It’s not enough to have technocratic answers,” she insists. “You’ve got to speak to people’s emotions and tell compelling stories. And I don’t think we on the left are very good at doing that. And so part of this is about reclaiming the power of story and saying that the right must not have complete carte blanche when it comes to choosing the stories to tell about England. Unless we get on the pitch and start telling our own, we lose a way of reaching people that is incredibly resonant and important.” The book is peppered with examples of the kind of stories she means. She goes back to the Charter of the Forest of 1215, which set out rights of popular access to the land, something we might now think of as dangerously radical. She traces the evolution of the myth of Robin Hood, and how it turned into the story of a “character who is opposed to greed and power, and who combines this resistance to the powerful with compassion for those in need”. By way of a rebuke to the standard rightwing view of the second world war – basically the tale of doughty Brits staunchly standing alone – she points out that one in 10 of the RAF’s fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain were refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. Put these stories together, she suggests, and you get a more forward-looking vision of England than the one offered by the people who brought us Brexit – something we may very well need if the ties that bind the UK continue to loosen. “There’s solid support for independence in Scotland,” she says. “In Wales, there’s just been a new commission on the future of the country which has included independence as one of the options. We’ve heard that now Sinn Féin has far more power in Northern Ireland, they are actively thinking that a referendum for a united Ireland could happen before 2030. But in England we’re not even thinking about any of that. And if we don’t, you can bet your life that the populists and the rightwing people will be, because they always get there first.” At that point, she grabs the stack of paper on the desk and legs it to the Commons. The next morning at nine o’clock sharp, we talk by video call for another half-hour – firstly, about how she feels about the seemingly inevitable end of Tory rule, and the arrival of a government led by Keir Starmer. “My first response would be, of course Labour is going to be a hundred times better than this government,” she says. “But that’s a very low bar. The bigger question is: is it going to be good enough? And to my mind, with everything that I’ve seen so far, the answer to that is no.” Self-evidently, a lot of her political attention is focused on helping the Greens to retain her slightly remodelled constituency (her prospective successor in Brighton is the party’s former London mayoral candidate Siân Berry). She also talks up their chances in the new seat of Bristol Central – and, somewhat more ambitiously, the prospect of taking the rural seat of North Herefordshire. Very soon, she says, one of the party’s tasks is likely to centre on somehow pressuring Labour to be “bolder and braver” – on such issues as green investment, reversing the Tories’ cruel benefits policies, and changing the tax system to tackle huge wealth inequality. “Labour is going to go nowhere on any of those issues,” she says. “And yet they need to. So the Greens will push them.” But what will she be doing? She has some ideas about getting involved in the more political aspects of art and culture, and reconnecting with nature, but they are still vague and tentative. One aspect of her post-parliament life, however, is already under way: she is training to be an end-of-life-doula – essentially, a care worker who sees to the needs of people nearing death, and their friends and families. “The organisation I’m training with is called Living Well Dying Well,” she says. “And I think the ‘living well’ part of that is important. We live better when we keep in mind that life is short. And there’s a practical point about the fact that we do death so badly in this country.” In what way? “Well, we’re embarrassed about it. It’s the last taboo. People will cross the road rather than speak to a friend who’s lost a loved one because they don’t know how to talk about it.” Some of these thoughts, she says, were first triggered when her father died of prostate cancer just as the pandemic began; since then, she has also lost her mother. “When my dad was dying, I didn’t recognise the different stages of death. And I’ve learned since that just as there are different stages of birth that you can recognise, with dilation and contractions and so on, in many deaths there are the same kinds of moments: the changing of people’s breathing or the amount of time someone spends being conscious. But that familiarity with death is something that we have lost. And we could make people’s deaths so much more meaningful – even beautiful sometimes. There’s just so much more we could be doing.” As she explains all this, the conversation eventually returns to the life she is leaving behind. “It’s very nourishing to be among people who cut through the crap and get to what really matters,” she says. “In some ways, that’s the opposite of parliament, isn’t it?” Another England by Caroline Lucas is published by Cornerstone (£22).

2023-08-10T01:14:54Z,Biden’s China investment ban: who’s targeted and what does it mean for the 2024 US election?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/joe-biden-us-china-investment-ban-who-is-targeted-what-does-it-mean-for-2024-usa-election,"Joe Biden has moved to restrict US investment in Chinese technology, signing an executive order which focuses on a few, sensitive hi-tech sectors including semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). It is the latest in a series of measures taken by the US to restrict China’s access to the most advanced technology and comes as the president has embarked on a multi-state tour of the south-west to tout his plans to revive American manufacturing after decades of decline. The restrictions are expected to take effect next year – and come at a sensitive time in the US-China relationship. The Biden administration has launched diplomatic overtures to Beijing in recent months, seeking to mend ties after a series of incidents, while still attempting to bolster its position against China on military, economic and technological fronts. What are the latest restrictions? As a result of previous Biden administration measures, the US already bans or restricts the export to China of many of the technologies covered in these new measures. The aim of Wednesday’s executive order is to prevent US funds from helping China build its own domestic capabilities, which could undermine the existing export controls. Under the executive order, the US Treasury has been directed to regulate certain US investments in semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. China, Hong Kong and Macau are listed as the “countries of concern”, but a senior Biden official has told Reuters other countries could be added in the future. The rules are not retroactive and apply to to future investments, with officials saying the goal is to regulate investments in areas that could give China military and intelligence advantages. Britain and the European Union have signalled their intention to move along similar lines, and the Group of Seven advanced economies agreed in June that restrictions on outbound investments should be part of an overall toolkit. Biden’s plan has been criticised by Republicans, many of whom say it does not go far enough. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has called it “almost laughable”, adding that the plan is “riddled with loopholes … and fails to include industries China’s government deems critical”, he said. How has China reacted? A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said the White House had ignored “China’s repeated expression of deep concerns” about the plan. The embassy warned that it would affect more than 70,000 US companies that do business in China, hurting both Chinese and American businesses. The country’s commerce ministry said it reserved the right to take countermeasures and encouraged the US to respect the laws of market economy and the principle of fair competition. What part do these measures play in Biden’s re-election bid? As the executive order was made public, Biden was speaking in New Mexico, touting his government’s success in boosting manufacturing jobs in the renewable energy sector. “Where’s it written that America can’t lead the world again in manufacturing? Because we’re going to do just that,” Biden said at the groundbreaking of a new factory manufacturing wind turbine towers in the city of Belon. “Instead of exporting American jobs, we’re creating American jobs and we’re exporting American products,” he added. However, polling shows that for many, the perception of the president’s economic policies – “Bidenomics” as his communications team likes to call them – are at odds with a range of positive indicators. US inflation has dropped to the lowest levels since 2021 and the administration has repeatedly touted months of consistent jobs growth; despite this though multiple polls show that only a minority of Americans support Biden’s handling of the economy. The cornerstone of Biden’s refreshed bid to voters are two major bills he shepherded through Congress and signed into law a year ago: the Chips and Science Act – which pumps huge funding into semiconductor manufacturing, research and development – and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a law for megaprojects boosting green investment. The chips act aims to further freeze China’s semiconductor industry in place, while pouring billions of dollars in subsidies into the US chip industry. Both laws, along with the growing restrictions on Chinese industry, are positioned to win back portions of the working-class vote who felt left behind by globalisation and turned to Donald Trump at previous elections. What’s next? The ban is a step in a broad and ongoing push to undermine China’s efforts to achieve independence in a number of technological areas, in particular the development of advanced semiconductors. In recent months, the US government has signalled it still wants to close some loopholes Chinese businesses are using to get their hands on the most advanced semiconductors. In response to previous chip bans, Nvidia one of the world’s leading chip companies, has started offering a less advanced chip, the A800, to Chinese buyers. But new curbs being considered by Washington would restrict even those products. In possible anticipation of such a move China’s tech giants – including Baidu, TikTok-owner ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba – have made orders worth $1bn to acquire about 100,000 A800 processors from the Nvidia to be delivered this year, the Financial Times has reported. The Chinese groups had also bought a further $4bn worth of graphics processing units to be delivered in 2024, according to the report.

2023-06-10T14:06:22Z,"Labour has clear lead in more than 100 battleground seats, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/10/labour-lead-tories-battleground-seats-poll-conservatives-election,"Labour has established a clear lead over the Tories in more than 100 battleground seats that will decide the next election, according to a new analysis seen by the Observer. In a rare insight into marginal constituencies at next year’s election, Keir Starmer’s party has now secured a 10% swing from the Conservatives in a set of 144 seats in which the vote will be won and lost. Labour now holds a seven-point lead over the Tories in the seats, which include marginals in England, Wales and Scotland. With both main parties increasingly refining their key policy offers ahead of a looming election, the research suggests Labour now sits on 39% of the vote in the marginal seats, up from 32% at the last election. Meanwhile, the Tories have slumped from 44% to 32%. However, the polling suggests that Labour’s hopes of securing an overall majority remain on a knife edge. To achieve this, Labour needs to win an additional 124 parliamentary constituencies. The analysis suggests it is on course to win about 117 seats from the Conservatives in England &amp; Wales and about six to eight from the SNP in Scotland. That would give that party 123-125 extra seats. Worryingly for Rishi Sunak, Labour has also amassed a huge lead among the under-50s in the seats, which include many of the “red wall” constituencies that the Tories won for the first time in 2019. Labour leads by 28 points among those under 50. The rare analysis examining the battleground seats features in a report for the UK 2040 Options project, overseen by the Nesta thinktank and the Behavioural Insights unit, which aims to set out the policy options for tackling the biggest challenges facing the country over the next two decades. Opinium polled 4,000 voters living in key marginal constituencies. It picked the 124 constituencies that Labour came closest to winning and combined them with the 100 constituencies most narrowly won by the Tories. Many seats were in both groups, giving them 144 battleground seats. Both parties are now planning their strategies for the next election and attempting to bolster their reputation for fiscal credibility. Labour is blaming the Tories for the increase in mortgage costs hitting millions of homeowners and the Conservatives are warning that Labour’s green investment plans would push up inflation. The marginal seats research found that the economy and the NHS are the overwhelming priorities for voters there and are likely to dominate the election. Nearly a third (31%) of voters think inflation and cost of living is the most urgent issue, followed by NHS staffing and funding (20%). One in 10 voters selected immigration as the most important issue to tackle, although this rose to 19% among the over-65s. Tory MPs expect tax cuts to be made next year, with most hoping for a cut to income tax as the headline election offer. However, the research suggests that tax cuts are not a priority for voters in the key set of seats. Just 12% expressed a preference for cutting taxes and spending less on public services, with 38% wanting to keep tax and spending as they are. A further 36% want to raise taxes and spend more on public services. Labour appears to be making the most significant progress in England in the Midlands, where it lost significant ground to the Tories at the last election. It has secured a 12.7% swing from the Tories in the region. Ravi Gurumurthy, Nesta’s chief executive, said that the analysis made it abundantly clear that the state of the economy and the NHS were the dominant issues ahead of an election next year. “The public is often represented as being polarised and divided, but there’s a lot of agreement among voters about the issues we need to solve right now and for the country’s future,” he said. “The public primarily wants the government and politicians to focus on the economy and health services. We’ve had quite a few handbrake turns on policy. Regardless of who forms the next government the UK is in desperate need of an extended period of stable policy-making. This means levelling with voters about trade-offs. People deserve grown-up debates about the decisions that will affect their lives now and in the coming decades.”",Labour; Opinion polls; Conservatives; Politics; Keir Starmer; Rishi Sunak; UK news,Politics
2024-03-31T10:00:36Z,Weather watcher: why Matt Gaw is a man for all seasons,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/31/weather-watcher-why-matt-gaw-is-a-man-for-all-seasons,"I don’t usually pray for rain before an interview, especially one taking place outdoors. But a few days before our scheduled meeting, Matt Gaw tells me the chance of some precipitation is “half decent”. Excellent. As I leave north London there’s a faint, almost invisible drizzle in the air, but by the time I’m in Suffolk, the wind has blown that away. Why do I want rain? Gaw, a nature writer, has just written a book about weather, In All Weathers, in which he argues we should experience it in all its forms. We are culturally programmed to see sun as good, pretty much everything else as bad. As soon as children are given crayons they draw smiling Teletubbie suns. In books and films, rain signifies something ominous around the corner. Mist hides scary things. Snow, perhaps an exception, is magical – until it turns to slush. I meet Gaw at Knettishall Heath, a nature reserve on the Suffolk side of the Little Ouse border with Norfolk. It’s an alluring habitat, a mishmash of woodland, heathland and meadow, with a sizeable herd of Exmoor ponies. We stride through bog and woods with Lyra, Gaw’s jack russell, who clearly doesn’t want to be there, especially when the wind picks up. At various points Gaw carries Lyra, much to his embarrassment. Evidently, she hasn’t embraced his all-weather message. Nature was ever present in my childhood. Family holidays were spent hiking in Snowdonia or the Bannau Brycheiniog, formerly known as the Brecon Beacons, often in the rain. I can’t say I enjoyed getting soaked, but the strong winds that blew you off course – now they were fun. But mostly I’ve never thought much about weather. When I started growing vegetables, I began to notice the changing sun and rain patterns, primarily because I wanted good tomatoes. But mostly the weather is just, well, there. Gaw wants us to change that perspective, to change the dichotomy between good and bad. Knettishall is an important location for Gaw, who lives in nearby Bury St Edmunds. It’s the site of one of his first pieces of nature writing, a story about swimming in the Little Ouse with his daughter, Eliza, then aged four. It was a contribution to Melissa Harrison’s beloved Seasons anthology in 2016. A book deal followed. In The Pull of the River, released in 2018, he canoed Britain’s rivers. Two years later, for Under the Stars, he walked around the country at night. Born in Colchester in 1980, Gaw grew up in Halstead, north Essex. “We weren’t birdwatchers or anything,” he says, but most of his time was spent playing outside, fording streams and climbing trees. Family holidays were in caravans in the Peak District. At the University of Sussex, an intellectual interest in nature took hold, and reading the likes of Roger Deakin, Robert McFarlane and Aldo Leopold’s A Sand County Almanac stirred something in him, as did the works of Kathleen Jamie and Melissa Harrison. To Gaw, these writers are experts at exploring a place and their relationship with that place. “They show you that if you visit somewhere enough times, along with the fondness of familiarity, there is a strangeness, too, a newness, a different way of seeing.” After a BA in philosophy, Gaw did a master’s degree in aesthetics, where he railed against convention. “There’s this whole tradition of distance, removing yourself and looking at a scene.” For him, nature was about immersing oneself in it, “rather than seeing yourself as removed”. That theme runs throughout his books. By canoeing you see the country from a different angle, a “frog’s eye view”, as Deakin would call it. He avoided the sea so as not be apart from the land, and floating through the countryside, he saw it transformed. “The world becomes bigger, more interesting. The river is a window on to another world and a way of looking back at ours.” In his 2020 follow-up, Under the Stars, Gaw saw the world through an entirely different perspective: the dark. His books, he says, are about learning, expanding his world. “What makes me really excited is that childhood feeling when you realise something amazing about the world, when it just seems bigger.” He spent a decade as a journalist, until becoming a father, when he found himself more affected by stories he was writing. He freelanced and, in his 30s, turned to nature. In All Weathers is a lovely book, Gaw is a brilliant writer who immerses the reader in his experiences. There are interesting facts, but it’s no scientific survey – this is about how one man experienced weather, from gales on Skye’s Neist Point and fog on the fens to rain at England’s wettest inhabited spot, Seathwaite in Cumbria. There is no chapter on sun, though it is the reason he wrote the book. Where were you during that cloying, boiling, sleep-depriving summer of 2022, where the mercury topped 40C? I was stuck on busy London tubes and Gaw was at home in Bury St Edmunds hoping for rain. When was the last time he’d gone out walking in the rain, he thought to himself, to really experience how it felt? “My grandparents used to have this old weather house on their windowsill,” Gaw remembers. “There were two little people inside. If it was sunny, the man would pop out smiling. If it was raining, it would be someone coming out with this horrible grimace on their face.” But that summer, nothing could be more welcome than rain. It got him thinking. Can you pinpoint the last time you experienced a cloudy day with average temperatures? Or a light breeze, or shower? In this country we talk about the weather constantly, almost reflexively. But unless it’s extreme, knocking down trees, flooding homes or causing droughts, we don’t notice what it feels like. Gaw set out to do just that. He tracked where rain would fall or fog would appear – the latter was trickier than he thought, often disappearing by the time he arrived. He writes about heading into Cumbrian fells in storms, as a descending walker warns him to turn back. “I was woefully unprepared. I thought everything was weatherproof. I got absolutely soaked, my phone got ruined.” But it was beautiful, too. “Watching the rain move across the fells, it was like ribbons, it felt flowing and living. It sounds a little bit hippy, but I like the idea that it was feeling you. It was almost like, you feel, therefore you are.” We know (not too much) sun is good for us, providing vitamin D and increasing serotonin. But rain can be positive, too, Gaw argues. Research indicates that negative ions, atmospheric molecules charged with electricity, are abundant around water, including the rain, and may positively impact mental health. But many of the benefits are intangible. “Noticing the weather makes you much more present within your environment. Weather is a lot about time.” In fact, in many Latin languages, the words for time and weather are the same. “Perhaps our weather can, in some small way, teach us to see again,” says Gaw. It is also about changes. It can be hard to get excited about a dull day, but there is little more beautiful than the shifts that can bring. Rays of sun bursting through grey cloud alter our perspective on the landscape. Birds start singing. It changes how we feel. “That’s what Wordsworth got really excited about, the transition,” says Gaw. “Not just experiencing the rain, but the sudden movement where the sun comes through. That’s the key of the book. It was about noticing the weather, but because once you start getting clocked into the weather, you clock into everything else.” Weather is also destructive. Wind creates stress on the body, and may even increase the risk of heart attack. Rain causes floods, sun creates droughts, ice can create car crashes. “We need to respect it,” says Gaw, who doesn’t suggest putting oneself in danger just to experience “weather”. In his day job, Gaw teaches English at a secondary school, where he constantly talks about pathetic fallacies, something deeply ingrained in our culture and language. Horror films always take place at night, the rain weeps, mist is mysterious. We talk about brain fog and not having the foggiest. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, according to him, as long as we’re aware it doesn’t have to be like that. As we emerge from birch woodland into heath, grey clouds give way to rays of sun. The low afternoon light is sharp, brown turns almost to green, and talk turns to the climate crisis. For his previous books, Gaw could have flown to the US to canoe its great rivers, or see Nevada’s sweeping, clear night skies. He didn’t, because of the environmental impact of flying, as well as accessibility. “The nature writing I’ve always had an affinity for is where I know I’ve got a chance of experiencing it,” says Gaw. Climate change was a big factor – after that broiling 2022 summer, 2023 was the hottest year on record. “One of the challenges of the book was to celebrate weather, but at the same time recognise this shadow of climatic chaos. I didn’t want it to be: ‘Everything’s wonderful.’” Though he says governments bear more responsibility than individuals, nature writing can play a vital role. “It’s more than whether people go out in the rain or not.” For Gaw, understanding how weather transforms the world can ignite a passion and desire to protect it. “We only care about what we know about and what we love.” Is he positive? We meet a few days after Labour drops its £28bn green investment pledge, amid climate being embroiled in the “woke wars”. “Hopeful is a better word.” Gaw’s role as a teacher gives him a unique insight into teenagers’ views. It is unusual to find one who isn’t clued up and even if they don’t talk about a particular government, it’s clear they’re angry. “For them, adults are the people in power and they have not done enough.” His children, Seth, 15, and Eliza, 13, enjoy wild swimming and have joined Gaw on many of his weather-seeking missions. “I want them to be exposed to it, to see it’s something normal. It’s harder, in some respects, for my kids to have a connection to nature like I did. Maybe they didn’t play in the same way. Even though we intend those things, our world has changed; the way we operate has changed.” How has the book changed Gaw? He still loves sun, but now it’s “just one part of a vast, complex, beautiful weatherscape and I know I need it all to experience the world to its fullest extent”, he writes in the epilogue. “The blossoming of summer is no more precious than the glimmer of ice and snow, the wild, blood-bubbling wind, the movement and beauty of an autumnal drenching.” On my way home I stop at my dad’s house in Clare, a small Suffolk town south of Knettishall. He’s keen to show me a barn owl he sees most days. The wind is heavy, a light rain begins to fall, I can hear the gentle prick prick of rain on my jacket. It tickles my face. We don’t see the owl, but I spot a kestrel on a tree 20 yards away. The sun glimmers through the cloud, brightening its rust-coloured body. It takes off, almost showing off as it gathers itself in the heavy winds above our heads before flying away. Moments later, we see a buzzard perched regally on a pole. Behind it, a rainbow begins to emerge. I think about Gaw’s book, about how in normal circumstances I might not have bothered leaving home in this weather. I would have missed the kestrel, the buzzard, the rain on my cheeks, the cloud turning to rain turning to sun.

2023-01-05T18:19:28Z,Labour is trumpeting its Great British Energy plan – but where’s the detail? | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jan/05/labour-great-british-energy-plan-gbe,"Keir Starmer is promising to turn from slogans to solutions, so here’s a request: can we have a few concrete details on how Great British Energy, a flagship Labour proposal to create “a publicly owned national champion in clean energy”, would operate? The most basic unanswered question is how much capital the new company would be given on day one. Until we’re told, it’s impossible to tell if GBE would merely reassemble the old small-scale Green Investment Bank, which was launched by George Osborne for the coalition government in 2012 and sold in 2017, or pursue far more ambitious goals, which tends to be Labour’s claim. Starmer committed to create GBE at party conference last September and repeated the pledge in a speech on Thursday. The idea is to nationalise precisely nothing, note. Nor would the new entity be involved in the retail supply end of the energy market or transmission. It would stick to creating new clean generating capacity, often “in collaboration with the private sector”. The idea seems to flow from several reasonable observations. First, many European countries have publicly owned energy generators: Sweden has Vattenfall and the Danish state owns half of Ørsted, which operates 30% of the offshore windfarms in UK waters. Second, the lack of UK ownership of UK generating assets is embarrassing. The Perth-based FTSE 100 firm SSE, which itself wants to be the “UK’s clean energy champion”, is in third place in the generation league table. The biggest player is EDF – owned by the French state – thanks to its nuclear interests. A lot of dividend payments flow abroad, in other words – Starmer last year spoke about the billpayers of Swansea paying for schools and hospitals in Stockholm thanks to Swedish ownership of a local onshore windfarm. Third, for all the progress in deploying offshore wind at scale, the UK hasn’t grabbed the supply chain opportunities. No great UK manufacturer of wind turbines has emerged over the past 20 years, despite the billions added to our bills in green levies. So, yes, one can imagine how a state-backed player could agitate usefully to shift the industrial profile a little. But then one comes to hard questions of priorities, tradeoffs and returns on investment – stuff that matters on the ground. Since the world is awash with capital willing to finance onshore and conventional offshore windfarms in the UK, Labour understandably imagines GBE investing in earlier-stage technologies such as floating offshore wind, hydrogen, tidal power and small nuclear reactors. Fine: one can see how reliable state-backed funding could encourage private sector players to push marginal projects over the line, just as the old Green Investment Bank did. But that is more akin to a financing mechanism. Would GBE be a “company” only in the sense that it would own its portfolio of minority stakes for ever? If so, it would be more like a national infrastructure fund rather than an operator like Orsted. No shame in that, but the financial mandate shouldn’t be blurry. If a tidal scheme, say, proves economically unviable, would GBE be encouraged to back it anyway in the interests of energy security? The interaction with current funding schemes – for the Rolls-Royce-led small reactor programme and so on – also matters. Would those funding pots be wrapped into GBE or be administered separately? If GBE adds to the overall setup, it could be helpful, argues the independent energy analyst Peter Atherton; but, if it requires years of reorganisation of current schemes, then it could cause delays. It’s a fair point. Again, the design of the model is crucial. The funding, to repeat, is the biggest question. Initial capitalisation “will depend on the investment decisions GBE decides to make based upon commercial negotiation”, we’re told, a formulation that could mean almost anything. As one senior business figure puts it unkindly, Labour’s ambitions for the new company “depend on whether one is talking to [the shadow chancellor] Rachel Reeves or [the shadow climate change secretary] Ed Miliband”. The idea of forming a publicly owned generation company isn’t remotely radical in itself. The state is already knee-deep in the market via contracts-for-difference and other incentive schemes. Owning a few projects – or stakes in projects – just takes the process a step or two further. But it is reasonable to expect the initial scale of the venture to be settled at an early stage. Are we talking billions or tens of billions? The era of detailed policies approaches.

2023-06-02T14:31:47Z,British energy developers to be told: speed up projects or leave queue for grid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/02/britibritish-energy-developers-projects-national-grid-solar-power,"Britain’s electricity system operator will tell energy developers to get on with their projects or get out of the queue for a grid connection as it struggles to manage the growing backlog of delayed green energy projects. The ultimatum is expected to help speed up the 10- to 15-year wait for a grid connection, which is holding back billions in green investment and threatens to derail the UK’s progress towards its climate targets. The electricity system operator, which is owned by the FTSE 100 energy firm National Grid, has faced fierce criticism for the green energy gridlock but has promised its new reforms could slash up to 10 years from the current waiting time. It said it would tell developers to “get on, get back or get out of the energy queue” to make way for projects that are ready to generate clean electricity for the grid. This means developers that have applied for a connection will need to prove that their schemes are making progress, or risk losing their place in the queue. The company has retained a legal firm to help move aside delayed developers to make way for viable projects. It is also working with the regulator to tweak existing rules that developers can build their own grid connections. The reforms come following growing criticism within the UK’s renewable energy industry over National Grid’s handling of its grid connection queue. MPs revealed last month that businesses in Great Britain were facing waits of up to 15 years to secure a connection to solar power installations, which could pull the plug on the government’s ambition to install 70GW of solar by 2035. The energy regulator Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, last month described the delays as unacceptable and criticised a “legacy of stalled, unviable and often highly speculative ‘zombie’ projects blocking ready-to-go solar, wind and other renewable schemes stuck behind them”. There are about 220 projects waiting to be hooked up to the national transmission system before 2026 but only half of these projects have planning permission and some have pushed back their expected start date by up to 14 years, according to the system operator. Barnaby Wharton, a director at trade association Renewable UK, said: “Grid connection delays are holding back £15bn of investment in offshore wind alone over the course of this decade, at the very time when we need to boost our energy security as quickly as possible and provide cheap power for consumers to tackle the cost of living crisis.” The changes could help “unlock new clean energy capacity faster” by letting projects that are ready to connect to the grid move ahead of projects that “simply aren’t making progress”, Wharton added. In the past National Grid only had to set up connections to the occasional, usually large, power plant – but the green electricity boom has led to many more grid connection applications from hundreds of smaller renewable energy projects. The pace of the UK’s renewables rollout is expected to build to help meet an anticipated 50% rise in demand for electricity across the country by 2035. The government has set out plans to build enough offshore wind to power every home in the UK by 2030, and promised to lift an effective ban on onshore wind farms in England, too. The UK is also expecting to increase the number of subsea cables connecting the grid to neighbouring countries. Zoisa North-Bond, the chief executive of Octopus Energy Generation, a sister company to home energy supplier Octopus Energy, said the new grid reforms were “a positive step” but added that the “devil is in the detail”. “We’re past the point of polite processes. What we need is fresh thinking beyond the concept of ‘a queue’, like concrete dates to implement steps, a firmer stance on prioritising renewables over fossil fuels, and better use of data to show where projects can connect quicker. This will end the gridlock, unlock Britain’s colossal renewables potential and bring down bills for good,” she said.",Energy industry; National Grid; Utilities; Business; UK news; Solar power; Energy; Environment,Business
2023-04-05T23:01:08Z,Businesses in north of England ask ministers for help to hit net zero,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/06/businesses-in-north-of-england-ask-ministers-for-help-to-hit-net-zero,"Business leaders in the north of England have written to the prime minister, chancellor and energy secretary asking for help to reach net zero. Big names including Drax, Siemens, Peel, Manchester airport, the CBI and all 11 local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) in the north signed a letter urging the government to prioritise green growth in the north. The letter called for a meeting to discuss investment that would close “regional disparities by creating hundreds of thousands of highly skilled new jobs and building healthy, resilient communities”. The north already generated 50% of England’s renewable energy and was decarbonising 13% faster than the country as a whole, the group said. The business leaders signing the open letter were ambitious to go even further, they added, arguing that the north of England could help the UK take advantage of the huge economic opportunity the global transition to net zero represents. A report last year by the 11 LEPs in partnership with Nature North, Transport for the North and the N8 research group found that green investment in the north could unlock £6bn of prosperity. It identified areas that could be further developed, such as offshore wind capabilities in the North Sea and the Mersey Tidal Power project, as well as nature projects such as the Great Northern Forest, which will ultimately plant at least 50m trees across the north of England, and the Great North Bog, an ambitious peatland restoration initiative that will restore nearly 7,000 sq km of upland peat. The business leaders welcomed a £20bn commitment to carbon capture, utilisation and storage outlined in the budget and in the Powering Up Britain policy paper released last week. The paper, setting out how the government would enhance the UK’s energy security and deliver on its net zero commitments, was published by the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which was established in February and is headed up by Grant Shapps. The letter read: “Our region has an industrial heritage like nowhere else in the world. A driving force of the original Industrial Revolution, the north continues to produce innovations that are central to UK competitiveness and are changing the world. Nowhere is this clearer than in green and low-carbon technologies. “Half of all renewable energy generated in England comes from the north. There are exciting plans to use carbon capture and hydrogen to decarbonise our major industrial regions. Although we have traditionally been a large carbon emitter, thanks to these new low carbon opportunities, the region is now decarbonising significantly faster than the UK as a whole.” It added: “Just as the north led national growth in the first Industrial Revolution, and transformed the future of the country, we can and will lead the transition towards low-carbon energy, generating a surplus of secure clean energy and reaping economic rewards. “We have the skills, the desire, and the drive to take this once-in-a-generation opportunity. We are ambitious to capitalise on the huge international demand for the technologies northern business are developing.”",Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Business; England; Siemens; Drax; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Energy storage; Energy industry; UK news,Environment
2023-07-22T05:00:04Z,"As Labour loses Uxbridge over Ulez, what now for the party’s green policies?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/22/as-labour-loses-uxbridge-over-ulez-what-now-for-the-partys-green-policies,"Do “tree huggers” have a place in Keir Starmer’s Labour party? After the party’s failure to take Boris Johnson’s former seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in Thursday’s byelection, the Labour leader’s commitment to green policies has been called into question. Earlier this month, the Sunday Times reported that Starmer has grown so frustrated with green policies – which the Tories are accused of having “weaponised” to spark a culture war over the environment – that he declared: “I hate tree huggers.” Labour insiders rushed to say this was not true, and pointed to the recent launch of a number of green measures, including a halt to new North Sea oil and gas licences; decarbonising the energy system by 2030; and £28bn a year for green investment, though this was postponed to the second half of the next parliament instead of the start. The Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection, which Labour failed to win by just 495 votes, has revived concerns. Uxbridge is one of the most car-dependent constituencies in the country, and Labour’s London mayor Sadiq Khan is about to introduce an extension to the ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) that would penalise the area’s most polluting vehicles in an attempt to clean up the capital’s filthy air. Starmer blamed Labour’s failure to take the seat it was keenly targeting on the anti-pollution policy. He told journalists: “Ulez was the reason we didn’t win there yesterday. We know that. We heard that on the doors. And we’ve all got to reflect on that, including the mayor.” Asked what “reflect” meant and whether Ulez should be scrapped, Starmer refused to defend the policy. He said: “We’ve got to look at the result. The mayor needs to reflect. And it’s too early to say what should happen next.” Tom Burke, the co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, predicted that those within Labour who are antagonistic to green measures will seize this moment. He said: “There will be pressure inside Labour – some people will take fright from this.” Some trade unions have deep reservations about the transition to a low-carbon economy, and some in the party are fearful over Tory attacks on climate policies. But Burke warned that Starmer should not listen to these concerns. He said: “They should be very careful in generalising from this to climate policy more generally. What Starmer should do is not attack his own side, but communicate far more effectively what the consequences will be of climate policy failure. That’s what’s missing from this debate.” Insiders said there would be no change to Labour’s green stance. A Labour source said that green policies such as ramping up renewable energy and home insulation were the way to bring down soaring bills. The source added: “It’s full steam ahead on policies that tackle the climate crisis and the cost of living, as they can only be tackled together – that’s the only way.” Doug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, said that is the right response. He explained: “The worst and most regressive take would be that this shows green policy is unpopular. We know that people are crying out for action on climate and nature, and it needs visionary and fair policy to make it happen. “Far from retreating, they need to go further and faster and ensure that measures are in place for ensuring the burden of change does not fall on those with the least resources.” The local problem of the Ulez is also likely to dissipate. Khan’s team said it would still come into force at the end of August, and small businesses and those receiving child benefit will get financial help to scrap the most polluting vehicles. They hope that the onset of the scheme will dispel damaging myths over who will be affected, and help people to realise the benefits of cleaner air. What is clear is that Starmer can expect many more attacks from the Tories on green grounds. Labour insiders alleged that the Tory campaign in Uxbridge was fought with “dirty tricks”, with voters being misled over the impact of Ulez. They say many voters were given the mistaken impression that they would lose the right to use their cars, when in fact only one in 10 people will be affected. In one case, a driver of a Tesla electric car berated Labour canvassers on the doorstep, fearing he would face restrictions, based on Tory campaigning. It seems unlikely there will be any letup in the Tory climate culture war, however, now that the Uxbridge campaign has borne such fruit. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, has been stepping up his attacks on Labour, branding the party “the political wing of Just Stop Oil”. He wrote to Starmer this week to demand Labour pay compensation for damage caused by the group’s protesters. Burke was scathing about these tactics. He said: “Whenever you see politicians being rude like this, it means they really don’t know what to say about how to square the divisions inside their own party on the issue. These Tory attacks are increasingly ridiculous, and they are misleading themselves about what the public think.”",Byelections; Conservatives; Labour; Environment; Keir Starmer; Low emission zones,Politics
2023-02-03T12:00:00Z,Joe Biden’s green subsidies have left Europe struggling for a response | Lorenzo Marsili,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/03/joe-biden-green-deal-eu-joint-climate-fund,"European governments have for many years basked in a sense of climate superiority over the US. We had the most ambitious climate goals; we were the constructive actor at Cop conferences; we had carbon-pricing mechanisms; and since 1990, we have reduced emissions by 28% against just 2% in the US. The US, by contrast, had climate-denying Republicans. The Biden administration now has the world’s most generous package of climate incentives – a $370bn green subsidy package, which goes by the misnomer Inflation Reduction Act. But instead of celebrating the US handouts and tax breaks for investment in such things as electric vehicles and solar panels, many European governments are furious. Yes, it’s good for the planet. But it’s even better for American industry as the new US green subsidies are only available for products “made in America”. The scale of financing is such that some European companies are already making plans to shift production across the Atlantic. Europe fears deindustrialisation and accuses the US of protectionism and unfair competition. Just do the same, Washington argues. Develop your own green industrial policy and both sides of the pond can then lead the climate revolution together. Europe should indeed understand that a great transformation is taking shape in the US. Not only is the climate crisis finally being taken seriously. But industrial planning – or what some now call the designer economy – is back in fashion across the political spectrum. This transformation opens a unique opportunity for Europe and the world. The European Commission seems to understand this: along with a temporary relaxation of state aid rules to stimulate green projects, Brussels wants a joint European sovereignty fund to channel money to green industry. If taken seriously, this would trigger the emergence of a continent-wide industrial policy, accelerating Europe’s green transformation and the EU’s economic integration. It would place the first- and third-largest economies in the world on an equal climate-war footing, finally making emissions reduction targets a realistic prospect. With the US now on board, this is no longer mere wishful thinking. But the ball is in Europe’s court. And if you think the Americans getting ahead of Europe on climate sounds like the world upside down, wait until you hear this: the main opponents of a bold response are the supposedly great Europeans Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron – with the forever despondent Dutch premier, Mark Rutte. And the main supporter? The far-right nationalist Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Germany, and to a lesser extent France, are foot-dragging on the commission’s ambitions. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, has firmly opposed repeating the Covid-era joint borrowing fund for climate purposes. The pandemic fund was intended as a one-off, he said, not the beginning of a federalised treasury. Much better, Berlin argues, to simply allow each country to subsidise industry nationally as it sees fit. France agrees, and while it accepts the theoretical idea of a joint fund it suggests merely rebranding unspent pandemic money for the purposes of green investment. This, however, would be no better than the economic nationalism that Europe accuses the US of. When the EU relaxed state aid rules for energy in response to the war in Ukraine last year, nearly 80% of new subsidies were found to have been dished out in Germany and to a lesser extent France. Authorising more national industrial subsidies would open the floodgates to beggar-thy-neighbour competition within the EU, with Germany and France, the biggest industrial players, siphoning off clean energy industry from the rest of the continent. Italy’s Meloni, by contrast, demands that the EU act as a single economic power with a common industrial policy and joint funding to match. Of course, she hasn’t overnight become a European federalist. She simply understands that Italy’s national interest lies in a united response. Her Europeanism is the rational consequence of Italy’s fragile financial and geopolitical position. When EU leaders meet for a summit on 9-10 February, she will demand a common European climate policy, a common migration policy and a common plan for Africa. Meloni’s reasoning on green investment applies to all EU countries. Divided, the 27 are bound to be bullied by foes and friends alike – the American Inflation Reduction Act is the clearest reminder of that. Without unity, the EU’s role as a world leader in the fight against climate change all but withers away. Allowing Meloni – who until recently was branded a fascist – to pass as the advocate of a united Europe is the undesirable consequence of protectionist thinking in Paris and Berlin. European governments have a historic opportunity to join Washington in delivering a planetary industrial green strategy to prevent climate chaos. Their plan could embrace the 44 countries of the newly launched European Political Community, thereby including the UK and Turkey. Asia, Africa and Latin America could be included in the conversation early on to avoid replicating in the global south the industrial theft that the US is accused of inflicting on Europe. The EU lobbied the US to join the climate struggle and wanted the new rightwing Italian government not to sow discord and division. On both accounts, it got its wish. It’s now time to deliver. The Green party shares power in Germany and Macron stands as a driver of European integration. Will they now pull Europe together around an ambitious climate plan, or will they let Meloni grandstand as the new Macron?

2023-06-27T23:01:48Z,"UK missing climate targets on nearly every front, say government’s advisers",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/28/uk-has-made-no-progress-on-climate-plan-say-governments-own-advisers,"The government’s plans to hit net zero have been comprehensively criticised in a withering report by its own advisers that says targets are being missed on nearly every front. Fewer homes were insulated last year under the government-backed scheme than the year before, despite soaring energy bills and a cost of living crisis. There is little progress on transport emissions, no coherent programme for behaviour change, and still no decision on hydrogen for home heating. Meanwhile the installation of new wind and solar farms and the upgrading of the electricity grid are still too slow to meet net zero, according to the Climate Change Committee, which says that the lack of urgency of government and a failure of political leadership means progress has stalled. Lord Deben, the outgoing chair of the CCC, said the UK had “lost the leadership” on climate action shown at Cop26 in 2021 and done “a number of things” – such as greenlighting a new coal mine and new oil and gasfields in the North Sea – that were “utterly unacceptable”. He said the committee’s confidence that the government would meet its shorter-term carbon-cutting goals by 2030 was even lower than last year, despite the publication of a new green strategy by ministers. “We’ve slipped behind, and other people have moved ahead,” he said. “This is not a report that suggests satisfactory progress.” Greenhouse gas emissions have been falling by just under 3% a year, but this will need to double over the next eight years. The committee warned that the UK could no longer expand any of its airports without closures or shrinking of capacity elsewhere but the government seems not to have accepted this. Public charging for electric vehicles is more costly than it need be, and the government is expecting transport emissions to be higher than was previously admitted, according to the CCC’s latest annual report, published on Wednesday, entitled Progress in Reducing UK Emissions: 2023 Report to Parliament. The report also found: The number of homes receiving energy efficiency improvements under the government’s Energy Company Obligation scheme more than halved, from 383,700 in 2021 to 159,600 in 2022, according to the report. At least 1m to 2m homes should be upgraded each year to meet net zero. Homes are still being built that will need to be retrofitted with low-carbon heating and efficiency measures, because the government has not yet brought in its promised future homes standard. No decision on whether to use hydrogen for home heating will be made until 2026, leaving households and boiler companies in limbo. Emissions from transport have remained stubbornly high as the government has “made a political choice” to allow an increase in road traffic, instead of encouraging people on to public transport. There is no coherent programme to encourage people to change their high-carbon lifestyles. There is no clear policy to decarbonise steel production, or emissions from other heavy industries. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said: “What’s missing is the kind of political leadership. You’ve got a series of strings being pushed across government and no one at the top pulling it up to raise it to the political priority that is required. Until that happens, this programme [of reaching net zero] is going to run into the sand.” Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics for Greenpeace UK, said: “There’s almost no progress in this progress report, just a pitiful catalogue of Rishi Sunak’s climate failures.” The 438-page annual progress report was the committee’s 15th since the 2008 Climate Change Act, and the last for Deben, a former Conservative environment secretary, who is stepping down after an extended 10-year term as chair. An interim chair, the scientist Prof Piers Forster of Leeds, will take over while a replacement is found. Deben said ministers could still step up: “What I’m looking for is the leadership which is essential when we are at a moment not just of national emergency, but of global emergency.” Alok Sharma, the Tory MP who acted as president of Cop26, urged the government to lift the ban on onshore wind, catch up with rival countries on green jobs, and to show leadership internationally, before Cop28, the next UN climate summit, which takes place in November. “In the global race to attract green investment, jobs and growth the UK risks falling behind without a material response to initiatives from other countries like the US’s Inflation Reduction Act,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “We can be proud of the UK’s record as a world leader on net zero. We are going far beyond other countries and delivering tangible progress whilst bringing down energy bills, with hundreds of pounds coming off bills from next month. “The UK is cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and attracted billions of investment into renewables, which now account for 40% of our electricity. In the last year alone, we have confirmed the first state backing of a nuclear project in over 30 years and invested billions to kickstart new industries like carbon capture and floating offshore wind. “With a new department dedicated to delivering net zero and energy security, we are driving economic growth, creating jobs, bringing down energy bills, and reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.”",Environment; Climate crisis; UK news; Rishi Sunak; Cop28; Politics; Renewable energy,Environment
2023-06-06T11:55:07Z,"Labour to link government tenders to ‘unionised jobs’, Starmer tells GMB",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/labour-to-link-government-tenders-to-unionised-jobs-keir-starmer-tells-gmb,"Keir Starmer has promised to use public procurement to help create “unionised jobs” in the UK, after being pressed by a striking GMB member from Amazon’s Coventry warehouse. Speaking at the GMB’s annual congress in Brighton, the Labour leader was warmly applauded when he backed calls for Amazon to recognise the union in Coventry, calling it a “fantastic campaign”. Citing analysis carried out for the union that showed the web company earned £222m from government and other public sector contracts last year, GMB member Garfield Hylton asked Starmer: “What will a Labour government do to stop this flow of money to Amazon if they continue to refuse recognition of the workers’ union?” Starmer replied: “I think the point you make about contracts is really important. It’s not a free-for-all. There’s lots of public money tied up in procurement, and an incoming Labour government is entitled to say, ‘what’s the terms and conditions?’ “There’s a framework for public procurement, at the heart of which is dignity and respect, and we expect to see unionised jobs, and support unionised industries.” The Labour leader repeatedly stressed his pro-union credentials, as he addressed GMB members. “Together, we have a golden opportunity to shape the future to the interests of working people, firmly and decisively,” Starmer said. “The rest of the world is moving on from the outdated arguments our opponents provide. Put simply, people aren’t going to take it any more.” He said Labour’s £28bn-a-year green investment pledge – one of its key economic policies – would create, “good, union jobs” in the UK. “Like President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), our green prosperity plan is our plan for growth, and because we’re Labour, it is a plan for working people, their jobs and their salaries,” he said, adding there would be “incentives in contracts” to ensure jobs throughout the supply chain are created in the UK. Joe Biden’s US administration has placed conditions on billions of dollars’ worth of investment in green energy under the IRA. Firms involved have to pay the “prevailing wage,” in the relevant sector – rather than using cheap labour to undercut rivals – and make use of apprentices. The GMB has been urging Labour to attach pro-worker conditions to new government contracts, across the economy. The research carried out for the union by consultants Tussell shows the government spent a total of £222m with Amazon in 2022 – most of it with Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing subsidiary. Over the past five years, central and local government has spent £684m on contracts with Amazon and its subsidiaries, according to Tussell’s analysis. Amazon has declined a formal request for union recognition from the GMB at the company’s Coventry warehouse, known as BHX4, where staff have been involved in the first UK strike action against the firm since January, demanding pay of £15 an hour. An Amazon spokesperson said it respected its employees’ rights to join or not join a union, adding: “Amazon recognises that its status as a supplier to the public sector is a privilege which has to continually be re-earned through the quality of our services and the value for money that we bring for UK taxpayers. We know they will only remain customers for as long as we are able to deliver on both of those things.” Gary Smith, the GMB’s general secretary, said: “These [government contracts] are extraordinary sums of money, when Amazon workers are having to go on strike for decent pay. “If this amount of taxpayer cash is spent on a private company, the contract must come with guarantees on worker pay, health and safety and their right to be represented by a formally recognised trade union.” The GMB’s request for recognition in Coventry has been passed to the independent Central Arbitration Committee, which could grant statutory recognition if it judges that most workers support the idea. Starmer’s charm offensive in Brighton comes amid a rift with the GMB over energy policy. Smith has claimed that Labour has “got it wrong” in declining to license new fossil fuel exploration in the North Sea. The Labour leader was received enthusiastically by delegates, however, as he set out his party’s pro-worker policies, including a new “fair pay agreement” in social care; expanded parental leave; an end to fire-and-rehire; and full employment rights on day one of a new job. He sought to assuage fears over what Smith has called a “cliff-edge” in the North Sea energy industry, saying a Labour government would seize the opportunity to create new, clean energy jobs. “What I will never let happen is what happened in coalmining, where an industry came to an end and nobody had planned for the future – and we’re still living with the consequences,” he said.",Trade unions; Politics; Business; Amazon; Keir Starmer; UK news,Politics
2023-06-19T18:26:44Z,Starmer reassures North Sea workers as Labour lays out energy and climate plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/19/starmer-reassures-north-sea-workers-as-labour-lays-out-energy-and-climate-plan,"Scotland was a brave choice as the venue for the launch of Keir Starmer’s new energy and climate policy. Back in March, Rishi Sunak was planning to hold his “energy day” in Aberdeen, the UK’s oil and gas capital, but after criticism he switched to the much safer Oxfordshire. Starmer knows that Labour needs to win back lost seats in Scotland, so visiting the Scottish capital for an important speech was a canny move. More than that, though, taking the launch to Edinburgh showed a willingness to face head-on Labour’s energy dilemma: how to shift the UK economy to a low-carbon footing, as net zero demands, without destroying high-quality jobs in carbon-intensive industries. Scotland exemplifies this: with a 200,000-strong North Sea oil workforce, and most of the UK’s installed base of windfarms, the Scottish economy and its workers are caught between the fossil fuel past and the renewable future. Starmer told them they could choose both, with a carefully managed transition. “The moment for decisive action is now,” he said. “If we wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out, the opportunities this change can bring for Scotland and your community will pass us by, and that would be a historic mistake. An error, for the future of Scotland, as big as the Thatcher government closing the coalmines. My offer is this: a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs … to harness the wealth that is in our air, in our seas, in our skies, and use it to serve the interests of your community.” The Labour leader has weathered a torrid few weeks on this issue, criticised for being too green and not green enough. He was forced to delay planned green investment of £28bn a year to the second half of a prospective Labour parliament, to the chagrin of economists and green campaigners. But his net zero policies earned him the title of “the political wing of Just Stop Oil” from the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, and the ire of sections of the trade union movement, one of whose leaders called him “naive” for halting new North Sea licences. The Tories redoubled their attacks on Monday. A party spokesperson said: “Labour have an energy surrender plan to abolish British oil and gas and an economic plan to saddle the British people with billions of debt and borrowing. Written and funded by the Just Stop Oil extremists, Labour’s energy policy appeases their eco-zealot paymasters and puts dictators like Putin in charge of setting the price of your energy bills. Only the Conservatives can be trusted to grow the economy while delivering secure British power.” Starmer may brush this off as “Tory crap”, but his need to reassure workers and billpayers has led to some difficult decisions. The Rosebank oil and gas field, one of the biggest potential fields in the North Sea, is likely to receive final approval soon from the Conservative government. Labour will not try to stop production from the field, if elected to government, because rescinding licences could open the UK to legal wrangling and claims of billions in compensation. Labour must also be uncomfortably conscious of how big oil and gas companies could create difficulties before the election, if they threaten to start cutting jobs now. For all these reasons, reassurances over the future of the North Sea took precedence at the policy launch. As each of the key members of the Labour leader’s top team – Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor; Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary; Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour leader – took to the stage, the message was clear: North Sea oil and gas would continue to be produced “for decades to come”. At some point, that reassurance must be called into question. Conservative policy failures on net zero, as ministers vow to “squeeze every last drop from the North Sea” while also laying claim to climate leadership internationally, have led to accusations of hypocrisy. John Gummer, the chair of the committee on climate change and a former Conservative environment secretary, recently said: “[The government are] asking other people not to do what they’re doing.” Environmental groups, keen to praise what they see as a good overall package of measures from Labour – including the eventual £28bn-a-year investment, a £500m a year jobs bonus for companies setting up low-carbon industries here, the creation of a national energy company called Great British Energy, and insulation for 19m homes – were reluctant to criticise. Poor countries, experiencing the devastation of the climate crisis, have grown tired of rich countries arguing they can continue to produce fossil fuels while claiming to be climate leaders. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “It’s not credible for any political party to claim to be a leader on climate change whilst happily admitting it will continue to worsen the climate crisis through oil and gas burning for ‘decades’. “ My country of Kenya is suffering from the droughts and storms caused by rich nations historic emissions and despite still battling poverty we’ve got our electricity mix to 92% renewables. We need parties in rich countries like the Labour party to be allies in this energy transition, not continue to prop up the fossil fuel industry which is causing climate misery across the globe.”",Keir Starmer; Labour; Politics; Scotland; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Gas; Energy industry; Energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; UK news,Politics
2023-09-08T05:00:47Z,Two years and £45m of taxpayer cash: the steady launch of state bank UKIB,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/08/the-steady-launch-of-state-bank-ukib,"It is not every day that the former boss of HSBC is found trudging through the mud of a Cornish mining site. But this was a special occasion. On an overcast day in early August, John Flint, now head of the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB), descended on Trelavour Downs in black wellies and a hi-vis jacket, alongside the Treasury minister Andrew Griffith, to mark the government-owned bank’s £24m investment in Cornish Lithium: the company hoping to jump-start a local lithium supply chain for electric vehicles and the wider renewable energy sector. The project fulfils UKIB’s mandate, by supporting regional development and the UK’s net zero climate ambitions. It also marks the lender’s first ever direct equity investment and increased the bank’s total spending to £1.9bn. However, that is far short of the £22bn worth of taxpayer funds currently at its disposal, raising questions over whether – after two years and £45m of taxpayer cash – UKIB is finally in a position to play a key role in the UK’s infrastructure and net zero ambitions. UKIB was unveiled in November 2020 by the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, alongside a £100bn infrastructure plan meant to help revive the country’s fortunes after the Covid crisis. The bank, based in Leeds, would issue loans, guarantees and direct equity investments in five priority areas – clean energy, transport, digital, water and waste – with an annual steer from its single owner: the UK Treasury. Planning started months earlier, after the UK formally lost access to the European Infrastructure Bank (EIB), which had spent about £5bn a year in the UK before Brexit. While broader in scope, UKIB was also expected to fill the shoes of the Green Investment Bank, which was privatised in 2017. Labour criticised the plan, noting that UKIB was much smaller than rival development banks, including the KfW in Germany, which in 2022 had €607bn (£521bn) of outstanding loans on its books and equity stakes worth €36.6bn. Labour also noted that the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, did not expect UKIB’s work to increase economic growth. But the Treasury pressed ahead, launching the bank in June 2021 in an unfinished state. According to a National Audit Office assessment, the government in effect skipped the detailed planning phase, starting operations with a skeleton crew of six staff, without the objectives or performance metrics that would usually be in place. And although the Treasury instituted investment limits to avoid putting too much taxpayer cash at risk, UKIB was still without key personnel, including a chief executive. In September 2021, it landed on HSBC’s former boss John Flint. He is well versed in sprawling bureaucracies and private sector finance after 30 years at the lender, but City investors were not envious of the task he faced. “John Flint readily refers to ‘building the aeroplane in flight’, and that’s exactly what they were doing,” said Darryl Murphy, Aviva Investors’ head of infrastructure, highlighting the political pressure Flint was under. “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.” Flint started hiring bankers, policy analysts and strategists to identify eligible projects that could secure returns of at least 2.5% for the taxpayer. His team took their time, controversially spending the bulk of two years issuing loans and investing in equity funds, rather than backing individual projects. That strategy attracted strong criticism from the public accounts committee. “It’s really not clear what the UKIB is doing that the market wasn’t already or would be with better functioning tax incentives,” the committee’s chair, Meg Hillier, said in January. But Flint said UKIB staff were careful not to rush into direct investments. “One of the reasons we were sluggish [was] we didn’t have the skills and the team to do it … and until we got them, I couldn’t allow us to do it.” Furthermore, the bank needed to avoid projects that could readily attract private funders without UKIB’s help. “The government is borrowing from the markets to give to us to lend. So if we’re doing things that are not needed, we’re inflating the national debt.” Despite moving cautiously, UKIB’s first investment – a £107m loan to the Tees Valley combined authority (TVCA) to develop the South Bank Quay – has stumbled on controversy, given that the local authority, led by the Conservative mayor, Ben Houchen, is now under investigation for corruption. UKIB said it was content with the project’s progress after a recent site visit, and that “any inquiry into the wider Teesworks site is a matter for TVCA and not something we would comment on”. Most of UKIB’s investments over the next year focused on energy infrastructure funds and fibre broadband projects. But as the skeleton team grew to 220 staff, including bankers with City credentials from Lloyds, Barclays, Aviva and the EIB, costs unsurprisingly ballooned. The Treasury spent £12m on admin costs for UKIB’s first year of operations, which tripled to £36m in the 2022-23 financial year. Aviva’s Murphy said it was “astounding, in terms of scale. I don’t think their cost-to-income ratio today would stack up in the private sector. But that’s the benefit of having government support.” Those admin costs cover staff pay, including for Flint, who was put on a pay packet worth about £490,000 a year. All of UKIB’s staff are also eligible for bonuses worth up to three months’ salary. Flint made about £65,000 in bonus payments in 2021-2022 – and that figure would have doubled if he hadn’t arrived part-way through the year. Flint defended the public bank’s bonus policy, saying he needed to attract experienced candidates, including from notoriously high-paying City firms. “In the context of the public sector, [the pay] is good. In the context of the private sector, it isn’t,” Flint said. “If we could reduce our salary bill by 10%, that saves the public sector some money, but if we deploy £22bn really badly, that’s a whole [other] order of magnitude of taxpayer impact.” The Treasury is publicly confident about UKIB’s progress to date, particularly in light of the recent Cornish Lithium investment. And with his team now in place, Flint is confident UKIB’s investments this year will be “roughly double” the approximately £1.1bn committed through 2021-2022, and will then accelerate. “The financing needs that come directly off the government’s net zero strategy are just going to start increasing significantly year after year,” he said. How successful UKIB will be at drawing in private investors remains to be seen. Darius Craton, head of the private capital advisory arm at the US investment bank Raymond James, said a consistent and steady stream of investments over the coming years would help. “Returns will still be at the forefront of investor’s minds as they assess potentially partnering with the UKIB,” he added. But there could be a potential shake-up after the next general election, with uncertainty over how a Labour government would seek to deploy UKIB’s resources. For now, Flint is comfortable with UKIB’s trajectory. “I don’t have the luxury in this role of an organisation with lots and lots of resources. We’ve had to build it,” Flint said. “So anyone who thinks we’re not going quickly enough, should give me a call. But otherwise, I can assure you we’re in exactly the right space.”",Banking; Infrastructure; Business; UK news,Business
2023-04-04T17:58:29Z,The Guardian view on Sir Keir Starmer: his party remains a mystery to voters | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-sir-keir-starmer-his-party-remains-a-mystery-to-voters,"It is three years since Sir Keir Starmer was elected leader of a Labour party despondent after a heavy election defeat. Sir Keir can claim to have come a long way in a short space of time. It is to his credit that Labour is riding high in the polls, with a 20-point lead over the Tories. His purge of party opponents has silenced many of his internal critics and he has ruthlessly excluded potential parliamentary candidates for sometimes “spurious reasons”. In the battle for hearts and minds, he is right to think that lucky generals are better than good ones. Labour looks set to gain 700 seats in May’s local elections, a result that would disrupt the Conservatives’ narrative of an electoral recovery under Rishi Sunak. In Scotland, if the SNP continues to flounder, then its problems could usher in a Labour government. And yet Labour is not seen as the wave of the future. This is not for want of trying. Sir Keir has repeatedly attempted to capture the mood of the country. He has had 12 slogans since becoming leader, each one more meaningless than the last. None of Sir Keir’s phrases have so far created public excitement about the idea of change. Instead of building the party to fill a gap in politics and give Labour a distinctive electoral appeal, Sir Keir gambled that the Tories would implode. That bet has not paid off. The Conservative party is getting itself out of the mess it was in at the beginning of the year. The next election could well be fought between a candidate whom voters see as competent, smart and rich, and a rival whom voters see as competent, smart and dull. It is still eminently possible that the former could triumph over the latter. The mistake has been a lack of what Americans call “the vision thing”. No one knows what Sir Keir or his party clearly stand for – apart from attacking its left flank. Labour’s strongest cards are on the NHS, public services and inequality. Yet there is no coherent strategy that plays to those strengths. Unfortunately, Labour presently appears uninterested in transforming the country. This has allowed the Conservatives to steal Labour’s thunder, most notably with a big childcare offer. This was a key policy area that Sir Keir had largely chosen to stay silent on. Even when the party has an eye-catching policy, such as its £28bn green investment plan, this is being undermined by floating the idea that it would be delivered through public-private partnerships. If the Labour party wants to stick to fiscal orthodoxy, then why won’t it tax capital gains effectively to pay for decent public services? The question is met with silence from the leadership. Some politicians manipulate circumstances to their advantage, waiting for the right moment to confront institutions that need to be changed. Others say they will break with the past no matter what the risk. Both approaches require a motivating programme, one that is argued for in public. Sir Keir has followed neither path. His policies are distinguished by their lack of ambition and are dwarfed by the problems they seek to solve. There is time to change tack and build a winning coalition capable of reorganising itself around new problems. Sir Keir ought to be bolder in his prescriptions to fix Britain. For that he will need a diagnosis of what ails the country. Such an insight would act as a signpost for the public, mapping out the ground on which Labour would stand. Sir Keir should realise that without a focal point at which a new consensus can gather, an election-winning politics cannot form.",Labour; Politics; Keir Starmer; Rishi Sunak; NHS; Public services policy,Opinion
2022-03-09T10:28:07Z,Green credentials of world’s largest investor questioned over oil industry emails,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/blackrock-privately-soothes-oil-industry-fears-over-its-new-green-credentials,"Emails have revealed the high-wire act performed by major banks and the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, as they privately soothe oil industry concerns about their public support for greener investment. In his annual letter to chief executives, BlackRock boss Larry Fink said that pursuing climate action policies was not about being “woke” but was about pursuing profits on behalf of clients. The comments were widely seen as a signal that the asset manager, whose clients have entrusted $10tn to its care, would wield its investment clout to support greener ventures. But emails – obtained via a freedom of information request by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the thinktank InfluenceMap – show that a regulator in oil-rich Texas left a meeting with BlackRock believing the company had undergone a change of heart. After the meeting with BlackRock staff, on 7 January 2022, the chair of the Texas oil regulator, Wayne Christian, wrote to the company expressing his relief. He said he had been concerned by the asset manager’s promotion of investments governed by environmental and social guidelines (ESG), which typically involve selling out of oil and gas stocks. He said that it was “nice to hear that BlackRock didn’t mean – or no longer believes – many of the disagreeable things the company and … Mr Fink have said about the oil and gas industry”. In an attached letter, Christian said BlackRock’s staff had referred to “media misrepresentations” about its environmental stance and had also declared themselves “supportive” of the oil and gas industry. Replying to Christian, a BlackRock employee did not question his interpretation of the discussion but pointed to comments made by Fink, saying that “traditional” energy companies were “part of the solution” alongside environmental investment policies. BlackRock said there was no contradiction between its public statements and its private conversations with Christian. “BlackRock has been clear and consistent since January 2020 that climate risk is an investment risk that will impact returns in investors’ portfolios as companies navigate both the physical and transition risk associated with climate. “Our investment conviction is that sustainability and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to our clients. “In addition, BlackRock has long stated that energy firms play an important role in the global economy and in a successful transition. “We expect to remain long-term investors in carbon-intensive sectors. We do not pursue broad divestment from sectors and industries as a policy. But Anusha Narayanan, climate campaign manager at Greenpeace USA, said it appeared BlackRock was “trying to have their cake and eat it”. “We need to stop falling for this false choice between a healthy planet or a healthy economy. Fossil fuels give us neither. Last week’s IPCC report made it clear that climate change is already causing widespread damages and losses to people and ecosystems around the world, with increasingly irreversible consequences. “Financial regulators are calling the climate crisis an emerging threat to the stability of the US financial system. “For companies like BlackRock, investing in a carbon-free future must mean the immediate divestment from coal, oil, and gas.” While BlackRock walked the line between greener investments and staying on the right side of oil industry advocates, US banks have faced similar pressure from oil-rich states, in one case apparently forcing a change of policy. In November, the treasurers of 15 US states – responsible for more than $600bn in funds – wrote an open letter to the banking industry in which they threatened to withdraw from financial institutions that boycott fossil fuel companies. A second freedom of information request shows that US Bank wrote to the state treasurer of West Virginia, who coordinated the letter, saying it hoped to maintain its relationship with the state, a major coal producer, for many years to come. In a note, Tim Rieder, senior vice-president of US Bank, added: “Personally, I totally agree with the [treasurers’] letter.” US Bank subsequently appeared to change its investment policy, removing a pledge to boycott coal investments. US Bank said it had not changed its policy under pressure from US states and that its investment policy had not prohibited financing coal-fired power since October 2020. However, its 2021 environmental responsibility policy, displayed on the bank’s website until last week, did prohibit US Bank from financing coal-fired power. A host of other banks have also issued reassurances to Texas, after it implemented a law requiring financial institutions to certify that they do not boycott energy companies in order to remain eligible to do business with the state. Barclays, Citigroup, UBS and Wells Fargo were among 39 institutions that made the pledge. Barclays said: “We are aligning our entire financing portfolio to the goals and timelines of the Paris [climate] agreement, on the way to becoming a net zero bank by 2050.” UBS said it supports the goals of the Paris agreement and added: “We view engagement with companies in all industries as fundamental to any sustainable investing approach.” Citigroup said: “Our policies are focused on responsibly managing the energy transition, not boycotting the energy sector. This position has been communicated consistently to all of our stakeholders.” Wells Fargo declined to comment.",Climate crisis; Fossil fuel divestment; Business; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Banking,Environment
2023-03-30T15:44:34Z,UK energy strategy casts doubt on Drax’s carbon capture project,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/30/uk-energy-strategy-casts-doubt-on-drax-carbon-capture-project,"The energy company Drax will immediately enter talks with the government after its energy strategy cast doubt over its £2bn carbon capture project and plunged the company’s share price into turmoil. The government’s wide-ranging plan to secure Britain’s energy supplies inadvertently raised questions about the future of one of the country’s biggest electricity generators after appearing to rule out the project to capture carbon emissions at the Drax biomass plant in North Yorkshire from the race for subsidies. The company suffered one of the biggest falls on the FTSE 250 as shares tumbled 12% on Thursday morning. However, Drax assured investors that it would enter formal bilateral talks with the government immediately to “move the project forward”. Drax chief executive, Will Gardiner, told investors that the government planned to expand the “Track 1” process later this year, and that its project would be eligible. Funding for the carbon capture project is considered crucial in securing future revenues for Drax beyond 2027 when its existing subsidy for burning wood pellets in its power plant will come to an end. However, a delay in joining the Track 1 process could still leave a funding gap until 2030. The energy security and net zero minister Graham Stuart said in parliament on Thursday that the government “totally understands that we need to work with Drax on a bridging option between 2027 and 2030 and the secretary of state has charged our officials working with Drax on what those options look like”. The share price losses were quickly wiped out, and the stock rose 6% after the assurances. The strategy named eight carbon capture projects in the first track of a government subsidy scheme which could begin trapping and storing carbon emissions from 2027; including three in Teesside and five in the north-west of England and north Wales, but leaving out Drax’s project in the Humber. Ministers are under pressure to cut subsidies for biomass generators amid growing concern that burning wood to generate electricity is far from green and may even increase CO2 emissions. The government also named 20 hydrogen projects which will receive funding awards including three spear-headed by Scottish Power and two for SSE. Drax’s market turmoil emerged as leading business groups criticised the government plan for its lack of clarity and ambition in accelerating Britain’s green industries. The government published multiple policy papers, totalling 1,000 pages, but many of the strategies set out had been previously announced, and much of the government spending had already been committed. “Despite the volume and detail of today’s announcements, there is nothing obvious within these plans which matches the ambition of the US’s Inflation Reduction Act,” said Alexandra Hall-Chen, a policy adviser at the Institute of Directors. “It remains an open question as to whether the UK can offer the incentives for green investment that can sustain it as a leader in the global green economy.” The government’s document deluge includes separate but interconnected plans to secure energy supplies, reduce carbon emissions to net zero, and establish the UK as a leading centre for green finance. The government has launched a consultation on plans to require all large companies with more than 500 employees or £500m in turnover to disclose their plans to reach net zero. Currently the Financial Conduct Authority requires listed companies and large asset owners to disclose their plans, but the government stipulation would level the playing field across the economy to make it easier for investors to make greener decisions. James Fotherby, a policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, described the decision as “encouraging” and urged the government to “provide a clear timetable and further details on the implementation of the sustainability disclosure requirements to tackle greenwashing and inform investors’ financial decisions”.",Drax; Energy industry; Biomass and bioenergy; Renewable energy; UK news; Energy; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Yorkshire,Business
2023-01-30T15:02:24Z,EU plans to loosen state aid rules to boost renewables investment,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy,"The EU is stepping up its green subsidy race with the US through plans to loosen state aid rules on tax credits for renewable energy projects. European policymakers have been under pressure to respond to the US president Joe Biden’s $369bn (£298bn) Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to encourage renewables investment in everything from electric cars to wind turbines. The European Commission plans to loosen state aid rules to enable investment into production facilities in green industries, according to draft plans. EU member states are divided over whether to introduce the new rules and how long for, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the plans. The draft proposals reportedly suggest some of a €800bn (£705bn) Covid-19 recovery fund could be redirected towards tax credits. “The provisions on tax benefits would enable member states to align their national fiscal incentives on a common scheme, and thereby offer greater transparency and predictability to businesses across the EU,” the draft said. Europe’s energy system has been under intense scrutiny since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent throttling of gas supplies into Europe. Brussels intends to set new targets for green industrial capacity and simplify the approval process for renewables projects. It plans to increase the level at which deals are scrutinised by the commission under state aid rules. Biden’s new rules, introduced last autumn, have reinvigorated the renewables market in the US, leading to a wave of new projects. The president hailed the legislation as “the biggest step forward on climate ever” on signing the bill last year. It has been estimated that the legislation could reduce US emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, bringing Biden close to the goal of cutting US emissions in half by the end of the decade. Companies, investors and politicians have called for Europe and the UK to follow suit, with Jozef Síkela, the Czech minister of industry and trade, equating the US programme with “doping in sport”. In Britain, ministers have been accused of discouraging renewables investment by extending a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas firms to electricity generators, including wind and solar projects on older contracts. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK, has accused the government of offering more generous tax terms to oil and gas projects and “tilting the playing field against renewables”. Meanwhile, the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband has said a Labour government would form an “anti-Opec” alliance of countries dedicated to renewables, to bring down energy prices and promote clean technology. On Monday, the oil and gas company BP said global carbon emissions were expected to fall quicker than it had previously expected as a result of the war in Ukraine and Biden’s efforts to encourage green investment.",Energy industry; Renewable energy; European Commission; European Union; Europe; Energy; Environment; World news; Business; US news; UK news,Business
2024-02-21T10:00:13Z,"Emotional, messy and breathtakingly ruthless: the hidden life of Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/21/the-hidden-life-of-keir-starmer,"When friends heard I was writing a book about Keir Starmer, there were the usual questions: does he believe in anything? What’s he like? Isn’t he, they asked with a frown, a bit boring? The last of these was the easiest to answer because he really isn’t dull. Starmer is good company, engagingly funny and listens in a way that too many politicians too often fail to do. There is, of course, a long tradition of advisers (or ex-advisers like me) wailing on about how they wish more voters could see this or that candidate as we do. But the gap between the reality and perception of Starmer is bigger than with most, and it cannot simply be down to the way he sometimes closes in on himself when a camera is pointed at him, or how the online snobs – largely from the left – mock his accent and call him “Keith”. The better explanation is that Starmer is complicated, as most people are, and filled with paradoxes. He’s the most working-class leader of the Labour party for a generation and also the first in its history to have the prefix “Sir” attached to his name before he got the job. He is a private and cautious man who has chosen to place himself in the white light of public scrutiny while taking some gigantic political risks, including one that ended the Labour career of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. He likes to think decisions through and sometimes changes his mind, but he has also been breathtakingly ruthless in overcoming more polished or popular opponents in the Tory party and his own. None of that’s dull; it’s just very difficult to define. And part of him still instinctively resists any effort to do so. He didn’t always relish the process of me writing a biography about him. Over the course of the past couple of years and dozens of conversations, I’ve had to prod or cajole him into talking about things that middle-aged Englishmen are not always comfortable discussing: an intensely difficult relationship with his father; a sense of separation from his brother and the sisters he left behind as he pursued a career in London; the source of a hard-driving ambition that one of his ex-girlfriends remembers as involving “not much reflection and no stopping … which can make life difficult for others around him because there really aren’t many people made of that kind of stuff”. For most of Starmer’s life, he hasn’t had to talk or even think too hard about all of this. His identity was built around the three decades he spent as a successful human rights barrister and then director of public prosecutions. He never won a case on the basis that he grew up in a “pebbledash semi”, while the now well-worn phrase “My dad was a toolmaker and my mum was a nurse” did not cross his lips until he was in his late 50s. At one stage, I wanted to call my biography of him The Unpolitician because he doesn’t fit the template of political leaders. His backstory is messy and flawed, and he has neither a grandiose vision that can be summed up in a three-word slogan nor the kind of charisma that for so long made so many think Boris Johnson was unbeatable. However, even if “unpolitician” had been a real word, it still wouldn’t have been a fair description of Starmer who, for all his misgivings about this profession, has learned how to become pretty good at it. He is fallible and still makes some unforced errors, as he did in comments over Israel and Gaza last year, or this month in initially allowing Labour to stand by its candidate Azhar Ali over some awful antisemitic remarks. But separate the wood from the trees and the real significance of that last row is how he eventually did something I don’t remember any major party leader doing in living memory, which was to sack a candidate in the midst of a byelection he expected to win. But he has pulled Labour from being way behind in the polls to 20 points ahead. And those who dismiss this achievement as that of a “lucky general” are underestimating him in the same way many defeated opponents once did. If many of Johnson’s wounds appeared self-inflicted, it was often Starmer’s forensic and lawyerly scalpel that made the first incision. When Liz Truss was terrifying citizens and markets alike, Starmer provided reassurance where Labour would previously have offered only an alternative kind of fear. When Rishi Sunak initially seemed to be contesting the territory of centrist competence and decency, the Labour leader held it while Sunak was dragged into the badlands of the Conservative party’s wildest frontiers. Indeed, a testament to his success in transforming the Labour party and its electoral fortunes is that the biggest question hanging over Starmer now seems to be whether winning is enough. There are plenty of critics inside the party who are angry at the way he has abandoned some – if not all – of the “10 pledges” on which he fought the leadership election in 2020. Still more despair of recent retreats from an earlier promise to spend £28bn a year on green investment. Others suggest his efforts to root out antisemitism are being used to purge the left and that he has been captured by the right. Part of the problem is that Starmer steadfastly refuses to place himself on an ideological spectrum or bind himself too tightly to a particular set of policies. Chris Ward, who was one of his principal advisers until 2021 and remains close to him now, told me: “One of Keir’s greatest strengths is that he’s never been from or beholden to a particular faction of the Labour party. I think that’s because – unlike almost every previous Labour leader – he didn’t spend his life in the Labour party and it isn’t his whole life, even now. It’s why he could win a leadership contest from the soft left, but now lead it from the centre-right. His focus is always on getting him closer to the goal of winning an election and changing the country – and he’s smart enough to find different parts of the party to get him there at different times.” But even Ward worries about the direction of travel. “The danger, of course, is that he ultimately ends up trapped by one faction or becomes isolated when the going gets tough. That’s always been my biggest fear. Whether he can avoid that in No 10, and finally get the chance to do all the things he came into politics to do, is the next big challenge he’ll face.” For my part, I think the argument made casually by a lot of people these days that he stands for nothing is well wide of the mark. The five missions he announced last year and which are still under-reported remain key to understanding what he would do. And each of them is rooted in everyday values based on friendship, family and football. The third is a huge part of his makeup and usually his metaphor of choice; when, for instance, he speaks of yearning for the chance to get into government and show what he can do, he inevitably describes it as “doing his talking on the pitch”. When he talks about watching Arsenal, there is a sense of this tightly bound man revelling in the experience of losing himself in a crowd. He can be almost lyrical about the feeling when a late winner is scored and “everyone stands up, hands in the air … like there’s a magnet in the sky above the stadium”. But his values show themselves in other ways too. Talking about his schooldays, he expresses his disgust at how a friend of his was chucked out of his family’s home for being gay by a father who declared: “You’re no son of mine.” Later, the young Starmer got beaten up in a nightclub after he came to the aid of the same friend, who “didn’t do much to conceal” his sexuality, when he had been attacked by some kids who “decided the way to prove they weren’t gay too was by punching and kicking him”. That says a lot for a sporty teenager in the early 1980s, and those same values are obvious now when he described going to the same-sex wedding of his niece Jess in 2022 and reflected on the progress Britain has made from the old days. Then just six weeks later, Starmer told me of how he had got a nasty reminder of “how far we have to go”, after Jess and her wife were leaving a pub in the town where they live and work. “It’s a friendly place, small enough for them to know most people. It’s their manor,” he said. “They were hand in hand like the newlyweds they are, when three men came up to them. These cowards punched Jess many times, fracturing her cheekbone, for no reason except she’s a lesbian.” In cold fury, he tossed his phone across the table at me. It showed two photographs of her face: the first looking radiant and happy on her wedding day, the other almost unrecognisably swollen and purple after the attack. Starmer’s anger over what happened to his niece, and – despite his best efforts with the police – the failure to prosecute those responsible, is an emotion you rarely see from him in public. But it’s impossible to listen to him talking about the horrific murders of Fiona Ivison or Jane Clough – cases he was involved in as a lawyer and prosecutor – or a more recent visit to a women’s refuge in Birmingham, without coming away knowing that his declared mission to halve violence against women and girls goes way beyond the usual banalities expressed by a lot of politicians. In private, he frequently shows grief and joy on behalf of ordinary people, who offer him a bridge back into a world that politics doesn’t always understand. And there is a real warmth in the way Starmer talks about the people and places that make up this country. One of his stories that stuck most in my mind involved being on holiday last summer in the Lake District when he took his children back to a cottage he stayed in with his parents when he was their age. “We knocked on the door and a woman was kind enough to let us in and show us around. She noticed our car moving and thought someone was stealing it, so I explained that was just my police protection team. Her husband started laughing and saying she hadn’t clocked I was a politician. She said if I told her that earlier she would have taken the chance to push me down the stairs,” he said. This may not be either the funniest or the most inspirational anecdote you’ll hear from a political leader, but it was worth recording because it shows the pleasure Starmer takes at still being anonymous within all that muddle of Britain where nuance and ambiguity may yet offer a better chance of progress and finding consensus than the most puffed-up vision. It would obviously be ludicrous to suggest he is the only political leader to have family members, friends and experiences outside “the bubble” – almost all do and doubtless gain insight from them because even the most out-of-touch politician has a real life somewhere too. What’s more unusual about Starmer, though, is his desire to prevent too much cross-contamination. For instance, when he made repeated visits to his seriously ill brother in a Leeds hospital during 2022, he kept it secret. And, when he later stood up in front of a couple of hundred health professionals to make a speech there – typically a perfect platform for a Labour leader – he kept the media away because for him all that mattered was saying thank you for the care they had given. So when people ask me what the Labour leader is really like, my answer is always going to be complicated because there’s something quite extraordinary in him still being quite normal. He once made a speech where he talked about an “ordinary hope”. It’s the best place to start if you’re searching for some optimism. • Keir Starmer: The Biography by Tom Baldwin (William Collins, £25) is published on 29 February.

2024-02-23T06:31:47Z,Friday briefing: The UK is in urgent need of a sensible home-energy policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/23/friday-briefing-the-uk-is-in-urgent-need-of-a-sensible-home-energy-policy,"Good morning. Houses in the UK are some of the oldest and least energy efficient in Europe. A new report by Friends of the Earth and the Institute of Health Equity found that 9.6m households are living in cold, poorly insulated homes. These households also have incomes below the minimum for a decent standard of living, meaning that they cannot afford to install double glazing or insulation, for example, to make their homes warmer. The analysis comes just weeks after the Labour party U-turned on a key climate proposal, which included a pledge to insulate millions of homes. Meanwhile, over the last 13 years the government has reversed plenty of policies designed to tackle the insulation problem in the UK. To help me unpack the latest research on insulating homes, I spoke with Guardian health and inequalities correspondent, Tobi Thomas. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Law | Shamima Begum, who left the UK as a 15-year-old schoolgirl to join Islamic State, will find out today whether her appeal against the removal of her UK citizenship has been successful. Space | The US has returned to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, after a privately built spacecraft named Odysseus capped a nail-biting 73-minute descent from orbit with an apparently flawless touchdown near the lunar surface south pole.

Dozens of Conservative and SNP MPs signed a motion calling for a vote of no confidence in him, after Hoyle changed parliamentary procedure to allow a Labour amendment on Gaza to be debated on Wednesday. Education | Teaching unions have accused ministers of “daylight robbery” after a new survey by the Trades Union Congress revealed that teachers perform the most unpaid overtime of any profession. The survey found that two out of five teaching staff in the UK worked 26 hours for free each week, for a combined 5.5m hours a year. Universities | The Office for Students (OfS), England’s higher education regulator, is to launch its first investigation into thousands of “franchise students” enrolled on university courses run by subcontractors, amid concerns about poor quality and potential abuse of student loans. In depth: ‘Living in a poorly insulated home negatively affects children’s brain development’ The environmental benefits of retrofitting homes is clear and simple. Better insulated homes require less energy, which cuts down on fuel consumption and brings Britain closer to its climate targets. Without measures to insulate Britain’s homes, the country will struggle to meet crucial goals set in the Paris climate agreement. *** Cold homes and health Poorly insulated homes cause and exacerbate a plethora of health problems, including rheumatoid arthritis as well as asthma and other respiratory illnesses and can also lead to a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. In the worst case scenarios, lives are cut short – with excess winter deaths linked to poorly insulated homes up by half in Britain last year. And it’s not just physical health, Tobi says: “the report revealed that living in a cold home doubles the risk of adults developing a new mental health condition, like depression”. These risks are further amplified among older people, children and those living with pre-existing health conditions. “Living in a poorly insulated home negatively affects children’s lung and brain development”, says Tobi, and stymies their mental health, too. The knock-on effect is well documented: children living in cold homes miss school more often due to illness and have poorer educational outcomes. Inevitably, this burden then falls on to the already stretched health and social care services; it costs the NHS £540m a year to treat people affected by excess cold. Investing in proper insulation could alleviate some of these pressures. A study by Citizens Advice found that a major programme of retrofitting would save the NHS £2bn by 2030. *** A decade of policy reversal It has not always been like this – between 2008 and 2012 4.5m lofts were insulated and more than 2m cavity walls were treated. But over time, the political agenda shifted away from prioritising environmentally friendly policies. The first real moment of this turn was encapsulated by former prime minister David Cameron’s promise to aides that he would “cut the green crap”. On the chopping block was government support for insulation with installation rates falling by about 90%. It was the first of many short-term policies that would come at the expense of more long-lasting proposals. Studies have found that ditching these insulation schemes has added to consumers inflated bills. Despite the mounting evidence that insulating homes is better for households and the government’s budget, ministers have continued to jettison proposals: just a few months ago Rishi Sunak scrapped the government’s pledge to force private landlords to upgrade their properties Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating by 2025. He also discarded plans to fine boiler makers who fail to meet targets for heat pumps. The climate change thinktank E3G has projected that, at the current rate of delivery, it’s going to take 146 years just to hit the goal of insulating 300,000 homes, which is way off the government’s plan to reach their target by 2026. People are concerned about rising energy bills and the growing prevalence of fuel poverty in the country, says Tobi. “Three million households are still going to be in fuel poverty by the end of the decade because the government’s been really slow to meet its home energy efficiency targets.” *** Labour’s u-turns Rachel Reeves (pictured above) promised to be the UK’s first green chancellor boldly putting forward a £28bn green investment pledge. Making the pledge her priority, Reeves said any delays to the proposal would only cost the country more, financially and environmentally. Two and a half years and several U-turns later, the pledge has gone and with it spending on housing insulation. The Labour party is now saying that it will insulate 5m homes, a fraction of the original 19m goal. Energy experts have said that the rollback could mean that, by abandoning this policy, once in government the Labour party would be at risk of failing to meet the legally binding targets on carbon reduction and ending fuel poverty by 2030. As both parties drag their feet on this issue, more people will continue to go without basic necessities such as heat and fuel.

2023-06-03T11:57:34Z,"Labour needs an ‘honest debate’ about Brexit damage, union warns",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/03/labour-needs-an-honest-debate-about-brexit-damage-union-warns,"The leader of one of the country’s biggest unions has urged Labour to conduct an “honest debate” about the economic damage being caused to working people by Brexit, as evidence grows that it is fuelling inflation and driving jobs and investment abroad. In an interview with the Observer, Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which is one of Labour’s biggest financial backers, giving more than £1m a year, said politicians of all parties had been too afraid to admit the adverse consequences that leaving the EU was having on jobs and life in working communities. “There has been a lack of honesty and a fear among politicians to face up to the impact that Brexit is having in terms of the economy,” said Smith, whose union has more than 500,000 members across the UK. “In terms of what the future looks like, it needs to start from a position of honesty. It is hitting trade. It is hitting investment and we need a new settlement. “We know that we are not going to be re-entering the EU. But we have to recognise that the frictions at borders are one of the factors behind inflation. It is bad for jobs and it is bad for investment.” The GMB leader cited warnings from the drug giant AstraZeneca – which employs many GMB workers – about its future investments in the UK in the post-Brexit era, saying he worried that the company would switch production to the EU if it found trading and tax arrangements were more favourable there. Smith’s comments echo frustration among pro-EU Labour backers and supporters at the party’s reluctance to do more to expose Brexit’s failings or advocate a clearer plan for a closer relationship if it wins the next election. Some senior Labour strategists fear alienating its many backers who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. In an article in the Daily Express last week, Keir Starmer attempted a delicate balancing act, trying to reassure the paper’s overwhelmingly Tory-supporting readership that he would not take the UK back into the EU or single market, while also making clear that the Brexit deal negotiated by Boris Johnson’s government had not worked and would need to be revisited. “Britain’s future is outside the EU,” Starmer said, despite having been the most senior Labour figure most in favour of holding a second referendum on membership before becoming leader. “Not in the single market, not in the customs union, not with a return to freedom of movement. Those arguments are in the past, where they belong,” he said, while adding that “there’s no point pretending that everything is working fine”. Ahead of the GMB annual conference in Brighton this week, Smith said he had been encouraged by much that Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had said about the party’s economic agenda for government, including its plans to foster a new “green industrial revolution” through investment in wind, solar and tidal energy. But, as with Brexit, he was concerned that the drive to more renewable energy – and the expansion of nuclear – under the Conservatives had so far merely created jobs abroad rather than here in the UK. Under Labour, there needed to be a “new settlement” involving the unions, with guarantees that employment would be created in the renewable and other sectors in this country. “We have some of the biggest windfarms in the world but almost no jobs in fabrication and manufacture of the windfarms. “The windfarms off the east coast of the UK have been produced in China and Indonesia, and by Middle Eastern sovereign oil- and gas-backed wealth funds.” Smith’s intervention is evidence of the unions wanting to play a role in shaping Labour’s economic policy ahead of a general election expected next year. What was needed from Starmer and Reeves, Smith said, was an economic vision as radical as that produced by the US president, Joe Biden, which ensured that green investment projects were linked to domestic production and home-grown job creation: “We do not see ourselves as having political saviours,” said Smith, “but we do want a Labour government and I want to see a proactive industrial strategy from Labour that actually safeguards what we still have in terms of manufacturing jobs, and which does support the creation of work in any green transition.” The GMB leader has not been afraid to criticise Labour in strong terms. He repeated his attack on the party for saying it would ban future North Sea oil and gas drilling, describing it as “naive”. Smith claimed that it would mean importing more oil and gas from abroad and cost jobs in coastal communities. But despite flexing his muscles, he was clear that a Labour government would be massively preferable to another Conservative one. “The Tories are trying to break organised Labour with their anti-union legislation …. There is no national economic plan and our public services have been starved of investment. And, after 13 years, what we have got is Tory squalor in the public services. “The lack of industrial strategy, the lack of an industrial plan, has done enormous damage in terms of investment and opportunities.”",Labour; GMB union; Politics; European Union; Brexit; Renewable energy; Green jobs; Energy; Europe; Green economy; Keir Starmer; Rachel Reeves; UK news; Trade unions,Politics
2023-05-31T12:12:55Z,Labour’s oil and gas ban shows it’s ready to fight the next election on climate issues | Bill McGuire,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/labours-oil-and-gas-ban-shows-its-ready-to-fight-the-next-election-on-climate-issues,"It’s been a long time coming, but at last it seems that voters who give a damn about the climate emergency will have a real choice at the next general election. While the Tories have fiddled, Labour has been putting together a pretty impressive pro-climate portfolio. The latest pledge to ban all new domestic oil and gas developments and cut off borrowing for fossil fuel-related projects sits in diametric opposition to Tory plans to suck as much oil and gas as possible out of the North Sea. And Labour’s goody bag of climate measures contains plenty more that environmentally informed voters can cheer. At its 2021 annual conference, the party flagged plans, should it win the next election, for an annual £28bn green investment fund. Alongside this were pledges to decarbonise the steel industry and, perhaps most critically, to test all its other policy against its potential consequences for the environment and the goal of net zero emissions. A year on, Labour committed to the establishment of a new state-owned energy company, and a £60bn programme to insulate 19m homes. The cherry on the cake was the announced ambition to decarbonise the UK’s electricity supply as soon as 2030. Contrast all this with Tory efforts. It says everything about the importance Rishi Sunak and co attach to green measures that Ukraine – a nation fighting a bitter war for survival – installed more onshore wind turbines in the past 15 months than the UK. It shouldn’t really come as a surprise, though. The Tories have come a very long way since David Cameron’s putative greening of the party, but the direction of travel has been almost entirely backwards. It is unlikely this will change before the next election. Serious government action on the climate is now all but impossible, given the increasing gravitational pull of a growing body of rightwing Tory MPs, who regard the whole net zero thing as just another part of the woke agenda, and would see it scrapped if they could. With no prospect of a Damascene conversion then, the stage is set for an election next year that will see the two main parties offer climate policies separated by an ocean of clear, blue water. And the Tories will be forced to defend a thoroughly dismal record on climate policy, over a period in which its salience has only increased for voters. Back in 2019, when Greenpeace rated the climate credentials of the party manifestos, the Tories scored a measly seven out of 20, way behind the Greens, Labour and Liberal Democrats. Since the last election, while the other parties have pushed ahead on the green policy front, the Tories have done their utmost to score even lower, and succeeded. In just the past few years, they have expressed support for airport expansion, reawakened the spectre of fracking, given the green light to the opening of the country’s first deep coalmine in 30 years, scrapped subsidies on electric vehicles, cut air passenger duty on domestic flights, and issued 100 new licences for oil and gas exploration. It is true that Boris Johnson did launch a “flagship” green homes grant scheme to support insulation and increased take-up of heat pumps, but this badly botched centrepiece of his “build back greener” initiative lasted barely six months before being dumped. For many people, the list of reasons for not voting Tory next time is as long as my arm, but right at the top has to be the party’s dire record on tackling the climate emergency. The choice is stark: on the one hand, a party that increasingly walks the talk on climate; on the other, one that walks away from its responsibilities. But this isn’t to say that Labour’s offer on climate is perfect. Far from it. There is real concern that without the hands-on control that nationalising the energy sector would bring, decarbonising electricity supply within less than eight years will just not happen. There are worries, too, that the growth-is-everything approach trumpeted by Keir Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, places GDP on a pedestal and sends the wrong message at a time when alternative metrics of progress would provide better measures of success in tackling the climate emergency. The next Labour government will also need to take serious note that our world is facing a climate and ecological crisis, so far more needs to be done to reboot the country’s degraded landscape and biodiversity. And because we can no longer dodge significant climate-related consequences, there is an urgent requirement to address adaptation at the same time as slashing emissions. This means everything from reforestation to reduce flood hazard, to planning for water supply during periods of severe drought, managing retreat from at-risk coastal locations as sea-level rise accelerates. and greening cities to cope better with 40C+ summer temperatures. The truth is that the Labour offer is good, but there is still room for improvement, The bottom line is that this country will not survive another five years of Tory rule, but even more importantly, nor will the climate.

2023-02-09T19:19:01Z,Sunak and Hunt to host UK industry leaders to drum up investment,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/09/sunak-and-hunt-to-host-200-uk-industry-leaders-to-drum-up-investment,"Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt will host some of the UK’s most prominent industry leaders on Friday as part of a drive to drum up fresh investment to revive the UK’s struggling economy. The prime minister, who is expected to attend remotely, and the chancellor will address 42 bosses from commerce and industry who sit on the UK Investment Council – with a focus on creating jobs in hi-tech sectors. Council members include executives from Airbus, HSBC, Nestlé, Nissan and Hutchison Whampoa, which owns the 3 UK mobile telephone network. The head of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the outgoing Legal &amp; General CEO Sir Nigel Wilson and Liv Garfield, the Severn Trent CEO are also expected to attend. The government said the event would build on the success of the inaugural Global Investment Summit in October 2021, which brought together more than 170 chief executives “to showcase the UK’s commitment to green investment ahead of Cop26”. Ministers said £9.7bn of new foreign investment was pledged on the day, “creating over 30,000 new jobs and supporting growth in vital sectors such as wind and hydrogen energy, sustainable homes, and carbon capture and storage”. Lord Johnson, the investment minister, is expected to make a plea for firms to make the most of the UK’s low business taxes and high-skilled workforce. Johnson, the former business partner of Jacob Rees-Mogg at his £7bn Somerset Capital Management investment fund, was sacked from his job as investment minister by Sunak when he took over from Liz Truss in November, only to be reinstated 44 days later. The UK Investment Council was established in April 2021 under Lord Grimstone, the much-respected former Standard Life chair, who quit last summer when Boris Johnson was ousted as PM. The council exists alongside another Boris Johnson initiative, the Green Jobs Delivery Group, which has been privately criticised by business groups for being a talking shop and lacking strategic direction. A second investment summit this year is planned for October, which Sunak and Hunt will hope can boost Britain’s poor record of business investment since the 2016 Brexit vote. Business investment fell in the year to October 2022 to leave the level spending on new equipment, machinery and IT systems 8% below its pre-pandemic level, according to the Bank of England and it is expected to fall again by 5.6% in 2023, the central bank said in its latest economic outlook. The agenda for the discussion, which will be chaired by Lord Johnson, will focus on “how business and government [can] work together to encourage growth in the current economic climate”. The meeting will come days after Sunak unveiled a shake-up of Whitehall departments that saw the promotion to secretary of state of Kemi Badenoch, at the newly created department of business and trade. • The headline and text of this article were amended on 10 February 2023 because an earlier version referred to Sunak and Hunt addressing 200 business executives.

2023-03-10T22:30:03Z,Jeremy Hunt’s budget to announce £20bn funding to cut carbon emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors,"The chancellor is poised to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions at next week’s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain’s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a “reset” of government efforts to clean up the UK’s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday’s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce “unprecedented investment” of £20bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and “commit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year”. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing £210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce’s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain’s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.” The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Already a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK’s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.”",Budget 2023; UK news; Energy industry; Business; Nuclear power; Energy; Environment; Budget,UK news
2023-02-16T16:00:02Z,Soaring fuel bills may push 141m more into extreme poverty globally – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/16/soaring-fuel-bills-may-push-141m-more-into-extreme-poverty-globally-study,"Soaring energy prices triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict could push up to 141 million more people around the globe into extreme poverty, a study has found. The cost of energy for households globally could have increased by between 62.6% and 112.9% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a modelling study by an international group of scientists published in Nature Energy. The study modelled the impact of higher energy prices on the spending of 201 groups, representing different expenditure levels, in 116 countries, covering 87.4% of the global population. Despite efforts by governments to insulate consumers from the price rises, researchers estimated that overall household expenditure rose by between 2.7% and 4.8%. As a result, they estimate that an additional 78–141 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty. One of the report’s authors, Yuli Shan, a professor at the University of Birmingham, said: “High energy prices hit household finances in two ways: fuel price rises directly increase household energy bills, while energy inputs needed to produce goods and services push prices up for those products as well, and especially for food, which affects households indirectly. “Unaffordable costs of energy and other necessities will push vulnerable populations into energy poverty and even extreme poverty.” Shan added: “This unprecedented global energy crisis reminds us that an energy system highly reliant on fossil fuels perpetuates energy security risks, as well as accelerating climate change.” Household gas and electricity bills rose sharply last year, while petrol and diesel prices hit record highs. A report prepared for the World Economic Forum in Davos last month said soaring prices for energy and food could persist for the next two years. The energy crisis has led to calls for nations to move faster in building renewable energy sources, while governments have turned to polluting fuels such as coal to ensure security of power supplies. Another of the report’s authors, Klaus Hubacek of the University of Groningen, said: “This crisis is worsening energy poverty and extreme poverty worldwide. For poor countries, living costs undermine their hard-won gains in energy access and poverty alleviation. “Ensuring access to affordable energy and other necessities is a priority for those countries, but short-term policies addressing the cost of living crisis must align with climate mitigation goals and other long-term sustainable development commitments.” The UK and Europe have been urged to follow the US’s lead in encouraging green investment through Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Western nations have attempted to put a dent in the Kremlin’s coffers by placing a price cap on Russian oil while still allowing it to flow to avoid spiralling fuel prices. In recent weeks, wholesale gas prices have fallen as the mild winter and strong gas storage levels in Europe have boosted confidence that countries will not experience energy shortages this winter. However, concerns remain over how nations will replace Russian gas supplies next winter. In the UK, energy bills are to rise by 40% in April when government support for bills becomes less generous. National Energy Action estimates there are now 6.7 million UK households in fuel poverty – a figure that has more than doubled since 2020. Last week Greenpeace threatened to take legal action against the UK government as it emerged that a target to lift millions of struggling households out of fuel poverty was likely to be missed.",Energy; Energy bills; Household bills; Fuel poverty; Oil; Gas; Commodities; Cost of living crisis; UK cost of living crisis; World news; Environment; Business; Money,Environment
2024-02-08T06:35:29Z,Thursday briefing: Benjamin Netanyahu rejects a plan for short-term peace,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/08/first-edition-israel-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations,"Good morning. As the war in Gaza enters its fifth month, the push for a ceasefire has continued. Responding to Israel’s proposals, Hamas has made a far-reaching counteroffer, which includes a four and a half month truce that would see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, guarantee the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and require the reconstruction of the strip, among other requirements. The Palestinian militant group also added that over the course of the temporary ceasefire, negotiations must continue to ensure a permanent end to the fighting. The US president, Joe Biden, said the requests were “a little over the top”. But the general consensus seemed to be that this was a step in the right direction. As expected, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected Hamas’s terms, which he described as “delusional”, and has dismissed pressure from the US to come to a mediated truce. As combat intensifies and Israel prepares to storm Rafah, a small town bordering Egypt that is currently housing more than half of Gaza’s population, time is running low. With every passing day, the situation in Gaza becomes more untenable. For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Bethan McKernan, the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, about how close negotiations are to a ceasefire. That’s right after the headlines.

Labour | Keir Starmer will announce today that he is scaling back Labour’s £28bn green investment programme, in his biggest policy U-turn since becoming party leader. In depth: ‘We’re still far off a meaningful deal where hostages are released and there is a real ceasefire’ Two weeks ago, Israel announced a US-backed ceasefire plan that would entail a 45-day truce and the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. In its proposal, Israel ruled out a permanent ceasefire in order to retain the right to continue the war to wipe out Hamas. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it was a “good strong proposal” and that “there is some real hope going forward”. Here’s what happened next. *** The counterproposal After deliberating, Hamas has come back with its own proposal that includes a three-phase ceasefire, with each stage lasting 45 days. In the first phase, all Israeli women, males under the age of 19, elderly people and the sick would be released in exchange for Palestinian women and children in Israeli prisons. During the second stage, the rest of the male hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. This would be followed by the exchange of bodies and remains in the final phase. The plans also include an increased flow of food and other aid, the reconstruction of Gaza, and retention of Hamas control in the strip. Hamas has said a permanent ceasefire is not required from the outset; however by the end of the ceasefire there would have to be some kind of agreement for a permanent truce before the release of the last hostages. *** Sticking points and compromise Even though some mediators viewed the counterproposal as a positive step, Israel’s government unequivocally rejected its terms. Netanyahu reiterated his stance that “absolute victory” against Hamas was the only solution that would secure Israel. He added that it would take months more fighting before Hamas was defeated. Despite Netanyahu’s push back, Blinken has said there is “space for agreement to be reached”. Any proposal that leaves Hamas in charge of Gaza will be deemed unacceptable by the Israeli government. “Israel has offered the leaders of Hamas to go into exile in the past, and that idea has recently been floated again, but Hamas will probably not agree to that,” says Bethan. Then there is the issue of the prisoner exchange: in November, the Palestinian prisoners who were returned to Gaza were generally women and children who had been imprisoned for misdemeanour crimes or on trumped-up charges, but Bethan explains “this time Hamas has written a long list of prisoners they want released, including hardened militants who are serving life sentences”, which is proving to be a point of contention. Although both sides are digging their heels in, they have also indicated there is room for compromise. “The length of the ceasefire, the amount of aid and goods allowed into Gaza and the way the hostage and prisoner release mechanism would work in practice” are all areas either or both sides may be willing to move on, Bethan says. *** What’s next? The outcome of these negotiations could not be more critical to the security of the region and the worsening of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Pressure on Israel from the Americans to agree to a deal has increased, especially as they hope that a hostage and ceasefire deal will lead to a wider resolution in the Middle East. During the November ceasefire, Hezbollah stood down and stopped firing at Israel – whether that would happen again is unclear but there is still a chance that it could de-escalate hostilities between the Lebanese militia group and Israel. Bethan notes that it is unlikely to make much of a difference with the Houthis in Yemen, who “had their own calculations and interests in mind when they got involved and are unlikely to stand down. They would need their own separate negotiations.” The consensus among mediators is that this is the closest Israel and Hamas have been to a ceasefire since November; Bethan, though, is not as optimistic: “We’re still really far off a meaningful deal where hostages and prisoners are released and there is a real ceasefire on the ground in Gaza.” Ramadan, a period where tensions tend to flare up in the West Bank and Jerusalem, is also fast approaching – if a truce has not been declared before mid-March, hostilities could get even worse. However, a ceasefire deal that the Israeli government is not on board with could fling Netanyahu, who is deeply unpopular, into another political crisis. Bethan says the core problem on the Israeli side is that “no one is willing to negotiate a two-state solution … The short-termist thinking is making these negotiations near impossible. How can you plan a ceasefire if you don’t know what you want to happen in Gaza after the war is over?” A truce based on the idea of all-out victory for Israel seems unrealistic even to its allies. While Israel can “degrade Hamas’s capabilities and make Gaza completely uninhabitable, they are not going to kill Hamas as an ideology or political force”, Bethan says. In the coming weeks, both sides are likely to continue to blame the other for the failure to reach a truce, as the death toll continues to rise.

2023-01-30T11:03:36Z,"Global carbon emissions forecast cut due to Ukraine war and Biden, says BP",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/30/global-carbon-emissions-ukraine-war-biden-bp,"Global carbon emissions are expected to fall quicker than previously expected as a result of the war in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s efforts to encourage green investment, BP has said. The oil and gas company said carbon emissions would fall more rapidly than it forecast a year ago thanks to renewed efforts by countries to pursue greater energy security by supporting domestic, renewable energy supplies. In its annual energy outlook report, BP said it had reduced forecasts for global emissions in 2030 by 3.7% and by 9.3% in 2050. It expects oil demand to be 5% lower and gas demand to have fallen by 6% by 2035. The company said deployment of renewables projects would be 5% higher at current rates. Countries moved rapidly last year to wean themselves off Russian gas supplies after the invasion of Ukraine. In the short term this has resulted in other fossil fuels such as coal being ramped up or kept on standby to fill the gap. However, demand for renewable projects to provide a cheap long-term replacement has also improved. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which came into force in August, is credited with encouraging a new wave of investment in renewables in the US. Policymakers in the UK and EU have been encouraged to follow suit. BP’s new outlook forecasts that global emissions will peak during the 2020s and fall by 30% on 2019 levels by about 2050. However, that would still be short of the target of net zero by 2050 needed to avoid extremely damaging global heating. The UK has legally committed to this goal. The BP chief economist, Spencer Dale, wrote in the report: “From an energy perspective, the disruptions to Russian energy supplies and the resulting global energy shortages seem likely to have a material and lasting impact on the energy system. “Global energy policies and discussions in recent years have been focused on the importance of decarbonising the energy system and the transition to net zero. The events of the past year have served as a reminder to us all that this transition also needs to take account of the security and affordability of energy.” The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, set a target of making the company net zero by “2050 or sooner” on taking charge in 2020. Looney has been attempting to revamp BP’s image and increase its focus on renewables. However, it faced criticism over plans to spend up to double the amount on oil and gas projects than on renewable investments this year. In its outlook report, BP expects oil demand to level out at about 100m barrels a day over the next 10 years or so before falling to about 75m barrels a day by 2050. To hit global net zero goals, this would need to be reduced by 20m barrels a day. BP’s profits have soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent already inflated gas prices even higher and led ministers to introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators. The company is expected to reveal fourth-quarter underlying profits of about $5bn next week.",BP; Energy industry; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions; Fossil fuels; Environment; UK news; US news,Business
2021-10-16T18:12:12Z,Treasury leak reveals rift between Johnson and Sunak over costs of zero-carbon economy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/16/treasury-leak-reveals-rift-between-johnson-and-sunak-over-costs-of-zero-carbon-economy,"Confidential documents leaked to the Observer reveal an extraordinary rift between Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over the potential economic effects of moving towards a zero-carbon economy, with just weeks to go before the crucial Cop26 climate summit. As Johnson prepares to position the UK at the head of global efforts to combat climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions as host of the Glasgow Cop26 meeting, the documents show the Treasury is warning of serious economic damage to the UK economy and future tax rises if the UK overspends on, or misdirects, green investment. Green experts said the “half-baked” and “one-sided” Treasury net-zero review presented only the costs of action on emissions, rather than the benefits, such as green jobs, lower energy bills and avoiding the disastrous impact of global heating. They said the review could be “weaponised” by climate-change deniers around the world before Cop26, undermining Johnson’s attempts at climate leadership on the global stage. The internal Treasury documents say that while there may be economic benefits to UK companies from swift and appropriate climate action, there is also a danger that economic activity could move abroad if firms found their costs were increasing by more than those of their overseas competitors. The leaked papers are understood to have been produced to accompany a slide show given confidentially to key groups outside government in the last month. The documents state: “The investment required to decarbonise the UK economy is uncertain but could help to improve the UK’s relatively low investment levels and increase productivity. “However, more green investment is likely to attract diminishing returns, reducing the positive impact of ever more investment on GDP. Some green investments could displace other, more productive, investment opportunities. If more productive investments are made earlier in the transition, this risk may be accentuated later in the transition.” On the risk of additional costs to companies from green initiatives, the documents say: “Climate action in the UK can lead to economic activity moving abroad if it directly leads to costs increasing, and it is more profitable to produce in countries with less stringent climate policies.” On the fiscal implications, the documents say the cost of moving towards net zero could mean tax rises because of “the erosion of tax revenue from fossil fuel-related activity”. They say: “The government may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably, and consistently with the government’s fiscal principles.” Ed Matthew, campaign director at the E3G thinktank, said: “To governments looking to Cop26, this looks unprofessional and embarrassing. The UK is standing in front of the world at Cop26 trying to galvanise ambitious action from every country. If the government has not presented the robust economic case in favour of action, that’s going to significantly undermine those attempts.” The Treasury’s approach is also starkly at odds with that of business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and the analysis of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in a report published in July this year. On the costs of moving towards net zero, the OBR said in its report: “Between now and 2050 the fiscal costs of getting to net zero in the UK could be significant, but they are not exceptional ... While unmitigated climate change would spell disaster, the net fiscal costs of moving to net zero emissions by 2050 could be comparatively modest.” The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, has also repeatedly said the costs of action are small and diminishing, at less than 1% of GDP by 2050, while the costs of inaction are large and rising. While there are concerns over how the costs could fall on poorer households, the CCC chief executive Chris Stark has made clear that ministers can choose to distribute the costs and benefits fairly, through the design of green policies. Whitehall sources said there was a belief that Sunak was keen to position himself as something of a climate-change sceptic in order to boost his popularity with Tory party members, and draw comparisons with Johnson’s green enthusiasms. “Rishi clearly sees an interest in showing he is not really down with this green stuff. He wants Boris to own the whole agenda.” A source at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy confirmed that the Treasury was “kicking back” against many of the green plans being advanced by No 10 and Kwarteng. “They are not climate change deniers but they are emphasising the short-term risks, rather than long-term needs, which is what we are emphasising.” In contrast to the Treasury’s caution, Labour committed at its recent party conference to invest £28bn extra every year until 2030 to secure a “green transition” creating good jobs with decent wages in the process. The leak comes as the government prepares to publish its long-awaited net zero strategy, and heat and buildings strategy, which will contain policies on cutting emissions and creating green jobs, including a ban on new gas boilers from 2035 and grants for householders to move to green heating. The government’s Cop26 president, former business secretary Alok Sharma, is embarking on a frantic last-ditch round of diplomacy, including with Chinese representatives, amid speculation that President Xi Jinping will not attend the talks. The US and the EU are also talking to key high-emitting countries in the final weeks before Cop26, which opens on 31 October. The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and committing to raise £15bn for projects like zero-emissions buses, offshore wind and schemes to decarbonise homes.”",Green economy; Cop26; Environment; Politics; Rishi Sunak; Boris Johnson; Conservatives; UK news; Investing; Business,Environment
2020-07-15T05:01:01Z,UK government planning new green investment bank,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/15/uk-government-planning-new-green-investment-bank,"The UK government is poised to reveal plans for a new state-backed green bank to help finance Britain’s climate ambitions, three years after ministers agreed to sell the UK’s Green Investment Bank. Kwasi Kwarteng, the energy minister, said that he expects the government to set out how it plans to create a successor to the Green Investment Bank “in the not-too-distant future”. The move to rebuild a new green lender comes amid growing calls from climate campaigners, economists and academics to invest in green infrastructure to help revive the UK’s struggling economy and help meet its climate targets. The government sold the UK’s original Green Investment Bank to Australian bank Macquarie in 2017, only five years after it was formed, in a controversial deal dubbed “deeply regrettable” and “politically dubious” by critics of the sale. At a digital event hosted by climate campaign group UK100 on Monday, the minister said it is “no secret” that there is “an ongoing debate within government about how we can in effect create the Green Investment Bank 2.0”. “I fully expect there may well be announcements in that regard in the not-too-distant future,” Kwarteng added. The minister said that the UK’s commitment to build a “net zero carbon” economy within 30 years, and the “huge amount of investment” needed to reach this goal, “suggests that there may well be scope” for a new green development bank. He added that his personal view favoured a bank that focuses on the consumer and suggested that a bank similar to Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW, which was set up in the wake of the second world war to invest in infrastructure, could facilitate this. Polly Billington, the director of UK100, said business and banks should take on a much bigger role in “building back better”. “Green investment will create thousands of jobs, tackle climate change and secure the recovery. Our research with Siemens found that investing £5bn in renewable energy could unlock £100bn of private capital. We look forward to working with the government to make this happen,” she said. Researchers at the Grantham Institute, part of the London School of Economics (LSE), have called for ministers to plough £20bn in paid cash towards a new national investment bank to establish a pipeline of clean infrastructure projects including carbon capture and hydrogen. The new report, commissioned by the Aldersgate Group, proposed the state-backed bank alongside a string of near-term public investments and long-term, low-carbon strategies. The recommendations include funding for energy efficiency upgrades, tree planting and wetland restoration to boost Britain’s green recovery and help create new jobs and training opportunities. The report’s four-prong approach also set out a “low carbon skills” strategy to level-up workers who might be left underemployed or unemployed following the pandemic, and a long-term framework for low-carbon investment using a rising carbon market price to incentivise private investments. Dimitri Zenghelis, a senior visiting fellow at the LSE and the co-author of the report, said: “The government has made a good start with the summer statement and early stimulus measures will help shore up a more resilient economy over the next two years. But the government must now turn its rhetoric on green recovery into predictable and credible commitments to build a sustainable economy over next decade and beyond.”",Business; Environment; Green Investment Bank; UK news; Green economy; Green jobs; Infrastructure,Environment
2021-07-04T17:30:27Z,The Guardian view on rebalancing the economy: Brexit won’t do it | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/04/the-guardian-view-on-rebalancing-the-economy-brexit-wont-do-it,"Giving up membership of the EU is changing the UK economy. But not in the way the headlines suggest. Last week there was much crowing that Brexit Britain had secured a £1bn electric vehicle hub in Sunderland, where Nissan will produce a new all-electric car model and its partner Envision will build a huge battery factory. This was good news. But there was less focus on the fact that the units built will be tailored to rules set by Brussels. Ministers are coy about what was paid to keep the Japanese car giant here. States often dangle economic carrots to attract investment. The UK would have done so had we stayed in the EU. Instead, with Britain outside the bloc, Nissan had the upper hand in negotiations. If the plant had gone somewhere else, it would have been a clear signal that Britain was a less attractive destination outside the EU than it was within. Without the investment, ministers could have credibly been accused of betraying “red wall” voters. If Nissan’s investment is a vote of confidence in Brexit, then one has to ask what to say about companies that have left since 2016. Job offerings in UK finance have plunged downward since the 2016 referendum. This ought not to surprise anyone: before Christmas, Boris Johnson managed to get a thin trading agreement with the EU that brought relief for manufacturers but dismayed financial services, which make up 7% of the country’s GDP. Mr Johnson called this an “Australian-style” deal. In fact it was worse than that: it is now easier to sell many financial products to the EU from Sydney than London, despite the latter being 10,000 miles closer to Brussels. There had been some hope that the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, might have been able to salvage this situation by convincing the EU to grant “equivalence” for City businesses to operate on an equal footing with local European firms. But on the same day as the Nissan announcement, Mr Sunak said his attempt to secure such terms had stalled. The upshot will be that those wishing to trade and clear securities in the EU will have to move their operations to the continent. This is already happening. Before Brexit, more than half the trade in EU equities was in London; now it’s less than 20%. Remarkably, the City now risks slipping behind Amsterdam as Europe’s largest share-trading centre. Some might see such a loss as a much-needed rebalancing of the British economy, with the need for more jobs making things and fewer shuffling paper. But financial services employ about six times as many people as the motor industry, and surely a rebalancing is better done on our terms, not on other people’s. Our laissez-faire approach to the economy has left us catching up. The UK stock market is filled with polluting stocks and lacks green industrial investment opportunities. The government’s £15bn green gilt offer may help lower the cost of raising capital for renewable energy companies, but the help is smaller than that offered by the US, France and Germany. Britain might bet on fintech companies and attempt to set the rules in a fast-growing sector. It could opt for greater deregulation by lowering authorisation requirements and dropping disclosure rules. That would be unwise and encourage the kind of sharp practices that led to the last financial crash. Britain should have regulated the City better. It didn’t need to leave the EU to do so. Helen Thompson, a professor of political economy at Cambridge University, argued in 2017 that Britain’s position as a non-euro member of the EU, while possessing the offshore financial centre of the eurozone, made Brexit inevitable. Now we have lost that role, Britain is in search of another.",Brexit; Nissan; European Union; Europe; Foreign policy; Politics; Boris Johnson; Manufacturing sector; Trade policy; Money; Business; Automotive industry; UK news,Opinion
2023-05-24T15:30:12Z,Pay attention to Rachel Reeves: her economic thinking is a return to sanity | Martin Kettle,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/rachel-reeves-economic-thinking-social-democracy,"The mythology of political history insists that politicians’ speeches are important. A lifetime in political journalism tells me different. Political speeches have got to be made, and some politicians are good at them – Michael Heseltine, the best I have ever heard – but most speeches are events of the moment. They are decorative, not determinative. Most do not matter much and are rightly forgotten, even the good ones. There are, though, occasional exceptions. Rachel Reeves’ speech to the Peterson Institute in Washington DC on Wednesday has a claim to be one of those with a longer shelf life. Not because it was an oratorical tour de force stuffed with smart lines. It wasn’t. Some of Reeves’ terminology, such as her embrace of what she calls “securonomics”, is a distracting barrier to understanding what is otherwise a key idea. But that’s a small point. This speech matters a lot. It matters because the ideas and commitments it contains are serious – and because it addresses something indisputably important. What it addresses is the long-term dysfunction of the British economy, now accentuated by Brexit. Inflation may have dropped to 8.7%, but it is still higher than expected – and food, services and underlying inflation are all still growing. Interest rates may rise again and are unlikely to fall soon. Britain’s economy is walking wounded. The cost of living crisis remains acute for millions. Optimism is in short supply. Reeves’ speech was partly a response to the national imperative to put that right. But it was also about Labour’s familiar need to prove to voters that it can be trusted with the economy. Unsurprisingly, support for the Tories as the best party for the economy has tanked. But economic confidence in Labour, though greater than for the Tories, still remains low. The issue is Labour’s achilles heel. With an election now possibly less than a year away, the shadow chancellor needed to make a seriously big pitch. Hence the journey to New York and Washington DC for her keynote speech. That speech, which also marked the publication of a Labour pamphlet titled A New Business Model for Britain, repays careful reading. It does so because it contains a structured – and, in significant respects, new – argument about the British economy. As such, it lays out Labour’s direction of travel on the dominant issue now facing Britain, and the one by which a future Keir Starmer government will ultimately be judged by voters. Such is the depth of mistrust in politics today, it is tempting to say it makes an argument by which the very future of credible democratic government of any kind in Britain may stand or fall. It’s as important as that. At the heart of the shadow chancellor’s argument are four core principles. The first is that the rules of the global economy have changed because of repeated shocks since 2008. The second is that government has to be more proactive in order to establish the economic order that is so conspicuously under threat from those shocks. The third is that liberal economies must work together to do this, not against one another. And the fourth is that all this must happen within effective national fiscal rules – and not by allowing debt to balloon. In the wake of the economic and political tumults of the past seven years, this reads very much like a return to sanity. Some of the building blocks that Reeves proposes may have been touted occasionally during the Conservative years, as when Theresa May argued for more active government, for instance. But they remained words not deeds, not least under Rishi Sunak, who is opposed to the idea of industrial strategy. But what Reeves now advocates is definitely not a return to the past. Her long-term aim is to restore growth to the UK economy. But Reeves’ approach is a world away from Liz Truss’s slash-and-burn dash for growth. It would also propel a Labour government into a very different place from that adopted after 1997 by New Labour. In some ways it would be more New Deal than New Labour, and the whole project owes a lot to Joe Biden’s administration in Washington and the government-led investment that marks Bidenomics. In Reeves’ strategy, the state would play a more overarching role and would not vacate the territory of decision-making to the banks and to business. An industrial strategy – focused above all on the green investment programme, worth £140bn over five years – would dare to speak its name again for the first time since the 1970s. And supply chains would be made more secure, even protectionist in some respects, by lessening dependency on China, and by a more active, pragmatic alignment with Europe. Reeves is traditional in one sense. She is trying to carve out a middle way between free-market globalism and state control of the economy. This is something that every social democratic party in western Europe has attempted to do, albeit within various different national traditions and with changing shibboleths, since the 1950s. Hers is a 2020s version, and although it owes much to the US Democrats, it also has things in common with the German SPD’s programme. To dismiss all this as Blairite would be trite. A week ago, the New Statesman dubbed Reeves the most influential person in British progressive politics today, with Starmer relegated to second place. Her Washington DC speech lends weight to that case. If nothing else, it is the most substantial answer that Labour has yet offered to those who claim they do not know what the party now stands for.

2021-03-30T07:00:36Z,"Green investing 'is definitely not going to work’, says ex-BlackRock executive",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/30/tariq-fancy-environmentally-friendly-green-investing,"From his desk in midtown Manhattan Tariq Fancy once oversaw the beginning of arguably the biggest, most ambitious, effort ever to turn Wall Street “green”. Now, as environmentally friendly investing grows at an exponential rate, Fancy has come to a stark conclusion: “This is definitely not going to work.” As the former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Fancy was charged with embedding environmental, social and governance (ESG) corporate policies across the investment giant’s portfolio. Fancy was a leader in a movement that has given many people, including investors, activists and academics, hope that after years of backing polluters, Wall Street was finally stepping up to confront the climate crisis. “I have looked inside the machine and I can tell you business does not have this,” Tariq told the Guardian. “Not because these are bad people but because they run for-profit machines that will operate exactly as you would expect them to do,” said Fancy. Fancy, 42, worked for BlackRock between 2018 and 2019 and was the investor’s chief investment officer for sustainable investing at a time when BlackRock was preparing to announce a major shift in strategy. “The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance,” the BlackRock chairman, Larry Fink, wrote in his highly influential annual letter to CEOs in 2020, shortly after Fancy’s departure. “In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital.” In future, Fink said, BlackRock would transition away from investments in companies that “present a high sustainability-related risk”. BlackRock manages about $7tn in assets and, with one of Wall Street’s biggest voices sounding the alarm about the need to deal with the climate crisis, the news was viewed as a pivotal moment for the financial community. But for Fancy, who now runs the digital learning non-profit Rumie in Toronto, Canada, BlackRock’s move, and the ones it has inspired, contain a fundamental flaw: the climate crisis can never be solved by today’s free markets. “It’s not because they are evil, it’s because the system is built to extract profits,” he said. Investors have a fiduciary duty to maximise returns to their clients and as long as there is money to be made in activities that contribute to global warming, no amount of rhetoric about the need for sustainable investing will change that, he believes. “In many cases it’s cheaper and easier to market yourself as green rather than do the long tail work of actually improving your sustainability profile. That’s expensive and if there is no penalty from the government, in the form of a carbon tax or anything else, then this market failure is going to persist,” said Fancy, a former investment banker who now leads an initiative to bring affordable digital education to underserved communities worldwide. The amount of money that poured into sustainable investment through vehicles like exchange traded funds (ETFs) hit record levels last year. It’s a trend Fancy believes could continue for years and still have zero impact on climate change because “there is no connection between the two things”. Moving money to green investments doesn’t mean polluters will no longer find backers. The argument is similar to that of divestment, another strategy Fancy says doesn’t work. “If you sell your stock in a company that has a high emissions footprint, it doesn’t matter. The company still exists, the only difference is that you don’t own them. The company is going to keep on going the way they were and there are 20 hedge funds who will buy that stock overnight. The market is the market. “I don’t think the public realizes we are not talking about stopping climate change,” he said. “We are literally talking about selling assets so we don’t get caught up in the damage when it hits.” Business knows this, Fancy said, and it also knows the solution – it just doesn’t like it. He compared the business communities reaction to the coronavirus pandemic to its views on climate change. “Science shows us that Covid-19 is a systemic problem for which we all need to bend down a curve, the infections curve.” As the crisis escalated business leaders were immediately supportive of government-led initiatives to restrict travel, close venues and shutter the economy. “The Business Roundtable [the US’s most powerful business lobby] said we should make mask-wearing mandatory. They were right about all those things,” he said. The world needed government to use its extraordinary powers “because if you left it to the free market everything would have been open in the US and we would have lost millions of people, it wouldn’t have been half a million”. Climate change too is a problem science says is systemic and one where we have to bend down the curve. “The difference is the incubation period. It’s not a few weeks, it’s a few decades. For that they are still saying we should rely on the free market. That’s where I have a problem.” A survey of 250 senior executives supports Fancy’s point. About 64% of the executives surveyed in a recent poll commissioned by British lender Standard Chartered said they “believe the economics of operating as a net-zero [carbon emissions] organization do not stack up for their company”. And 79% of senior executives said short-term CEO tenure made it harder for companies to transition to net zero. Under the current system the costs, says Fancy, are simply too high and the benefits of conducting business as usual are too great. A 2019 Morgan Stanley study found that getting to net zero by 2050 will cost $50tn. “The reality is that their incentives are very short-term,” he said. “My concern is that when it comes to climate change, it’s actually expensive. It’s like saying when it comes for Covid-19 that’s a crisis and an opportunity. Well yeah, it’s an opportunity for Zoom, it’s not an opportunity for society.” There is a solution, said Fancy, and it’s the one that business leaders embraced in the coronavirus crisis: government intervention. But – given the long time line for climate change – it’s one that business leaders don’t like. What would work is a change in government policy that made it more expensive to pollute, such as a carbon tax, because that would change the corporate world and Wall Street’s incentives. “If you put a tax on carbon, every single portfolio manager would adjust their portfolio,” he said. BlackRock disputes Fancy’s analysis. In a statement the company said: “Sustainable investing can deliver strong investment returns while also helping to address urgent social and environmental concerns.” The company added that it believes greenwashing “is a risk to investors and detrimental to the asset management industry’s credibility, which is why we strongly support regulatory initiatives to set consistent standards and increase transparency for sustainable portfolios”. But for Fancy the overarching point is that real change has to be led by government, not Wall Street. “If I was on a panel and someone asked me what’s the best way to tackle climate change? Should I buy an ETF or should I call my congressperson and demand legislation and a price on carbon? The truth is someone is better off calling their congressperson.”",Investing; Environment; Business; US news; World news,Business
2023-01-24T06:00:25Z,EU ‘could end reliance on China for electric car batteries by 2030’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/24/eu-could-end-reliance-on-china-electric-car-batteries-by-2030-investment-joe-biden-369bn-green-subsidies,"Europe could end its reliance on China for electric car batteries by 2030 but only if it keeps pace with Joe Biden’s $369bn (£298bn) green subsidy spree, experts predict. A report by the renewable energy campaign group Transport &amp; Environment said the EU was on track to produce enough lithium-ion battery cells by 2027 to meet demand and cut China from supply chains. “Li-ion” batteries are rechargeable and used in consumer electronics and electric cars. The study forecasts that Europe’s reliance on China for the refining and processing of battery metals could also fall dramatically – predicting more than 50% of Europe’s refined lithium demand can come from European projects by 2030. There are now no lithium refineries in Europe, and about 90% of the world’s processing of the metal takes place in east Asia. But refinery projects under way in Germany and France are expected to boost Europe’s prospects, and planned EU legislation on critical raw materials is designed to ensure they meet high environmental standards. MPs have raised concerns that Britain’s electric vehicle supply chain is overly reliant on China, a key vulnerability amid political tensions between Beijing and the west. Britain has banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, while the EU has committed to phase out combustion engines from 2035. However, Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has attracted green investment to the US and put pressure on Britain and the EU to respond at a time when policymakers have been levying windfall taxes on renewable energy firms. The T&amp;E report showed two-thirds of Europe’s demand for cathodes – which are also used in batteries and contain critical raw materials – can be produced on the continent by 2027, with projects such as Umicore in Poland and Northvolt in Sweden contributing. However, the study’s authors warned that companies could still move projects planned for Europe to the US, tempted by the tax benefits and other subsidies provided by the IRA for localising battery supply chains in the US. Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility at T&amp;E, said: “Today half of the lithium-ion battery cells used in the EU are already made there. But the Inflation Reduction Act has changed the rules of the game, and Europe needs to put more money on the table or risk losing planned battery factories and jobs to America.” T&amp;E called for a dedicated EU fund with cash raised through joint debt issuance to aid investment into electric vehicles, batteries and renewables. Last week, Britishvolt, the battery startup that had hoped to build a “gigafactory” near Blyth, Northumberland, collapsed into administration. The company struggled to find funding and was denied access to promised state funds after failing to hit government targets. Its collapse has sparked calls for a comprehensive industrial strategy to map out Britain’s approach to the green economy, including the car industry’s switch to electric vehicles. On Monday, Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the government had failed to invest in the green economy, and is falling behind the US and EU. He said the US and Europe are “outspending and outsmarting us” in their approaches to encouraging low carbon investments. “While our competitors across Europe, Asia and the US are making their move, and going hell for leather, we seem to be second guessing ourselves and hoping for the best,” he said in a speech at University College London.","Technology sector; Manufacturing sector; Climate finance; Automotive industry; European Union; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Green economy; Renewable energy; Business; Motoring",Business
2023-05-24T05:00:02Z,Brexit ruined Britain’s appetite for revolution. That makes Starmer’s job harder | Rafael Behr,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/brexit-britain-appetite-revolution-keir-starmer-labour,"Before administering any painful procedure, doctors talk to their patients with a careful balance of candour and tact. Too graphic a warning might trigger refusal to cooperate, but pretending something won’t hurt is a betrayal of trust. Politicians face the same dilemma with painful reforms. Speak too frankly and you spook the electorate. Deny the scale of a task and you have no mandate. This is especially tricky for opposition leaders who want voters to feel upbeat about the future under a changed regime. Itemising pain kills the buzz. “The NHS is not sustainable unless we make serious, deep, long-term changes,” Keir Starmer said on Monday, trying to sound candid. It will be “hard”, “difficult” and “challenging”, but worth it to reach the goal of a health service “fit for the future”. On cost, he was tactful. Decisions will be made “on a full appreciation of reality – on the state of the NHS and our public finances”. In other words, Dr Starmer says try to relax but be prepared for some fiscal discomfort. Labour’s pledges are worthy and expensive – reduced waiting times; integration of health and social care; a digital upgrade of the whole service. Named revenue sources – VAT on private school fees; closing non-dom tax loopholes – cover only a fraction of the likely bill. Those are sticking plasters, which is what the opposition leader accuses Rishi Sunak of applying in avoidance of longer-term solutions. It is sensible for a party to avoid too much detail about its manifesto this far out from an election. Why give the enemy time to raid your best ideas and trash the rest? When it comes to awkward truths in a campaign, the virtue of telling it straight rarely outweighs the risk of making a nervous electorate flinch from your touch. The cautionary tale is Theresa May’s decision to confront the cost of social care in her 2017 election manifesto. She thought she had a sufficient poll lead to seek permission to do something hard. It looked brave for all of a few minutes, until the policy was called a “dementia tax” and fired back as a torpedo into her campaign. Democracy has always involved some tension between honesty and salesmanship, but it feels severe right now. Part of the problem is sheer exhaustion after years of successive crises, some visited on Britain from overseas (Covid; war in Ukraine), others homegrown (Brexit; Liz Truss). They have cascaded across one another, merging into a morale-sapping permacrisis. Solving difficult problems is an exercise in deferred gratification. There is an input of energy and resources that doesn’t yield immediate reward. When politicians speak of reform to upgrade public services, for example, they are pleading for patience. That asks a lot of people who have been locked down for a pandemic, had their operations delayed and their trains cancelled, then seen their stagnant wages gobbled by inflation. The past few years have put British voters in the mood for payback, not more sacrifice. This is also why Starmer’s dilemma is most acute on the question of Europe. Opinion polls show a majority thinking Brexit was a mistake (and even Nigel Farage says it isn’t working), but that doesn’t necessarily translate into an appetite for re-enacting the battles fought since 2016 in reverse. Any campaign to go back into the EU must recognise that the old membership terms are no longer available. Our continental neighbours would want to see sustained cross-party pro-European consensus before taking any British application seriously. Rejoin is not rewind. It is the work of a generation. The politics of shuffling closer to Europe from the outside are not much easier. Proper access to the single market is the economic game-changer. That re-opens arguments about free movement (or open-door immigration policy, as the Tories would cast it) and taking regulatory dictation from Brussels – the issues that polarised debate in the first place. Talk of softening the blow from Brexit tends logically to acceptance that the best Brexit is none at all. One test of whether Starmer is right to swerve away from that road is to ponder how glad many incumbent Conservative MPs would be if he took it. It suits Labour to keep Brexit in the background, as one more thing the Tories messed up. It is a significant factor in general economic malaise and a brake on recovery, but not the only one. The effect on politics is harder to quantify, and more pernicious. The harm flows from contradictions in a project that was genuinely revolutionary and cynically fraudulent at the same time. Brexit mined justified anger with a status quo that wasn’t working, then used that resource to fuel a project for impoverishing the people who most urgently needed change. That deception set a threshold of calculated dishonesty or downright stupidity for ministerial office. Anyone willing or able to engage with the complexities of Britain’s predicament in the third decade of the 21st century was disqualified from joining Boris Johnson’s cabinet. Those perverse recruitment criteria still stand. Sunak passed the test of ideological stupefaction. Making a national mission of a folly burned up irreplaceable reserves of political energy. People who operate the machinery of government are demoralised by requests to steer into ditches. Voters who were given reason to expect great things on liberation from Brussels, and got nothing, will be warier of investing hope in a different, Labour-branded project for radical upheaval. Depleted willingness to confront hard choices is a Brexit legacy that impedes Starmer even more than the economic cost. He can talk about NHS reform, green investment, ambitious housebuilding targets, all without getting lured into the weeds of European renegotiation. He can say, correctly, that he is focusing on people’s actual priorities. He can diagnose grave problems and prescribe solutions in many areas, steering tactfully away from the hardest issue. But when it comes to delivering on those promises, he will find the body politic scarred and weakened by the years of Brexit malpractice. A symptom of how deep the syndrome goes is the opposition leader’s reluctance to call it by its name. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; Conservatives; UK news; NHS,Opinion

Yet he is already being regarded by many Democrats, and some Republicans, as significant a Democratic president as Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson. He is dramatically changing the face of the US around Democratic priorities – reindustrialisation to support blue-collar jobs and wages, wholeheartedly fighting climate change, investing massively in science and education, doing more for the poorest and, not least, rejuvenating the US’s decaying public infrastructure. But, unlike his famous predecessors, he has never had their big majorities in Congress, and after November’s midterm elections he does not even control the House of Representatives. He has had to rely on guile, sheer political craft and reading the Washington runes better than any alive. For the last few months we were being warned of financial Armageddon, as an implacable Republican party forced the US to default on its debts, only to be avoided if the administration agreed to its demands for swingeing public spending cuts to avoid going through an artificial debt ceiling limit. Tomorrow was to be the witching day when default occurred and a financial crisis engulfed the world. Instead, last week the wily Biden again outfoxed his opponents, and struck a deal massively weighted in his favour that was voted for by overwhelming majorities. It was an extraordinary victory and, when invited to claim it as such, he replied: “You think that’s going to help me get it passed?” First rule in Washington politics, from which the affable Biden has never deviated: always allow the defeated to save face because you’re soon going to have to cut another deal with them. Yet what lay behind the Republican retreat is important not just for US politics but our own. The ever more ideological US right, so influential among British Tories, has been abandoning fiscal conservatism as a dead end for some time. It goes through the motions of bloodcurdling threats to cuts in public spending, but it does not have the bottle to face the political consequences – the decimation of social programmes beloved of its own base and which any Republican presidential nominee needs preserved to have a hope in 2024. Instead, the new terrain is the fight against “the woke” – from banning drag queen reading hours to penalising investment companies that invest on “environmental, societal and governance” principles – laced with traditional social conservatism fighting against abortion along with a dose of America-first nationalism. It is, in effect, Donald Trump’s politics. The ghastly cocktail might work in the US, although I doubt not enough to win national presidential elections. It certainly won’t work in Britain. Biden’s negotiating tactics were textbook. Publicly, he took seriously the threats of Kevin McCarthy, leader of the House of Representatives, to cut $4.5tn of spending over a decade, talking up the threat and flying back early from the G7 summit to negotiate, showing the depth of his concern. Privately, he knew the Republican would back off: cuts of that scale would mean that social programmes would be decimated, given that so much federal spending is on defence, which the Republicans did not want to touch. This was not 2011, when the Republicans used the same tactic and meant it, when their libertarian tax-cutting right were in control; now they are big spenders too. Biden read the mood swing well: he knows his opponents better than they know themselves. Taking over the key negotiations himself, I am told, he forced the realities home on McCarthy, who successively scaled back his demand to a headline cuts figure of $1.5tn, which helped him save face. But even that was vastly overstated because of a series of side, off-balance-sheet deals. Federal spending will end up by being reduced by 0.2%, if that, over the next 10 years, while all the huge spending programmes on chips, infrastructure and green investment that Biden has negotiated through are intact. A stunning victory. There are problems ahead: the US, accounting for 15% of world GDP, can comfortably afford spending on this scale, but it will just have to increase its tax base. The Internal Revenue Service has been hollowed out over the years. As a first step, Biden wants to build up its capacity to go after the scarcely taxed US super-rich – one area where McCarthy did get a spending cut, if not decisive. But before 2030 the US will have to raise taxes. This will not lower its growth: as the Institute of Government recently reported, there is little or no evidence that tax cuts have any impact on growth. But it will force a huge political battle into the open. Meanwhile, Bidenomics defines the new consensus, what US treasury secretary Janet Yellen describes as “modern supply side” economics, set out in perhaps the best statement of social democratic economic analysis ever to come out of Washington, the 2022 Economic Report of the President. In her recent trip to Washington, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, met the principal architects, including Yellen, all endorsing her own version of modern supply side economics she has been developing since getting the job in 2021. At its simplest, this is a commitment to ambitious public investment, particularly over net zero, in a deliberative partnership with business as the foundation for economic growth. It is working in the US. It will work in the UK. British Tories are in a parallel position to McCarthy’s Republicans. They may deplore public spending and the big state in principle, but they shrink from the consequences of putting their ideology into action. They find themselves giving aid to new technologies and supporting the green transition as political and economic necessities without believing in either – so their approach is tepid, ad hoc, unconvinced. They are tempted to follow the US right into the poisonous thickets of being anti-woke – but Britain is a much more liberal, easygoing society than the heartlands of the US midwest. And round the corner comes the spectre of having to raise, not cut, taxes. It may be that both Britain and the US will be in the throes of national elections in autumn 2024. For the first time in 40 years, not only does the liberal left have the better argument; with a following wind, they can go all the way. • This article was amended on 5 June 2023 because an earlier version used “Democrat” when “Democratic” was the appropriate adjective in accordance with our style guidance. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Joe Biden; US politics; Republicans; Janet Yellen; Green jobs; Rachel Reeves; US news; US economic growth and recession; Economics,Opinion
2023-09-26T09:44:30Z,First Thing: Biden joins stars in hailing ‘deal’ to end Hollywood writers strike,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/26/first-thing-biden-joins-stars-in-hailing-deal-to-end-hollywood-writers-strike,"Good morning. The tentative deal reached between Hollywood and studio executives has been received well by those on strike and others within the industry. Members from the Writers Guild of America (WGA), who took on the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers with demands that included better pay and residuals, and safeguards on the use of artificial intelligence, shared their collective relief. The WGA said on Sunday: “We have reached a tentative agreement on a new 2023 MBA, which is to say an agreement in principle on all deal points, subject to drafting final contract language. What we have won in this contract – most particularly, everything we have gained since 2 May – is due to the willingness of this membership to exercise its power, to demonstrate its solidarity, to walk side-by-side, to endure the pain and uncertainty of the past 146 days.” The organization called the deal “exceptional”. What did Joe Biden say about the deal? The president issued a statement on the strike’s imminent end and praised the power of collective bargaining. “This agreement, including assurances related to artificial intelligence, did not come easily. But its formation is a testament to the power of collective bargaining. There simply is no substitute for employers and employees coming together to negotiate in good faith toward an agreement that makes a business stronger and secures the pay, benefits, and dignity that workers deserve. Is the Hollywood writers’ strike really over? While there is still much that is unclear – the nature of the deal, which needs to be ironed out in contractual language and ratified by union leadership and its 11,500 members, has yet to be revealed – the picture of a post-strike Hollywood is coming into focus. Here is what we know so far. ‘Staggering’ green growth gives hope for 1.5C, says global energy head The prospects of the world staying within the 1.5C limit on global heating have brightened owing to the “staggering” growth of renewable energy and green investment in the past two years, the chief of the world’s energy watchdog has said. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency and the world’s foremost energy economist, said much more needed to be done though the rapid uptake of solar power and electric vehicles was encouraging. “Despite the scale of the challenges, I feel more optimistic than I felt two years ago,” he said. “Solar photovoltaic installations and electric vehicle sales are perfectly in line with what we said they should be, to be on track to reach net zero by 2050, and thus stay within 1.5C. Clean energy investments in the last two years have seen a staggering 40% increase.” Birol also noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector were “still stubbornly high”, and that the extreme weather seen around the world this year had shown the climate was changing “at frightening speed”. What else did the report say? The IEA, in a report entitled Net Zero Roadmap, published this morning, also called on developed countries with 2050 net zero targets to bring them forward by several years. Some already have closer dates, such as Germany with 2045 and Austria and Iceland with 2040 – and for many developing countries are much later, at 2060 in the case of China, and 2070 in India’s case. Bob Menendez refuses to quit and says $480,000 in cash was for personal use Insisting he would not resign after being indicted on corruption charges, the embattled New Jersey Democratic senator Bob Menendez told reporters the $480,000 in cash found in a safe, clothing and closets at his home was kept there for emergency personal use. He said: “For 30 years, I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings accounts, which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.” The senator’s parents are from Cuba and he was born in New York. Last week, he said: “It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat.” In Union City, New Jersey, on Monday, Menendez spoke in English and in Spanish. A group of people he said were “everyday people and constituents who know me” stood behind him as he spoke. The senator continued: “Now this may seem old-fashioned, but these were monies drawn from my personal savings accounts based on the income that I have lawfully derived over those 30 years. I look forward to addressing other issues in trial.” What is Menendez accused of? Under an indictment unsealed last week, Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, 56, were accused of using his seat in the Senate, as chair of the foreign relations committee, to benefit the government of Egypt.

He was 90. McCallum died on Monday of natural causes, surrounded by family, CBS said. The FBI warned at least three Americans active in the Sikh community that their lives were in danger in the immediate aftermath of the murder of a Sikh activist in Canada in June. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has blamed the apparent assassination on the Indian government. The National Transportation Safety Board said it has opened an investigation into a JetBlue flight that experienced sudden severe turbulence yesterday, injuring seven passengers and a crew member. The injured were taken to hospital for evaluation and treatment. A third person has been charged in the death of a toddler apparently poisoned by fentanyl in a New York City daycare center, as the search continues for the alleged ringleader of the drug-peddling operation. Renny Antonio Parra Paredes, 38, was charged with narcotics distribution resulting in death. Hopes are fading for the “reawakening” of India’s moon lander after Indian scientists were unable to communicate with the spacecraft since it went into shutdown mode to survive the freezing lunar nights. There is a 50% chance that the devices could endure the low temperatures. Stat of the day: Antarctic sea ice shrinks to lowest annual maximum level on record, data shows Antarctica is likely to have broken the record for the lowest annual maximum amount of sea ice around the continent, beating the previous low by a million square kilometres. The new mark is the latest in a string of records for the region’s sea ice, as scientists fear global heating could have shifted the region into a new era of disappearing ice with far reaching consequences for the world’s climate and sea levels. Each September, Antarctica’s sea ice reaches its maximum extent. The average between 1981 and 2010 was 18.71m sq km. But the US National Snow and Ice Data Center said preliminary analysis suggested the sea ice reached a maximum of 16.96m sq km on 10 September and had fallen since then. Don’t miss this: I survived three days in a capsized boat on the ocean floor – praying in my air bubble Harrison Okene was sitting on the toilet – surely the worst place to be as disaster strikes – when a freak wave hit the tugboat he was working on, and turned it upside down. Now he was on the floor, and the toilet was above him. “I was trying to open the door to get out, when the toilet fell and hit me on the head,” he says. He just had time to see blood pour from the wound before the lights went off. “Everywhere was dark.” The bathroom began to fill with water. “It didn’t take long,” he says. “One minute, two minutes” – and he felt the boat touch the seabed. Thirty metres (100ft) below the surface, it came to rest. Okene had no choice but to listen in the dark as the shouts of his colleagues fell silent. His throat throbbed and his tongue peeled. Ten years on, he explains why he loves the sea more than ever – and decided to become a diver, Climate check: ‘Whatever it takes’ – students at 50 US high schools launch climate initiative Students at more than 50 high schools across the US are proposing a Green New Deal for Schools, demanding that their districts teach climate justice, create pathways to green jobs after graduation and plan for climate disasters, among other policies. The campaign, coordinated by the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate justice collective, is a reaction to rightwing efforts to ban or suppress climate education and activism at schools. The national effort could include teach-ins and walkouts, as well as targeted petitions to school boards and districts in the coming weeks, organizers with Sunrise told the Guardian. “We are prepared to do whatever it takes,” said Adah Crandall, 17, an organiser for the Sunrise Movement based in Portland, Oregon. Last Thing: Eat yogurt to ward off garlic breath, say scientists If you have ever skipped the garlic for fear of romantic rejection, take note: you can have your date and eat garlic – provided you follow up with a spoonful of yogurt. Research suggests the fat and protein that yogurt contains prevents almost all of the smelly volatile compounds in garlic from escaping into the air. Manpreet Kaur and Prof Sheryl Barringer at the Ohio State University in Columbus, US, tested the capacity of yogurt – and the water, fat and protein in it – to neutralize the sulfurous compounds that give raw and cooked garlic its characteristic odor. Their results, published in the journal Molecules, suggested yogurt alone reduced 99% of the most odor-producing volatiles in raw garlic. They found higher-fat yogurt was better than lower-fat yogurt. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday. If you’re not already signed up, subscribe now.

2023-05-12T21:30:05Z,‘Clause IV on steroids’: Keir Starmer says his Labour must go further than Blair,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/12/clause-iv-on-steroids-keir-starmer-says-his-labour-must-go-further-than-blair,"Labour is prepared for a “dirty and nasty” campaign ahead of next year’s general election, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The Labour leader claimed his project of reforming the party in the aftermath of the Corbyn era must go further and deeper than Tony Blair’s government. In a speech on Saturday, he said reforms were necessary because an incoming Labour government would have a bigger task than confronted Blair, owing to the severe challenges currently facing the country, on top of 13 years of Conservative rule. “If you think our job in 1997 was to rebuild a crumbling public realm, that in 1964 it was to modernise an economy overly dependent on the kindness of strangers, in 1945 to build a new Britain, in a volatile world, out of the trauma of collective sacrifice – in 2024, it will have to be all three,” he said. He highlighted Blair’s controversial move in 1995 to rewrite the Labour constitution, known as clause IV, ditching the party’s then commitment to mass nationalisation in a dramatic shift towards the centre ground. “This is about taking our party back to where we belong and where we should always have been … back doing what we were created to do,” Starmer told the Progressive Britain conference. “That’s why I say this project goes further and deeper than New Labour’s rewriting of clause IV … This is about rolling our sleeves up, changing our entire culture, our DNA. This is clause IV on steroids.” In a questions and answers session, Starmer acknowledged that the party faced a hard road ahead if it is to take power after the next general election. “I have always known it is going to get dirty and nasty. That is the nature of our politics,” he said in response to a question. “We can’t complain. It isn’t pleasant, but we have to get on with it.” But he said Labour should look forward to the challenge: “This is the bit where we get to talk about the future of the country, with hope.” Starmer’s comments are likely to alarm those on the party’s left who are already angered by his decision to drop pledges on tuition fees and the nationalisation of utilities. He has defended these shifts by saying his proposals have been adapted given unprecedented global events. He said in his speech that this zeal for reform is born from the fact that working people “no longer have faith in an unreformed state”. “We need to accept that nobody is going to unite behind the traditional Westminster way of doing things. Seriously, walk round any working-class community and you will be hit over the head by this,” he said, describing his plans as a “new partnership between politics and working people: a new Labour project for our times”. In this month’s local election, Labour gained 500 seats at the expense of the Conservatives, becoming the largest party in local government. However, there was a strong showing for the Liberal Democrats, too, fuelling speculation about a possible hung parliament and coalitions. In an interview, Shabana Mahmood, Labour’s election chief, insisted the party was on course for an absolute majority at the next election, based on last week’s local voting across England. She said there was “polite disagreement with some of the psephologists” who extrapolated the local election data to predict a hung parliament, given that last week’s voting did not take place in Scotland, Wales or London. Labour is particularly confident of making gains in Scotland. “So I think that when you look at the fuller picture, that’s why we believe we are on course,” Mahmood said. “But obviously there is a long way between now and actually completing that course. And that’s the next bit ahead for us. It’s not as if any of us are sitting there thinking this is in the bag. I’d be the first person to militantly stamp that out. It’s just we know it’s doable. We know there is a path there for us. And we’re very much on it.” Starmer’s speech comes at a point when Labour is under pressure to set out more big policies. Sources said more details of the party’s offering to the electorate would be set out in the coming months and at its conference in the autumn. Before then, the national policy forum process in July will begin to shape the priorities of a Labour government. In a briefing sent out to Labour members this week, 86 pages of proposals for debate at the forum included measures such as day one rights for workers, billions of pounds of green investment, reform of childcare, and a huge expansion of NHS staffing, as well as votes at 16. Starmer is yet to set out how his proposed reforms to the state would take shape, but he told the Observer last month that he would be “bolder” than the last Labour government on overhauling public services. He also set out plans to accelerate housebuilding and get more young people on the property ladder. In his speech, Starmer launched a new attack on the Conservatives for being “unconservative” and failing to understand people’s need for “stability, order, security”. “We must understand there are precious things – in our way of life, in our environment, in our communities – that it is our responsibility to protect and preserve and to pass on to future generations,” he said. “And if that sounds Conservative, then let me tell you: I don’t care. Somebody has got to stand up for the things that make this country great, and it isn’t going to be the Tories.” He said Rishi Sunak’s party did not stand up for “our rivers and seas, not our NHS or BBC, not our families, not our nation”. The Conservatives accused Starmer of a cynical rebrand, with the party chair, Greg Hands, saying: “Starmer has backtracked on every pledge he has ever made and he is now cynically trying to rebrand his own flip-flops as ‘reform’.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; UK news,Politics
2023-05-31T05:00:16Z,The spectre of price controls is back to spook Sunak – and Thatcherite myths won’t save him | Rafael Behr,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/31/price-controls-rishi-sunak-thatcher-prime-minister,"Even if you don’t call it “price control” (and Downing Street would prefer that you don’t), asking supermarkets to limit the cost of basic goods is an extraordinary thing for a Conservative government to contemplate. It may not happen. If it does, it will be voluntary, say ministers – just a nudge to retailers, so they keep the cost of living down. Definitely not the sort of thing that was last attempted 50 years ago, under a weak Tory prime minister struggling to control inflation, while grappling with strikes and sliding towards election defeat. Nothing like that at all. Rishi Sunak is unlike Ted Heath in all the ways that Britain in 2023 and 1973 are different places. The comparison reveals little, except for a familiar neurosis among those Tory MPs who will be quick to conjure spectres from the 70s if Whitehall really does start setting the price of milk. There is no decade more ghastly in the Conservative imagination than the one that ended with Margaret Thatcher’s election victory. It is inscribed in party folklore as a parable of national decline, written by a bloated state to dictation from Bolshevik trade unions. (Heath’s eagerness for Britain to join the European Economic Community confirms his villainy.) The picture is made darker so the light of redemption in the 80s, by way of privatisation, deregulation and tax cuts, may shine brighter. Every party-political narrative is a myth made from half-truth and fantasy. The Conservative morality tale of Thatcherism as national liberation from suffocation by socialism is no different. The most important aspect of the story, given its ongoing salience in Tory ideology, is how long ago it all happened. Rishi Sunak was not yet born when Thatcher entered Downing Street. As much time has passed between then and now as elapsed between Queen Victoria’s funeral and the end of the second world war. As it happens, on the very day that ministers were denying newspaper reports of imminent price controls, a British railway was renationalised. Another one. That makes four in five years. The private contract to run the TransPennine Express expired and was not renewed because the service was so bad. The trains are now controlled by the “operator of last resort” on behalf of the government. The moment passed without hullabaloo. The guardians of Thatcher’s sacred flame don’t waste energy defending rail privatisation, which was done by John Major. Even at the time there was a last-gasp feel about it; the grey prime minister relighting stale butts from a policy ashtray at the end of the night. And that was 30 years ago. The cycle that carries ideas from radical inception, via mainstream acceptance to outdated dogma moves slowly. Generations have been born and reached adulthood with the Conservative party fixed in orbit around a political doctrine that was written before the invention of the internet. Intellectual stagnation invites demographic decline, which militates against fresh thinking. The youngest voters who flinch from memory of the 70s are now pushing 70. Their grandchildren are enfranchised. But older people are more reliable when it comes to actually voting. Differential turnout skews Tory policy towards the greying base. Why risk putting new homes in the backyards of rich pensioners, or asking them to cash in their assets to pay for social care? Unsurprisingly, millennials, those aged roughly 25-40, are not voting Conservative. A polling report, published on Tuesday by Onward, a centre-right thinktank, points out that these voters make up around a quarter of the electorate. They are the largest cohort in just over half of all constituencies. There is no mystery about their allegiance. They want secure jobs, an NHS that works, affordable homes and childcare that won’t gobble their entire income. They are socially liberal (but not moved by partisan culture wars); they care about the environment; they are not pro-Brexit. Of course they aren’t Tories. The report’s authors, striving not to despair, point out that some millennials are well-disposed to Sunak, but that warmth isn’t yet sufficient to thaw relations with the prime minister’s party. It is also probably a function of people not actually knowing what Sunak stands for, clocking his age, immigrant background and moderate demeanour, then extrapolating that he must be somewhere to the left of the average older, white Tory. That is a reasonable assumption in the wider context of British society, although in this case it happens to be wrong. Sunak combines doctrinal rigidity with a pragmatic streak in ways that make him hard to read. As chancellor, he borrowed huge sums to pay people’s wages via the pandemic furlough scheme. When Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatened gas supplies, he subsidised household bills. Such interventions demand temporary abandonment of the Thatcherite creed. When Ed Miliband proposed freezing energy prices in 2014, the Tories denounced it as unhinged Marxism. Now it is government policy. The difference, say Conservatives, is that their deployment of state control is expedient, short-term and reluctant, while Labour does it by default and with relish. (The same applies to tax rises.) That presumes a return to the place where government could retreat from economic management, let the market allocate resources efficiently and distribute reward according to merit. That land never truly existed and it certainly isn’t springing to life in the foreseeable future. Most British voters know it. They want the state to be active on their behalf, and willingly so. They are bitten by winds that do not reach Sunak, insulated behind his wall of money and intellectual complacency. The absence of a discernible strategy for adapting to volatile times makes Britain an outlier among democracies, or rather a laggard. The US and EU are racing to subsidise new technologies, secure supply chains, make themselves hospitable to innovation and resilient against global turbulence. Labour has recently started flagging this as a dividing line between itself and the Tories. It doesn’t make headlines, but it is there, in speeches and in policy – £28bn every year for green investment, for example. They don’t get much credit for it, but Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are trying to engage with the world as it is. Sunak seems perplexed by a world that refuses to go back to the way it was. In that respect, he is faithfully serving the cohorts that have done well for themselves over the course of his lifetime, although most of them are so much older than him. That is why he looks oddly out of place, despite being a typical Tory in every other respect. There is something especially futile about his Thatcherite faith; something doubly pointless in the spectacle of him not just running out of time, but facing the wrong way as the eager young keeper of a dying flame.

2020-07-06T21:30:13Z,Chancellor set to announce £3bn green investment package,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/06/chancellor-set-to-announce-3bn-green-investment-package,"Rishi Sunak is to announce a £3bn package of green investment to decarbonise public buildings and cut emissions from Britain’s poorly insulated homes as part of the government’s Covid-19 economic recovery plan. The chancellor will seek to use Wednesday’s summer statement on the economy to fend off criticism that his proposals lack ambition by insisting that he can “kick start” an environment-friendly revival through the creation of thousands of green jobs in the construction industry. Sunak will say that the extra money for decarbonising houses, schools, hospitals, prisons and military bases will help the UK meet its target of being a carbon net zero economy by 2050, and is likely to say that further green spending will be announced later in the year. Opposition parties and environmental groups said, however, that the green investment pledge was inadequate to meet the challenge posed by global heating. Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace UK’s head of green recovery, said: “Surely this is just a down payment? The German government’s pumping a whopping £36bn into climate change-cutting, economy-boosting measures and France is throwing £13.5bn at tackling the climate emergency. £3bn isn’t playing in the same league.” Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “We have consistently called or a recovery which has energy efficiency at its heart and will welcome any measures which achieve that. “But this needs to be part of a much broader and bigger scale strategy for getting on track for net zero, which includes a zero carbon army of young people being put back to work, investment in renewable energy and a plan to green our transport network. When the moment demands the most ambitious green recovery possible, the government has not so far risen to the challenge.” The Treasury said the summer statement was about “securing the recovery” and would be followed by two bigger events – a spending round and a budget – in the autumn. Sunak’s plan was on top of the £5bn of infrastructure spending announced by Boris Johnson last week. Of the £3bn, the chancellor will earmark £1bn to improve the insulation and energy efficiency of public buildings, and to invest in green heating technology. Sunak will also announce £50m to pilot new approaches to retrofitting social housing at scale to make them greener, through measures like heat pumps, insulation and double glazing, which the Treasury said would support landlords to improve the least energy efficient social rented homes in England. Warmer homes for social tenants could lower annual energy bills by £200 a year for some of the poorest households, the government estimates. The UK’s homes are the draughtiest in Europe, accounting for about a fifth of the UK’s carbon emissions, but sporadic attempts at insulation programmes by governments over the last two decades have failed to make much progress. With the focus of the spending statement on jobs, it is thought most of the remaining £2bn will be spent on creating “green” employment opportunities for construction workers. The Conservative manifesto at the 2019 election promised to invest £9.2bn on improving energy efficiency in homes, schools and hospitals, saying that this, if done at sufficient speed, would create around 100,000 jobs. “The government remains committed to decarbonising buildings to keep us on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050,” a treasury spokesperson said. “The funding expected to be announced this week represents a significant and accelerated down payment on decarbonising buildings, to help stimulate the economic recovery and create green jobs. Allocations for future funding will be determined in due course.” Rogers added: “Of course this money is better than nothing, but it doesn’t measure up to the economic and environmental crises. It’s not enough to create the hundreds of thousands of new green jobs that are needed. It’s not enough to insulate all of the homes and buildings that need to be kept warm and more energy efficient. It’s not enough to ‘build back greener’, and it’s certainly not enough to put us on track to tackle the catastrophic impacts of the climate emergency.” Miliband has previously called for a huge green investment programme to create jobs, particularly for young people, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and to help tackle the climate emergency. Separately, the Liberal Democrats urged Sunak to zero-rate VAT on green products, including wind turbines, solar panels, bikes and e-bikes. The chancellor must not “miss this once-in-a lifetime opportunity to secure a green economic recovery”, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at business group the CBI, said: “Investment in green jobs and technology must be at the centre of our efforts to revive the economy. “This £3bn package of measures will undoubtably fast-forward progress towards net-zero. With the government’s own manifesto promising £9.2bn on energy efficiency alone, we look forward to seeing the full details on delivery of its ambition to build back greener.”",Economic policy; Rishi Sunak; Environment; UK news; Coronavirus; Politics; Infrastructure; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions,Politics
2023-03-16T13:36:37Z,Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it,"Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear power, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain’s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. But is it? Does Britain need nuclear power? Hunt follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain’s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France’s EDF – which operates the stations – said it had extended the life of two other plants. Proponents argue that nuclear provides a “baseload” of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also high hopes for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised. Why is nuclear being reclassified? To attract private investment. The consultation is on the “taxonomy” or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn climate subsidy package. Is Britain the first country to do this? No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a “green” investment. The EU’s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed “to boost green investments and prevent ‘greenwashing’”. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace. Will it make a difference? Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears. The government has committed £700m to the Suffolk plant, which could cost more than £30bn to build. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with delays and cost overruns. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C’s funders. The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce’s’ aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain. Is nuclear energy renewable? Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, which are expected to be around for many years. Is it really green? Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid says that the “lifecycle emissions” – emissions resulting from every stage of the production process – are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation. Hunt said on Wednesday that “increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations”. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build – Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push – it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain’s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments remains in place. Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as Sellafield, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete deep underground. It has also been argued that – as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast – rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed. That is not the only concern, is it? No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including Three Mile Island in 1979, Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, in Ukraine, has again raised concerns over a nuclear incident. .",Nuclear power; Energy; Jeremy Hunt; UK news; Environment; Politics; Energy industry; Business; Sustainable development,Environment
2023-02-03T09:18:14Z,Nadhim Zahawi: it was the paltry size of his tax bill that should shock us | Arun Advani,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/03/nadhim-zahawi-it-was-the-paltry-size-of-his-tax-bill-that-should-shock-us,"Nadhim Zahawi’s tax row reveals an even bigger scandal: the rich are getting a tax break that those on low incomes can only dream of. While the revelation that the former Conservative chair had to pay a tax penalty was shocking, the bigger concern is that the only tax he was required to pay on £27m was £3.7m. That implies an average tax rate of less than 14%, lower than the rate for someone working full-time on the minimum wage. Two weeks ago, the Guardian broke the story that Zahawi had been fined by HMRC for not taking reasonable care in his tax affairs. This “carelessness” meant he had not paid £3.7m in tax that he owed from the sale of £27m worth of shares in YouGov, the company he co-founded in 2000. His belated payment of the tax bill, plus interest and a fine, while he was chancellor, led to a total payment of about £5m. The revelation ultimately led to the ethics investigation that was his downfall. Assuming Zahawi’s bill was related to unpaid capital gains tax, his startlingly low rate was possible because capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than other income. While the tax rate for someone earning a salary of £270,000 is 47%, made up of 45% income tax above £150,000 and 2% national insurance contributions above £50,000, someone taking home 100 times as much can pay the much lower 20% capital gains tax rate. And some gains can qualify for either business asset disposal relief or investors’ relief, bringing the rate on those gains down to 10%, and further reducing the average rate. These low tax rates tend to benefit the wealthiest in society, the asset-rich. Capital gains are the returns that someone makes on selling an asset that has grown in value – be it a property, shares or antique vase. But most capital gains come not from the sale of second homes by the upper middle classes but from the sale or dissolution of businesses by individuals who both own and manage those businesses. And those gains are incredibly concentrated: half of all taxable gains in the entire country go to about 5,000 people, who each receive more than £1.5m in gains. Perhaps this would be worth it if there was compelling evidence that these low rates had beneficial side-effects for growth and employment. But the current structure of capital gains tax is neither good for growth nor good for all of those who receive money in the form of gains. It is bad for growth because the gap between capital gains tax and income tax rates encourages people who could be brilliant employees to instead be mediocre self-employed managers, contributing to the long “tail” of unproductive firms in the UK. Someone taking home £1m in gains would pay up to £370,000 less tax than if they were earning the same as a salaried employee. It is also bad for those actually investing serious cash in companies, because in times of high inflation they can pay large amounts of tax on increases in the value of those investments, even if this increase doesn’t keep up with the price of ordinary goods and services. So what is the answer? One not particularly radical solution would be to largely go back to the capital gains tax structure imposed by the Conservative chancellor Nigel Lawson in 1988. Lawson taxed capital gains at the same rate as income, and provided an allowance for inflation. A move back in this direction, with also some “smoothing” to account for gains being received less frequently than income, would be eminently sensible. As a bonus it would raise about £16bn. This could pay for quite a lot of wage increases for teachers, nurses and firefighters who are striking because their incomes are falling relative to the cost of living. Or for green investment. Or for the tax cuts the chancellor so desperately craves. • Arun Advani is an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick and a research fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies",Nadhim Zahawi; Conservatives; Business; Politics; UK news; HMRC,Opinion
2022-12-11T14:00:35Z,Albanese government looking at laws to force big business to disclose climate efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/12/albanese-government-looking-at-laws-to-force-big-business-to-disclose-climate-efforts,"Banks and other big businesses will be forced to come clean with the public about what they are doing to cut emissions under plans put forward by the Albanese government. The government is also looking for ways to crack down on “greenwashing” – or when businesses try to win over consumers by overhyping their environmental practices. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will say in a speech in Sydney on Monday that Australian firms “need to make credible disclosures to remain competitive in global capital markets”. “There’s now broad acceptance that proper disclosure of these financial risks and impacts isn’t a nice-to-have extra,” he will say, according to speech notes distributed by his office in advance. “This information is need-to-know – essential to mobilising the weight of our financial system behind the net zero transition.” Treasury will release a consultation paper on Monday on the development of an Australian climate risk disclosure system. The government argues business and investors need clarity and certainty to manage climate risks and invest in new opportunities. It wants large business and financial institutions to provide “more information and greater transparency on how they are responding to climate change and supporting the transition to net zero”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government says the reporting requirements are expected to be mandatory for large entities and phased in over time. It also plans to apply “appropriately tailored requirements to comparable commonwealth public sector corporate entities and investment funds”. The director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change, Erwin Jackson, welcomed Australia “catching up” on climate-related disclosures. He said this could “support the unlocking of the billions of dollars of investment that are going to be needed on the transition to net zero”. Jackson said climate disclosure arrangements in Australia were a “dog’s breakfast”. “We have very large number of companies voluntarily disclosing at the moment but one company discloses one thing and another company discloses another thing and it’s really impossible for investors to get clear information to compare companies,” he said. “The sooner investors have clarity on the robustness of companies’ plans, the sooner they’ll be able to back those companies and industries on delivering the new industries and the new jobs that are going to be created as we address climate change.” The government has also asked Treasury to develop a comprehensive strategy to deepen Australia’s green finance markets and seize opportunities presented by surging global momentum in sustainable finance. Chalmers will say global investors increasingly see “a new harmony between profit and planet”. Australia should respond “by making our country a world leader in sustainable finance, taking a larger slice of the growing green investment pie”, he will tell the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute. Chalmers says the government is focused on “confronting and cracking down on greenwashing – ensuring the credibility of sustainability-related financial targets, products and investments – because credibility is everything”. He flagged the need to “develop coordinated strategies to prevent greenwashing in the corporate sector and financial markets” in a letter to the Council of Financial Regulators. The newly released letter to the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, in his capacity as chair of the CFR also seeks support for “standardised, internationally-aligned climate-related financial disclosure requirements for large businesses and financial institutions”. Treasury has asked for public submissions by 17 February.",Australian politics; Jim Chalmers; Climate crisis; Environment; Australia news; Business; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions,Australia news
2023-09-24T05:00:14Z,‘This can only end badly’: Tories fear Sunak policy blitz is bound to fail,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/24/this-can-only-end-badly-tories-fear-sunak-policy-blitz-is-bound-to-fail,"As world leaders gathered at the UN climate summit in New York last Tuesday, a topic that was sparking lively discussion on the margins was Rishi Sunak’s “no-show”. “There were a lot of people asking why he hadn’t come,” said one British source who attended. “Most other world leaders were there.” The UK was, however, briefly represented at the New York event by Prince William, who was in town to announce the winners of the Earthshot prize, his environmental charity. While the prince was on stage at lunchtime US time – with the likes of Bill Gates and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, discussing the importance of combating global warming – diplomats and officials were distracted by a news alert on their phones. The BBC had been leaked details of how Britain’s prime minister was about to U-turn on several key climate change commitments, and the story was making waves not just in the UK, but across the Atlantic. The reaction among environmentalists, government officials and others at the UN was, inevitably, scornful. “Which are you?” asked one non-UK diplomat to a British friend, “the prince promoting Earthshot, or your PM thumbing his nose at us?” Slowly it was becoming clearer why Sunak had decided to stay well away. There were more important things to do at home. It is less than two years since the UK, under a Conservative government, hosted the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, which committed member states to ratchet up `– not down – their policies to combat global heating. The then Prince Charles told the Glasgow gathering it was their last chance, saying that “the eyes and hopes of the world are upon you …because time has quite literally run out.” But that was then. These days in Downing Street, more immediate political concerns predominate. The Tories remain way behind in the opinion polls, and after 11 months of Sunak’s mission to steady the ship following the turbulence of Boris Johnson’s and Liz Truss’s time at No 10, there is frustration, if not desperation. Isaac Levido, the Australian strategy guru behind Johnson’s 2019 victory, has been spending the past few weeks working on ways to turn the tide late in the day by finding sharper dividing lines with Labour. Apart from one ray of sunshine over the summer – in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where the Conservatives hung on in a byelection largely because of opposition to Labour mayor Sadiq Khan’s expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) in London – nothing has gone right. Initiatives on small boats, the health service and schools all misfired and the autumn got off to the worst possible start, with many schools partially shut and buildings closed off after safety concerns about Raac concrete. When Conservative MPs returned to Westminster a fortnight ago, they were crying out for new ideas. “We are sinking fast as there is no new direction. We just flog the same issues, like small boats, and it merely shows where we have gone wrong,” said one. The tax cuts demanded by the right of the party have been all but ruled out by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, who insists that cutting inflation is priority number one. So what, without money to spend, could Sunak and his chancellor do to appeal to undecided voters and cause problems for Labour at the same time? As well as Levido being on the case, work was being done by the thinktank Onward, jointly set up by Will Tanner, who is now Sunak’s deputy chief of staff, and the Tory minister Neil O’Brien. Over the last few days, famine has turned to feast and that work has borne fruit. The dividing lines for a general election campaign have become far clearer. But much of the strategy that has emerged at such speed is hugely high-risk, and Tory MPs know it. The rush of announcements began somewhat chaotically with a rearranged speech by Sunak on Wednesday, reversing a lot of climate change policy that at Cop26 two years ago had been sacrosanct. The speech had to be brought forward from Friday because the BBC leak about the switch had caused a stir – not least in the car industry, which wants certainty over plans for electric vehicles. Sunak, while insisting the UK would still meet its net zero goals, announced a delay to the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, relaxed targets to get households to switch away from fossil fuel boilers, and ditched plans for tougher energy efficiency rules for landlords. All in all, it was a huge U-turn that caught even seasoned Tory MPs by surprise. One Conservative source admitted that Sunak was taking the biggest gamble of his premiership. “Yes, he opens himself to all the stuff about lack of global leadership, but this is about taking on Labour,” the source said. “It is about Starmer – with his £28bn of spending on green investment – hitting you in the pocket. It is a dividing line.” Plenty of Tories greeted the move as positive. “It is exactly right, the only thing to do,” said Sir Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne. Others were dismayed. One MP on the left of the party said he had been encouraged by some of Sunak’s decisions over the summer, such as the move to rejoin the EU’s Horizon scientific research programme: “But then I saw this and thought how wrong I could be.” Alok Sharma, the former cabinet minister who chaired the Cop26 summit, was sharply critical, saying it would be “incredibly damaging … if the political consensus that we have forged in our country on the environment and climate action is fractured”. If it was an attempt to win votes, it would fail, he added: “I really do not believe that it’s going to help any political party electorally which chooses to go down this path.” Other policy ideas that have emerged in the last few days range from ditching A-levels and replacing them with an international baccalaureate – a measure dismissed by many educationalists as unachievable, because there are not enough teachers to make it work – to banning the next generation from ever buying cigarettes. In the next few days, it is also expected that Sunak will announce a major scaling-down of the HS2 high speed rail project, possibly scrapping the section north of Birmingham altogether. Labour sources say they believe this is another attempt to create a dividing line with Labour and Keir Starmer: “The Tories will say that HS2 is really a project that benefits the south, not the north, and that, because of that, Labour will be betraying the north by supporting it,” said one. The risks are obvious, according to Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester. “HS2 to Manchester builds the core of a new east-west line called Northern Powerhouse Rail,” Burnham said. “If the government pulls the plug on HS2, they will be pulling the plug on that new east-west line – and on the north as a whole. We will be left with Victorian rail infrastructure while the southern half of the country will be connected by new high speed lines. “At the end of the parliament which was meant to level us up, the Conservative party will have succeeded in laying the foundations for the north-south divide to get much wider. As political betrayals go, it doesn’t get much bigger.” Government insiders said the wobbling over HS2 had caused nervousness in every part of Whitehall, given the amount of money already invested, the weak business case for shortening the line, and the damage done to investor confidence in the UK. This weekend there are strong rumours of ministerial resignations if the project is cut. Sunak’s personal dislike of HS2 is well known: he is said to be more in favour of cancelling the northern section entirely than Hunt. “I just think the PM hates the project,” said one Whitehall source. “He hated it when he was chancellor and he didn’t like signing it off. I don’t think it’s much more complicated than that. It also is about having some extra fiscal headroom. “But what’s strange is that it doesn’t really save you money in this spending review period before the election – it saves you money in the future. I think pretty much everybody else is very nervous. “The PM also hates smoking. I mean, it’s a strange basis to make policy. Net zero, smoking, A-level reform – what unites these things other than his personal views? That, I think, is a challenge. What’s the common thread between these things and HS2? How does this add up to a coherent programme for government? I’m slightly baffled.” Opponents both in government and on the Tory back benches are already pointing out the obvious problems. “I’m all for being bold – the difficulty for him, of course, is he doesn’t have a mandate to be bold in these areas,” said one senior Tory. “And it is going against the explicit mandate that the Conservative government does have.” The Conservative party meets in Manchester for its annual conference next weekend. Senior figures close to the HS2 project say that ditching the northern leg of the high speed line during the gathering in the city would be a political disaster in every sense for a party trying to hang on to seats behind the “red wall”. “You can see why they want to get an announcement out of the way in the next few days,” said one source. “If they were to announce that HS2 was not coming to Manchester while meeting in, er, Manchester, I don’t think they could ever come back.” While Sunak’s team insist all their plans are well thought through, and reflect Sunak’s vision and desire for change, there are plenty in his party who smell panic and policymaking on the hoof. “The policy blitz is just confusing people,” said one senior Tory. “It smacks of total desperation. HS2, smoking, net zero … Most people just seem to see this as flailing around in every direction rather than having any coherent strategy.” Whether or not it is all coherent, most Tories agree on one thing at least: that the burst of recent activity points towards a general election sooner rather than later. “Multiple cabinet ministers now expect a May election,” said one Tory. “They’ve decided to gamble the house and are behaving like problem gamblers in a casino. Throwing the kitchen sink at random policy. This can only end badly.”",Politics; Environment; UK news; Conservatives; Climate crisis; Rishi Sunak; HS2,Politics
2023-03-30T17:05:55Z,Hasty changes to Sunak’s climate strategy reveal a warring Tory party,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/hasty-changes-to-rishi-sunak-climate-strategy-reveal-a-warring-tory-party,"Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, headed to Oxfordshire on Thursday to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, the early-stage concept that promises unlimited clean energy at an unspecified future point, if only some hefty physical constraints can be overcome. He was accompanied by Grant Shapps, energy and net zero secretary, for the biggest energy and climate change announcement of his premiership, a comprehensive package of measures encompassing everything from onshore wind and solar power to carbon taxes and heat pumps. “When global energy supplies are disrupted and weaponised by the likes of Putin, we have seen household bills soar and economic growth slow around the world,” said Sunak, of the “powering up Britain” energy package. “We have stepped in to shield people from its worst impacts by helping to pay around half the typical energy bill. But we are also stepping up to power Britain and ensure our energy security in the long term, with more affordable, clean energy from Britain, so we can drive down energy prices and grow our economy.” Yet, only a few days before, the plan was to hold the launch in Aberdeen, the oil and gas capital of the UK. Local businesses had been primed, oil and gas specialists were ready, shoving their minor interests in green alternatives – such as hydrogen – hastily to the fore, for an event to be hailed as “energy security day”. Fossil fuels would be a necessary part of that energy security, they had been assured. And, only a few days before that, the plan was not to foreground energy security at all – the event was to be called “green day”, and the focus would be clearly on renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling the climate crisis, as well as bringing down household bills through supporting clean power. Tom Burke, co-founder of the thinktank E3G, and a veteran government adviser, said the whirl of changes in the run-up to the launch were both bewildering and revealing. “This is a level of chaos that reveals the extent of the internal unresolved disputes within the party on these issues,” he said. “There is an anti-green faction in the Tory party, and this chaos has been all about them.” The energy strategy, running to well over a thousand pages across its reams of documents, covers everything from nuclear fusion – which some experts regard as an unconvincing distraction, when technology to cut emissions today should be the priority – to electric vehicle charging points. Sunak had little choice but to publish some form of strategy this week, as last year the high court ruled that the government’s existing strategy to meet its legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 was inadequate. The judge in the case, brought by Friends of the Earth and other campaigners, ordered a revamp by the end of this month, also the deadline for the government to publish its response to the review of net zero by Tory MP Chris Skidmore, published in January. To complete the package, the chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, decided to publish his strategy for green investment at the same time, setting out how the private sector is expected to fund the comprehensive overhaul of the UK’s economy needed to reach the net zero target. For the government, this marks a major cross-Whitehall operation, encompassing policy that spans the Department for Transport, Department for Levelling Up, Department for Business and Trade, and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as the Treasury and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Downing Street. The government’s focus is timely, given rapidly growing concerns that the UK is falling behind internationally, which have been given new urgency by the war in Ukraine and the soaring price of energy. The US is pushing forward strongly with its $369bn Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to make America a superpower for clean energy technologies and offers tax breaks to manufacturers. Europe, after initial outrage that it was losing its green leadership status, is now hard at work on its response. Hundreds of billions of euros of investment are at stake, and the sacred cow of state aid rules is likely to be slaughtered in pursuing them. So the key question is: does the UK’s new energy and climate package measure up to what other countries are planning? For most of the experts and campaigners delivering their verdict on Thursday, the answer was a clear no. Mel Evans, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, summed it up: “Ministers talk about leading the world, but the UK is not even making it to the starting blocks of the green tech race. A good government would go all in on renewable, efficient energy to give millions of people warm homes, clean air, lower bills and a safe climate – but powering Up Britain is a far cry from what this country needs.” Despite the support for offshore wind, the talk of electric vehicles and the focus on carbon capture, there were too many misses. Plans to insulate 300,000 homes were dismissed as puny, compared with the 14m that need upgrades. Onshore wind turbines are still, in effect, banned, despite small changes to the planning rules. Hydrogen is still being touted for home heating, despite studies showing it will not work. Solar panels will not be mandated on new-build housing, and the heat pump scheme is still flawed. Burke laid the blame at the door of a prime minister besieged by a warring party. “This feels like a party that is internally divided, that can’t come up with a coherent story, that can’t even agree what the story is,” he told the Guardian. “And this is what is spooking investors: this anti-green faction of losers who are going to turn the UK into a loser, in the global race for green prosperity.”",Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy; Rishi Sunak; Grant Shapps; Environment; Politics; UK news; Climate crisis,Environment
2023-02-26T09:00:18Z,Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton review – the root of all evil,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/26/birnam-wood-by-eleanor-catton-review-the-root-of-all-evil-luminaries-booker-prize,"In his great critical work The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode wrote about the end-directedness of fiction, the way that novels rehearse and forestall their endings – a process he called peripeteia. One thing he doesn’t discuss in that book is what happens when an ending entirely alters your understanding of the text. There are numerous examples of tricksy plot twists – think Fingersmith or Fight Club – but I’m not sure I’ve read a novel whose ending so brilliantly and brutally changes our perception of what has gone before as Birnam Wood, Eleanor Catton’s follow-up to her Booker-winning The Luminaries. For nine-tenths of its 400 pages, Birnam Wood comes across as a Kiwi Jonathan Franzen – a smart, satirical novel about the clash between a gardening collective and a scheming tech billionaire. There are numerous Franzen tropes here – countercultural/capitalist discord; the striving for ideological purity; the relentless and vampiric march of big business; environmental crisis. There’s even a rare bird – here it’s an orange-fronted parakeet. Birnam Wood is like a Franzen greatest hits album until its glorious, apocalyptic final pages enlarge and complicate our understanding of its message. Mira Bunting is one of the principal figures in Birnam Wood, founder of a group of guerrilla gardeners who tend 18 plots of vacant land around Christchurch and dream of self-sufficiency, which they describe as “breaking good”. Mira is 29 but, like many of her friends, appears trapped in an extended adolescence. She lives with Shelley Noakes, her “sensible, predictable, dependable sidekick”. Birnam Wood has grown into a thriving (if still decidedly loss-making) project, whose aims are to grow food and flowers while operating “as much as possible outside a capitalist framework”. Already, though, capitalism has sought to subsume projects like theirs. “Birnam Wood was now a startup, a pop-up, the brainchild of ‘creatives’; it was organic, it was local; it was a bit like Uber; it was a bit like Airbnb.” Mira and Shelley are resistant to this linguistic colonisation of their world, although they also recognise the need to make the project financially viable. That wish seems suddenly to be granted with the arrival of the charismatic, tracksuited billionaire Robert Lemoine. Lemoine’s company, Autonomo, builds drones and has recently embarked on a joint venture with a New Zealand pest control entrepreneur, Sir Owen Darvish. Lemoine has also bought the Darvish family home in Thorndike, a (fictional) mountain village in the (also fictional) Korowai national park. Lemoine claims that he’s just another “doomsteader” buying up a New Zealand bolthole. Instead, we learn that he has discovered rare earth minerals in the park and has begun mining them, a process that has already unleashed environmental devastation. Lemoine meets Mira as she’s out scouting for potential Birnam Wood planting sites. He offers her land and cash – the dream of “breaking good” seems to have arrived. Only Tony Gallo seems sceptical of the collective’s sudden good fortune. Tony, a co-founder of Birnam Wood who has been away travelling for several years, is horrified to find that capitalism has taken hold of the gardening project. He makes an impassioned speech at the group’s hui (meet-up) and is shown the door. The rage that energises him here, which he sums up later as anger “at the sheer inexorability of late-capitalist degradation not just of the environment, not just of civic institutions, not just of intellectual and political ideals, but worse, of his own expectations, of what he even felt was possible any more…” is the sustaining rage of the novel. Mira, Shelley and the rest of Birnam Wood (and, by extension, the reader) initially see Tony as a throwback, his views as incompatible with the new spirit of the collective. In fact, the events of the novel seem designed to assert definitively that there can be no accommodation between capitalism and projects that seek to deliver benefits that are communal, cooperative and non-financial. We are living in the age of the B Corp and caring capitalism, of ESG and green investment. Birnam Wood’s message, underlined in blood-red ink by its extraordinary conclusion, is that these attempts to shape a gentler form of capitalism are doomed to failure. Greed is not only not good, it is actively evil and aggressively expansionist. As Birnam Wood’s benevolent beginnings are warped and tainted by their association with big tech, we recognise that only by reclaiming the purity and radicalism of the group’s origins can Mira, Shelley and Tony hope to rescue it. Birnam Wood is a dark and brilliant novel about the violence and tawdriness of late capitalism. Its ending, though, propels it from a merely very good book into a truly great one.

The opening last Sunday of the long-delayed Olkiluoto 3 plant, Europe’s largest, means about 40% of Finland’s electricity demand will soon be met by nuclear power, which the government says will boost energy security and help it achieve its carbon neutrality targets. Across the Baltic Sea and just hours before the Finnish plant came on stream, Germany was finally pulling the plug on its last three nuclear power plants, shutting down the steaming towers of Isar II, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II reactors late on Saturday. The environmental group Greenpeace, at the heart of Germany’s long-lived and powerful anti-nuclear movement, organised a party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. “Finally, nuclear energy belongs to history,” it proclaimed. There are few clearer illustrations of Europe’s nuclear divide. One faction, led by Germany, argues that the costs are too high and the risks – from reactor accidents and toxic waste – are, as the Green environment minister, Steffi Lemke, put it, “ultimately unmanageable”. Another, headed by France, argues equally forcefully that nuclear power is a reliable, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for electricity, and that phasing it out as Europe tries to meet vital green targets is ecologically damaging and economically senseless. The debate is not new. But with a third of the bloc’s nuclear reactors nearing the end of their original lifespan by 2025, and a legally binding aim of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, it is becoming increasingly intense. The energy shock that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, which brought an end to cheap gas imports and led Germany to briefly delay closing its last nuclear plants, has only entrenched the divisions. “There’s a lot of posturing,” the centrist MEP Pascal Canfin, who chairs the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “Different member states have made very different choices and have very different positions – and interests. “There’s scope for convergence and compromise. But given the sheer quantity of additional electricity we will need, both sides have to recognise we need every available solution … We have to take the politics and ideology out of this.” According to Eurostat, 25.4% of the EU’s electricity was nuclear generated in 2021, with 100-odd reactors in 13 member states. France, which has 56 operable nuclear reactors, accounting for just over half of that total. The divide across the bloc, though, is stark. If France has the highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (almost 70%), followed by Slovakia (52.4%) and Belgium (50.6%), others hardly touch it. The Netherlands stands at barely 3%. Germany’s opposition to nuclear goes back a long way; it was the main issue behind the launch of the country’s Green movement. Major accidents at Three Mile Island, Chornobyl and Fukushima reinforced an essentially ideological conviction. Advocates of its “Energiewende” green transition plan note that the 46% share of its electricity generated by renewables is far greater than the share that was produced by nuclear when its phase-out was first announced in 1998. While its plan, aimed at winning long-term public and industry support, will increase fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in the short term (coal is due to be phased out by 2038 or earlier), Germany argues it will also stimulate renewables growth. Immediate energy supply concerns meant public opinion swung against the shutdown last weekend, but polls before the war in Ukraine showed broad support for the principle. Other countries hold similar views. Several have already phased out nuclear, or plan to do so. Italy shut all its plants in 1990, after a 1987 referendum (in a 2011 plebiscite, held weeks after the Fukushima disaster, 94% of voters rejected a government plan to reintroduce nuclear power). Belgium was planning to close the last of its seven reactors by 2025, but recently extended the life of the two newest for a further decade, saying they were “critical to our energy security”. Spain aims to phase out its five active plants by 2035. Other opponents include Portugal, Denmark and Austria – which, along with Luxembourg, is suing the European Commission for classing nuclear energy as a “bridge technology” on the path to net zero, and thus as a “green” investment. In the French-led pro-nuclear camp, meanwhile, are Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – which this year launched an alliance to boost nuclear cooperation within the bloc. Far from phasing out nuclear, Romania has doubled production in the last 15 years; Hungary and the Czech Republic have increased theirs by a fifth. Sweden is drafting a law to allow it to build more, while France aims to extend its plants’ life to 50 years and open at least six new ones by 2035. “Certain countries have made the extreme choice of turning their back on nuclear energy,” President Emmanuel Macron said when unveiling his plans in February. “Not France.” The country launched its nuclear programme after the 1973 oil crisis; a poll last year showed nearly 80% of voters support it, up 20 points from 2016. The nuclear standoff – at its most tense between France and Germany – has the potential to disrupt a range of vital EU projects, from changes to the bloc’s electricity market to the Green Deal programme supporting industry’s transition to net zero. For example, Paris and its central European allies have raged against a lack of support from Berlin for their efforts to have nuclear-derived hydrogen classified as “green” in EU legislation (so that it counts towards renewable energy targets). For Canfin, compromise will have to come through a general acceptance that renewable energy is “green” while nuclear energy is “low-carbon” – not fully green, because of its cost and risks, but also not “fossil”. “Text by text, we have to take the drama out of the question,” he said. “Behind the political slogans, there is starting to be convergence around the realities.” France and the “pro” camp now accept that only renewables are capable of boosting low-carbon electricity production short-term, Canfin said, while Germany is “evolving” to view nuclear as “part of the solution, not part of the problem”. A generational shift in Europe’s green movement – now driven more by concern about the climate crisis than, as was once the case, opposition to nuclear – should help, he said, with the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg criticising Germany’s shutdown as “a mistake”.",Nuclear power; Europe; Germany; France; Finland; Energy; Environment; World news; Energy industry; Business,Environment
2022-08-17T19:00:24Z,Doctors for Extinction Rebellion’s protest puts MCC deals in spotlight | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/doctors-for-extinction-rebellions-protest-puts-mcc-deals-in-spotlight,"The rain came to Lord’s just after two in the afternoon. As the players walked briskly from the pitch, and the spectators popped their umbrellas or started to scurry for cover, a huge orange banner dropped down from the top tier of the Edrich Stand. “JP Morgan,” it read. “Stop bankrolling new oil and gas”. The font “JP Morgan” was written in matched the one used on the sponsored hoardings either side. The firm, which is the world’s leading investor in the exploration of new fossil fuels, has been MCC’s main corporate partner for the past decade and its branding is plastered all over the ground. It wasn’t the first time there’s been a protest at Lord’s, but it was the first in a long while when anyone has managed to smuggle a banner in past the stewards or, perhaps, been willing to pay for tickets to do it. Protesters here in recent years have tended to stay outside the gates, or in one case, in 2008, chained themselves to them. It was all very polite. The man and woman behind it, Chris Newman and Alice Clack, who are both members of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion, explained that they had timed it so it wouldn’t interrupt play, because they didn’t want to ruin everyone’s day. Which meant they were less of a nuisance than the portly MCC member sitting in front of the pavilion, who held up the game when his garish egg-and-bacon blazer distracted Ben Stokes from his batting. The stewards told him to take it off. They took the banner down too, then escorted Newman and Clack out of the ground. “They were,” Newman said, “very kind about it.” So, the banner wasn’t up long, but it didn’t need to be to embarrass MCC, who make great play of their green credentials. They released this statement later in the day: “MCC puts sustainability at the forefront of its running of the club, as conveyed within our environmental, social and governance strategy, and which has seen Lord’s operate on 100% renewable energy since 2016, amongst many other initiatives. JP Morgan is a principal partner and longstanding supporter of MCC and cricket at Lord’s and we are working with them, as we do with all of our partners, on aligning with the club’s own environmental values.” JP Morgan’s press office was on, too. Oddly, their statement didn’t mention the $81bn they invested in fossil fuels in 2020-21, or that they had increased their financing of coal production from $1.28bn to $3.8bn in that same period. “In 2021, we facilitated more than $100bn for green activities like renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation, doubled our green investment banking activity and were the largest underwriter of green bonds,” JP Morgan’s spokesman said. “These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1tn for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet. We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 …” etc and so on. So that’s probably enough of that, let’s get back to Newman and Clack. They said the people around them in the stands applauded their banner when they unfurled it, then cheered again when Clack pulled it back from the stewards after they had hauled it in. “We’re not radicals. We’re just trying to do what’s appropriate,” said Clack. “JP Morgan uses these sponsorships [and Lord’s isn’t the only one, there’s also the Commonwealth Games and the National Portrait Gallery] to sanitise their image when the reality is that they’re the world’s leading financier of the expansion of fossil fuels.” Clack compares it to the advertising money spent by the tobacco industry, and cricket, of course, has history there too, with the John Player League and the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and all the rest. “This is blood money, and we need to start calling it that.” “How do you push back against that?” Clack asked. “JP Morgan pays insane amounts of money to plaster their logo all over this ground. We don’t have hundreds of thousands of pounds to run a counter-advertising campaign. We’ve barely got the £150 to buy a ticket to come here to hang our banner up for five minutes.” They’d heard all those PR lines already. “We know they’re doing a lot of green investment,” Newman said. “Well, great, but it’s like giving someone poison and then being proud you’ve also provided a small amount of the antidote.” The same goes for MCC. They are powered entirely by wind‑generated electricity, they don’t send any waste to landfill, and their own sustainability manager, Dr Russell Seymour, contributed the foreword to the recent Hit For Six report on the impact of climate change on the game. They’re right to be proud of all that. Which shouldn’t stop them from being embarrassed about what they’ve got wrong.",England v South Africa 2022; Cricket; Sport; England cricket team; South Africa cricket team; Climate crisis,Sport
2023-07-10T07:49:50Z,"As Thames Water sinks, Macquarie Group continues its unstoppable rise ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/10/as-thames-water-sinks-macquarie-group-continues-its-unstoppable-rise,"In the UK it will soon be possible to leave your rented home, travel on a motorway en route to the airport and get on a plane, all of which are leased, owned or managed by Macquarie Group. But as Macquarie’s reach into the framework of British life expands, it is the plight of one of its former utilities that is drawing attention to the stewardship of the prominent asset manager. Six years after the Australian company sold its remaining stake in Thames Water, the consequences of a high debt load accumulated under its watch, and arguably inadequate investment, are clearly visible. There are regular leaks of raw sewage, polluting waterways, affecting farms and households, and killing birds and fish. In the past fortnight, Thames Water chief executive Sarah Bentley has abruptly resigned while government officials have held emergency talks amid concerns over the water company’s ability to continue operating. On Monday, Thames said it had secured £750m in funding from shareholders to run to March 2025, and it would need a further £2.5bn over the following five years. Bosses said extreme weather had put “unprecedented pressure” on its network. The crisis engulfing Britain’s largest water utility serving 15 million people is raising serious questions over whether the UK should expand its relationship with the “Macquarie way”. Dividend payout Macquarie’s ties to the UK are deep, given it was set up as a subsidiary to the British merchant bank Hill Samuel &amp; Co in 1969, before obtaining an Australian banking licence in the 1980s. Its robustness now stands in stark contrast to the ill health of Thames Water, which is showing the strains of an increase in debt from £3.4bn to £10.8bn during the Macquarie consortium-led ownership from 2006 to 2017. Macquarie says it supported the utility to invest more than £11bn in its network, representing the highest per customer investment level of all water companies in England and Wales. “That level of investment exceeds annual investment levels both before and since our ownership,” it says. Meanwhile, Macquarie has enjoyed near uninterrupted profit growth over more than a decade to become a global heavyweight in infrastructure and funds management, commodities trading and investment banking, and has no obvious single competitor. It can compete with Goldman Sachs on an investment banking deal at the same time as it spars with BP over gas trading in the US, and jostles with the Commonwealth Bank for Australian home loans. “They are not limited in what they do; they are always looking to capitalise on whatever opportunities present themselves,” says Omkar Joshi, chief investment officer at Sydney-based Opal Capital Management. “The main thing that really drives them is an entrepreneurial culture. They deploy capital to different opportunities and, in reality, many of them won’t work – but some of them will work really well.” Macquarie has had enormous success buying public infrastructure and placing it in their funds. It can then charge fees, and receive dividends for its part-ownership, as well as enjoy any increase in the asset price. Estimates have put dividends paid to underlying investors, including itself, for Thames Water at £2.7bn over the 11-year period it oversaw the asset. “The dividend yield to equity shareholders earned from our funds’ investment was in line with listed UK water utility companies,” Macquarie says. “At all times during our ownership the regulated entity of Thames Water maintained an investment grade credit rating.” Winter storms Macquarie is well known for taking advantage of volatile markets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it bet big on non-investment grade loans, known as junk debt. The debt was cheap, but the quality was decent and the returns turned out to be excellent. While that part of the business was pared back when the opportunity faded, Macquarie’s commodities trading unit has since grown to generate well over half the company’s earnings, aided by rising prices linked to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the US, Macquarie is accused of manipulating the price of natural gas to profit from winter storms that froze large swathes of the country in early 2021. Its energy business buys natural gas and moves it along pipelines and grids, typically from areas where usage is low to high-demand markets. A lawsuit filed by the Kansas attorney general alleges that Macquarie bought gas at an inflated price in a bid to influence key benchmarks for setting prices – an allegation the Australian company denies. Macquarie is seeking to have the matter dismissed. Macquarie has previously said it helps move gas to markets facing extreme weather conditions to relieve pressure on households. The winter storm trading period turned out to be significant for Macquarie, boosting its overall profit with a reported windfall of at least A$270m (£140m). Millionaire’s factory The group has long been tagged the “millionaire’s factory”, but the descriptor now severely underplays the riches its staff can generate for shareholders, and themselves. The head of Macquarie’s commodities and global markets division, Nick O’Kane, earned A$57.6m last financial year. The previous year his pay was A$36m. His pay packet far exceeds even that of the company’s chief executive, Shemara Wikramanayake, who is the highest paid CEO in Australia with A$32.8m over a 12-month period. It may seem odd that the CEO is not always the highest paid employee at Macquarie, but it makes sense for a performance-obsessed company that rewards executives who drive profits. Martin Stanley, Macquarie’s former head of asset management, whose division oversaw Thames Water transactions, earned A$19.6m in 2021, the year he stepped down from the role. Stanley nows lives in a £2.5m house with swimming pool in Suffolk in the UK. Macquarie has a reputation in the analyst community for being a “black box”, given it is difficult to analyse the details of its disparate business units, let alone forecast returns. The profit drivers also jump around from year to year. “There is an element of trust that it will meet its forecasts, which it invariably does,” says one analyst. Thames debts Thames Water is now the most indebted water company rated by Standard &amp; Poor’s, with leverage exceeding 80%, most of which accrued under Macquarie’s tenure. More than half the company’s debt is inflation-linked, as at the end of last year, which does not bode well for this current period of escalating costs. Critics point to the privatisation of the UK water industry more than three decades ago, which was supposed to usher in a new era of investment, more competitive bills and improved water quality, as the source of the problem. Groups such as the Macquarie consortium came in and used securitisation models – which allow the owners to unlock more financing – to raise the debt-to-equity ratio to levels unanticipated at privatisation. “From what I can see it seems that this is absolutely the root of the problem,” says Kate Bayliss, of the economics department at Soas, University of London. “We had such a naive and benign perspective of what we thought the private sector would do when the regulations were conceptualised … Financial wizardry is seen as a good thing, but it’s impenetrable, near impossible to understand the structures from the outside.” Macquarie sold its final stake in Thames in 2017, the same year it snapped up the government’s Green Investment Bank for £2.3bn despite concerns taxpayers were being shortchanged. Its exit from Thames Water proved to be well timed. Days after the sale was announced in March 2017, the utility was hit with a then record fine of £20.3m linked to huge leaks of untreated sewage for offences in 2013 and 2014. A judge described the environmental breaches as “wicked”, while noting a “continual failure to report incidents” and “history of non-compliance”. In the ensuing years the leaks at Thames Water have continued, its financial position has worsened and political pressure has increased. “They had impeccable timing,” says Bayliss. “They are very good at what they do.” Macquarie was then allowed to wade back into the UK water industry in 2021, buying a majority stake in the troubled Southern Water. But, five years on, its links to Thames are still apparent. After Bentley’s departure, existing directors Alastair Cochran and Cathryn Ross were hastily promoted to become joint chief executives. Not only is Ross a former CEO of industry regulator Ofwat, which scrutinised Thames’ financial position, but since 2019 she has also held a directorship on the board of National Gas Transmission, the £7.5bn gas network and metering business bought by a consortium led by Macquarie from National Grid last year. Meanwhile, former Aviva chairman Sir Adrian Montague, has been brought in as Thames’ new chair, replacing Ian Marchant. Since 2017, he has been chairman of Cadent, Britain’s biggest gas distribution network which is owned by a consortium led by Macquarie.

2023-03-12T07:00:44Z,Labour planning £8bn Biden-style green energy revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/12/labour-planning-8bn-green-revolution-for-uk-industry-in-deprived-regions,"The Labour party is planning to put the UK at the head of a worldwide green industrial revolution, with a massive US-style, public-private investment scheme targeted at the most deprived regions. In an interview with the Observer, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, who will travel to Washington in May to meet senior Democrats, says a Labour government will follow the model of US president Joe Biden’s hugely ambitious regional recovery plan, using the climate crisis as the catalyst for economic revival. She says Labour’s new national wealth fund, to be endowed with an initial £8bn of funding from the state but which it is hoped will then pull in private investment, will be given a specific remit to focus on green industrial revival in deprived areas with regional targets to create hundreds of thousands of jobs outside London and the south-east. Ahead of the spring budget on Wednesday, in which the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will be under pressure to prevent an exodus of UK green industries to the US and the EU – both of which are preparing incentives to lure green firms from overseas – both Labour and the Tories are determined to ensure the UK will not be left behind. Hunt is set to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions in the budget, as well as plans to boost the nuclear sector with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Many UK companies, Reeves said, were desperate to invest in areas such as offshore wind, tidal energy, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, but feared that without government backing – on a partnership model like that pioneered by Biden in his Inflation Reduction Act – they “would not get off the ground”. “The Tories are the last people in town believing that the ‘laissez faire’ approach of leaving it all to the market can work. Everyone else recognises that, in a world of such huge change and increased competition between nations for this investment, you have to have this partnership approach,” she said. “All of this is up for grabs, no-one is doing a lot of this stuff at scale yet. We could be global leaders in some of this. There is a real urgency because growth is so low. This would be real levelling up, where the government has failed. We have got a serious plan and we just want a chance to get on and get started with it.” Several key UK-based companies are now examining where best to operate. Jaguar Land Rover’s owner, Tata Motors, has reportedly asked the UK government for more than £500m in state subsidies to build a battery factory in Somerset, a move seen as crucial to the future of the entire British car industry. Reeves said: “The government said we were going to get electric vehicle production and batteries here but we haven’t and Jaguar Land Rover (Britain’s biggest car maker) are on the verge of making a really big decision. It is crucial that batteries are produced by JLR in Britain or, as night follows day, more car production will move overseas.” In January, the UK battery start-up Britishvolt collapsed into administration, with the majority of its 300 staff made redundant after talks about rescue bids failed. The company’s efforts to build a large facility near Blyth came unstuck as it struggled to find a cash injection to pursue the project. It has now been bought by an Australian company. Labour has already committed to investing £28bn a year – or £224bn over its first eight years in government – on climate measures. Reeves says it will aim to create 450,000 new jobs over a decade from green industrial projects – in which the UK public will have a stake – including 50,000 in the north-west and Yorkshire, and 30,000 in the north-east, the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the east of England. Reeves is planning to meet key architects of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) during her May visit and make a speech from there to “show the UK can deliver global leadership on climate change, on new industries and on the future of economic thinking”. Biden’s IRA was signed into law in August last year and aims to spur investment in green technology by devoting billions of dollars in subsidies through grants, loans and tax credits to public and private entities. It has a strong focus on electric vehicles and the battery industry. Since it was announced it has drawn investment into areas such as Michigan, a rust belt state, where Ford has revealed plans to build a $3.5bn electric vehicle battery plant that would create 2,500 jobs. The company explicitly referenced the Biden legislation as being a factor in its decision to locate there instead of Canada or Mexico. The EU is expected to unveil more details this week of its net-zero industry act, which is also designed to lead to a big acceleration of green technology in EU member states, with recent changes to state aid rules also in the pipeline. The Institute for Directors recently called for a UK version of the Inflation Reduction Act to “incentivise much-needed green investment” and prevent the UK being left behind. Reeves said: “The exciting thing about some of the new industries of the future, whether it is floating offshore wind, or carbon capture and storage, or green hydrogen, is that they are going to create good jobs in places outside London and the south-east, in former industrial areas, in coastal communities. We are taking inspiration from president Biden and the US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen.”",Green economy; Labour; Rachel Reeves; Climate crisis; Renewable energy; Energy; Energy industry; Joe Biden; European Union; Environment; Politics; UK news,Environment
2023-03-20T18:00:06Z,"World can still avoid worst of climate collapse with genuine change, IPCC says ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/20/ipcc-says-world-can-avoid-worst-of-climate-breakdown-if-it-acts-now,"Avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown is still possible, and there are “multiple, feasible and effective options” for doing so, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said. Hoesung Lee, chair of the body, which is made up of the world’s leading climate scientists, made clear that – despite the widespread damage already being caused by extreme weather, and the looming threat of potentially catastrophic changes – the future was still humanity’s to shape. “[The IPCC reports] clearly show that humanity has the knowhow and the technology to tackle human-induced climate change. But not only that. They show that we have the capacity to build a much more prosperous, inclusive and equitable society in this process. “Tackling climate change is a hard, complex and enduring challenge for generations. We, the scientific community, spell out the facts of disheartening reality, but we also point to the prospects of hope through concerted, genuine and global transformational change.” Finance would be key, he said. The shift to a low-carbon economy would take between three and six times the amounts of funding currently devoted to green investment, according to the final section of the IPCC’s comprehensive sixth assessment report (AR6) of human knowledge of the climate. Climate justice would also be vital, the IPCC said, because the people being hit hardest by the impacts of the crisis were the poorest and most vulnerable who have done least to cause the problem. Aditi Mukherji, one of the 93 authors of the “synthesis report”, the final section that draws together the key findings, said: “Almost half the world’s population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions.” This positive framing of a report that makes mostly very grim reading was a deliberate counterblast to the many voices that have said the world has little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the threshold beyond which many of the impacts of the crisis will rapidly become irreversible. Chris Jones, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, a member of the report’s core writing team, pointed out that emissions fell by 6% in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 lockdowns, and a similar fall would be needed each year for the next decade. “The scale of the challenge is massive,” he said. “If we keep emitting at the current rate, the carbon budget for 1.5C will be exhausted by 2030.” Monday’s publication may be the last this decade from the IPCC, which was set up in 1988 to assess global knowledge of the climate and advise on how human actions have been changing it. The IPCC AR6 report, which was delayed slightly owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, was published in three main sections from August 2021 to April 2022. The first three sections covered the underlying science of the climate system, the impacts of climate breakdown and the ways of tackling or reducing the problem, followed by Monday’s synthesis chapter drawing the previous three together. IPCC scientists and climate experts emphasised that this decade would be crucial, as decisions made now would affect the future of the planet for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate official, said: “We are in a critical decade for climate action. Global emissions need to be reduced by nearly 43% by 2030 for the world to achieve the Paris agreement’s goal to limit global temperature rise to 2C and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. The synthesis report highlights just how far off-track we are.” But he added: “It’s not too late. The IPCC clearly demonstrates that it is possible to limit global warming to 1.5C with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors of the global economy. It has given us many feasible, effective and low-cost mitigation and adaptation options to scale up across sectors and countries.” The message of action, rather than despair, was also taken up by the UN secretary-general, António Guterres. He called for countries to adopt an “acceleration agenda” involving all of the G20, the world’s biggest developed and developing countries. Developed countries must bring forward their commitments on reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, from 2050 to “as close as possible to 2040”, said Guterres. Emerging economies, many of which have set net zero targets for the second half of this century, must also bring them forward, to “as close as possible” to 2050, he urged. This would require a major revision by some of the world’s biggest emitters: China currently has a target of before 2060, and India of 2070. Guterres also called for developed countries to phase out coal by 2030, and all others by 2040. He called for no new licensing or funding of oil and gas projects, based on the findings of the International Energy Agency that all new oil and gas development must cease for the world to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Achieving this will be a stretch, and many governments are likely to ignore these pleas, at least in the short term. Many experts were keen to point out that the price of renewable energy technology has fallen rapidly, making it a more attractive investment. But oil and gas companies have also been enjoying a record bonanza, and many are planning to reinvest the proceeds in more fossil fuels. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change in the UK, said: “António Guterres is right to say that we need to rapidly increase the pace and urgency of the fight against the climate crisis. “In Britain, we have a Conservative government whose net zero strategy is so bad that it has been declared unlawful. The tragedy is that the Conservatives are holding us back from reaping the benefits of the green transition – lower energy bills, millions of good jobs, and a livable future for our children and grandchildren. “Labour will make Britain world leader in tackling the climate crisis, with our plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower by 2030, and by leading a clean power alliance across the world to create cleaner, greener energy.”",Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; World news; Climate science; Fossil fuels; Extreme weather; UK news; Green politics; United Nations,Environment
2022-11-16T12:51:20Z,SSE profits more than triple as UK energy prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/16/sse-profits-more-than-triple-as-uk-energy-prices-soar-windfall-tax,"The electricity generator and network company SSE has reported a more than tripling of profits thanks to soaring energy prices – a day before the government is expected to expand a windfall tax on the power sector. The company, which is based in Perth, Scotland, and runs gas-fired power stations alongside hydroelectric plants and windfarms, reported a 221% increase in adjusted pre-tax profits year on year to £559m in the six months to the end of September. SSE has benefited from an increase in gas prices in the UK since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The publication of the soaring financial performance at the firm, which in May significantly upgraded its profits forecast for this year, comes a day before the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is forecast to announce a 40% windfall tax on “excess returns” being made by electricity generators. Last month, analysts estimated that profits at the world’s seven biggest energy companies had soared by £150bn so far in 2022. SSE attempted to play down the profits increase by saying it invested a record £1.7bn on energy security and sustainable energy projects. “Cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy is coming, it just needs to be built, and SSE is building at pace,” Alistair Phillips-Davies, the chief executive, said. “With a supportive government policy environment, SSE alone could invest more than £24bn in Great Britain by the end of this decade.” Phillips-Davies said SSE’s investment plans would create “tens of thousands” of jobs and “deliver greater financial security to families and improved energy security for everyone”. Asked about his view on the potential windfall tax, he said: “In terms of levies, caps, windfall taxes – if they’re fair and reasonable, fine. One of the things we’ve got to be careful of in the UK … we’ve got one of the best renewable green investment markets in the world, we’ve created the biggest offshore wind market in the world, it’s critical that we don’t endanger that. “Particularly when all of that investment is going to be delivering energy through this decade at far, far lower costs than we’re currently importing energy.” Research released on Wednesday by the Energy and Utilities Alliance showed the public is supportive of windfall taxes. A survey of 2,000 adults revealed 79% support a windfall tax on the excess profits of energy producers compared with under 5% who were opposed. SSE, which said its profits were largely fuelled by higher revenue from its gas-fired plants, said its renewable energy output was affected by inclement weather during the reporting period. The company said operating profits in its thermal division, which includes gas-fired power plants, had increased by 178% to £100.4m because of the “higher and more volatile gas and power market price environment”. Its gas storage arm recorded a 415% rise in profits to £147.8m, driven by the volatile conditions. Its new gas-fired power station in North Lincolnshire, Keadby 2, will be operational on 19 December and is planned to be “Europe’s most-efficient gas plant”. However, Philips-Davies said the company had written off £2.4bn on its gas storage and generation business over the last decade. “We’ve definitely seen an uptick in profitability for that but that is definitely against a number of years where we’ve seen suppressed or, in the case of gas storage, no profitability whatsoever.” The company is in the process of selling a 25% stake in its power transmission assets to raise cash to build more renewables generation as it focuses on wind and hydropower in Scotland. SSE said it expected to reach a sale agreement “in the coming weeks”. It is also constructing the Seagreen offshore windfarm, which will be the world’s largest, and developing a pumped hydropower plant at Coire Glas in the Highlands. The completion of the project has been delayed from April into next summer.",SSE; Energy industry; Business; Utilities; UK news; Scotland; Jeremy Hunt; Politics; Wind power; Energy; Environment; Renewable energy; Gas,Business

As onlookers seek to read the environmental signals being sent by Truss’s new appointments, there has been particular interest in the ideas of Matthew Sinclair, who published Let Them Eat Carbon in 2011. With the subtitle “The price of failing climate policies and how governments and big business profit from them”, the book sets out to tackle what Sinclair calls “the burgeoning climate change industry”. In the book, he argues that climate change policies “push up electricity bills, make it more expensive to drive to work or fly away on holiday, put manufacturing workers out of a job – they sometimes even make your food more expensive”. He worries that the money directed towards climate change is going into the pockets of special interest groups around the world, into “dodgy projects” and “entire new organisations in the public sector”. He does not dispute the science, and agrees that in the short term changes in global temperature are likely to be disruptive, but suggests that perhaps it may be best for humanity to simply get used to new temperatures, arguing: “There is no particular reason to think the particular balance of the ecosystem right now is necessarily the best for us. “Current environmental policies in many countries will do huge harm to the economy while having little or no effect on carbon emissions.” In his former role as director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, a thinktank that is part of a rightwing network that promotes free-market capitalism around the world, he campaigned against green taxes. In a six-point plan to cut Whitehall spending, published in 2012, he said cancelling high-speed rail services could produce more than £750m in savings, and also proposed scrapping the Green Investment Bank, which was set up to address the shortfall in investment in the energy sector. He said this could save £2.7bn. In 2016, he declared on the subject on insulation: “I worry about the health impacts of super-warm homes” and said it was his opinion that the UK has “pushed energy efficiency too far, too fast”. Environmental campaigners have also expressed alarm that Truss appointed Jacob Rees-Mogg as business secretary, as he has a poor record on the environment. In the past, Rees-Mogg has claimed that “climate alarmism” is responsible for high energy prices and that it is unrealistic for scientists to project future changes to the climate because meteorologists struggle to correctly predict the weather.",Liz Truss; Politics; Climate crisis; Climate science; Environment; UK news,Politics
2022-11-25T10:52:40Z,Rishi Sunak switches priorities to sealing up holes in a sinking ship,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/25/rishi-sunak-priorities-sealing-holes-sinking-ship,"When Rishi Sunak was chancellor, Treasury aides and ministers said he was deeply entrenched in the detail, able to refer to spreadsheets or reports by chapter number by heart. The job of prime minister is a very different one, which his closest aides in No 10 say he is starting to understand means choosing very specific priorities. Sunak has suggested to MPs who have seen him recently that he has three main priorities for his premiership: stabilising the economy, tackling small boat crossings in the Channel, and easing the pressures on the NHS. The striking thing about those priorities are that none are Sunak’s own vision or even really his choosing. It is government as management – almost the opposite of Liz Truss, who governed by ideology above all else. But Sunak’s managerial style is probably his only survival route as the severity of the crises will affect the next two years of his premiership. There is precious little in the autumn statement that tells us anything about Sunak’s ideas for growth, with investment zones heavily diluted, planning reforms at a standstill, and an unwillingness to pursue green investment including maintaining the ban on onshore wind. For the most part, he is acting like a prime minister who has grasped that he is likely to have just two years in No 10 and precious little time to build a legacy other than sealing up some holes in a sinking boat. That sense of a government in pure survival mode has filtered out to Conservative MPs – who are adopting their own tactics. Some have checked out entirely, seen in the muted response to the autumn statement, where Conservative MPs nodded through the tax rises having previous railed against them under Boris Johnson. Others are ditching any pretence at appeal to anything other than their own local issues. The most obvious illustration of that is a big rebellion brewing on the levelling up bill, where almost 50 MPs have signed a move to abolish all housing targets. Labour will not back the amendment and in normal times a government could face down the rebels and tell them where to go. But sources in the department as well as MPs have suggested that the prime minister is not prepared to risk another hole in the boat. His authority rests on being the consensus choice as prime minister; he derives his mandate solely from MPs. If Sunak should lose his parliamentary majority at an early vote – and have to rely on Labour – then he effectively no longer has his mandate. So MPs expect a compromise to be found on housebuilding targets, which could lead to further economic paralysis. There are many other issues where this could continue to trip up Sunak – the online harms bill where MPs, including some in his own cabinet, have expressed concerns about “legal but harmful” definitions of content in the bill. Another rebellion is brewing on onshore wind – backed by Boris Johnson, Truss and her levelling up secretary Simon Clarke, as well as MPs across the party. And that row could run on longer, with the MP Chris Skidmore delivering a net zero review in early January. Sunak must also soon decide what to do with the energy price freeze – for homes and businesses – when the scheme comes to an end in April and with predictions still of eye-watering rises. There is also still no letup in MPs’ anger about small boats crossing the Channel – and the necessity of housing refugees in more and more hotels, meaning the accommodation is in some MPs’ constituencies for the first time. And the NHS has not yet reached the peak of the winter crisis, with suggestions already that the government needs to consider military assistance for the health service or reopening Nightingale hospitals. All of those issues must be tackled before Sunak can even start to think about what his own agenda might be. But he also then faces the prospect at the next election of having precious little to say – beyond spelling out even more spending cuts.",Rishi Sunak; Politics; Conservatives; Economic policy; Immigration and asylum; NHS; Society; UK news; Health,Politics
2022-10-26T17:57:09Z,The Guardian view on Sunak v Starmer: time to get real | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/26/the-guardian-view-on-sunak-v-starmer-time-to-get-real,"Forget Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder – Westminster is braced for its own epic bout: “weird guy” versus “centrist dad”. At least, that is how advisers to Sir Keir Starmer would like it framed: the super-wealthy and preternaturally young new prime minister versus their reliably grownup leader. If Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions is any guide, Labour ministers will need to deepen and broaden their attack. It’s not that they lack for material, served up in a reliably adult manner by the leader of the opposition. From Rishi Sunak’s non-dom wife to his reappointment of Suella Braverman to the very office she quit in disgrace just last week, all was present and correct. One can see in this the germ of this winter’s political debate – and the two big problems with it. Not only did Mr Sunak have his guard up, he’d brought his own parries. In the new prime minister’s view, his rival is a north London remainer who worships Jeremy Corbyn. Missing from this tired ding-dong between Sir Forensic and a reedy, dweeby understudy of Boris Johnson was the fact that the vast majority of voters are suffering a vicious squeeze on their living standards. Meanwhile, pubs and churches are setting themselves up as warm hubs, so that people who can’t afford to heat their homes do not freeze this winter. Hospitals in Leicester have started food banks for their own workers. Not only does the parliamentary pantomime ring particularly hollow in this brutal winter, but the post-2020 dynamic of Labour competence against Conservative culture war is over. To rehash an old rule of politics: it’s the economic crisis, stupid. And neither Mr Sunak nor Sir Keir is prepared. In fairness to the new prime minister, he has got one thing right. By putting off the next budget until mid-November, he has given his government breathing and thinking space to make more serious fiscal plans. The bad news is he plans another disastrous round of austerity. Wednesday’s most telling challenge came from the SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, who asked for a guarantee that benefits would rise in line with inflation – a guarantee the prime minister refused to give. This will drive to destitution some of the lowest-paid Britons, as recognised by a Tory chancellor who just a few months back swore benefits would be linked to inflation. That chancellor was none other than Mr Sunak. The odds-on favourite to be the next prime minister is of course Sir Keir, and it is natural that he will be asked more and more what he would do differently. So far, the honest answer is: we don’t know. Labour has a £28bn-a-year green investment package and a pledge to scrap the non-dom tax loophole. But it needs to do more on wealth taxes, and it should argue that spending cuts amid a recession are madness. Far better to protect benefits and public servants’ wages, and to lay out plans to grow the economy. Given how fast food prices are rising, it should also guarantee meals for schoolchildren – in and out of term. Oppositions don’t win elections, it is often said; governments lose them. From Boris Johnson to Liz Truss, through parties and lobbying scandals and foolhardy budgets, this government has done its level best to lose the next election. Now it’s up to Labour to prove why it should win. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and more than 80,000 injured in five months of fighting in Ukraine, an acceleration in already heavy losses for Moscow, US intelligence officials estimate. Most of the troops were killed in brutal trench warfare for the small eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia has repeatedly claimed it was on the brink of capturing, White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said when he revealed the new estimate yesterday, writes Emma Graham-Harrison. “Russia’s attempt at an offensive in the Donbas, largely through Bakhmut, has failed … Russia has been unable to seize any really strategically significant territory,” Kirby said. The losses are an acceleration in Russian casualties even from the bloody first days of the war, and overshadow some of the bloodiest allied battles of the second world war, Kirby added. That includes the Guadalcanal campaign, the first major allied offensive against Japan, which also lasted five months. How were the losses calculated? Kirby did not detail how the US calculated Russia’s losses, but said about half of those who died were fighting under the Wagner mercenary group rather than with the Russian military. They were being sent into battle without proper training or leadership, he added. What’s happening on the ground in Ukraine? Ukrainian forces are still holding out in a corner of Bakhmut. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, said yesterday “the situation is quite difficult”, but Ukrainian forces are still counterattacking against Russians. ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton quits Google and warns of dangers of misinformation The man often touted as the godfather of AI has quit Google, citing concerns over the flood of fake information, videos and photos online and the possibility for AI to upend the job market. Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who with two of his students at the University of Toronto built a neural net in 2012, quit Google this week, the New York Times reported. Hinton, 75, said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field. He was brought on by Google a decade ago to help develop the company’s AI technology. Hinton’s research led the way for systems such as ChatGPT. He told the New York Times that until last year he believed Google had been a “proper steward” of the technology, but that changed once Microsoft started incorporating a chatbot into its Bing search engine, and the company began becoming concerned about the risk to its search business. Some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”, he told the BBC, warning they could become more intelligent than humans and could be exploited by “bad actors”. What else did Hinton say? “I’ve come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we’re developing is very different from the intelligence we have. So it’s as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learned something, everybody automatically knew it. And that’s how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.” In other news … Thousands of film and television writers are to go on strike, throwing Hollywood into turmoil as the entertainment business grapples with seismic changes triggered by the global streaming TV boom.

Sanders expressed that belief in an exchange on Friday evening with the host of Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace? on HBO Max. Wallace had asked Sanders about the general assertion in his book It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism that billionaires should not exist. “Are you basically saying that once you get to $999m that the government should confiscate all the rest?” Matthews asked the US senator from Vermont, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats and has helped them attain their slim majority in the upper congressional chamber. “Yeah,” Sanders replied. “You may disagree with me but, fine, I think people can make it on $999m.

Climate check: Green investment funds pushing money into fossil fuel firms, research finds Investment funds branded as green or socially responsible are being used by some of the world’s largest asset managers to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in fossil fuel companies, according to a report. The research, by the Common Wealth thinktank, showed that the US fund managers BlackRock and State Street and the UK-based Legal &amp; General were among asset managers to use funds with an “environment, social and governance” (ESG) label to invest in fossil fuel firms. The leftwing thinktank said despite claims that ESG funds offered a green and socially responsible option for investors, “the research shows these funds are significantly exposed to fossil fuel companies”. Between February and April this year, BlackRock, State Street and Legal &amp; General alone were found to hold $1bn (£800m) in bonds issued by fossil fuel companies in their ESG funds.

Pretty said that the resemblance was so marked that many had presumed the image was fake. “People don’t believe it’s real.

2023-01-26T08:00:53Z,Biden’s clean energy brainwave paves Britain’s way to post-Brexit growth. Dare we copy him? | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/26/joe-biden-clean-energy-britain-brexit-growth-us-eu-uk,"Stagnation nation. That’s an apt two-word description of the UK, where after 15 years of sluggish economic performance the prospect is for a shallow recession this year. Politicians know they have a problem. In the past 13 years, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak have all proposed different ways of fixing things, none of which have moved the dial that much. Jeremy Hunt says his budget, on 15 March will be all about growth, but don’t hold your breath. One suggested remedy for curing the UK’s economic ills that will certainly not be tried any time soon is rejoining the EU. There are those who argue that Britain should go down this route, but they don’t include either Sunak or Keir Starmer. The opposition leader and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, say they want to secure better relations with the EU, but under a future Labour government there would be no attempt to be part of the single market or the customs union, let alone an application for full membership. With both the main parties committed to making Brexit work, the search is on for policies that will not just get the economy moving again but do so in a way that spreads the benefits of growth to the left-behind parts of the country. They could start by taking a look at what Joe Biden is doing on the other side of the Atlantic with his Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is a bit of a misnomer since it has little to do with tackling the cost of living in the US. Instead, it offers subsidies to companies that set up clean energy plants in the US and generous tax credits for consumers who buy new electric vehicles produced there. It represents protectionism on a grand scale, and it was the talk of Davos last week. In the heyday of the drive to open up markets in the 1990s and early 2000s, the IRA would have been universally condemned by those attending the World Economic Forum’s annual talkfest. But those days are over, at least for now. The trend is towards deglobalisation, with production either on-shored or sited in a country deemed to be friendly. Tellingly, there were plenty of Davos attendees who strongly backed the IRA. Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary said it was a “historically positive measure”. France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said it was a good thing the US was providing incentives for investment in climate-friendly technology, and that Europe should do the same. The EU will find it difficult to emulate what Biden has done, because it is not a fiscal union, but the European Commission has plans for a new fund to boost green investment, and will relax the rules on state aid, which are designed to promote a level playing field across member states. Having initially raised concerns about the discriminatory nature of the IRA, the EU seems to have come round to an if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them approach. This makes sense. While the EU could clearly take a case to the World Trade Organization over Biden’s use of subsidies, the bigger picture is that it is welcome news that the US is getting serious about tackling global heating. If the IRA encourages other countries to do likewise, all well and good. That list of countries ought to include the UK. The head of the CBI, Tony Danker, said earlier this week that it was possible for the UK to lead the world on green growth but only with a change of mindset. Britain, he said was “on the verge of being relegated from the Champions League by the Americans and the Europeans: both [are] in an arms race to win global market share. Not only are they spending money, they’re abandoning regulatory barriers including state aid to win the prize! That’s a lesson for us on what it means to go big.” Unfortunately, the current UK government is thinking small. Grant Shapps, the business secretary, said in Davos that Britain didn’t need its equivalent of an IRA because it had taken an early lead in renewable energy and the Americans were now playing catch-up. Kemi Badenoch, the trade secretary, made clear her concerns about a global subsidies race in her talks with the Americans and the Europeans. Realistically, a different approach will require a change of government, and it was notable that Starmer used his visit to Davos to promote his idea for a green prosperity plan – a blueprint for a net-zero transition that would require a more activist state. While it won’t please all Labour supporters, Starmer’s thinking has evolved since the days when he was backing a second EU referendum. Leftwing supporters of Brexit have always argued that leaving the EU provided an opportunity to use state aid, subsidies, tax breaks and procurement to strengthen the UK’s industrial base, and the Labour leader seems to be slowly warming to some of those ideas. Clearly, it would be daft to imagine that the UK could ever outspend the US, but it makes sense to borrow for investments that would boost the prospects of faster sustainable growth. Nor does a UK equivalent of an IRA have to break the bank, because, as Danker said in his speech, there are smart ways in which the government can spend money to support green growth. And if the CBI can get behind funding immature technologies where markets don’t yet operate fully or providing incentives for locally sourced goods, then there is no earthly reason why Labour should not do the same.

2023-04-25T11:15:30Z, John Kerry: relying solely on CO2-removal technology is ‘dangerous’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/25/john-kerry-relying-technology-remove-carbon-dioxide-dangerous,"Relying too heavily on technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is dangerous and a cause for alarm, John Kerry has warned. The US special presidential envoy for climate said in an interview that new technologies may not prevent the world from passing “tipping points”, key temperature thresholds that, once passed, could trigger a cascade of unstoppable physical effects. “Some scientists suggest that it’s possible there could be an overshoot [of global temperatures, beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that governments are targeting] and you could clawback, so to speak – you have technologies and other things that allow you to come back,” Kerry told the Guardian. “The danger with that, which alarms me the most and motivates me the most, is that according to the science, and the best scientists in the world, we may be at or past several tipping points that they have been warning us about for some time,” he said. “That’s the danger, the irreversibility.” He called on governments to deploy renewable energy faster, along with related technologies such as electric vehicles. These are already available for widespread deployment, and could prevent the world from reaching the high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that would cause temperatures to breach the 1.5C threshold. “Part of the challenge we face right now is countries that have technologies available to them are not necessarily deploying them at the rate that they should be,” he said. “Fatih Birol [executive director of the International Energy Agency] has made it very clear for some time that all you need to meet the 2030 goal of 45% reduction [in greenhouse gas emissions] globally is to deploy renewables in the current state of technology, and that’s not happening.” “There’s a resistance right now that I see from several quarters to doing what we know we need to do,” Kerry said. “I think there are things that are really quite simple that we could be doing, but it requires political will, it requires resources, allocation and a determination to get the job done.” He pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, the $369bn (£296bn) push by the US to invest in renewable energy and low-carbon technologies. EU governments have protested at aspects of the legislation, such as tax breaks for green companies to set up in the US, which they see as protectionist and a potential competitive threat. Kerry countered that the US measures were good for all countries. “If we accelerate the pace of discovery, then the world benefits. This is not a US-centric thing,” he said. “If we can advance those technologies very rapidly, then we’re sworn to share them, and help people to develop similarly. That’s the way collectively we try to meet the challenge.” He said the act, passed last summer, was already making an impact. “People are shifting and realising the best thing to do. There are a number of countries in Europe – Germany, and France, and others – that are hell-bent to do a similar kind of effort. They try to define it for themselves and go out and do it,” he said. “Given the trillions we need to be deploying to meet this challenge, to have something that excites investment is in everybody’s interest. We are seeing a tremendous amount of venture capital moving in the direction of some of these transition essentials.” The UK must also pile efforts into net zero, he added. “Everybody in the world [needs a net zero strategy],” he said. “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made it crystal clear that we’re not on the track we need to be … everything needs to be increased exponentially in effort.” The US president, Joe Biden, has come under severe criticism from climate activists, despite his green investment push, for pressing ahead with investment in fossil fuels. In recent weeks, he approved an area of the Gulf of Mexico amounting to about 73m acres, roughly the size of Italy, for drilling for oil and gas wells. A fortnight before that, he approved the Willow project, a drilling site in Alaska that is expected to produce 600m barrels of oil over its lifetime. Further licences are also possible, and the US is looking to expand its shale gas production and export to Europe under Biden’s watch. Kerry robustly defended these actions, on the grounds that more fossil fuels were needed temporarily because of the war in Ukraine, and said some oil and gas expansion could occur within climate limits, particularly if carbon capture and storage, or other ways of reducing the impact of the fossil fuels, could be used. “Gas usage is an automatic 30-50% reduction over oil and coal. It’s not clean, it’s cleaner,” he said. “So now the question is, can carbon capture and storage be deployed at a scale that makes it possible to meet our goals?” The expansion of drilling would “not have a deep impact. I’m not saying it’s impactless completely, but it’s not going to have a significant impact.” The US was still committed to its climate targets, of a 50-52% reduction in emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, he added. Kerry also pointed to the turmoil around the world, and high energy prices, caused by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “We needed desperately to not allow Putin to make his gas cutoff a weapon. And because of Ukraine, and the urgency of calming the marketplace, making sure that economies are not suddenly crashing because prices are going so high that people can’t afford to live, you’ve got to have some supply. It’s transition. That’s why the goal was 2030 and then it’s 2050. It’s not tomorrow.” He conceded that the expansion of fossil fuels in the US was difficult to explain to other countries, however. “It obviously has challenges of perception or messaging,” he said. “There’s a danger that somebody distorts it, and says ‘they did it, therefore we can do it’. That’s why I say you’ve got to understand it, you’ve got to put it in a real context of what it really means and what the impact of this is going to be.” But he insisted that the US would still meet its climate targets. “President Biden has reiterated a full-fledged commitment to keep our target, we’re not moving on our target,” he said. “This one thing is not an aberration in terms of us walking back on our goals, or walking back on our expectations. I feel very confident about that.” The appointment of Sultan Al Jaber as president of the next UN climate summit, Cop28, in the United Arab Emirates in November, has been condemned by activists who say his role as chief of the UAE national oil company Adnoc creates a conflict of interest. Kerry defended Jaber, insisting that his background – which Jaber told the Guardian would help him bring a business focus to the role – would be an advantage. “Personally, I think that because he has an experience within the context of oil and gas production, and a leadership in that, he has the ability to pull some missing links to the table with respect to what we have to get done. I’m hopeful about that,” Kerry said. Kerry also called for more private sector funding for climate finance, to help poor countries cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. “Climate finance is not just a challenge, it is the biggest single challenge right now,” he said. “Finance, and I mean big finance in the trillions of dollars. That requires a mobilisation of capital, using incentives and working with the private sector to bring them to the table, to create bankable projects that will excite deployment of capital.” • This article was amended on 27 April 2023 to clarify in the headline and text that John Kerry was not arguing against the use of carbon-capture technology, but warning of a potential overreliance on it.",John Kerry; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); US news; Environment,US news
2022-12-12T09:00:01Z,US banks named as being among least ethical UK operators,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/12/us-banks-named-as-being-among-least-ethical-uk-operators,"Two US banking giants which launched accounts in the UK have been ranked among the “worst” providers by researchers because of their policies on issues such as the climate crisis and weapons. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase both scored poorly due to their records on the environment, human rights and paying tax, according to a new study by Ethical Consumer magazine. Both of the banks were downgraded by the ethical organisation largely because of their investment in fossil fuels in the latest study, which scrutinises financial institutions’ practices against a range of criteria. Triodos Bank, which describes itself as “one of the world’s most sustainable banks”, has been awarded a “best buy” for current and savings accounts in the survey, which is undertaken every two years. It was awarded the highest ranking among 31 current accounts with a green, or good, “Ethiscore” based on its transparency and investment strategy. Meanwhile, the Chase current account, JPMorgan’s consumer brand in the UK, was the fourth-worst ranked current account with a red – or poor – rating and a recommendation that this was a “brand to avoid”. Ethical Consumer is an independent, not-for-profit co-operative founded in 1989 and based in Manchester. It aims to make businesses more sustainable through consumer pressure. In the study, banks were scored against ratings on climate and the environment as well as on financial issues such as director pay and tax avoidance. It also looked at the activities that are funded by the banks and the ethical policies in place to prevent financing of harmful practices. Triodos was applauded for publishing information about every organisation that it lends to. Customers are able to review every organisation in their portfolios, which is not possible with other banks, according to Ethical Consumer. The determination of how ethical a bank is was largely determined by where their money is invested, according to the co-operative, including how transparent they are and whether there are robust policies to stop them funding harmful practices. If a bank was found to have invested in mining, for example, it would lose marks under sections on human and workers’ rights as well as pollution. Only Triodos, Co-op, Nationwide and Cumberland building society did not lend to problematic areas, according to the study. If a bank held shares in, as well as lending to, companies which had unethical practices, they were also deducted marks. Ruairidh Fraser, one of the authors of the report, says banks have a huge impact through their loans and investments. “That’s why it’s so important for customers to know what banks are doing with their money and what policies, if any, guide their choices. But our survey of the banking sector showed that this information is still very hard to find,” he says. Triodos’ current account dropped slightly in its score since the last survey due to what was claimed to be “excessive” executive pay, but remained a leading product as a result of its transparency and positive investment strategy. Goldman Sachs’s Marcus savings account, which has attracted significant interest from UK consumers on the back of attractive rates, also emerged with a poor Ethiscore. Of the savings accounts that were rated, it was one of 22 which received the middle or worst ranking for the likely use of tax avoidance strategies. “The biggest banks all fail miserably on tax,” claims the report. Three financial institutions – Charity Bank, Ecology building society and Triodos – were awarded best buy status in this category. Most of the providers got the worst rating around their carbon management and reporting, as they did not discuss the carbon impacts of their investments and were found to have funded sectors which were deemed to be climate destructive. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, both relatively recent entrants to the UK banking market, were singled out for criticism in the report. Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for JPMorgan defended the banks’ green credentials. “In 2021, JPMorgan Chase facilitated more than $100 billion for green activities like renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation, doubled our green investment banking activity and were the largest underwriter of green bonds,” said the spokesman. “These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1 trillion for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet. We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 emission intensity reduction targets in oil and gas, electric power and automotive manufacturing, while helping the world meet its energy needs securely and affordably.” Bevis Watts, the chief executive of Triodos Bank UK, called on other banks to adopt similar levels of transparency and accountability. “If the financial industry is truly going to be play a part in tackling the combined threats of the environmental and social issues that we are facing, we need each and every bank to reflect these values and make real commitments to investing only in areas that contribute to a sustainable future for everyone.”",Money; Banks and building societies; Goldman Sachs; JP Morgan; Ethical business; Banking; Business,Money
2022-12-08T06:00:46Z,Could Cumbria coalmine be stopped despite government green light?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/08/government-approves-cumbria-coalmine-legal-challenge,"The government has given the green light to a new coalmine in Cumbria, the first in the UK for more than 30 years, but already moves have begun to challenge the decision before construction work can start. Climate campaigners are examining the decision with a view to a legal challenge, based on the UK’s national and international legally binding climate commitments. The Guardian understands that lawyers working for NGOs will be looking for grounds to bring a high court claim against the planning permission. If such a claim were to succeed, the court could strike down the government’s decision and send it back to ministers to redetermine. Tony Bosworth, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The evidence against this mine is huge. It will have a significant impact on UK climate targets, while the market for coal is already disappearing. The UK steel industry wants to move to greener production, like its counterparts in mainland Europe who are rapidly moving away from coal.” Another threat to the mine’s future is the general election that must take place within the next two years. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party have all made clear their opposition to the new mine. Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, vowed to keep fighting: “This government has backed a climate-busting, backward-looking, business-wrecking, stranded asset coalmine. This mine is a climate crime against humanity – and such a reckless desire to dig up our dirty fossil fuel past will be challenged every step of the way.” Protesters are also gearing up to take local action at the site of the mine, and any banks and investors that finance the mine will also be put under pressure in public campaigns. All of this means that it is possible that the new mine will never be operational. The economic viability of the mine – which will cost £165m, create 500 new jobs and produce an estimated 2.8m tonnes of coking coal a year, for steel-making – is already in doubt. Two UK steel companies have said they will not need its coal, and most leading European steel-makers are adopting green production methods. Ron Deelan, a former chief executive of British Steel, said: “This is a completely unnecessary step for the British steel industry, which is not waiting for more coal as there is enough on the free market available. The British steel industry needs green investment in electric arc furnaces and hydrogen to protect jobs and make the UK competitive.” The UK’s own steel industry must reach net zero emissions by 2035, according to the government’s independent statutory advisers on climate, the Committee on Climate Change. Philip Dunne, the Tory MP who is chair of the environmental audit committee in parliament, said: “Coal is the most polluting energy source, and is not consistent with the government’s net zero ambitions. It is not clear cut to suggest that having a coalmine producing coking coal for steelmaking on our doorstep will reduce steelmakers’ demand for imported coal. On the contrary, when our committee heard from steelmakers earlier this year, they argued that they have survived long enough without UK domestic coking coal and that any purchase of coking coal would be a commercial decision.” For these reasons, about 83% of the coal produced is likely to be for export, but who the customers may be remains unknown. Steel produced using coal may soon face penalties in the EU, where moves are under way to bring in “carbon border adjustment mechanisms” (CBAMs), which operate as tariffs on high-carbon, favouring lower-carbon products instead, such as steel made with renewable energy. Simon Nicholas, energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: “The decision comes as the UK steel sector calls for government support to transition to low-carbon technology, in a bid to remain competitive with the European steel industry, which has seen an acceleration in its technology transition away from coal in 2022.” Supporters of the mine point to the 500 to 530 jobs that are likely to be created. But environmental experts said many more jobs were likely in green industries in future, such as windfarms, solar farms, replacing gas for heating with district heating networks and heat pumps, and tree-planting and nature conservation. Rebecca Willis, professor in energy and climate governance at the University of Lancaster, said: “There is no business case or scientific justification for this mine, which has only been made possible by a quirk of our planning laws. It will harm the UK’s climate credentials and do very little for communities in Cumbria, where the focus should be on delivering long-term, secure and green jobs.” Reaction from climate campaigners in developing countries, which have for years been urged by the UK to move away from coal, has also been critical. Steve Maël Size, of the Care For Environment/CAN group in Cameroon, pointed out that the UK had made coal a key issue in its presidency of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. “If a power like the UK, which was among the pioneers in the fight against coal, decides to reinvest to open [a coalmine], that would mean that it has long fought for nothing,” he said. • This article was amended on 8 December 2022.

2023-07-09T08:00:40Z,Champagne with Rupert Murdoch … Keir Starmer’s Labour is preparing for power,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/09/rupert-murdoch-keir-starmer-labour-party-power-no-10,"After 13 years of Conservative government it was, in the words of one guest, “an extraordinary, symbolic moment, like a changing of the guard”. Rupert Murdoch was throwing a midsummer party at Spencer House, the palatial residence in St James’s, London, owned by Earl Spencer. Seated on a sofa in the middle of the main room, the 92-year-old media magnate was holding court with carefully chosen individuals of influence – five minutes at a time, strictly one to one. Cabinet ministers, MPs, media executives and others among the great and the good sipped Pol Roger champagne and admired the extravagant floral arrangements, wondering who would be next. As the numbers swelled, one senior News Corp journalist was chatting away to former prime minister Liz Truss when he had to break off suddenly. His duty was to meet a special guest and bring him to Murdoch. A minute or so later, in swept Keir Starmer in an open-necked black shirt, ready for his audience with the most powerful media figure in the world. “You go, don’t you?” was how Tony Blair, in his memoirs, described what to do when, as leader of a Labour opposition, an invitation arrived to meet Murdoch in “the lion’s den”. One News Corp executive in London noted after the latest party that contact between Starmer, Murdoch and his top brass was by no means rare. In fact, Rupert and Keir had already had a “brush-by” at the News Corp CEO Summit earlier the same day. Nor were their discussions always initiated by the Murdoch side. “We can’t keep him [Starmer] away,” said the source. Last Wednesday, Starmer was unable to attend another summer media party of note, put on by the Conservative-supporting Spectator magazine in Westminster. The Labour leader was in Kent preparing to launch a new education policy the next day. Details of that story – Starmer’s plan to smash the “class ceiling” – were leaked that evening to Murdoch’s Times newspaper, which led its front page on Thursday with the headline “Speaking lessons for all pupils”. Courting the right-leaning media influencers was working a treat. Despite Starmer’s absence, his team was well represented at the Spectator do, with several of his closest aides in attendance. Shadow cabinet members Wes Streeting and Jonathan Ashworth were also there, lapping up the attention. “People wanted to talk more to the Labour people than the Conservatives,” said one member of team Starmer after the event. “That tells you a lot.” Another senior MP who attended noted that nothing better illustrated how far Labour had come since the days of Jeremy Corbyn than his party’s heavy presence on such summer evenings where the champagne flows. With his party far ahead in the opinion polls (15 points in today’s Opinium survey for the Observer, more in several others) Starmer and his people no longer have to try to generate media or corporate interest. Their challenge is to manage and control it as it grows, and maximise the opportunities it throws up. For Starmer, the demands on his time are growing every day as a general election approaches, and as the Tories divide and disintegrate as a fighting force. “You can feel it now,” said a shadow cabinet member. “The media is preparing psychologically for a Labour government. Business is preparing for one, too. The Tories are preparing for defeat. Their focus now is on who comes next [after Sunak]. They are circling like sharks around him.” If networking right across the political spectrum is part of the process of preparing for power, so too is maintaining discipline and keeping feet on the ground. There is a nervousness at the top of Labour now that is mounting in parallel with rising expectations. Over recent weeks, Starmer’s campaigns director, Morgan McSweeney, has been acting as “killjoy in chief”, studying political campaigns run by parties which were way ahead in the polls in the run-up to polling day, and were expected to win, then bombed and lost. He has been passing the lesson on to everyone who matters at the top of the party, above all about the need to assume nothing and take nothing for granted – and to stay in touch with voters’ interests. “People have been in our position before and lost, and we need to know why that is,” he says. McSweeney has been debriefing political figures who suffered the pain of three failed left-of-centre campaigns: Labour’s in 1992, when the party under Neil Kinnock was defeated by the Tories led by John Major (the infamous Sheffield rally being a lesson on its own); the Democrats under Hillary Clinton in 2016, who lost to Donald Trump’s Republicans; and the Australian Labor party’s defeat under Bill Shorten in 2019, when the minority Liberal-National Coalition government, led by prime minister Scott Morrison, secured a third term. McSweeney points out Labour lost a seat last week to the Conservatives on Cambridge city council for the first time in years. This can be put down almost entirely to the Labour-run administration’s unpopular plans for a congestion charge in the city. One error can knock an entire campaign off course: that is the lesson from Cambridge. On the practical planning front, young Labour advisers are now being given regular “preparation for government” advice sessions by staff who worked for ministers such as Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson in the New Labour administration. “There is a lot about how government works, what to expect,” said one Labour staffer. This work will be stepped up when former civil servant Sue Gray takes up her post as Starmer’s chief of staff in the autumn. Another Labour adviser said it was difficult at times to think ahead because of conflicting messages. “We are told so often to guard against complacency. Every week its about how we are not measuring the curtains [inside No 10]. You are told one minute to prepare, the next to assume nothing. It can be a bit disorientating.” While the Tories tear each other apart, discipline levels inside the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) are rising. Most people on the Corbynite left have long since departed or are now eyeing opportunities that could be in store if they stay quiet. “There are lots of ostensibly ‘left’ members of the PLP who actually quite fancy being government ministers,” said one senior figure. “The prospect of winning v losing is what sharpens minds.” Another Labour staffer said the prize was too great for anyone with “half an ounce of sense” to rock the boat: “We have [not] been in as good a position as we are now for ages. That is partly because of the desperate state the Tories are in and partly because of good decisions by Keir. The fact of the matter is that, at this stage, no one wants to be the one who fucks this up.” If there is a nagging doubt in Labour ranks, however – and it still exists among plenty at the top of the party – it is that the Starmer bandwagon may be something of an illusion, powered more by Tory failures and infighting than by any real vision that he or Labour has so far been able to offer in policy terms. The party finds itself in the tricky position of having to prepare a policy programme that appeals widely, and that addresses the decay in public services after 13 years of Tory rule, when the economy is hardly growing and inflation and interest rates are both stubbornly high. “The fact is there is no money,” says a shadow cabinet member. “We have to deal with that, and make it the Tories’ fault – not set traps for ourselves as a result of their failures.” There is also a defensiveness at the heart of much Labour strategy – most notable in its reluctance to talk about the failings of Brexit – that infuriates and depresses some of the party’s MPs. For the few Tories who still have any hope that their party can win the next election, it lies in a feeling that Starmer will come across as vacuous and without vision when voters finally have to make their choice. One former Tory cabinet member told the Observer: “Obviously, it should be Labour’s to lose now, but I still wonder how they deal with this central issue of what Starmer is about. He seems to lack a purpose, and that will look worse when there is no money.” In recent weeks, with the economy so sluggish, Starmer and his shadow ministers have already had to rein back on expectations about how much they would be able to spend in government, and when – even on their core projects such as green investment. “I am increasingly alarmed by the state of the economy,” said a senior shadow cabinet member. “This means we are having to be serious and honest with people and say we will have to rule out or delay things. It is a difficult message.” For some, all this is unsettling. “There’s obviously been a process of tightening up and a whole set of policies, and so people just feel constrained,” said one influential figure on Labour’s left. “At the moment, it has a weird effect. Keir does these speeches about his five missions. He’s then asked questions at the speeches about things that he’s not going to do – so the message coming out of them is often what Labour is ruling out. Maybe that’s what they want.” In reality, Labour’s high command is indeed open about cutting back on any aspects of a policy programme that might be attacked by the Tories as unaffordable, and therefore irresponsible, in the run-up to an election. They believe the positives to be gained from being seen as responsible – particularly after the years of ill-discipline and chaos under Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss – outweigh the negatives of being accused of lack of ambition. “We are trying to make sure the manifesto is as tight as possible,” one senior figure said. “It means that lots of the things the Tories will try and claim we are going to spend on, with the inevitable spending dossier, simply won’t be part of our policy platform.” Shadow ministers are told week after week that there is no money by the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden. They are having to go away and come up with cost-free ideas because fiscal responsibility is the watchword. This week, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth will make a speech in which he will unveil plans to use artificial intelligence in the welfare system to increase efficiency and save public money at the same time. As the summer break approaches, and Labour figures turn their minds to conference season in the autumn, they hope the public and the media – including outlets run by Murdoch – will buy the message. “The public wants change,” says a shadow cabinet member. “But it also wants responsibility. That is the tightrope we are walking. It is not easy.”",Labour; Keir Starmer; Conservatives; Politics; UK news; Media; Rupert Murdoch; The Spectator; Newspapers & magazines; Magazines,Politics
2021-09-21T13:30:42Z,"Britain’s energy crisis has been years in the making, thanks to the Conservatives | Ed Davey",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/21/britain-energy-crisis-conservatives-insulate-homes,"Rocketing heating bills owing to dramatic gas price rises are just the latest chapter in Britain’s mounting cost of living crisis. From food price-hikes to increasing transport costs, this new bout of inflation is hitting essential goods – and that means the poorest people will be hit the hardest. So no one should be surprised that Boris Johnson has dismissed these problems. He wants us to think it’s all a global problem, with nothing unique to the UK. And he wants us to think it will all be over quickly. Of course, the reality is somewhat different. While rising gas prices are a global phenomenon, British consumers will be hit hard because energy policy in the last six years has been an unmitigated disaster – with fewer homes being insulated and with measures for diversifying the UK away from overdependence on gas needlessly stalled. Within the last 18 months alone, the Conservatives have launched, mismanaged and then scrapped a Green Home Grant scheme; their flagship policy to help people cut their heating bills failed totally, and nothing has been put in its place. Johnson’s botched Brexit deal is unquestionably a UK-only phenomenon and a major cause of rising food prices. The shortages of lorry drivers, farm workers and staff in the food processing sector – from chicken processing units to abattoirs – are adding to these pressures. Despite the lowest paid being among the worst hit by these Conservative policy failures, Johnson seems determined to make it even worse for them – by slashing support and raising taxes for the low paid. The Conservatives’ cut to universal credit will plunge an estimated more than 800,000 people into poverty. On top of that, their unfair and manifesto-breaking increase to national insurance will disproportionately hit the young and those on low and middle incomes. Our carers, nurses and other vital frontline workers sacrificed so much during the pandemic to keep the country going. Many of them are on low pay. A NHS healthcare assistant, for instance, is likely to be on universal credit, and the combined impact of the cut and NI rise will mean a £940 hit to their income, more than wiping out the 3% pay rise announced earlier this year. And that’s before rising prices make it even worse. Last month’s rise in year-on-year inflation was 3% – with the monthly rise of 0.6% in August being the largest increase ever recorded using the Treasury’s favourite CPIH measure of inflation. The timing of this new cost-of-living crisis could not have been worse. Millions of families already struggling will now face rising energy bills as we enter the colder months. As secretary of state for energy and climate change, I was proud of the role the Liberal Democrats played in weaning the UK off both coal and gas – for instance, when we nearly quadrupled the UK’s renewable energy between 2010 and 2015. Our policies led to massive investment in onshore and offshore wind and solar, and brought in new standards for zero-carbon housing and tough regulations on energy firms to force them to promote home insulation to cut customers’ heating bills and tackle fuel poverty. From promoting district heat networks to pushing National Grid and Norway’s StattNet to build the world’s longest subsea cable to link the UK to cheap hydropower, we were developing the low-carbon energy infrastructure to tackle climate change and improve the UK’s energy security. Most of that stopped under the Conservatives after 2015. They privatised our Green Investment Bank, scrapped new homes standards, stopped onshore wind, damaged our solar industry and failed to take any serious new initiatives. Indeed, energy policy has effectively been stalled for six years. And guess what? Tory climate sceptic backbenchers and their backers are now arguing that the current energy crisis shows why we must scrap green levies and subsidies for the renewables industry. This isn’t just wrong because it would be embarrassing ahead of the forthcoming Glasgow Cop26 summit. It’s factually wrong. Almost all of the renewable power plants built thanks to Liberal Democrat policies are now paying the consumer back: with the wholesale price of power so high because of increased fossil fuel prices, renewables pay back the difference between a higher wholesale market price and the guaranteed price (“the strike price”) in their contract. The Conservatives’ failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis is just the latest example of the party taking people for granted. In the Chesham and Amersham byelection, so many lifelong Conservative voters told us that Johnson’s incompetence and lack of decency would cause them to vote for us. They felt taken for granted by the prime minister. A Conservative winter of discontent could yet see that light go on for many of the party’s other former supporters.

2022-10-31T02:02:08Z,"Poverty, housing and the Amazon: Lula’s in-tray as president-elect of Brazil",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/lula-policies-priorities-win-brazil-president-election-poverty-housing-amazon,"The euphoria of an election victory is fleeting and while many Brazilians will wake up with a hangover after celebrating the defeat of Jair Bolsonaro, president-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will soon have his own headaches to deal with. Lula takes power on 1 January 2023 and will be charged with rebuilding and reuniting a nation that has been left damaged and bitterly divided after four years of Bolsonaro’s anarchic far-right policies. The challenges are immense: 33 million Brazilians face acute hunger and 100 million live in poverty, the highest numbers in years. Bolsonaro’s policies, particularly in the Amazon, have led to Brazil becoming an international pariah. Lula addressed these and myriad other issues in his victory speech but made it clear his first priority was the one that has accompanied him throughout his long political career: improving the lot of Brazil’s poor. “We can’t accept it as normal that in this country millions of men, women and children don’t have enough to eat,” he told an adoring crowd. “If we are the world’s third biggest producer of food and the biggest producer of animal protein … we have the duty to guarantee that every Brazilian can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.” The speech was a more emotive version of a letter he wrote to the Brazilian people last week outlining his priorities. The letter is filled with ambitious – critics say barely credible – proposals, including equal pay for men and women, clearing all waiting lists for surgeries and medical exams, and getting every infant a place in creche. The plan was issued without any clear details or costings, but Lula is betting that voters will trust he can repeat his feats from 12 years ago when he left power with approval ratings above 80%. Like his vow to eradicate hunger, many of his promises are similar to those he made during his first terms in office between 2003 and 2011. He is promising to build more affordable housing, and take electricity and water cisterns to unconnected and far-flung villages. Major infrastructure projects like public transportation, energy and water will also be managed as before, with the state banks providing funding. He has promised tax reform and an increase in the minimum wage. In a revamp of the internationally lauded Bolsa Familia poverty-relief program, the poorest families will get 600 reais ($110) a month and those with children under six years of age will get an additional 150 reais ($30). The handout comes with a requirement to keep children in school and get all vaccinations. Quite how he does it all is still an open question – and a very big one. The commodities boom that financed many of his programs the first time around is over, and he will face a hostile Congress, where Bolsonarismo remains strong. Many prominent backbenchers are funded by agribusiness and they could be a major obstacle in what will be one of Lula’s highest priority areas, the Amazon. Deforestation has increased every year since Bolsonaro took power. Lula will halt Bolsonaro’s development-at-all-costs policies that encouraged ranchers, prospectors and loggers to besiege the Amazon and plunder its natural resources. He promised to “aim for zero deforestation” but will be satisfied if his government can lower deforestation by 83% as was seen under Lula and Dilma between 2003 and 2014. Much focus will also be on Indigenous issues. A quick rebuild of the Indigenous and environmental organisations that were hollowed out by Bolsonaro will signal just how serious Lula’s government is and will also help combat deforestation. “Instead of being world leaders in deforestation, we want to be world champions in facing up to the climate crisis and in socio-environmental development,” Lula said. “That way we will have healthy food on our plates, clean air to breathe and water to drink and lots of quality jobs with green investment.” The focus on reindustrialisation and public works projects might be necessary but they are also a sign of how Latin American politics has failed to fully grasp 21st-century realities, said Shannon O’Neil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “What I find dispiriting sometimes for the future of Latin America is that the kind of discussions they are having is based on 20th-century economies,” O’Neil said, without naming Lula directly. “It is not about human capital, which is really the future of any workforce, it is not about automation or creating intellectual property, or research and development. Too much of it is about looking back at economies that are disappearing. It is not what the next 25 years are going to bring.”",Brazil; Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva; Jair Bolsonaro; Americas; World news; Amazon rainforest,World news
2022-10-26T07:00:03Z,How green will new environment secretary Thérèse Coffey be?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/26/how-green-will-new-environment-secretary-therese-coffey-be,"The environment sector has reacted with some surprise that Rishi Sunak has appointed Thérèse Coffey as environment secretary. At a crucial time for the environment, with much important and complex legislation coming down the line including the farming payments review due this week, many hoped the new prime minister would choose someone with recent senior experience in the department. Names hopefully floated around as the reshuffle took place included George Eustice, the former secretary of state under Boris Johnson, and Victoria Prentis, a former minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) who is popular in the farming sector. Some even dared to dream that Michael Gove, the architect of a lot of the post-Brexit environmental legislation which was under threat by Liz Truss, may make a return. However, there are some points of hope in Coffey’s appointment, despite the fact she has not shown much interest in the environment in the past. Unlike her predecessor Ranil Jayawardena, she held a junior ministerial role at Defra for three years. Shaun Spiers, chief executive of environmental thinktank Green Alliance, said: “Thérèse Coffey has experience at Defra, working with Michael Gove when there was a strong push to show that Britain could be greener outside the EU than as a member state. It’s good that she won’t have to start from scratch and can build on this experience to drive reform forward. In particular, as a minister in Theresa May’s government, she understood the importance of the circular economy, a policy area that has stalled since then.” Some of the greener Tories are hopeful she may prove a good influence. Philip Dunne, the chair of the environmental audit committee, told the Guardian that she is an “excellent appointment” due to her experience and the fact she holds a rural seat, Suffolk Coastal. One senior source in the farming sector was relieved to see any change, saying simply: “Anyone is better than Ranil.” While secretary of state for the Department for Work and Pensions, Coffey encouraged green investment, saying: “Pensions can be the superpower in delivering prosperity for people and the planet in our race to net zero.” Coffey also welcomed the Dasgupta review into biodiversity, and Defra’s nature strategy in 2020, proclaiming: “This is a really exciting moment for our natural environment after years of work. Our nature strategy in harmony with and a great catalyst for our climate change strategy will help us both achieve net zero and save our planet.” Coffey will not be likely to take a hard line on the carbon emissions from meat, if her previous tweets are anything to go by. In 2018, responding to a Guardian article about the benefits of a meat tax, she said: “What next, no spag bol?” Her tweets have caused controversy in the past – when environment minister in 2018 she celebrated using potent herbicide RoundUp in her garden, which contains the controversial ingredient glyphosate. She claimed the weedkiller was “amazing”, prompting scientist Dr David Coombes to call the tweet a “candidate for most inappropriate tweet of the year”. Coffey faces a difficult task. To create the stability her new boss has said he wants, she will need to calm tensions between the government and environment groups including the RSPB and National Trust, which were on the cusp of organising mass protests over the government’s planned “war on nature”. Jayawardena, who until Tuesday held the post, took a firm line with the groups, and it is believed he told MPs to say the RSPB was misleading people about plans to scrap nature protections to try to boost membership numbers. It remains to be seen whether the post-Brexit nature-friendly farming schemes, which Jayawardena planned to weaken, will remain in place. Coffey has stated her support for such measures in the past, though, and once said: “Nature-based solutions really are the best and most cost-effective way to tackle climate change, with multiple benefits for the environment and communities.” It is also unknown whether Coffey is enthusiastic about deregulation as her predecessor, but he set a high bar. At the Conservative party conference this year, Jayawardena argued that the job of the environment secretary is to “leave farmers alone”. However, it is not clear they want to be left alone. Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, told the Guardian: “I look forward to working with Thérèse Coffey and hope that she will urgently provide farmers with certainty on Elms [the planned scheme to offer payments to farmers based on nature-friendly measures], delivering for food production and the environment”.",Thérèse Coffey; UK news; Politics; Farming; Environment; Biodiversity; Climate crisis; Conservatives; Ranil Jayawardena,Politics
2022-12-13T13:57:02Z,EU becomes first leading economy to legislate for ‘green tariff’ on imports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/13/eu-becomes-first-leading-economy-to-legislate-for-green-tariff-on-imports,"In the early hours of Tuesday morning the EU became the first big economy to legislate for a “green tariff” on imports, to be levied on goods that are produced with high carbon dioxide emissions. The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) means that countries which fail to green their industries will soon face a new threat: an effective carbon tax that will penalise those hoping to profit from high-carbon activities, and force them to clean up. The system will be applied at first to iron and steel, cement, fertilisers, aluminium, electricity, hydrogen and some chemicals. Jozef Síkela, minister of industry and trade of the Czech Republic, who led the negotiations in the EU parliament, said: “The carbon border adjustment mechanism is a key part of our climate action. This mechanism promotes the import of goods by non-EU businesses into the EU which fulfil the high climate standards applicable in the 27 EU member states. This will ensure a balanced treatment of such imports and is designed to encourage our partners in the world to join the EU’s climate efforts.” The agreement is still provisional, and details remain to be ironed out by member states and other institutions. But if all goes according to plan, CBAMs will come into force on a trial basis from next October. However, at first, there will be no financial or other penalties attached to the EU’s CBAM – companies will only be required to report on the emissions associated with the production of the goods they wish to sell. Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, told the Guardian: “We’re going to ask a tremendous transformation from many parts of our industry. If other [countries] don’t do that – if they don’t comply with what they engaged to do under the Paris agreement – the risk of carbon leakage is huge. You will see European industry move elsewhere, to places where they don’t have to comply with strict norms, to emit CO2 there. That would render our climate action useless.” Pascal Canfin, chair of the EU parliament’s environment committee, hailed the move: “The agreement is a world first. For the first time, we are going to ensure fair treatment between our companies, which pay a carbon price in Europe, and their foreign competitors, which do not. This is a major step that will allow us to do more for the climate while protecting our companies and our jobs.” The move, announced as part of the EU green deal, a big push to meet the EU’s stringent climate targets, could be the first salvo in a global carbon trade war – or the first step towards an equitable global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with urgent scientific advice. The US and the UK are considering how to respond, but the countries most affected by Europe’s moves are likely to be those with high-carbon export industries such as China, Turkey, India and potentially Australia. Russia faces its own sanctions and penalties based on its aggression in Ukraine, but could also be targeted by CBAMs. The move must also be seen in the context of the row between the EU and the US over the Inflation Reduction Act. President Joe Biden’s climate legislation contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives to green industries, which has been seen by some EU member states as an aggressive act that could undermine the attractiveness of the EU for green investment. The US has said the EU should develop its own incentives. Canfin, without naming the US, made it clear that the CBAM was also part of the EU response, saying the aim was to make Europe “a sovereign green power”. While the initial CBAM requirements will apply to only a few sectors, Canfin made it clear the EU parliament had many more in its sights. “We have also provided for the future integration of processed products, such as cars,” he said. “The message to our industries is clear: there is no need to relocate because we have taken the necessary measures to avoid unfair competition and carbon leakage.” Camille Maury, a senior policy officer for the decarbonisation of industry at the conservation group WWF, said the agreement was “half-baked”, however, and should be expanded to address the free permits to produce carbon dioxide that some companies are allocated under the EU’s existing carbon trading scheme. “The provisional agreement on CBAM includes some good elements on the scope and the emissions covered. Now talks will intensify on the overlap with the free permits to pollute allocated to industry under the EU ETS [emissions trading system],” she said. “To act as a real alternative to carbon leakage protection measures, and push EU industry to decarbonise, co-legislators will have to agree on finally upholding the ‘polluter pays’ principle by phasing out half of free permits to pollute for CBAM sectors by 2030, and totally by 2032. They shouldn’t budge for industry lobbying while we are in a climate emergency.” Lord Stern, the climate and development economist, believes the tariffs should be narrowly applied to particular high-carbon industries, such as steel. Steel-making traditionally involves high fossil fuel use, but some companies have been switching to “green steel”, using electric arc furnaces and in some cases hydrogen as fuel. Carbon border taxes on steel could spur the investment required for more to follow suit. “CBAMs have to be intelligent,” said Stern. “They have to be simple in definition and in operation and focused on a narrow group of relevant industries such as steel and cement. If you explain to other countries what you have in mind, and that they will not be affected if they have the right policies, then you can have a constructive dialogue. But if you use them as blanket protectionism, that would be divisive. And it is important to recognise that other countries may pursue sustainable growth and emissions reductions in different ways, and you should not insist that every country uses a carbon price, notwithstanding the great value of that policy tool.” A government spokesperson said: “Domestically, as we transition to net zero, the UK recognises the importance of addressing the risk of carbon leakage to ensure that our ambitious policy of decarbonisation is not undermined. The government is exploring a range of policies that could potentially mitigate future risk of carbon leakage. The government committed to consult on this, including on whether measures such as product standards and a carbon border adjustment mechanism could be appropriate tools in the UK’s policy mix, and will do so in the spring.”",International trade; Greenhouse gas emissions; European Union; Climate crisis; Environment; Manufacturing sector; Business; Global economy; World news; Tariffs,Business
2022-07-19T18:04:22Z,The Guardian view on public attitudes to the climate crisis: burning for change | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/19/the-guardian-view-on-public-attitudes-to-the-climate-crisis-burning-for-change,"Will the heatwave change anything? As predicted, British temperature records were shattered on Tuesday with 40.3C recorded in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. While Wednesday is expected to be cooler, the European crisis continues, with wildfires raging in France, Spain and Portugal. What immediate impact these extremes have on individuals depends on factors including geography, age, health, sex and socioeconomic status. Wealthier people in the UK, as all over the world, are better protected, while poorer people (who are more likely to be black or minority ethnic) are more exposed both at work and home. This is far from the first disruption to British weather attributed to global heating. This time last year saw flash floods. But sometimes the “heating” part of the climate emergency has felt as though it belonged elsewhere. Predictions for the UK have included more rain rather than sun. So this week’s burning heat has shocked scientists as well as the public. Will this alter how we think and behave? The UK public (like the global public) do not need convincing that the climate is changing. Nor do people need to be persuaded that this is a threat to them, and especially (if they are older) to their children and other young people. Government data shows that three-quarters of UK adults are worried about climate change and two-thirds feel “negative” about the future of the environment. This is not a view confined to the left of politics, with polling by the Conservative Environment Network showing that three-quarters of Tory “red wall” voters are similarly concerned. Since worried people are three times as likely to try to do something practical about climate change, such as using public transport instead of driving, this is encouraging. But could raised awareness of the risks alter dispositions in more fundamental ways – shifting political values and judgments? Data shows that around half the public think it is mainly the government’s responsibility to act on the dangers. Currently, YouGov’s tracker shows the climate behind the economy, health and defence as the fourth most important issue facing the country. The current heat crisis could lead to it climbing further up voters’ priorities. While there is no guarantee that this would lead politicians to take the much stronger action that is needed, including confronting fossil fuel interests, there is reason to hope that it might. Most people in the UK do not yet grasp the net zero concept. Only a small minority claim to have made “a lot” of changes personally. Tellingly, the peak of concern about climate was in March 2019, the month of a 1.4-million-strong international school strike and a few weeks before the first Extinction Rebellion occupations – proof that street protests can be very effective. Visionary leadership will be required to guide the transformation and, crucially, the green investment that are needed – not just in the UK but internationally. The ideological right, in particular, must give up the fantasy that human civilisation can grow indefinitely without environmental consequences – as the pioneering US economist Herman Daly is the latest to spell out. The energy landscape must be upended, and fossil fuels downgraded. There is no reason to think that the public in the UK, or anywhere else, are not ready for a greener future. Clearly, the dangerous heat has the potential to nudge us in a safer direction. What we need is for it to become a tipping point.",Climate crisis; Environment; Environmental activism; UK weather; Extreme weather; Greenhouse gas emissions,Opinion
2022-08-24T04:07:31Z,RBA urges business to act now on climate threats or face potential legal action,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/24/rba-urges-business-to-act-now-on-climate-threats-or-face-potential-legal-action,"The Reserve Bank has warned banks, insurers and other businesses to act now to manage the financial threats from global warming, with directors and trustees likely to face litigation risks if they don’t take “appropriate actions”. In a broad-ranging speech on Wednesday, the central bank’s head of domestic markets, Jonathan Kearns, said the climate crisis was a “significant issue” for the economy and society. Effects would be “more severe” if actions were delayed. For financial markets, the RBA’s main focus, the challenges range from immediate and chronic risks from the intensification of extreme weather, to the legal liabilities for those in charge of companies. Kearns said the appetite for Australia’s fossil fuel exports was also likely to diminish, a so-called “transition risk” the RBA is now taking into account for potential future economic fallout. The RBA was concerned asset prices would probably become more volatile, affecting their value as security for loans. That, in turn, would require banks to reassess their books. Households and businesses may also have their ability to repay debt reduced. The RBA and other members of the Council of Financial Regulators – Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Treasury – have been working on updated disclosure rules since 2017. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While noting uncertainties remain about the scale and location of climate perils, Kearns said business, directors or trustees were increasingly exposed to liability risk “if they do not sufficiently respond to climate change”. “This risk exists not only when they choose not to take appropriate actions but also if they are not informed to take appropriate actions,” he said. Apra has already been working with the country’s five biggest banks to develop climate vulnerability assessments to account for “anticipated physical and transition risks through to 2050”. These assessments are based on two scenarios developed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening of the Financial System that has been advising up to 100 central banks and similar agencies around the world. One is for a delayed and then rapid reduction in emissions, and the other the continuation of current global policies that are insufficient to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets. The regulators were also working to develop disclosures by companies that would be both “high quality” and comparable with other nations to help investors understand the risks at play. The International Sustainability Standards Board was aiming to finish “key decisions” by the end of 2022, Kearns said. The third area of work was to provide “scientifically based definitions for what could be considered as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’” finance. Asic on Tuesday listed as a priority a crackdown on “greenwashing” by companies that exaggerated their emission cuts or other environmental efforts. Without a taxonomy of consistent definitions, Australia could find it harder to attract investment, Kearns said. “For example, the EU taxonomy may label LNG as not being a green investment unless it meets stringent requirements that are not applied in Australia,” he said. “[H]owever, in the near-term, increased use of LNG in Australia may assist a transition away from coal while renewables infrastructure is developed.” Head of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, Andy Pitman, also a member of the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute’s taxonomy project, said it was “valuable” that the RBA was addressing climate risks. “There needs to be active dialogue between groups like the RBA and those who develop the [climate] models that provide the information around future risks,” Pitman said. The Australian Banking Association said banks recognised climate change represented “a first-order risk to the Australian economy, the financial system and investors”. “Banks support the Paris Agreement and its objective to take into account the needs of a just transition while achieving a net zero emissions economy and resilient Australia,” a spokesperson said. “As part of this work, banks have worked with APRA over the last 18 months to assess climate vulnerability across their lending banks, including their mortgage portfolio. We look forward APRA publishing the outcome of this work later this year.”",Reserve Bank of Australia; Climate crisis; Banking ; Australia news; Environment; Australian economy; Banking; Business,Australia news
2023-07-03T05:51:20Z,Monday briefing: Labour’s key U-turns under Keir Starmer,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/03/monday-briefing-labours-key-u-turns-under-keir-starmer,"Good morning. Keir Starmer has undergone a political transformation since he became leader of the Labour party. During the leadership contest, he positioned himself as a “colleague and friend” of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, in whose shadow cabinet he had served. His list of policy pledges presented him as a more competent version of Corbyn, with none of the political baggage. Three years later, the picture could not look more different. Starmer’s leadership, in tone and subject matter, has pivoted away from the leftwing agenda that he laid out then. As Starmer himself said earlier this year: “Our message at the next election must be we are different to the party Britain rejected in 2019.” To that end, barely a day goes by without a previous policy position being ditched. And, of course, Corbyn is still sitting without the party whip, after his failure to offer a full enough apology for the antisemitism scandal, and is barred from standing as a Labour MP at the next general election. The primary justification for this policy shift has been that the country is in a different place now. When Starmer became leader of the party, the pandemic had not yet happened, Russia had not formally invaded Ukraine, Liz Truss had not tanked the economy and the cost of living crisis had not taken hold. And Starmer’s allies and supporters are quick to point out that this strategy seems to be working for them in the polls – it now looks like the Labour party is on its way to its first general election victory since 2005. But to get here, Starmer has alienated a significant swathe of the people who voted for him in that Labour leadership contest, and has been accused of dishonesty and betrayal. Today’s newsletter goes through Labour’s key U-turns. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories NHS | Seven in 10 people in the UK believe charges for NHS care will creep in over the next decade, ending the health service’s record of being free at the point of use, polling has found. Ahead of the service’s 75th birthday this week the Guardian also asked five experts for their ideas on how to make the NHS thrive again. House of Lords | Two British peers were among 50 people who attended a party organised by the Russian ambassador to the UK at his opulent residence in west London last month. The event was to mark the creation of a Russia independent of the Soviet Union. Scotland | Orkney could leave the UK to become a self-governing territory of Norway after its council opted to explore “alternative forms of governance”. The archipelago off the north coast of Scotland will also consider changing its legal status within Britain as it seeks to provide more economic opportunities. Israel | As many as 50 Conservative MPs are threatening to rebel against a government proposal that would impose fines on public bodies, including local councils, that seek to mount boycotts against Israel. The scale of the unease on a foreign policy issue has caught government whips by surprise. France | The riots over the police shooting of teenager Nahel M appeared to ease after five nights of unrest that have seen thousands arrested and widespread destruction. French media reported that police made 49 arrests nationwide yesterday, down significantly from more than 2,000 over the previous two days. In depth: Moving on from policies past *** Tuition fees Since Tony Blair’s government introduced tuition fees in 1998, almost every political leader has promised to roll them back, only to turn on that promise once they got to office. Keir Starmer has gone one better, ditching the pledge even before he has won a general election. Despite adopting Corbyn’s key promise to abolish university tuition fees in his leadership campaign, in May he argued it was necessary to “move on” from the idea because of the economic situation the country finds itself in. Supporters of Starmer said it was a necessary decision, arguing that money is better spent elsewhere. Starmer has said that he is instead “looking at options for how we fund these fees”, though he has not made clear what these options are. *** Green investment In 2021, Labour laid out an ambitious plan to invest £28bn a year in climate-friendly investments until 2030. It was a prominent promise, one that clearly differentiated the Labour party from the Conservatives. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, even said she would be the UK’s first “Green chancellor” if Labour were to win the next general election. Now Reeves has said that Labour would instead “ramp up” towards the £28bn figure in the second half of their parliamentary term, kicking the agenda further down the line. She added that she could not have predicted what Liz Truss’s time in office would do to the economy and interest rates. To the new version of the Labour party that prizes fiscal discipline above all else this was a necessary decision. But it looks like this is just as much a political calculation as an economic one, as Reeves tightens Labour’s budget in anticipation of further Conservative party attacks on their fiscal irresponsibility before the general election. *** Income tax Keir Starmer said in an interview last week that in principle he “obviously wants lower taxes” and to “stimulate growth in the economy”, indicating that he will not raise taxes for the top 5% of earners (which was the first pledge he made in his list of priorities in 2020). His paramount ambition is to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 group of advanced economies if he wins the next election. *** Nationalisation Even overwhelmingly popular policies are facing the axe. Despite repeatedly promising to keep nationalisation of key services on the table, the Labour party has suggested that it will be backing away from bringing important utilities into state ownership. In 2021, Starmer ruled out nationalisation of big energy firms and less than a year after that, Reeves added that other sectors would also remain in the private sector. Both Starmer and Reeves stressed that they needed to be “pragmatic” and not “ideological” about nationalisation. However, after swift criticism, the Labour leader added a caveat: public ownership of the rail network was still on the table. This, at least, is not a risk for them to take on – the Conservative government has already nationalised a chunk of the railway networks. *** Freedom of movement At one point Keir Starmer was a second-referendum supporting, EU flag-waving remainer. That version of the Labour leader may not recognise the man who is trying to become the next prime minister. Within two years of pledging to protect free movement if he made it to No 10, Starmer said that it had become a “red line” for Labour that it would not cross. Putting free movement back on the table is not an option any more as it would mean they would have to reopen the Brexit deal and that could lead to years of arguments with Brussels. *** House of Lords Despite promising to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with a smaller democratically elected chamber as part of plans to “restore trust in politics”, Starmer reportedly plans to appoint dozens of peers to the upper chamber. The argument is that it is the only way to get its legislation through parliament, as the Conservatives have packed the Lords. Critics, among them the Scottish National Party, have accused Labour of hypocrisy given Starmer’s strong stance against an unelected chamber. *** Rent control I can personally attest to the hell-scape that private renting has become. Renting a room in London is up 20%, with the average monthly bill hitting £952 in the first quarter of 2023. And tenants across the rest of the country are facing an average increase of 14%. Even with this squeeze, Labour ruled out rent controls as a policy option. Just last year Lisa Nandy had suggested that she was interested in the idea. Nandy said it was a “sticking plaster” solution to the UK’s housing crisis. A sticking plaster that would nonetheless be appreciated by many renters who would like some disposable income. *** Everything else … In addition, Labour has U-turned on: a £3bn tax on big tech, universal free childcare and the reinstitution of the Department for International Development. Starmer is not wrong to note that the country today is not the same as it was nearly four years ago, and the economic conditions much tougher. But his ruthless realignment of the party has been criticised as being “cold”, “paranoid” and lacking vision. Those in his own party have questioned whether some of his decisions are “democratic, transparent and fair”. While Starmer may well win the next general election, and possibly with a large majority, it’s unclear what policies will be left.

2022-08-11T12:56:59Z,What is a windfall tax and will it be extended to UK energy providers?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/what-is-a-windfall-tax-and-will-it-be-extended-to-uk-energy-providers,"Interest in a windfall tax on electricity generation companies has re-emerged after industry executives met the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Thursday. The former chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators in May. Here, we examine the issue. What is a windfall tax? A windfall tax is a one-off levy on a sector that has made huge profits from something they were not responsible for. The government has imposed windfall taxes on industries before: in 1981, the then Conservative chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, levied the banks, arguing they had benefited from high interest rates. In 1997, the Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, raised £5.2bn from a windfall tax on privatised utilities. The pressure is on energy and electricity companies to ease the cost of living crisis, with Brown having called for suppliers who cannot lower bills to be temporarily brought into public ownership. What has been introduced? Oil and gas prices have soared over the past year, notably since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, triggering calls for companies in the sector to be taxed on their outsized profits. Labour originally argued that a one-off, year-long windfall levy could raise £1.2bn to fund discounts on home energy bills. After splits within the cabinet, Sunak launched the energy profits levy (EPL) in May. It could be in place until the end of December 2025 and is aimed at raising £5bn as part of a £15bn support package for households. Who has been taxed? The EPL not only encompassed well-known firms, such as BP and Shell, but also lesser-known ones, such as Harbour Energy, which actually produces more oil from the North Sea than any other UK extractor. After the EPL was announced, BP and Shell said it may affect their green investments, but a BP executive has since admitted the levy will have no impact. BP and Shell – and the British Gas owner, Centrica – have since reported huge profits, causing further anger. Sunak had threatened to extend the tax to electricity generators, wiping billions from the value of their stock. However, he later cooled on the idea and Boris Johnson indicated the levy would not be introduced, triggering a partial recovery of the stock price. The average annual energy bill is now forecast to top £4,000 from January, bringing the government’s options for further support under the microscope. Who are the electricity generators? Britain has a diverse energy generation sector, including companies supplying power from gas- and coal-fired power plants, windfarms and nuclear stations. Centrica, ScottishPower and some others serve consumers directly, but many are focused on delivering power to retail suppliers. The biggest generators include SSE, E.ON, Ørsted and Drax, which runs a large eponymous power plant in North Yorkshire. It has been estimated that taxing generators could raise between £3bn and £4bn. However, the industry argues some companies have not enjoyed the bumper profits made in the oil and gas industry because they sell the power they generate far in advance at lower prices, so have yet to benefit from the surge in energy prices experienced this year. What is the government’s position? Any action that requires legislation to be changed is not imminent, with parliament in recess and the Tory leadership race not concluding until 5 September. The government has committed to not make any big fiscal decisions until Johnson leaves Downing Street. Ministers are rowing back from threatening energy companies with an even bigger windfall tax, after the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss and her ally Kwarteng – who opposed the EPL – made plain they would not support this option. There are also concerns that a tax on electricity generators could hit their green investment plans. Sources have said that ministers are keen to discuss investment, wholesale prices and security of supply with power generators, rather than a windfall tax. Would a windfall tax on generators solve the energy crisis? Extending the levy could raise £4bn, providing some firepower for the government to help with energy bills. However, far more is likely to be needed to cushion the blow for millions of struggling households as rampant inflation forces Britons to pay more for everything, from food to petrol.",Energy industry; Business; Tax and spending; Politics; UK news; UK cost of living crisis; Energy bills; Consumer affairs; Money,Business
2024-06-13T04:00:20Z,Dirty waters: how the Environment Agency lost its way,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/13/dirty-waters-how-the-environment-agency-lost-its-way,"When Helen Nightingale joined the National Rivers Authority, the predecessor to the Environment Agency, in 1991, she thought of her work as a calling. She had been fascinated by nature since she was a child, when she used to poke around in the earth on her father’s allotment, looking for worms and beetles. In her job, Nightingale spent most of her time walking along the rivers in Lancashire and Merseyside, taking water samples and testing oxygen levels. She was responsible for protecting rivers, and she often learned about sewage and pesticide pollution from members of the public who called a dedicated hotline. “They’d phone you up and say, ‘There’s something wrong.’ And you would go out straight away,” she recalled. “You stood a much better chance of figuring out what was wrong if you could get there quickly.” Nightingale, who has a Lancastrian accent and curly blond hair, investigated pollution like a hard-nosed police detective inspecting a crime scene. She would visit dairy farms, industrial estates and sewage treatment plants, dressed in a raincoat and boots with steel toe caps, and usually started with the same question: “Can I look at your drains?” The work was demanding, and the pay, when Nightingale started, was just £9,500 a year (the UK average at the time was around £12,000), but she was proud to be protecting the environment. “It was a dream job,” she told me. “If we sat in the office, our boss would say, ‘Why are you here? Go out and look at something.’” In 1996, when the authority merged with Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Pollution to become the Environment Agency, Nightingale’s team were also given responsibility for inspecting recycling centres and waste companies, which meant they had less time for river inspections. Over the years, Nightingale felt as though staff were spending less time proactively looking for pollution, and more time doing box-ticking inspections of waste sites. Rather than taking her water samples to a local laboratory where she knew the biologists, she now sent these off to a centralised lab, from which it could take weeks to get results. By the time the results came back, she says it was often too late to find out why the river was deteriorating. From 2010 onwards, after the coalition government took power, these dynamics accelerated. The water teams were given fewer resources, and their staff numbers shrank. Then, in 2021, Nightingale and her colleagues were told that they would have to stop investigating many of the calls from the public. “We do not have sufficient funding to continue to provide our current level of environment management,” read a briefing that the agency sent to its staff that November. “This is not an easy transition … [we] have made it clear to government that you get the environment you pay for.” Freedom of information (FoI) requests show that, based on data available up until 2022, in 2018 staff attended 5,013 pollution incidents; by 2023, that number had fallen by 36%. Last year, English water companies discharged untreated sewage nearly half a million times, and tens of beaches are now regularly declared unsafe for swimmers. Rivers aren’t the only area where the Environment Agency doesn’t seem to be doing enough. According to numerous reports, some of them by the agency itself, Britain’s environment is in a terrible condition. Vast areas of natural habitat have either been degraded or destroyed, leaving the country with some of the lowest measures of biodiversity in Europe. Around one in six species are at risk of becoming extinct. Of the 40 environmental targets the government set for itself after Brexit, which include managing the use of harmful chemicals and improving air quality, the country is now on track to reach just four. For a long time, this ongoing ruination occurred mostly unnoticed, with only campaigners, scientists and anglers raising the alarm. But over the past five years, the condition of England’s environment, particularly its rivers, has become a potent source of anger. Three-quarters of the constituencies with the worst rates of sewage discharges are held by Conservative MPs, a fact their opponents hope to capitalise on in the upcoming election. The Telegraph, which is usually no fan of regulation, has launched a Clean Rivers Campaign criticising water companies. The Times has done the same. There have been documentaries about sewage, parliamentary inquiries and a touring opera. Almost everyone seems to agree that the condition of England’s environment isn’t good enough. Yet at first glance, this is puzzling: the country has plenty of laws for penalising pollution, ambitious recent targets enshrining the protection of nature, and a well-staffed regulator with the powers to enforce them. In theory, England’s Environment Agency should resemble a fourth emergency service, somewhere between an ambulance and a police force for nature. In practice, it is struggling to improve the environment’s health, or to prevent the pollution that is destroying it. When Nightingale retired in June 2022, she sent a terse email to her colleagues with the subject line, “Bye then, I’ll get my coat.” She wrote: “We seem to spend more time and effort avoiding attending incidents than actually going to them now. Water quality is deteriorating, [and] we don’t really know how much because we’ve stopped looking.” Instead of protecting the environment, Nightingale and other former staff members I spoke to felt as though the agency had become a witness to its decline. Between 2007 and 2021, the number of prosecutions it brought fell from 800 to just 17. It is not just disgruntled former employees who sense that the organisation isn’t doing enough: three current members of staff told this newspaper in 2022 that the agency had been cut back so far that it could no longer improve the environment or deter polluters. Even its current chair has admitted that he does not think his agency is “doing a good job at the moment”. But if the Environment Agency is failing in its mission, the question remains: how – and why – was it allowed to fall into such disrepair? * * * Few environmental regulators in Europe have such a vast range of responsibilities as England’s Environment Agency. It forecasts floods, sells fishing licences to anglers, and tracks coastal erosion. It advises the government on net zero, prosecutes criminal gangs that make money from illegally dumping waste, protects England from radioactive substances, and provides a public database of scrap metal dealers. It sets the environmental standards for water companies, including how often they are allowed to discharge raw sewage, and can fine and prosecute companies that break these rules. The agency has an annual budget of more than £2bn and a staff of nearly 13,400 people, including freshwater ecologists and hydrologists, experts in macroinvertebrates and the disposal of nuclear waste, research scientists, statisticians and fisheries officers who know more about the spawning patterns of salmon and pike than you could ever hope to learn. Over the past five months, I’ve spoken to more than 30 people, from former chairs and chief executives of the agency to frontline officers and water scientists, as well as campaigners, lawyers and environmentalists who come across the agency in their everyday and professional lives. Many had positive things to say about the agency’s technical expertise and the calibre of its staff, but the one thing everyone agreed was that it has been significantly weakened during the past 14 years of Conservative government. The impression many gave was of a demoralised and paranoid organisation that had been severely undermined by austerity. “It’s an organisation that routinely pulls people up for trivial health and safety breaches while not funding their day job correctly. It’s an organisation where [leaders] say that talking to the press is a disciplinary matter. It’s a nasty organisation,” said one former fisheries officer. The Environment Agency is a public body overseen by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which provides much of its funding. For a long time, the agency’s expertise and independence meant that it could be critical of government policies. “I was quite frank about that,” says John Selwyn Gummer, the former Conservative environment minister who signed the Environment Agency into law in 1995. “If I wanted to get the cabinet to do the right things, I had to have an independent environment agency telling me when I’m getting it wrong.” In 2008, the agency published a damning report arguing the proposal to add a third runway at Heathrow, which was a popular idea among Labour ministers, would breach controls on air pollution. (The runway has still not been built.) “We were at that time entirely able to say, ‘Our responsibility is to the environment, and this is what that responsibility leads us to conclude,’” says Chris Smith, who was chair of the agency from 2008 to 2014. When the new coalition government arrived in 2010, the prime minister David Cameron boasted about going to war with public bodies as part of his commitment to cutting “red tape” and making the state more accountable. To cut spending, the government began to close down public bodies. Others, including the Environment Agency, were threatened with drastic reforms. The government took away the agency’s independent website, and merged its press office with Defra’s. “The idea was that the agency should be seen but not heard,” says Barbara Young, its chief executive from 2000 to 2008. “I always think it’s a mark of a sophisticated democracy if, having invented a watchdog, you don’t take its teeth out and muzzle it the minute it starts to bark.” But that was precisely what was happening, she believes. When I mentioned this to Gummer, he was blunter: the Cameron-led government “didn’t have the confidence in their ability to deal with these things, and didn’t like criticism, so they wanted to put the cap on it”, he said. (An agency spokesperson told me that the Environment Agency “operates independently of Defra and has full control of its press and communications”, and that “press statements are always agreed and signed off by the EA”.) Whitehall tightened its grip over the agency, and neutered its approach to the industries it was supposed to police. In 2012, Cameron commissioned a report by Michael Heseltine called No Stone Unturned: In Pursuit of Growth, which recommended that all “non-economic regulators” – from the Environment Agency to English Heritage – should be held accountable for the economic consequences of their decisions. Two years later, the government introduced a new code stipulating that such regulators should avoid imposing unnecessary “burdens” on businesses, and consider how they could best “enable economic growth”. Every regulator now had to abide by a government-mandated “growth duty”. The Department for Business identified fines, and the negative publicity that stemmed from companies breaking the rules, as particular threats to growth. When I spoke to Heseltine recently, he defended the logic behind his 2012 report, arguing that “enhancing the environment is often determined by your ability to finance the enhancement – and that depends upon the economic performance of the economy”. Yet the economy remained sluggish, while the environment continued to deteriorate. The new guidance encouraged regulators to treat fines and prosecutions as a last resort. “With water companies, with big business, you can see a trajectory downwards over the past 10 years, where we’ve developed a soft touch,” said an Environment Agency source who now works in water regulation. Meanwhile, funding for environmental protection was cut by 80% between 2010 and 2021, meaning that the agency now has far fewer resources to investigate companies that might be breaking the rules. Of its many thousands of staff, just 91 people are qualified to inspect the plants where sewage is treated. “I think the cuts were also a way of silencing the EA,” said a retired staff member who worked on policy issues. “It was a way of saying: get back in your box. There was a realisation that it is expensive to have a high-quality environment.” These reforms and cuts meant that the Environment Agency found itself in an impossible position, torn between irreconcilable objectives. It was supposed to penalise environmental crimes, but it had also been told to prioritise economic growth. It was responsible for ensuring companies weren’t polluting rivers, but it had also been encouraged to let those companies police themselves. These changes seemed to be driven by something more insidious than fiscal discipline. “There is a missing political analysis in all this,” said Tom Burke, the former director of Friends of the Earth, who was a special adviser to three secretaries of state for the environment – Heseltine, Michael Howard and Gummer – from 1991-97. “The government knew it couldn’t have a political argument about winding back environmental law, because the public likes environmental law. So instead, they set out to kill environmental law by stealth.” * * * It can be tempting to blame the deterioration of England’s rivers on water companies alone, but there is another big problem that the Environment Agency has done remarkably little to police. Agricultural pollution affects more lakes and rivers in England than sewage releases, and the number of “megafarms” in England – livestock farms that house 40,000 or more chickens, or at least 2,000 pigs reared for meat – has increased by 20% since 2016. Yet the agency’s approach to farmers remains cautious. Rather than prosecuting rule-breakers, it prefers a gentler approach: offering advice, guidance and occasionally a letter of warning. “The agency continues to peddle this rubbish about having a chat over the farmyard kitchen table,” says Guy Linley-Adams, an environmental solicitor. “When you’re dealing with huge industrial operations with sophisticated accounting and management, they don’t need to be told that putting fertiliser too close to water causes a problem. They already know.” Within Defra, the balance of power is tilted firmly towards agriculture. Five of the department’s current six ministers either own land or come from farming families. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU), which represents 46,000 farming and growing businesses across the UK, enjoys political access that would be the envy of any lobbyist. Its headquarters occupy 18 Smith Square in London. Next door, at number 17, are Defra’s offices. The farmer’s lobby gets results. Since 2018, “neonicotinoids”, harmful pesticides that kill bees, have been banned in the EU. After lobbying from the NFU, Defra has granted farmers “emergency authorisation” to use them on sugar beets every year for the past four years. Meanwhile, the agency has long known that farmers have been spreading fields with a toxic mixture of chemicals and carcinogens. In 2020, an FoI request revealed the agency had been warned about the dangers of this practice in a report that it commissioned and then chose not to publish. Last year, the agency pledged to take action against this harmful practice, but on the ground it seems that nothing has changed. “It’s a real ‘tail wags dog’,” Barbara Young, the agency’s former chief executive, said of the relationship between farmers and the government. The less powerful the agency has become, the less farmers have come to fear the consequences of breaking its rules. An FoI request from 2020 showed that the average farm would be inspected by the agency once every 263 years. (In 2021, the agency received additional funding to hire more agricultural inspectors. A spokesperson said that it has carried out more than 10,000 farm inspections since 2021 – which amounts to no more than about 3% of farms per year.) Occasionally, the agency’s own reports will give a dark glimpse of its shortcomings as a regulator. In 2016, it began a three-year study of the River Axe in Devon, where water pollution is a major concern. Officers visited 86 farms along the Axe, all of which belonged to the Red Tractor scheme, which is supposed to assure supermarket shoppers of high farming standards. Nearly every single farm failed to comply with storage requirements for slurry, fuel and oil. Some farmers were illegally burning waste on the banks of the river, others were spreading dangerous volumes of slurry on to fields, and 49% of the farms were discharging pollution into the river. Not a single farmer was prosecuted or formally cautioned. Several former staff members told me this leniency stems from the government. British farmers have long felt under increasing economic pressure, and recently many have been struggling with the loss of EU subsidies, which are being phased out after Brexit. Ministers are keen not to add to these difficulties. Earlier this year, Defra officials, concerned about ministerial reactions, chose to bury a report about the bleak financial prospects for hill farmers when these subsidies are phased out completely in 2027. Confronting the problems caused by intensive farming would be like pulling at a thread on an unravelling jumper. While the government has introduced a fiendishly complex patchwork of post-Brexit subsidies that encourage farmers to conserve hedgerows and maintain peatlands, this will only go so far. If ministers seriously wanted to tackle farming practices, they would also have to take on the big supermarkets, which drive down prices and force farms to ruthlessly maximise their yields. And then they would have to start asking even bigger questions, such as whether our environment can continue supporting the production of £2.70 chickens that sustain low-wage Britain. “I’d say that most farmers want to do the right thing by climate and nature, but they can’t just do it out of the goodness of their hearts,” said Joseph Gridley, the chief executive of the Soil Association Exchange, a company that helps farmers transition to more sustainable practices. “For the past 70 years, most of the incentives in place have encouraged farmers to not do good things for the environment. I think there’s a degree of frustration. Farmers feel, ‘You’ve set up a system for us to do it one way, and now you’re blaming us.’” Very rarely, a farmer does something so egregious that the agency is forced to prosecute. In November 2020, John Price, a Herefordshire farmer known for his irascible temper and run-ins with local environmentalists, dispatched his farmhands to drive an 18-tonne bulldozer through the River Lugg. Price owns 1,000 hectares of land that sits beside the Lugg, a river with such a diversity of species that it is officially designated as a conservation site. His plan was to dredge the riverbed to prevent flooding. Responding to a tipoff, an official from a local nature charity drove down to the Lugg and photographed the bulldozer on his phone. He returned to his car, started to drive away, and then saw another car coming in the opposite direction. It was Price. The farmer sped behind him for 12 miles, flashing his lights and shouting at him to stop. When that didn’t work, Price parked his car across the road, blocking it entirely. (Price later claimed that he was concerned the official was photographing his partner and children.) These details came to light in a case heard at Herefordshire crown court in April 2023. “Any person, with even a passing interest in the countryside and conservation, could not fail to be dismayed by the devastation caused by Mr Price,” the judge told the court. “He has turned a traditional, tree-lined, meandering river, full of wildlife, into a canal void of most life. It is nothing short of ecological vandalism on an industrial scale.” Rather than preventing flooding, this stretch of the river was now deeper, wider and straighter than ever, so water flowed faster, increasing the risk of flooding downstream. It was, one former agency staff member told me, “the worst environmental crime I’ve ever seen”. Price pleaded guilty to seven offences and was sentenced to 12 months in prison (he served three). The story was widely covered, partly because it is the only case in which a landowner has been imprisoned under laws that target farming pollution. The agency has documented hundreds of cases where farmers seem to be violating these laws, but in 2021 it revealed that it had not issued a single fine to any of them. (A spokesperson said that since 2019, it has “prosecuted 21 cases on agricultural sites” – but only two of these were for breaking the rules that are supposed to target river pollution caused by farmers.) Although it has recently recruited 84 new farm inspectors, these inspectors will seek to pursue “advice-led regulation”, rather than more aggressive investigation and enforcement. “Even when it looks like they’re about to tackle the sector,” said the source, who now works at the agency, “they do it with the softest touch imaginable.” * * * In my conversations with former agency staff, one phrase kept coming up: “Boots on the ground.” Over and over, these former staffers emphasised how much more you notice about a landscape when you spend regular time in it. This could be something as subtle as a cloud of water crowfoot that is missing from a chalk stream, or a river that has fewer grayling than usual. “You’ve got to have an understanding of how rivers work, how they work in flood, where the key spots are, where the pollution hotspots are, the geography, the landscape … and you can’t buy that,” says Dave Throup, the agency’s former area manager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Several former staff members told me that officers are losing this understanding. “People tend to be in the office now,” said another former fisheries officer. The mood among staff who have worked at the agency over the past 10 years is often despondent. An internal staff survey carried out in 2021 reflected diminishing levels of job satisfaction and increasing workplace stress. Defra has some of the lowest salaries of any central government department, and a new environment officer will earn no more than about £25,000 a year. Almost 9,000 people have left since 2016, many of them older and experienced specialists. Managers have made it clear that staff concerns should not be aired in public. In 2022, agency officers said they had been warned against speaking to the media. This fear of negative coverage may help explain why the agency can seem reluctant to share information with the public. “It’s a very opaque organisation. It’s incredibly secretive,” said Ashley Smith, a former police detective and the co-founder of Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, a prominent campaign group. The agency’s current chair, Alan Lovell, recently told MPs that it receives 48,000 FoI requests a year – nearly as many as every department in Whitehall put together. “We do not publish enough material easily, so people have to go with FoI because they cannot get hold of things they want to know,” he said. Earlier this year, Philip Duffy, the agency’s current chief executive, told an audience at a water event that staff sometimes evaded these requests because disclosing the truth would be too “embarrassing” (a spokesperson at the time said that Duffy “wants to make more Environment Agency data readily available, and we are already looking at how this can be achieved”). Some former staff seem to think the agency has failed to notice rivers deteriorating. “The attitude from the higher-ups was really a sense of, ‘If we did a better job at finding pollution, there would be more of an expectation that we would then have to do something about [it],’” said one former staff member. Peter Lloyd, a retired water quality expert who worked at the agency for nearly 40 years, told a parliamentary inquiry in 2021 that its monitoring was “so poor, so inadequate and so misleading”, and he worries that this is getting worse. Lloyd argues that a new system that gives a national overview of the state of England’s rivers will obscure the changes within specific rivers, or the different types of pollution that occur within them. Without such information, people can draw wildly different conclusions. In 2019, for example, the then chief executive of the agency, James Bevan, wrote that Britain’s water quality is “better than at any time since the Industrial Revolution” – a claim that has not aged well. “This suggestion that water quality has got better, a lot of that is because [the agency doesn’t] go and look,” says Throup, the former Environment Agency area manager. “If you don’t look, you don’t find.” * * * This year, flooding in the south-west of England has deluged crops and left fields underwater. As the climate crisis intensifies, pressure will grow on the agency to protect homes and farmland, and the costs of doing so will escalate. Earlier this year, the agency slashed a quarter of flood projects it had planned to deliver in the next six years, owing to rising construction costs. Yet flood protection was one of the few areas that former staff I spoke with took pride in. When a bad flood hits, agency staff become the green-fleeced responders who arrive at the rescue. “You were doing eight-hour shifts five to six days a week, two to three weeks at a time. But people wanted to do it. The adrenaline was going,” says Throup, who was sent all over England to help with the agency’s flood response. He became so popular among flooded-out locals in Herefordshire that they petitioned for him to get an MBE. “What Dave Throup doesn’t know about rivers and flooding isn’t worth knowing,” it read. During natural disasters, the organisation has also proved a useful scapegoat for the government. In 2014, when the Somerset Levels experienced the wettest winter in 250 years, the government turned on the agency for being slow to dredge the county’s main river, a practice that most experts agree is a poor solution to flood management. Eric Pickles, then communities secretary, lambasted its staff on television. “We were dealing with the Environment Agency,” he said. “We thought we were dealing with experts.” In this skirmish between the agency and the government, it was possible to glimpse the outlines of a larger battle, between those who insist we will be able to engineer our way out of the climate crisis, and those who think that we will need to work with nature, not against it. “There’s an undercurrent of not believing this so-called green crap,” said Linley-Adams, the lawyer. “And that’s all rolled into this idea that we can dominate nature. We can dredge the rivers, drain the land.” This is perhaps the greatest challenge at the heart of the agency’s work: it is responsible for protecting an environment that is being degraded by processes it cannot control. There are good reasons why the agency should hand out more fines to rule-breaking farmers and bring criminal charges against the bosses of malfeasant water companies. But this would only go so far. Truly protecting and restoring the environment would require dramatic changes, particularly in how we use land – and these changes would extend far beyond the agency’s remit. “Ultimately, we want to get to a place where we’re asking, ‘What is the best use for this parcel of land?’ In some cases, it will be food production [or] conservation. And in some cases, it will be much better to use that land for the environmental [benefits] it could deliver,” said David Johnson, the technical director at the Rivers Trust, who worked at the agency from 2000 to 2010. This, in turn, would require a deeper shift: valuing land differently, seeing it not as a resource for maximising crop yields or building housing equity, but as the answer to a collective problem. A radical, democratic national plan on this scale is hard to imagine in Britain, where developers continue to build on flood plains, intensive farming rumbles on, and no property owner wants to imagine their house becoming a stranded asset. * * * How much might things improve under a Labour government? The party recently announced a new plan to restore and protect at least 30% of Britain’s natural environment by 2030. This would introduce a land-use framework to encourage more sustainable farming, and would ban some harmful pesticides. These are laudable goals, but delivering them will cost money – something Labour seems unwilling to commit to. The party has already cut its £28bn green investment pledge by half. And its refusal to introduce further tax rises, coupled with the fiscal rules the party has adopted, means that spending on everything but health, defence and schools could fall by as much as £20bn. Some staff I spoke to felt that the relationship between the government, polluting industries and the regulators had long been too cosy. A number of people with connections to the Labour party have recently taken up jobs at Water UK, the trade association for the water companies. On water, at least, some things seem to be improving. Public pressure has led to a flurry of activity, and in 2021, the Environment Agency, with Ofwat, announced that it was conducting its largest ever criminal investigation into the water companies in England and Wales (this is still ongoing, but its initial assessment has suggested “widespread and serious non-compliance” by “all companies”). The government has given the agency funding to recruit 500 new staff, and Defra has announced an “inspection surge” of water companies. As the scale of sewage pollution has come to light, officials within the agency have become more combative towards the water companies, and more willing to accept criticism of its failures. “We have not been doing our job well enough and we will correct those areas,” Duffy recently said. Cleaning up rivers has become an electoral issue that commands near-universal support. Conservatives are now being forced to reckon with the consequences of cutting the agency’s funding and encouraging it to take a softer approach. This has resulted in the absurd spectacle of public arguments about who is to blame for the state of rivers conducted by the very people who are responsible for the state of rivers. The only thing on which ministers seem to agree is that it is all someone else’s fault. Yet despite all the talk of pollution, neither Labour nor the Conservatives have pledged to restore the money cut from the agency’s budget since 2010. Since Helen Nightingale left the Environment Agency in 2022, she has been looking after her husband, who has Parkinson’s. She potters in her garden, and talks about England’s rivers with the bitter frustration of someone who tried to warn others of an unfolding scandal, only for those warnings to be ignored. “Water pollution seemed to just not be seen as significant or important. But not now. Oh no,” she said, addressing her former managers as if they were present in the room. “Water quality is suddenly very important. You didn’t have your eye on the ball!” • Follow the Long Read on X at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 20 July 2024.

2023-02-05T09:00:17Z,"In the global race to dominate green technology, Britain is still tying its shoelaces",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/05/global-race-dominate-green-technology-britain-still-tying-its-shoelaces,"The United States is out of the blocks. The European Union is hurrying along the track. China is competing too. Here in dear old blighty, we are not even at the starting line. While others are dashing towards the horizon, the UK still hasn’t tied its laces. The government appears to have barely noticed that there is a global race to dominate the green technologies of the future. In investment attracted, jobs created, income earned and lives bettered, the prizes for the winners will be huge. In prosperity foregone, the penalty for the laggards will be severe. In the US, Joe Biden’s administration has embarked on a $2tn programme to transform America’s economy. A big chunk of that money is intended to incentivise investment in technologies ranging from battery production to green hydrogen. It is driven by five goals: to decarbonise the economy, create well-paid jobs, gain an American advantage in the markets of the future, foster supply chains that are less reliant on authoritarian states and establish energy security. Anxious that the Biden plan will lure vital industries and cutting-edge tech away from Europe to the US, the EU plans to relax its rules on state aid to allow a wave of tax credits for green investment and speed up the approval of clean energy projects. China is spending huge sums in pursuit of its ambitions to be the world leader in areas such as solar panel production. While this contest has disturbingly protectionist aspects, there is also a big positive. Better that the great powers compete with each other to save the planet than to burn it. The UK, a medium-size player that has detached itself from its nearest economic bloc, cannot match the vast incentives and subsidies the behemoths are throwing into this race. So our best hope of having a stake in the industries of the future is to maximise what leverage we possess by being agile, creative and purposeful. A swath of recent studies have all reached broadly similar and alarming conclusions. The UK’s response to this global pivot is worse than sluggish. When warp-speed thinking is required, the government is moving with the pace of an arthritic snail. All the major global actors are putting substantial sums into securing supplies of semiconductors, the brains in everything from electric vehicles to wind turbines. Our government was supposed to unveil a UK plan for semiconductor security last autumn. Sign of it there is still none. The business select committee was right when it warned on Friday that the absence of any strategy in this vital area is “an act of national self-harm” that will leave the UK perilously exposed. In the wake of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and the rocketing gas and oil prices that followed, Boris Johnson launched what was supposed to be an energy security strategy. That was 10 months ago and was accompanied by the claim that the nuclear component would be accelerated by the immediate establishment of a “flagship body” called Great British Nuclear. This promise has gone the way of so many of that bloviator’s empty boasts. Simon Bowen, the industry expert who was appointed to advise on GBN’s creation, recently told MPs that it still doesn’t exist, ministers have not set out “a plan which tells us which technologies we need and when and where” and no funding has been agreed. “The piece that is missing at the moment is the overarching strategy.” Quite an important piece to be missing, wouldn’t you say? Chris Skidmore, a former science minister, was made “net zero tsar” by Liz Truss. You should not hold that provenance against him, because he is a thoughtful man who recently produced a timely report. Its polite and technical language did not disguise its scathing conclusions. His comprehensive review, running to more than 300 pages and drawing on more than 50 roundtables across the country, recorded failure after failure. Investment in renewables has been stifled by government U-turns and prevarication, such as the endless scrapping among Tories about whether they want to encourage more onshore wind or to prohibit it. New homes are still being built with no regard to net zero standards. Old ones are leaking heat for lack of an effective insulation programme. Mr Skidmore added his voice to those warning that the transition to clean energy is a global race for potentially vast markets that the UK cannot afford to lose. It doesn’t have to be like this. There is a large reservoir of public support for energetic action to green the economy and end our dangerous dependency on planet-destroying fossil fuels. Even when Britons have a lot of other stuff to make them anxious – a collapsing NHS, a cost of living crunch, waves of strikes in essential services – the climate crisis still commands a place in the top four of voters’ concerns. Britain has the talent to excel in some of the technologies that will be critical in the 21st century. The UK has been a pioneer in developing carbon capture and offshore wind, which accounted for about a quarter of our electricity generation in 2022. But there is a growing fear that the UK is squandering its advantages and not exploiting its opportunities. The consequences could be devastating for the economy. The British car industry, which supports a lot of jobs, is highly anxious that it will be a casualty of the end of the combustion engine without a supply of domestically produced batteries to put into electrical vehicles. Gigafactories are essential for the volume manufacturing of EVs. For all the rhetoric about being in the vanguard of the “green industrial revolution”, the UK only has one battery factory compared with an estimated 100 in China. The hope of establishing a second crumbled when Britishvolt, a venture near Blyth, Northumberland, collapsed into insolvency last month. Some of the blame belongs with Brexit, which has made the UK a less appealing destination for investment. Culpability also lies with the incessant instability since the referendum. We need a long-term plan to invest in the R&amp;D, skills and infrastructure necessary for a green economy, but that’s not going to happen when you have a succession of short-term prime ministers too consumed by scandals and scrabbling for their survival to think about the future. It is impossible for government to give confidence to business when Number 10 is a revolving door of chaos. Being a serious competitor in this race will require an industrial strategy, a concept to which many Tories are ideologically allergic. Rishi Sunak has had nothing of substance to say about the green transition since he became prime minister. It is a huge handicap that the Conservative party is so divided within itself about net zero. Some Tories do understand the imperative. Others scoff at what David Cameron once derided as “green crap”. I still meet a few who think the climate crisis is a hoax concocted by a conspiracy involving Extinction Rebellion, Sir David Attenborough and Beijing. Many Tories can think of net zero only as a painful burden to be moaned about and never as a fabulous opportunity to be eagerly seized. The way the polls are looking, it is more likely that the great challenge of moving to a net zero world will fall to a government led by Sir Keir Starmer. Labour is talking a much more positive game with its green prosperity plan. Features include the promise of zero-carbon electricity by 2030 and a programme to retrofit insulation to 19m homes. Some in Labour’s ranks fret that it is a bit too bold on the grounds that the Tories will attack the affordability of the price tag and on the assumption that greenery lacks appeal to voters in “red wall” seats. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary and an evangelist for green growth, has had talks with Biden team members about how they conceived and promoted the US government’s transition programme. Labour has broadly borrowed from the way the US president sold it to his voters. Says one senior Labour figure: “It works when you make it a (energy) bills issue, a jobs issue, a security issue and a climate issue.” The green prosperity plan is the most audacious and future-facing element in Sir Keir’s otherwise rather cautious prospectus. The Labour leader has now made it so central to his pitch for revitalising Britain that he couldn’t back away even if he were minded to. Which is good. The only future economy is a green economy. The coming decades will see one of the greatest industrial transformations in human history. The UK needs to be at the races, not fiddling with its laces while others speed away down the track leaving us for dust. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer • This article was amended on 5 February 2023.

2022-12-07T18:26:26Z,Cumbria coalmine approval shows Sunak does not care whether he is seen as green,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/07/cumbria-coalmine-approval-shows-sunak-does-not-care-if-he-is-seen-as-green,"Opening a new coalmine when the world stands on the brink of climate catastrophe is “absolutely indefensible”, in the words of the UK government’s independent climate adviser, the chair of the Climate Change Committee and the former Conservative minister Lord Deben. The £165m mine in Cumbria will produce coking coal for steelmaking, which the government has said will still be needed, even though steelmakers must move to low-carbon production in the next 13 years. Two of the UK’s existing steel companies have rejected the new coal, which means much of it will be exported to a world already awash with fossil fuels. Ron Deelen, a former chief executive of British Steel, said: “This is a completely unnecessary step for the British steel industry, which is not waiting for more coal as there is enough on the free market available. The British steel industry needs green investment in electric arc furnaces and hydrogen to protect jobs and make the UK competitive.” The decision, and the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, have been roundly condemned around the world. At the UN Cop27 climate summit last month, one of the key flashpoints was the charge of hypocrisy levelled by the developing world against rich countries that have preached lower emissions to the poor while pursuing fossil fuels themselves. The rift threatens to reverse the progress made at the UK-hosted Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year, where the UK succeeded in committing all countries to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “As a historical emitter responsible for the current state of the climate crisis, the UK cannot expand or invest in any new fossil fuel projects,” said Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network International. “No coal, no gas, no oil. They need to start demonstrating their commitment to 1.5C through actions and not just words.” Pressing ahead with the Cumbrian mine shows that Sunak has little interest in whether his government is seen as green or not. This week, he made a U-turn on onshore wind, with the first moves to partially relax the ban on onshore turbines in England announced just ahead of the coalmine. He may also relent further on solar farms, as the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, hinted on Tuesday they could be built on mid-grade agricultural land pending a review set for the middle of next year. Soon after taking office in October, Sunak also restored the moratorium on fracking. But these apparently positive moves should be seen as short-term tactical decisions, taken in light of parliamentary manoeuvrings, public pressure and the urgent need to expand the UK’s energy supplies in the wake of the Ukraine war. They do not denote a coherent green vision. Green Tories hark back fondly to Boris Johnson, whose green record in government may have been patchy but whose soaring rhetoric at least was reliably eco-friendly. Sunak has no such pretensions – he publicly dithered over whether to attend Cop27, souring relations with the developing world and disappointing allies such as the US and the EU. When he finally changed his mind and attended, he still forbade the king to go, a kick to the many Commonwealth countries in which King Charles is head of state and a cold shoulder to the Egyptian hosts (who retaliated by inviting Johnson). The Cumbrian decision has been taken while the fate of the planet is being decided by world governments once again at the Cop15 summit on biodiversity in Montreal this week. Under Johnson, the UK championed the idea of conserving 30% of the planet for nature by 2030, the centrepiece pledge of Cop15. Under Sunak, who is not going to Canada, the UK is not on track to reach its own nature protection targets. By nearly every green measure, the UK is failing. A scathing report by Deben’s Climate Change Committee this summer showed “major policy failures” and “scant evidence of delivery” on everything from public transport and food consumption to farming and tree-planting. Sunak’s policies since then have done little to remedy the situation. While people on low incomes are being forced to choose between eating and heating, at least a quarter of heating energy is wasted in leaks from the draughtiest housing stock in western Europe. An announced boost to insulation will result in about 70,000 more homes being insulated over three years but that falls well short of the nationwide programme of retrofit for 14m homes that experts and the building industry have called for. The switch from gas to heat pumps is moving at glacial speed, muddied by claims that hydrogen could be used instead in boilers despite expert advice that this is technically impossible. Even with the deadline on sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, greenhouse gas emissions from transport remain stubbornly high, fuelled by rising numbers of SUVs, the chaos in our rail networks and an absence of buses for most of the country outside London. There are green voices within Sunak’s cabinet. Michael Gove, a self-identified “shy green Tory”, was acclaimed as one of the UK’s best environment secretaries, who brought forward a 25-year environmental plan and started three key pieces of legislation – the Environment Act, Agriculture Act and Fisheries Act – during his two-year tenure from 2017 to 2019. The business secretary, Grant Shapps, was an enthusiastic attender at Cop27, telling an aide beforehand “I really believe this stuff”. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, joined the Conservative Environment Network early this year while on the backbenches, proclaiming: “Now. more than ever, in light of the global gas crisis and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s vital we decarbonise the UK’s economy by 2050. We must develop more homegrown clean energy, including renewables and new nuclear. This will lower people’s bills, strengthen our energy security and avoid the worst consequences of climate change.” Yet Gove has been made the frontman for the Cumbrian mine decision, and Hunt and Shapps have been given minimal cash for green policy. Sunak demoted Alok Sharma who, after the success of Cop26, was probably the UK’s most recognisable and lauded green champion internationally, after the king and Sir David Attenborough. The climate minister, Graham Stuart, was stripped of the right to attend cabinet. Scientists have made it clear this year, in the “bleakest warning yet” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that this decade is crucial if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C, a target now looking increasingly difficult but no less vital. Worldwide, emissions must be cut by half in the 2020s, compared with 2010 levels. That will require concerted global action, particularly from the world’s biggest economies, which are responsible for by far the biggest share of cumulative emissions. In the remaining two years before a general election, there is much that this government could do – insulating houses, improving public transport, expanding clean energy. All of these, though requiring public investment, would quickly help to put cash back into people’s pockets, generate new jobs and alleviate the cost of living crisis. Failure to take these measures now will mean more costly action is needed in the future, when it may be too late. Two years is a big chunk of a crucial decade.",Coal; Mining; Environment; Fossil fuels; Cumbria; UK news; England; Energy; Politics; Rishi Sunak,Environment
2023-07-07T15:21:43Z,Missions v priorities: how Starmer’s policy goals compare with Sunak’s,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/07/missions-v-priorities-how-starmer-policy-goals-compare-with-sunak-labour,"Keir Starmer announced the last of his five missions this week: removing barriers to opportunity. With the announcement, voters are now able to compare the Labour leader’s ideas with those of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who laid out his own five priorities at the beginning of the year. So what does each man want to achieve? And can he do it? Sunak’s five priorities 1. Halving inflation Sunak has made his top priority dealing with the economic mess created in part by the botched mini-budget of his predecessor, Liz Truss, which sent interest rates soaring. The problem is, he has relatively few tools to achieve his goal. Detail: Sunak has promised to halve the rate of the consumer prices index, which was 10.7% when he spoke. Unlike with some of his other pledges, he put a timeline on it: by the end of the year. So if CPI is not below 5.35% by the end of December, he will have failed. 5/5 Affordability: Sunak does not need to spend anything to bring down inflation, in fact he needs to do the opposite. To damp down demand in the economy, the prime minister must resist calls to cut taxes and to spend more government money. 5/5 Impact: Almost nothing would have a more immediate impact on voters’ pockets than cutting inflation. Although if the government and the Bank of England overshoot and cut demand too much, they risk triggering a recession. 5/5 Deliverability: Sunak may have thought he was being clever by promising something forecasters said would happen anyway. But with inflation proving unexpectedly stubborn at 8.7%, ministers are now admitting that the real power lies with the Bank. 1/5 2. Growing the economy Along with cutting inflation, Sunak has promised to grow the economy. The problem is that these two priorities clash: more austere fiscal and monetary policies are likely to cut inflation; looser ones will help boost growth. Detail: Downing Street has clarified that this pledge will be met if gross domestic product is higher in the fourth quarter than the previous three months. So if there is 0.1% GDP growth in the final quarter of this year, he will have succeeded. 5/5 Affordability: It all depends on how Sunak decides to meet this pledge. If he relies on supply-side reforms in the style of Truss, such as cutting regulations, it will not cost much. But many Tory MPs want him to go further and cut taxes. 4/5 Impact: A growing economy would obviously bring a lot of benefits. But for the pledge to be met he needs only 0.1% growth, which many economists would describe as stagnation. 1/5 Deliverability: The prime minister can increase public spending, cut taxes or reduce red tape to boost GDP. The problem is that using them also risks stoking inflation. In the last four quarters, GDP has risen 0.1% three times and fallen 0.1% once. 3/5 3. Cutting debt The prime minister has been far less clear about what his final economic pledge means or when he expects to deliver it. Cutting debt usually means reducing it as a proportion of GDP, something not forecast to start happening until 2027-28. Detail: Presuming Sunak means cutting public sector net debt as a proportion of GDP, we at least know what he means. But we have no idea when he intends to do it, except for the fact that the government’s fiscal rules mean it must be forecast to fall by the end of a five-year period. 2/5 Affordability: The conditions needed to cut public sector debt are similar to those needed to bring down inflation: Sunak needs to resist calls to spend more and to cut taxes. 5/5 Impact: The Treasury argues that having lower debt puts the government in a stronger position to respond to sudden shocks. If the government borrows less it could also help reduce interest rates, which would in turn bring down costs for households. But cut spending too much and Sunak risks further damaging Britain’s already-struggling public services. 3/5 Deliverability: Public sector net debt to GDP is forecast to grow every year for the next four years. Sunak has control over one half of the equation: how much the government borrows. But he does not have complete control over the other: how much the economy grows. 3/5 4. Reduce NHS waiting lists Voters regard health as the second most important issue facing the country, behind only the economy. Waiting lists in England (health is a devolved issue) have been rising steadily since the pandemic. Detail: The NHS provides a simple figure for the number of people who are waiting for treatment in England, which was 7.4 million as of April. But Downing Street has not said when it expects to hit the target. Worse, as waiting lists continue to increase, No 10 argues that the number of people waiting longer than 18 months is falling. But this was not the promise Sunak made. 3/5 Affordability: Sunak has announced an extra £2.4bn over the next five years to pay for his NHS workforce plan, which aims to fill more than 100,000 vacancies. Spending like this will help bring down waiting lists, but it will take time to have an effect. 2/5 Impact: Waiting lists are only one measure of the performance of the health service, but they have a huge impact on people’s lives, and are often a sign of how well it is performing in other areas too. 4/5 Deliverability: Since Sunak announced his pledge, the number of people waiting for treatment in England has gone up from 7.2 million to 7.4 million. The last time that figure came down was during the pandemic, when millions of people decided not to seek treatment at all for fear of overwhelming hospitals. 2/5 5. Stop the boats Small boat crossings have plagued Sunak’s premiership so far. The UK’s asylum processing system has all but ground to a halt, and yet people continue to cross the Channel in small and often dangerous vessels to seek refuge in the UK. Detail: The wording of this pledge has always been ambiguous. At one point in his speech at the beginning of the year, the PM talked about passing new laws to stop the boats, while at others he talked of stopping them altogether. 2/5 Affordability: Sunak intends to stop the small boats with legislation that allows ministers to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda and cap the number who can come through safe and legal routes. The government said last month that each flight to Rwanda would cost £169,000, making the system cheaper only if it brought about a drastic fall in the number of asylum seekers arriving. 4/5 Impact: Reducing the number of small boat crossings would help ease the burden on the asylum system and therefore the number of people living indefinitely in hotels – something that has irritated some of those in the communities nearby. 2/5 Deliverability: While the crossings continue – 3,823 people made the journey in June – the government’s legislation has been heavily amended in the House of Lords and its Rwanda plan has been struck down by the court of appeal. 2/5 Starmer’s five missions 1. Secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 Starmer focuses more on growth than curbing inflation, though his definition of “sustained growth” means incomes growing faster than costs. Detail: Labour says it aims to have higher per-capita GDP growth than any other G7 country in consecutive years by the end of the parliament. The party also wants to narrow the gap between the median British family and their French and German counterparts in the same period. 4/5 Affordability: Like Sunak, Starmer has promised to have public sector spending falling as a proportion of GDP by the end of the parliament, as well as eliminating the current account deficit by the same time. But he will borrow to spend £28bn on the green prosperity plan by the second half of the parliament. 3/5 Impact: In the last quarter, the UK grew at the second slowest rate in the G7, ahead only of Germany. From the end of 2019 until the end of March this year, the country’s growth was lower than any other G7 country. Putting the country at the top of that league table would be quite a turnaround. 4/5 Deliverability: Delivering higher growth than any other G7 country will be especially difficult given that Starmer is ruling out any major changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU. 2/5 2. Make Britain a clean energy superpower Starmer’s growth plan is intrinsically tied to his green energy plan, given that the £28bn green prosperity plan is the only thing Labour has identified as being worth borrowing to spend on. Detail: Labour has promised to spend £28bn on green schemes by the second half of the parliament. By 2030, the party promises to have built a zero-carbon electricity system, as well as to have cut £1,400 off the annual household energy bill. 4/5 Affordability: This is the one area of Labour’s plans for which it has allocated funds from borrowing. The Conservatives accuse the party of planning to spend recklessly, though Starmer argues that capital investment of this sort will make bills cheaper for the government and individuals in the long run. 2/5 Impact: Labour’s targets are ambitious, but not that far off some of those already set by the government, which has said that 95% of the country’s electricity will come from clean power by 2030. The party says its green investment will support 50,000 jobs in the green energy industry by 2030. 4/5 Deliverability: Most of this will not be easy. Even finding the projects to spend £28bn on could prove difficult. In the first quarter of 2023, fossil fuels accounted for more than a third of UK electricity production. There are some easy steps for Labour to take, however, including overturning the effective ban on onshore wind. 2/5 3. Build an NHS fit for the future Starmer says the NHS is “not on its knees, but on its face”. Yet his solutions are a series of individual fixes, such as training more GPs and using the private sector more, rather than a major reorganisation, such as creating a new national care service for social care, which some have called for. Detail: The Labour leader has clear targets to hit, such as reducing the number of deaths from strokes and heart disease by a quarter within 10 years. But some of Labour’s solutions are less defined, including what role it expects the private sector to play in freeing up capacity. 3/5 Affordability: Labour has promised small amounts of money for certain things, such as using some of the funds raised by axing non-dom tax status to train 15,000 new doctors. But any extra money to run the NHS will have to be paid for either by new taxes or be taken from elsewhere in the government budget. 3/5 Impact: Even simple improvements such as stopping patients having to call at 8am to see a GP on the same day would have a major impact on people’s lives. But experts say the health service faces bigger problems, not least major shortfalls in capital spending. 4/5 Deliverability: Some of what Labour promises should be achievable, such as training more clinicians or making it easier for patients to be referred to specialist services. But some doubt the party is doing enough to have the impact on health outcomes it has promised. 3/5 4. Make Britain’s streets safe Starmer should be on solid ground when it comes to crime and justice, given his former role as director of public prosecutions. This is also one area where the picture is already improving: the Office for National Statistics’ crime survey shows crime has been falling in the UK since 1995. But certain crimes are on the rise, including robbery and knife crime, and trust in police is falling. Detail: Labour has four pledges: to halve knife crime, to halve violence against women and girls, to raise confidence in every police force to its highest level ever, and to increase the proportion of crimes solved, all within a decade. Measuring them may be harder. On violence against women and girls, for example, the party says it will work with experts to determine the best statistic to use. 4/5 Affordability: Labour’s targets are clear. How much they will cost is less so. The party promises, for example, to recruit 13,000 new neighbourhood police officers and community support officers, but does not say where the money to do that will come from. 2/5 Impact: Crime is not in the top five voters’ priorities, perhaps reflecting the long-term decline in crime rates. But improvements, such as in the detection rate, which has been falling since 2014, are likely to have a major impact on whether people feel the justice system is working. 2/5 Deliverability: Without some estimate of how much money the measures will cost, or how they will be paid for, it is difficult to say how easy they will be to achieve. Some are likely to prove difficult, such as forcing through Louise Casey’s recommendations for cleaning up the Metropolitan police. 2/5 5. Break down barriers to opportunity Starmer said on Thursday that this mission was the one that resonated most strongly with him on a personal level. Encompassing everything from childcare to careers advice, this is also one of the broadest. Detail: Labour says it will increase the percentage of children achieving a “good level of development” by the end of reception from 72% now to 90% by 2030. It also wants to reverse the decline in the number of 18-year-olds who go on to further education, apprenticeships or employment. 4/5 Affordability: Labour will end tax breaks for private schools, which it says will raise £1.6bn. The party will then spend £350m of that on recruiting 6,500 new teachers, and a further £56m on giving £2,400 to each new teacher who stays in post for two years. But the party has not said how much it will spend on other pledges, such as the promise to increase childcare capacity, which could prove expensive. 3/5 Impact: If Labour can reduce the degree to which someone’s income depends on that of their parents down to levels close to that of Scandinavian countries, it could have a major impact on British society. But there are significant structural problems, such as expanding childcare availability and retaining more teachers, which some argue will not be solved without considerable extra money. 3/5 Deliverability: Many of the specifics are achievable, such as ending tax breaks to private schools and using the money to recruit and retain new teachers. But some doubt whether this will have sufficient impact to change outcomes at schools, given that many teachers are leaving the profession due to consistent below-inflation pay rises, something Labour has so far refused to promise to reverse. 3/5",Keir Starmer; Rishi Sunak; Politics; Labour; Conservatives; Economic policy; Education policy; Health policy; Green politics; Industrial policy; Public services policy; UK news; Society,Politics
2022-09-22T08:00:52Z,‘Everything is broken because of 12 years of Tory government’ – why can’t Starmer just say it? | Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/22/uk-broken-12-years-starmer-tory-government-labour,"There’s no through line to this era of Conservatism. It unfolds randomly like prog rock, ear-bleeding thrash straight after a flute solo. First, their only agenda was to reduce the deficit, then they were all about levelling up, now they want to increase the deficit and stop levelling up, and what they say doesn’t really matter, because it doesn’t happen anyway. Very often they deliver the exact opposite, and you have to conclude that the real agenda was to sever the links between language and meaning, cause and effect, promise and outcome. What they cannot escape, however, is the passage of time. Twelve years have now gone by, and it would be time-consuming and complicatedly disrespectful to recap how much hardship, how much lasting damage they have caused. They can and will start culture wars to plug the rhetorical gaps, but on the material realities facing most Britons, they have only one option: a narrative of impotence. The UK is poorer because the good times couldn’t last for ever; energy is more expensive because of unavoidable exogenous shocks; inflation is high because of energy; interest rates are high because of inflation; look over there, Germany is having a right time of it too. We’re in decline because so is the world. Any line other than this would require them to take some responsibility, which would interrupt their messaging that they “got the big calls right”. Labour needs to focus on how not to get pulled into the vortex. It is fabulously bad at avoiding other people’s narratives. The internal conversations ahead of its conference next week are about whether to launch with the national anthem – the reasoning being that royalism is at an all time high and now is the perfect time to draw in those elusive socially conservative, economically socialist voters without whom all hope is lost. It is a damn fool idea, playing God Save the King, an open invitation to hecklers which will then become the story. If no one heckles, that too will be a story. (“Call yourselves the party of equality? You can’t even muster the energy to object to your aristocratic overlords.”) The bigger problem, though, is that they’re always putting out yesterday’s fires, dealing with the concerns of last year’s focus groups. This drags them irresistibly into the Tory narrative, that we’re mired in a broken system. To make matters worse, this decline narrative is the left’s comfort zone, and the obvious alternative – vague, high-minded visions of a brighter, better future – won’t cut it, having been tainted by the boosterish drivel of the departing Boris Johnson. To escape the mire of decline, they first have to make the coherent case linking Conservative decisions, past and present, to current conditions. Ambulances take hours to arrive because of policy; schools are facing bankruptcy, parents are going hungry to feed their children, social care is on its knees, maternity services are unsafe – all the decay you can see is a direct consequence of governmental choices. This is uncomfortable for Keir Starmer, who styles himself as a problem solver, a practical politician; choosing an enemy and hammering that home seems both too binary and too rhetorical to someone who’d rather concentrate on outcomes than theories. But it’s fundamental, if we want to regain any sense of agency and control, to insist on this. What we’re facing this autumn is not a “perfect storm”, because it’s not an act of God; it’s much more workmanlike, an act of Conservative governments, and only by constantly reinforcing that can you hope to persuade anyone that life under a different government would be better. They also have to reject the prevailing idea that external factors will simply resolve over time, and there’s nothing to do about the short-term pain except grin and bear it. The idea that Vladimir Putin, at some indeterminate point in the sunlit future, will halt his war and reopen his gas pipelines, bringing energy prices back down and a return to normality, has a Johnson-esque optimism (vague, a bit shaky), but more importantly, misses an opportunity. There has never been a better time to move decisively away from fossil fuels and towards renewables; there has never been a better time for green investment than when carbon has priced itself out of the market; there has never been a riper time to make the argument that climate must take priority; there has never been a more stagnant time, waiting for a second Industrial Revolution. Finally, they need to drop the hand-wringing: “How could all these individual privations happen, in the sixth largest economy in the world?” This is a constant mantra in Labour circles, they’ve been saying it since the UK was the world’s fourth largest economy, and it’s meaningless. There is no point measuring your GDP relative to other nations’ if you’re not asking who’s got the money and what they’re spending it on. The wider case is that the putative “normal” UK that the new prime minister hopes to get us back to was itself unequal to the point of widespread hardship and economic self-sabotage. A Labour government should not strive to take us back to 2015, when the Conservatives had only done half their damage and there were only half as many food banks. It should not be chasing growth just for a seat at the world’s big-economy table. It needs new metaphors, new hymns; God might save the King, but only we can save ourselves.

2022-07-27T05:01:09Z,Kew Gardens secures a multimillion-pound climate change investment ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/27/kew-gardens-secures-a-multimillion-pound-climate-change-investment,"The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew has secured a multimillion-pound investment to help commercialise its research into climate change-resistant crops, zero-carbon fertiliser and plant- and cell-based meat and dairy products. Greensphere Capital, a sustainability-focused fund, is aiming to invest up to £100m in the work carried out by Kew, a research institution and the UK’s largest botanic garden, as well as other organisations, to commercialise and scale-up study into managing risks around the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The funding is designed to increase research into some of the world’s most pressing challenges, including how to feed a growing global population amid rising temperatures and increasing extreme weather events. Alongside sustainable agriculture, the investment will help pay for extra researchers to look into botanical and fungal sciences, restoration of habitats, agriculture and forestry, with the ultimate goal of turning some projects into companies. Greensphere – which was founded in 2011 and was the first fund manager to the government’s Green Investment Bank – is investing through its climate incubator, Gaia Sciences Innovation (GSI). Based at a 320-acre site in southwest London, Kew is home to a collection of almost 17,000 species of plants collected from all over the world during its more than 260-year history, as well its living collections in its gardens at Kew and Wakehurst in Sussex. The organisation is also home to the Millennium Seed Bank, an underground collection intended to conserve for the future over 2.4bn seeds from around the world including nearly all of the UK’s native plant species. Kew believes the tie-up with Greensphere will allow it to leverage its collections, particularly when freed from the shorter-term funding cycles commonly found with two- to three-year grants for academic research projects. A non-departmental public body, Kew receives about a third of its funding from the government through the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but said it does not have “what’s termed an intellectual property budget”. “It’s a huge opportunity to increase the impact of the work we’re doing on biodiversity,” said Prof Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew. However, she added: “It’s not that we’re commercialising Kew.” “Our expertise on collections, collated over 260 years, gives us a springboard by which we can provide information. Where plants were found in the past, that might not be found now, giving us an indication of what can happen with climate change,” said Simmonds. “How can we work, not just academically to publish papers about it, but how can we help on the ground, with people, to be able to get money possibly going to those communities, to assist them realise the value of their plants.” Greensphere’s investment will initially be used to hire about 20 new researchers, with the goal of developing up to 10 companies. The money will also help to increase the laboratory space dedicated to this kind of work, which GSI believes will strengthen the role of the UK as a scientific and entrepreneurial hub. The investment firm found that many ventures it could have invested in, which look to tackle biodiversity loss or the changing climate, were not based on scientific evidence, which first prompted discussions with Kew. “If we were going to invest in natural capital at any scale, it would be dishonest to do it without proper science. A little bit like building a road with no civil engineers,” said Divya Seshamani, managing partner of Greensphere Capital. “We found the science was a lot less developed than it could be. There weren’t ready companies, but there were clear solutions. We thought this could do with some funding, some commercial structure, to try to get the science into companies, and it would benefit Kew, giving it an extra revenue stream.” Kew currently has over 350 scientific staff working on projects with partners in more than 100 countries worldwide, including a permanent base in Madagascar, considered a critical location for biodiversity loss. Kew has previously only created one spin-out from its research, a company called Polypharmakos – formed in 2016 to discover and develop new antimicrobial agents from natural products – created with the University of Cambridge, through a £500,000 investment from the university. • This article was amended on 27 July 2022. Kew receives about one-third of its funding from the government, not “nearly half” as an earlier version said; and, when combined with its site in Wakehurst, Sussex, is the UK’s largest botanic gardens, not merely “one of the largest”.",Kew Gardens; Business; Science; Climate crisis; Environment,Science
2023-02-17T10:41:45Z,"Latest objects shot down over US not linked to China, Biden says | First Thing",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/17/first-thing-latest-objects-shot-down-over-us-not-linked-to-china-biden-says,"Good morning. Joe Biden has broken his silence on unknown aerial objects shot down over North America during the past week, assessing they were “most likely” operated by private companies or research institutions rather than China. The president’s tentative conclusion is likely to fuel criticism that his orders to take down the objects were an overreaction amid political pressure over the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon that transited much of the country. Biden spoke for eight minutes at the Eisenhower executive office building on Thursday after Republicans and some Democrats expressed concerns that his unwillingness to comment on the issue could allow conspiracy theories to thrive. “We don’t yet know exactly what these three objects were but nothing right now suggests they were related to China’s spy balloon program or that they were surveillance vehicles from any other country,” the president told reporters, against a backdrop of flags and the presidential seal. How will the government decide what poses a risk in the future? The president said the US was developing “sharper rules” around unknown aerial objects. These would help “distinguish between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not”. What has China said? China has denied that the balloon was a surveillance airship. Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said the balloon’s entry into US airspace was “an unintended, unexpected and isolated event”, adding: “China has repeatedly communicated this to the US side, yet the US overreacted by abusing the use of force and escalating the situation.” ‘Trust the government’: EPA seeks to reassure Ohio residents near toxic spill In Ohio, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) got a first-hand look at the toll left by a freight train derailment, where toxic chemicals spilled or were burned off, leaving the stench of fresh paint nearly two weeks later. The EPA’s administrator, Michael Regan, walked along a creek that still reeked of chemicals yesterday and sought to reassure skeptical residents that the water was fit for drinking and the air safe to breathe in East Palestine, where almost 5,000 people live near the Pennsylvania state line. “I’m asking they trust the government. I know that’s hard. We know there’s a lack of trust,” Regan said. “We’re testing for everything that was on that train.” Since the derailment, local people have complained about headaches and irritated eyes and finding their cars and lawns covered in soot. The hazardous chemicals that spilled from the train killed thousands of fish and residents have talked about finding dying or sick pets and wildlife. What has the White House said? “We understand the residents are concerned – as they should be – and they have questions. That’s all understandable,” said the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. “And we’re going to get to the bottom of this.” What else is happening? At least five lawsuits have been filed against the railroad, which announced this week that it was creating a $1m fund to help the community while continuing to remove spilled contaminants from the ground and streams, and monitoring air quality. World leaders meet in Munich for security conference as Russia intensifies ground attacks on Ukraine Senior politicians and military leaders from around the world are meeting today in Germany, with Ukrainian officials expected to address the security conference. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will be the opening speaker at the three-day Munich security conference as the west faces urgent calls to speed up ammunition production and supplies to Kyiv in the face of mounting fears that Russia is planning a new offensive. Bolstered by tens of thousands of reservists, Russia has intensified ground attacks across southern and eastern Ukraine, and, as the first anniversary of the invasion nears on 24 February, a new Russian offensive appears to be taking shape. Russia also rained missiles across Ukraine yesterday and struck its largest oil refinery. Sixteen of at least 36 missiles that Russia fired were shot down, the air force said, a lower rate than normal. Who is attending? The German chancellor Olaf, Scholz, French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, are among many top officials attending the Munich security conference. How big a threat does the hard right pose to US support for Ukraine? “I’ve been sounding the alarms on Republican opposition to Ukraine aid for the last 12 months,” the Democratic senator Chris Murphy said. “I think there’s going to be tremendous pressure on Speaker McCarthy to abandon Ukraine … and it’s possible he could wilt under the pressure. We know the Russians see this as a real opportunity.” In other news … Bruce Willis, who retired from acting last May as a result of aphasia, has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, his family announced yesterday. Problems with language and memory, which instigated rumors about his cognitive state, were “just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces”, they wrote. The US scores surprisingly badly in a new ranking system charting abuses of power by nation states. The US comes close to the median of 163 countries ranked in the Index of Impunity, reflecting a poor record on discrimination, inequality and access to democracy. A top Pentagon official will visit Taiwan in the coming days, according to reports, as attempts between the US and China to repair relations continue to backslide after the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon in its airspace. The Pentagon declined to comment on the report of Michael Chase’s trip. Protesters in Iran have marched through the streets of multiple cities in the most widespread demonstrations in weeks, online videos purported to show today. The demonstrations overnight marked 40 days since Iran executed two men on charges related to protests. Alabama is close to completing a protocol that will use nitrogen gas as a new form of execution in the state, officials have said, amid warnings from advocacy groups that it is an experimental move after botched lethal injections. For years, the state has said it is developing nitrogen hypoxia as a new execution method. Stat of the day: letter lost in 1916 delivered in London more than 100 years later A letter lost in the post in 1916 was finally delivered to a property in London, UK, more than a century after being sent from the English city of Bath. Bearing a penny George V stamp and Bath and Sydenham, south London, postmarks, it dropped through the letterbox of the theatre director Finlay Glen’s Crystal Palace apartment in the capital in 2021. It was addressed to Katie Marsh, who was married to the stamp dealer Oswald Marsh, and was sent by her friend Christabel Mennell, who was holidaying in Bath, according to research by Stephen Oxford, the editor of The Norwood Review, a local history magazine. It begins: “My dear Katie, will you lend me your aid – I am feeling quite ashamed of myself after saying what I did at the circle.” Don’t miss this: humans ‘may need more sleep in winter’, study finds For those of us who struggle to leave our beds in the winter, taunts of “lazy” could well be misplaced. Research suggests that while humans do not hibernate, we may need more sleep during the colder months. Analysis of people undergoing sleep studies found that they got more REM (rapid eye movement) sleep in the winter. While total sleep time appeared to be about an hour longer in the winter than the summer, this result was not considered statistically significant. However, REM sleep – known to be directly linked to the circadian clock, which is affected by changing light – was 30 minutes longer in the winter. “In general, societies need to adjust sleep habits including length and timing to season, or adjust school and working schedules to seasonal sleep needs,” said the researcher, Dr Dieter Kunz. Climate check: why resignation of World Bank boss is good news for climate crisis fight The resignation of David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, was greeted with relief and joy on Wednesday evening by climate experts and campaigners, who said it should open up a new era for financing the global shift to a low-carbon economy. Malpass, who was appointed to the role by the then US president Donald Trump in 2019, had been facing mounting calls to step down after a series of missteps, including lacklustre plans for green investment and appearing to deny climate science when confronted by a journalist. Al Gore, a former US vice-president, said: “Humankind needs the head of the World Bank to fully recognise and creatively respond to the civilisation-threatening danger posed by the climate crisis.” Last thing: US cancer patient developed ‘uncontrollable’ Irish accent, doctors say A cancer patient in the US developed what researchers say was an “uncontrollable Irish accent” during treatment, despite never having been to Ireland nor having immediate relatives from the country. While still rare, cases of foreign accent syndrome are more common in patients after strokes or head trauma, or who have psychiatric disorders, according to the experts. Some details of the man’s case, including his nationality, were not revealed. But researchers said he maintained the Irish accent through about 20 months of treatment, and a gradual onset of paralysis, until his death. “His accent was uncontrollable, present in all settings and gradually became persistent,” the report says.

2023-01-08T18:51:57Z,Keir Starmer: ‘I’m against austerity. But we’re going to have to be fiscally disciplined’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/08/keir-starmer-against-austerity-fiscally-disciplined-labour,"Keir Starmer leans over an open newspaper and points out a picture of him and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, holding hi-tech rivet guns while touring a design lab. “I’ve had a few shadow cabinet ministers ask me if this is how we’re going to get them to stick to fiscal discipline,” he jokes, before an interview with the Guardian in his constituency office in Camden, north London. The Labour leader has spent much of the last few days promising how careful he would be with the public finances should he end up in No 10 after the next election. But while he aims to burnish Labour’s reputation for economic competence, the UK’s cash-starved public services are at breaking point. Some in his party are anxious that his vow not to brandish a “big government chequebook” means schools and hospitals will not get the funding they need. But Starmer, despite his insistence on fiscal prudence, rules out a return to austerity under a Labour government. “Look, I’ve always made the case against austerity,” he says. “I’m against austerity. But I know we’re going to have to be fiscally disciplined.” While he acknowledges that schools, the NHS, courts and the police will all need more funding, every spending commitment will be fully costed. He denies he is trying to have it both ways. “That’s why we’ve made choices,” he says, citing plans to scrap non-dom tax status to fund training for more nurses and doctors. Starmer is looking to growth to provide extra money for public services. “It’s very important that our message on fiscal discipline is heard,” he says. “We’re going to inherit a really bad situation. The economy has been really badly damaged over 13 years of low growth. “The question Rachel [Reeves] and I have focused on is how we grow the economy. If growth the last 13 years had been at the same rate as the last Labour government, we’d have tens of billions for public services without raising a single penny more in tax.” He denies Labour is planning a wealth tax, saying there is “not much scope” for rises with overall tax so high – but admits dividends and rental income are the “sort of things” it could consider, rather than savings or property. “We’ve never said that we would introduce wealth taxes, we’ve said that we need a fair taxation system. It means looking at different forms of taxation that aren’t heavily dependent on the wage people earn,” he says. “But – and it’s a big ‘but’ in capital letters – we have got the highest taxation burden since the war, and the idea that there’s much scope for tax increases is wrong, which is why we’ve put our focus on growing the economy.” Starmer’s plans for reform have caused alarm in his party. Yet he is worried they have not “come through strongly enough”. He adds: “Obviously I know that if you put more money into public services they will improve, but I also know that reform will bring improvements. “In the NHS, obviously, everybody always has the question, ‘Does that mean the private sector?’ I don’t shy away when it comes to things like waiting lists – we’ll use whatever we can to get those down. But the reform I’m talking about goes way beyond that. We’re all living longer. We’ve got to move to a preventive model.” Another change he wants is devolution, giving people more control over their lives, but he acknowledges that handing power to local communities needs to be accompanied by funding. Reeves, however, has ruled out giving tax-raising powers to councils. Starmer defends Labour’s decision to use Vote Leave’s “take back control” slogan for devolution plans, insisting Brexiters can have faith he understands why they voted to leave the EU, despite being one of the biggest advocates of remain and a second referendum. “I’ve always understood that plea for change,” he says. “I don’t quarrel with the argument that people need more control in their lives. Obviously I campaigned for remain but I don’t argue that we should have the sort of change the many people who voted Brexit are crying out for.” Despite the economic damage of Brexit, Starmer is sticking resolutely to his line that he would get a better deal from the EU, presumably in the belief that going further would be electoral suicide. “We’ve left the EU and there’s no case for going back. But we will improve the deal we’ve got.” He is equally careful about small boats – reiterating there needs to be more cross-border work tackling criminal gangs trafficking people across the Channel. He criticises the broken asylum processing system, and underlines the need to make sure existing safe routes are working, particularly from Afghanistan. Starmer is philosophical about his new year push being overshadowed by the royal psychodrama around Prince Harry’s book, saying last week’s speech was just the latest staging post in getting ready for government. “I haven’t read the Harry stuff other than what’s come into the hands of the Guardian,” he says. “It’s obvious that gets attention, of course it does. But this was not a one-off speech, it was laying out what we’re going to be doing in 2023. “The impatience for change is palpable. The public is fed up with being asked to suck it up. They want the hope and reassurance that change is possible and change is coming.” Despite the media storm around Harry, Starmer refuses to comment directly, simply saying: “I still don’t think wading into private matters of the royal family is where politicians should be.” Starmer, who is approaching three years as leader of the opposition, has big plans for this year. He feels, having transformed Labour since the days of Jeremy Corbyn and attacked government failings over the last year, he has earned his party a hearing. “We’ve done hard work on changing the party, we’ve done hard work on exposing the Tories as not fit to govern. As we turn into a new year, we don’t rest on our laurels, we press on. We set out the case for a bold, reforming Labour government.” But what would that government look like? Starmer has faced criticism for not yet setting out what Labour would do with power. “Look, of course people are impatient for change when you have 13 years of failure. But we have to build the foundation for it.” He wants to “gently push back” at the idea Labour has not already set out any policies – the biggest so far is a £28bn a year green investment commitment – but admits the party needs to “build on” those they have already put forward. Starmer will set out more policy detail over the next three months, saying that Labour is doing a “huge amount of work” to prepare for government, and that by this time next year everybody will know exactly what it would do in power. “There were plenty of people urging me from day one: set out your plan for government. I resisted because I knew we could only do it if we got to this stage.” But he does not like complacency, and at every shadow cabinet meeting says the party has to fight like it is five points behind in the polls, rather than 20 ahead. Labour will have a 1997-style pledge card in the run-up to the next election, he confirms. “Yes, I want to be clear going into the election that if you vote Labour you will get ABCDE or whatever it may be.” The manifesto will be “short, sharp” and “tell a story about the future of the country”. Is Labour ready for government? “Yes,” he replies immediately, adding that his party has gone through a “shift in mindset” from opposition to government in waiting. Shadow ministers are receiving training from the Institute for Government and Starmer talks regularly to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He also gets tips from the leaders of Labour’s sister parties abroad who have recently won elections, including the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the Australian premier, Anthony Albanese. Aides have observed the US midterms. “By the time we hit that election we need the best campaigning team that the Labour party has ever seen,” Starmer says. Would he welcome back big Labour beasts of the past? Douglas Alexander is one former cabinet minister trying to become an MP. Starmer says he would be “very relaxed” about David Miliband, once tipped as the next Labour inhabitant of No 10, returning to the fold. “Of course I’m keen to use whatever experience there is,” he says. “There are good people of the past who want to run again. But there are really brilliant people of the future too.”",Keir Starmer; Labour; Politics; Austerity; Tax and spending; Economic policy; Devolution; UK news,Politics
2022-05-19T15:34:43Z,Three ways Sunak could raise £10bn to help Britons struggling with energy bills | Arun Advani,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/19/rishi-sunak-energy-bills-tax,"Suppose the chancellor wanted to follow Scottish Power’s advice, and give Britain’s most hard-up households £1,000 towards their energy bills this winter? Would it be possible to raise the £10bn needed in a way that didn’t just tax the same people he would be trying to help? I can think of at least three options, any of which would do the job, and all of which would make the tax system better as well. Capital gains First, Rishi Sunak could raise capital gains tax rates to match income tax rates, and reintroduce an inflation allowance, as his predecessor Nigel Lawson did in 1988. It was the top recommendation by Sunak’s own advisers, the Office of Tax Simplification, in 2020. This could raise up to £16bn. While some people will doubtless delay cashing in gains to avoid the tax, the chancellor should comfortably reach £10bn even accounting for this. A reformed capital gains tax would also be fairer, reducing the opportunity for some to game the system to pay lower effective tax rates. National insurance Second, he could apply national insurance contributions consistently across all sources of income. If you earn an average income, you’ll be paying 13.25% in national insurance on every extra pound you earn. Someone with a higher income – your MP, for example, on a salary of almost £85,000 – is paying only 3.25%. And landlords pay a tidy 0%. Other oddities include that national insurance is currently at zero after pension age, even for those in work, and effectively 1.25% on dividends. Fixing all these inconsistencies to tax all income consistently would raise more than £30bn, so the chancellor would have some money to spare to cut taxes, invest in education, or undo the cuts to the aid budget. Wealth tax Third, he could introduce an annual wealth tax of 1.1% on individual wealth above £10m, after netting off mortgages and other debts. This would raise £10bn from the wealthiest 0.04% of the population. For this group the usual economic arguments against a wealth tax, for example that it discourages savings, do not apply. There are also practical benefits, as existing taxes on wealth are not effective at raising tax from this group: a government report in 2018 showed that they are able use reliefs to pay just a 10% effective rate of inheritance tax – half the rate paid by individuals with £2m in wealth. Each of these options is good economics, raises some much-needed money, and would improve the tax system. But none should deter the chancellor from a fourth bit of good economics: a windfall tax on energy companies. Their current higher profits are nothing to do with their own efforts, and everything to do with the economic fallout of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Labour says this could raise £2bn as a one-off, but there are no independent estimates yet. However, it is Economics 101 that such windfalls should be taxed highly. Whatever it raises can then be put to constructive use, whether supporting low-income households or funding incentives for green investment. There are plenty of options for the chancellor to ease the cost of living crisis. Imagine if he were brave enough to implement them all.

2022-05-09T23:01:23Z,"Avoid using gas as ‘transition’ fuel in move to clean energy, study urges",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/avoid-using-gas-transition-fuel-move-clean-energy-study-urges,"Countries should move from coal to renewable energy without shifting to gas as a “transition” fuel to save money, as high gas prices and market volatility have made the fossil fuel an expensive option, analysis has found. Natural gas has long been touted as a “transition” fuel for economies dependent on coal for their power needs, as it has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal but requires similar centralised infrastructure, and gas-fired power stations take only a couple of years to build. Earlier this year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission angered green campaigners by including gas as a “bridge” to clean energy in its guidebook for green investment. High prices for gas, and the plummeting cost of renewable energies such as wind and solar power, have reversed that logic, according to analysis from TransitionZero. The cost of switching from coal to renewable energy has plunged by 99% since 2010, according to its report published on Tuesday. The findings call into question the economic viability of the scores of gas and coal-fired power plants that are planned or under construction around the world. About 615GW of new gas plants, and 442GW of new coal-fired power stations, are planned for construction globally, according to the analysis. Matt Gray, the co-founder of TransitionZero, said it no longer made sense to think of gas as a transition fuel, and countries should opt for renewables in place of coal. “Despite some regional variation, our analysis shows a clear deflationary trend in the cost of switching from coal to clean electricity,” he said. “Independent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this trend will accelerate, presenting governments with an economic opportunity to protect electricity consumers from continued fossil fuel volatility.” Many countries are reviewing their energy policies in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – which has sent fossil fuel prices soaring and disrupted supplies – and may be considering a reversion to coal. The amount of power generated from coal rose 9% to a record high last year, even before the war in Ukraine, and if the coal-fired power stations now planned are built the world will have little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to separate analysis published last month. Gray said that although the economics were firmly in favour of renewable energy, governments must make some policy changes in order to realise the full benefits. These included making it easier to build windfarms and solar power, because acquiring planning permission can take up to 10 years in some regions; removing distorting incentives and tax breaks for fossil fuels; and ensuring electricity markets are properly functioning. The analysis also found that the economics of moving from coal power to renewable energy, without using gas, were most favourable in Europe, where the price of coal has increased, in part because of EU policies and also because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In China and the US, however, domestically produced coal is cheaper than in Europe. Despite the lower price of renewables, China is still planning new coal-fired power stations, and the US could increase its coal use in response to higher demand for gas. In Japan, the price of switching from coal to renewables is higher still, because of “discriminatory regulations and land-use constraints”, and in south-east Asia some countries subsidise coal and gas, distorting the economics of a switch to clean power.",Renewable energy; Coal; Gas; Energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; World news; Business,Environment
2022-07-04T14:22:31Z,How Keir Starmer hopes to ‘make Brexit work’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/04/how-keir-starmer-hopes-to-make-brexit-work,"Keir Starmer is using a speech on Monday to set out Labour’s five-point plan to “make Brexit work” – a slogan he first used in his party conference speech last year. Labour’s approach is to seek to de-dramatise the issue, by focusing on practicalities, instead of reopening old political wounds: 1) Settle the Northern Ireland protocol Boris Johnson’s government is on the warpath with the EU over the protocol, with controversial legislation making its way through the House of Commons that would disapply aspects of the deal the government signed in 2019. Labour says there is a “landing zone” in negotiations between the two sides, however, which would include seeking a veterinary agreement to cover agricultural goods, allowing many of the cumbersome checks to be lifted. For other goods, Labour says it would work with businesses in Northern Ireland to put in place a trusted trader scheme to reduce the proportion of exports that need to be subject to checks. 2) Cut down paperwork Labour would seek to extend the new veterinary agreement UK-wide, so that as well as products from Great Britain being sold into Northern Ireland, exports to the EU could also potentially face fewer checks. It would also seek to negotiate “mutual recognition of conformity assessments,” across some sectors – so that companies would only have to face one set of tests to show they meet required standards in the UK and the EU. Labour hopes this is negotiable because, Starmer says, his government has no intention of cutting standards – though it is unclear whether the EU would be convinced. Theresa May sought a similar outcome, but she was willing to sign up to EU regulations for key goods as a quid quo pro. Labour would also seek new flexibility for people wanting to work in the EU in the short-term, such as musicians on tours. 3) Support services and scientists Point three includes a bundle of technical changes aimed at making life easier for employees and companies to work in, and export to, the EU. Starmer says Labour wants to negotiate mutual recognition of professional qualifications with the EU, for example, to allow UK professionals such as lawyers to practise more easily in the EU and vice versa. And Labour would seek access to cross-border scientific endeavours such as Horizon, which UK scientists are currently unable to access due to the row over the protocol – the EU ambassador to the UK recently called this “collateral damage”. 4) Seek a security pact Former prime minister Theresa May used a speech in Munich in 2018 to set out her hopes of negotiating a wide-ranging security pact with the EU, despite her determination to leave its common foreign and security policy. When Boris Johnson took over the negotiations he dropped the idea, however, to focus primarily on trade and the knotty issue of the Northern Irish border. Starmer argues that the current standoff over the protocol is hampering the UK’s ability to collaborate with the EU on other issues, including security – and says Labour would try to strike a new agreement. This would include joint working on issues such as intelligence and cybersecurity. 5) Invest in the UK Point five, perhaps the least developed, is broadly about what the UK can now do to maximise the benefits of being outside the EU. Starmer says Labour would “use green investment and a commitment to buy, make and sell in Britain to ensure we are best placed to compete on a global stage”. He also suggests the party would take a new approach to trade, which would “put people, communities, rights, and standards at its very heart”, though it is unclear what that would mean in practice. 6) Not seeking to rejoin the single market or restore free movement Starmer’s plan only has five points, but almost the most striking element of it is what he says he will not do – argue for the UK to rejoin the single market, or restore free movement. As he puts it: “With Labour, Britain will not go back into the EU. We will not be joining the single market. We will not be joining a customs union. We will not return to freedom of movement to create short-term fixes.” Starmer spent much of the last parliament helping to drag Labour towards a policy of a second referendum, and said during his leadership campaign that he would argue for free movement. But he now believes there is little to be won electorally from revisiting the issue, and whatever the hopes of many party members, hopes to, as he puts it, “move on”.",Keir Starmer; Labour; Brexit; Northern Ireland; UK news; European Union; Politics; Europe; Foreign policy; World news,Politics
2022-09-23T14:06:08Z,This ‘mini-budget’ is a naked exercise in redistributing wealth upwards | Michael Jacobs,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/23/mini-budget-redistributing-wealth-economy-liz-truss-kwasi-kwarteng,"When is a budget not a budget? When the government does not want there to be any informed analysis of its economic impacts. The only reason the Treasury has insisted Kwasi Kwarteng’s statement was a “fiscal event” and not a budget – despite a range of measures far exceeding the contents of most budgets – is that, since George Osborne’s tenure, chancellors of the exchequer have been required by law to ask the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to conduct an independent analysis of the measures taken. And why has the government been so keen to avoid such scrutiny? Because the economic impacts are likely to look very ugly. It is more or less impossible to find an economist who supports the government’s approach, or an economic model able to justify it. Indeed, the financial markets have already given their negative verdict. The problem is not the prime minister’s ambition to “grow the economy”. Many economists would actually agree with Liz Truss’s attack on “Treasury orthodoxy”, which has focused far too much on reducing public borrowing and debt, and not nearly enough on raising investment and productivity. The UK’s poor economic performance over the past decade has much to do with the tight fiscal policies pursued by Conservative chancellors. But there are three big problems with the way Truss and Kwarteng are seeking to reverse these policies. First, the government’s attempt to stimulate the economy through income tax cuts is deeply inefficient. As the UK slides into recession, with businesses failing and unemployment rising, it is not unreasonable for the government to inject some demand into the economy to counteract those effects. But income tax cuts are a really poor way of doing this. This is not simply about their distributional effect. As the Resolution Foundation has shown, by reversing the national insurance hike and abolishing the 45p tax rate on incomes above £150,000, Kwarteng has performed a remarkable act of redistribution to the rich. But the wider economic problem is that much of the tax cut will not lead to higher spending. Give households more money and they will spend some of it, but also save some. And the higher their income bracket, the more they will save. A much better way of getting money into the economy is through investment. Wise investment – in infrastructure and business – will raise productivity, and therefore increase long-term economic growth. Investment creates jobs, and therefore raises wages and spending. Economists call the rate at which an injection of cash into the economy raises national income the “multiplier”. As the OBR has noted, the investment multiplier is around three times larger than the tax multiplier. Today the best form of stimulus is green investment, in areas such as home insulation and renewable energy, which would also help to reduce fossil fuel demand and meet the UK’s climate goals. (This is Labour’s plan, it might be noted.) Second, cutting corporation tax (or not raising it as planned) and cutting stamp duty are really not good ways of stimulating economic growth either. There is almost no evidence that lower corporation tax stimulates investment. At 19%, the UK’s corporation tax is already the lowest in the G7, yet UK business investment is also the lowest. (Germany’s corporation tax rate is 30%.) Meanwhile, cutting stamp duty without building any more houses simply raises house prices – which are already growing at their fastest rate for 20 years. This will price more people out of the housing market, and benefit only existing homeowners. Third, the fact that the government is using borrowing to pay for all these tax cuts makes them an even worse idea. At a time when the chancellor is tearing up his own government’s fiscal rules, it is worth noting that the one fiscal rule almost everyone accepts is the so-called “golden rule”: that, in normal times, governments should borrow only to invest. This is because investment generates growth, which helps repay the borrowing. Almost no economist would agree with borrowing to fund tax cuts. (This is not what Margaret Thatcher did: she only cut tax when there had been sufficient growth to fund it.) In fact, the government’s fiscal strategy is even more extraordinary than this. The tax cuts announced will cost about £27bn next year, net of the oil and gas windfall tax already announced. The energy bills subsidy schemes for households and business will cost £60bn. Not yet announced, but very likely in the coming full budget, are spending increases: perhaps £18bn to maintain the real value of public service spending given inflation, and perhaps £25bn to raise defence spending from 2% to 3% of GDP. In total, it seems likely that the government will be borrowing up to £130bn more in 2023-24. Last year, the government borrowed £169bn (a historically high figure; before the pandemic it was about £50bn). So that is a remarkable 75% increase in borrowing. Can the government borrow this much? Certainly. But only at a price. That price can already be seen in the yields purchasers of government bonds (“gilts”) are now demanding. Already today, UK bond yields are up sharply, having already been rising for the past couple of weeks since the new government took office. Coupled with the interest rate rise announced by the Bank of England on Thursday (with more almost certainly still to come), that makes the government’s borrowing more expensive, creating an even bigger deficit. And that’s not the only reaction of the financial markets. Over the past two weeks the pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar for 20 years, and it is also down against the euro. It fell again after the chancellor’s speech. The markets are signalling their anxieties about the government’s strategy and its impact on the economy. Why does this matter? Because a lower pound raises import prices, thereby pushing inflation up. And it also makes gas (which is priced in dollars) more expensive, thereby raising the cost of the government’s energy bills scheme even higher. This is a potent brew of economic reaction. There is open talk now of a possible run on the pound, and gilt yields rising even further. A former member of the Bank of England monetary policy committee said this week that if he were an investor he would short (bet against) the pound. If their radical fiscal plan goes wrong, Truss and Kwarteng might find themselves shorted in the political markets.

2022-11-18T19:13:11Z,Economic gloom should spell Tory disaster – but Hunt has made it tricky for Starmer | Jonathan Freedland,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/18/economic-tory-jeremy-hunt-keir-starmer-autumn-statement,"The Tories should be toast. The words spoken by Jeremy Hunt to the House of Commons on Thursday, along with the forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility, should be enough to ensure that we are in the final stretch of what will have been 14 years of Conservative rule. Given that politics turns on economics, and that the dominant question of any election campaign is a version of the one Ronald Reagan asked of Americans in 1980 – “Are you better off now than you were four [or 14] years ago?” – the Conservatives should be heading to a crushing defeat in 2024. The economic outlook could scarcely be bleaker, with every measure pointing towards gloom. Real household incomes will fall by a calamitous 7% over the next two years, plunging living standards back to the level they were at in 2013: nine years spent pushing the boulder up the hill, only for it roll back down in 24 months. Forget the crash of 2008, the fall in incomes projected for the next year alone will be the steepest since records began in the mid-1950s. Meanwhile, Britons will be paying more in tax, as a share of national income, than at any time since the end of the second world war. The recession that is coming may not bite as deep as the one that struck in 2008, but it will be wider, affecting everyone. The experts warn of a food bank winter, with the cold, hunger and stress that already afflicts the – staggering figure – 14.5 million Britons in poverty spreading to those we once called the squeezed middle. The next two years will see another 500,000 Britons become unemployed, while any pay rise for those in work will be eaten up and outstripped by inflation. One estimate says real wages will not rise to their 2008 levels until 2027: that suggests Britain will have suffered not just one lost decade, but two. The front page of the Daily Record put it succinctly: “You’ve never had it so bad”. All this economic pain for the country should spell political agony for the government in charge. Not least because, despite the chancellor’s valiant attempts to pretend Britain’s problems were “made in Russia”, voters know that the hole we’re in grew much deeper eight short weeks ago. That was when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng delivered a budget which spooked the markets so badly that Britain is no longer trusted to make its own fiscal decisions. Instead it is on probation, with Hunt obliged to tax high and spend low to reassure the moneymen whose loans the country needs to live on. What’s more, the remedy imposed by reality on the government tears apart the coalition that put it there. So-called red wall voters who gave Boris Johnson a majority in 2019 did so in part because they were promised big money to draw level with the south, not so they could get a more emollient version of George Osborne’s austerity. Meanwhile, blue wall Conservatives, and especially the MPs who represent them, are Conservative because they believe, often as a matter of theology, in low taxes – yet it is their government that is taking more in tax than Stafford Cripps, Denis Healey or Gordon Brown ever dared. Most Tory MPs are prepared to stomach Hunt’s medicine for now, but only because they craved calm after the turmoil of Truss. Their patience will not hold for long, which means Rishi Sunak will soon be dealing with a restless parliamentary party that lost the knack for discipline long ago. Put all that together, and you get the expectation most Tories themselves admit privately: that these are the end of days. The best they can do is hope that something comes along – that inflation falls, interest rates ease, growth returns – and voters give them one last chance. But few are betting on it. On the contrary, most are bracing for a Labour government. And yet, grim as the outlook is for the Tories, Labour’s path to victory is not as straight as it may first appear. And that’s because Labour faces a different opponent to the one that confronted it even a few weeks ago. To be sure, Labour is comfortably ahead in the polls. But that lead grew in response to the two previous iterations of this government. First, voters became disgusted by the scandal, dishonesty and hypocrisy of the Johnson administration, and especially of Johnson himself: his failure to comply with his own Covid rules broke the bond of trust voters placed in him in 2019. Next, voters recoiled from the florid incompetence of Truss, which shattered the Tory reputation for economic acumen so thoroughly and so fast that, as I discovered for myself earlier this month, even US politicians and pundits now casually use “Liz Truss” as a synonym for debacle. The Hunt-Sunak combination is a different proposition. Sunak may yet rue his pledge to restore “integrity, professionalism and accountability” to government – thereby setting a standard by which to judge, and condemn, every ministerial failing and poor appointment – but for now, few voters would put him in the same moral category as Johnson. Similarly, he and, especially, Hunt are effective at presenting as steady technocrats rather than the crazed-eyed ideologues each replaced. Truss and Kwarteng were such an easy target. With their tax cuts for the richest, they were pantomime villains, all but inviting the audience to boo and hiss. The new duo are cannier than that. Not only have they not abolished the top rate of income tax, they’ve brought more high earners into it. They’ll uprate benefits and pensions in line with inflation, raise the minimum wage, give more cash to schools and hospitals and extend the energy price guarantee for those who need it most. Naturally, there are sleights of hand: non-doms are safe; the energy giants should have faced a heftier windfall tax; local councils will be forced to wield the axe on services already shrunk by Osborne’s austerity a decade ago. But Sunak and Hunt have made sure the optics are different – two decent men doing their best to clean up a mess, anxious to look out for people and services in need. The announcement that a couple of New Labour-era bigwigs will be at their side, offering advice, completes the picture. That makes it tougher for Keir Starmer. He likes to be the adult in the room, but come 2024 he will not have sole claim to that role. He will be asked if Labour will stick to the spending cuts that, cunningly, Hunt has scheduled for the other side of the next election. If Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves won’t adhere to Tory spending plans, as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown promised in 1997, what other cuts will they make? Given their plans for billions in green investment, how will they make their sums add up? Labour is always held more tightly to account on spending than the Tories – unjust, but true. For now, Labour says it cannot possibly know what state the finances will be in come 2024. That position may hold for a while, but not for ever. All this is made harder by Labour’s refusal to speak of the great unmentionable, the giant, stomping elephant marked Brexit which, the governor of the Bank of England confirmed this week, is one big reason why the British economy is contracting while the eurozone and the US are growing. Public support for quitting the EU is at an all-time low, with even one in five leave voters now conceding it was a mistake. It is the biggest single error of the post-2010 period, if not the postwar era, and yet the opposition can barely utter the word, let alone demand the government answer for it. So yes, the gloom descending on Britain is now so thick that the simple logic of “time for a change” should see the Conservatives beaten in 2024. This week the economics of that became simpler and starker – but the politics just got trickier.

2022-07-26T16:00:02Z,Labour is being too cautious on public ownership - it’s pragmatic policy | Cat Hobbs,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/labour-cautious-public-ownership,"Yesterday morning, Rachel Reeves was drawn into stating on the Today programme that a Labour government would not bring rail, energy and water into public ownership. Then followed a number of tweets from Labour’s shadow transport ministers, reaffirming the party’s commitment to nationalising the railway. By the afternoon, Keir Starmer had confirmed that rail would indeed be brought into public ownership because this was “pragmatic”, but water and energy would not. While Starmer claims the pragmatism of the policy rests on the fact that some of the rail network is already in public hands, the more relevant issue is that Labour is terrified of buying back assets. Bringing contracts (like rail franchises) into public ownership when they come to an end is generally cost-free whereas buying back water and energy companies involves compensating shareholders – and Jeremy Corbyn was hammered for this in the 2019 election. Of course, if Labour brings the whole railway into public ownership and funds it properly, that will be a huge cause for celebration. Privatisation has utterly failed and wastes £1bn a year. The best railway in Europe is publicly owned, in Switzerland. It could go further. If Labour’s rule is that public ownership is fine if it’s cost-free, why not set up a publicly owned energy supply company to compete in the market and offer people a better deal on their energy bills (as French EDF is doing right now)? The government has propped up Bulb at great cost when it could instead have created a new public supplier and transferred its 1.7 million customers. When smaller suppliers failed, they could be absorbed into this company. It could go further still. Why not set up a publicly owned renewable generation company to drive forward water and wind energy, while creating jobs and boosting the economy? The Norwegian state owns Statkraft, the largest renewables generator in Europe and is considering setting up a state-owned hydrogen company. Denmark owns 50% of Ørsted (previously Dong Energy), the world’s largest developer of offshore wind power. Creating an energy supplier and a renewable generation company could be done at very little cost, and would be a pragmatic way to use public ownership to tackle the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis. But by awkwardly dodging discussion of buying back water and energy grids, when recent polling shows a majority of “red wall” voters believe they belong in public hands, Labour is missing an opportunity. The privatised English water monopolies are spewing sewage into our rivers and seas, killing fish and making children ill, and allowing 900 Olympic swimming pools worth of water a day to leak away because they’d rather not spend money on investing in infrastructure. Meanwhile, they return around £2bn a year to shareholders, pay their CEOs millions and rack up a debt mountain at our expense. Scottish Water has spent £72 a year extra per household on infrastructure because it’s in public ownership. The energy grid monopolies have extremely high profits, and have similarly been slow to invest in infrastructure. Bringing energy transmission and distribution into public hands would save about £3.7bn a year. It’s understandable that Labour is scared to talk about this. But bringing these assets into public hands would be a brilliant deal for the public purse. Every household in the country could benefit, and so would local economies. Parliament can judge what is in the public interest and decide how much compensation would be appropriate. It seems reasonable to compensate shareholders for the money they originally invested, rather than the current market value of shares. The policy would pay for itself in around seven years on that basis. Would this hurt our pensions? Absolutely not. Our water companies and energy networks are primarily owned by shareholders abroad. Wessex Water, for example, is owned by a Malaysian company, and Northumbrian Water is 80% owned by Li Ka Shing, a Hong Kong businessman. Only 8.5% of the water sector is owned by UK pensions. UK Power Networks, covering London, is also owned by Li Ka Shing. The US billionaire Warren Buffett owns Northern Powergrid, which provides electricity to north-east England. Only 2% of our energy is owned by UK pensions. How about really taking back control, having water and energy companies that work for the British public and protecting pensions as needed while we do it? England’s model of selling off water assets wholesale is unique and the UK is almost the only country in Europe to have a privatised energy grid. Reeves has already committed to £28bn of green investment a year. Bringing water and energy into public ownership would also be an investment, giving the government tools to cut bills, connect up community renewables to the grid, upgrade infrastructure to stop leaks and clean up rivers and seas. People want decent public transport. They also want affordable energy bills and rivers that aren’t filled with sewage. Taking back our national assets is not only pragmatic, it’s a vote winner.

2022-07-06T12:31:49Z,‘Putin rubbing hands with glee’ after EU votes to class gas and nuclear as green,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green,"The European parliament has backed plans to label gas and nuclear energy as “green”, rejecting appeals from prominent Ukrainians and climate activists that the proposals are a gift to Vladimir Putin. One senior MEP said the vote was a “dark day for the climate”, while experts said the EU had set a dangerous precedent for countries to follow. The row began late last year with the leak of long-awaited details on the EU’s green investment guidebook, intended to help investors channel billions to the clean power transition. The European Commission decided some gas and nuclear projects could be included in the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities, subject to certain conditions. Under the plans, gas can be classed as a sustainable investment if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low-carbon gases”. Nuclear power can be called green if a project promises to deal with radioactive waste. The plan could only be stopped by a majority of EU member states or members of the European parliament. With most EU governments in favour, attention turned to the European parliament, but on Wednesday MEPs failed to muster a blocking majority. Only 282 MEPs voted in favour of an amendment against the inclusion of gas and nuclear, falling short of the 353 votes needed to overturn the decision. Bas Eickhout, the vice-president of the European parliament’s environment committee, said it was “dark day for the climate and energy transition”. The veteran Dutch MEP, who led the parliament in intra-EU negotiations on the taxonomy regulation, said the EU was “sending a disastrous signal to investors and the rest of the world” that it recognised fossil gas and nuclear as sustainable investments. “By clearing the way for this delegated act, the EU will have unreliable and greenwashed conditions for green investments in the energy sector,” he said. Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian climate scientist and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: “I am in shock. Russia’s war against Ukraine is a war paid for by climate-heating fossil fuels and the European parliament just voted to boost billions of funding to fossil gas from Russia. How in the world is that in line with Europe’s stance to protect our planet and stand with Ukraine?” Johanne Schroeten, a policy adviser at the E3G climate thinktank, said: “Vested interests seem to have gotten the upper hand. The EU has now set a dangerous precedent of low ambition for other countries and jurisdictions to follow.” The deal came after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, promised Emmanuel Macron that France could have the green seal of approval for nuclear projects, which prompted gas-consuming countries to demand a similar concession. Campaigners are now vowing legal action. WWF said that with its fellow NGO Client Earth it would “explore all potential avenues for further action to stop this greenwashing and protect the credibility of the whole EU taxonomy”. Two anti-nuclear states, Austria and Luxembourg, have already announced they will take the commission to the European court of justice. But the proposals have powerful backers. Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, tweeted that he welcomed the “positive results”, adding: “I am glad that Romania’s constant efforts on considering gas and nuclear as part of progressive decarbonisation were reflected in the EP’s final decision.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation intended for technical issues. Critics are now asking how such highly controversial plans could be passed through a form of lawmaking with few hurdles and less scrutiny. Activist fears were fuelled when Russia’s energy minister, Nikolai Shulginov, said the EU’s green taxonomy offered “a range of opportunities”. Speaking to the Energy Intelligence website before his country’s invasion of Ukraine, he said the inclusion of natural gas in the green taxonomy was evidence that the EU had realised it had made “a slight mistake” on the green transition. Since the invasion, the EU executive has set out plans to phase out Russian gas, but member states have not fixed a deadline to stop gas imports, unlike Russian oil and coal. The Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun tweeted: “Putin is rubbing his hands with glee today,” adding that the MEPs who had voted for or abstained on the inclusion of gas and nuclear in thegreen taxonomy had handed the Russian president “huge gifts”. She said: “I thank the brave 278 MEPs who objected. It wasn’t enough, but we won’t stop fighting.” • This article was amended on 6 July 2022 to clarify that while some prominent Ukrainian politicians came out against the EU vote on the green taxonomy, this was not the position of the state of Ukraine.",Energy; European Union; Gas; Nuclear power; Environment; Europe; European Commission; Russia; Ukraine; Renewable energy; World news,Environment
2022-08-04T09:07:58Z,Energy companies are bleeding British families dry. Here’s how to fix it | Owen Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/energy-companies-bleeding-british-families-governmental-control,"Britain’s households have been reduced to cash machines for the shareholders of energy giants. For any future historian seeking to understand just how broken was the British economic model of the 2020s, the dichotomy of these two statistics requires no further explanation: £6.9bn of profits for BP – the second highest ever – while the average household energy bill is expected to reach more than £3,600 a year by winter. This is self-evidently unaffordable for millions of British families, all too many of whom already skip hot meals to ensure their children are fed, while the only hardship shareholders can expect are hangovers from one too many champagne dinners. That the Tories were shamed into imposing a windfall tax in May is no adequate answer for a looming human catastrophe. The extra 25% they will pay on profits only applies from three weeks ago, meaning the vast fortunes made before then will be untouched. In part, they are profiteering from war: the horrors of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia have sent prices for oil and gas surging. The killing fields of armed conflict have often proven to be lucrative business opportunities. That history often repeats this sordid enterprise makes it no less grotesque. The energy companies know the case for a far more ambitious tax is inarguable, and so they resort to desperate spin. Higher rates will mean confiscating money desperately needed for green investment, they cry, imperilling the transition to the clean energy required to preserve human civilisation from the existential threat of the climate emergency. Don’t believe them. For a start, despite their attempts to “greenwash” their reputations as climate fighters, the world’s biggest oil and gas companies spend more than £150m a year lobbying politicians to halt, water down or destroy policies required to tackle the climate crisis. That big energy has thrown £1m at the Tories since the last election is not the whimsical splashing around of money: it’s because they trust the Conservatives most to forestall demands for tougher action to be taken against them. This was hardly naive: witness the 90% tax breaks – for investing in fossil fuel extraction – which Rishi Sunak handed them, allowing them to dramatically slash their tax bills. In any case, the killer fact is that 60% of their profits go directly to shareholders: none of that is funding investment in anything, let alone clean energy. Since 2010, they’ve handed out nearly £200bn to shareholders: imagine how this money could instead have been used to promote clean energy, as well as reducing household bills. “They’re not using cash to invest – and when they do invest, it’s still fossil fuel heavy,” says Mathew Lawrence, director of the Common Wealth thinktank. “It’s better to see them not as energy companies but as institutions whose main goal is managing cashflows to reward investors.” But not all years yield such bumper profits, say the energy companies: what of the lean periods? Even then, if you average out the years, big energy is awash with cash. Their apologists’ opposition to a sweeping tax becomes ever more desperate: such as claiming it will hammer pensioners, a point comprehensively rebutted by Common Wealth’s research which highlights that the main pension funds own less than 0.2% of BP and Shell’s shares . And would anyone consider Norway – which enjoys one of the highest standards of livings on Earth – to be financially reckless. Yet its permanent windfall tax – worth 56% on top of corporation tax – means that for every £100 they collect from barrels of oil in the North Sea, Britain collects just £8. While being coerced by popular pressure into imposing a more drastic tax on the energy companies is the most we can expect under Tory rule, that does not mean it should be the limit of Labour’s ambitions. When Keir Starmer was asked on national television during the 2020 Labour leadership race if he supported renationalising energy, he stuck his hand up, only later to renege on this promise, along with so many of his other campaign commitments. But taxes only offer temporary redress, rather than dealing with a structurally broken industry which should never have been surrendered by the government to profiteers. How can it be that Britain is one of only two European nations to have entirely flogged off its transmission grid , for example, with National Grid frittering away £1.4bn in dividends to shareholders in 2021 alone, instead of using it for investment? French president Emmanuel Macron can hardly be construed as a leftwing firebrand, and yet his government is taking full control of the already mostly nationalised EDF energy firm. Because it’s publicly owned, the government could simply order the company to take a £7bn hit to protect families from a cost-of-living crisis by limiting bill hikes to just 4% this year. As pro-public ownership organisation We Own It highlights, academic research points to energy prices that are up to 30% lower under public ownership – here is an obviously viable long-term solution. A social order which robs struggling households to shove astronomical dividends into the bank accounts of well-to-do shareholders is irretrievably broken. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss’s position is to denounce failed economic orthodoxies that have prevailed for years, concluding that the problem is that taxes are too high on big business – rather than, say, energy companies bleeding British families dry. Her blind refusal to acknowledge the reality speaks to a political party inhabiting a parallel universe. Britain’s energy industry should never have been reduced to a cash cow for profiteers. At the very least, our frontline politicians should be shamed into raiding these super-profits to offer their citizens a life raft. As it is, they’ve been left to drown.

2023-03-15T15:09:28Z,Budget 2023: will it lift Britain’s economic gloom? Our panel give their verdict | Polly Toynbee and others,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-britain-economic-jeremy-hunt-childcare-pensions-benefits,"Polly Toynbee: This budget lays the turf for the election – on Labour’s home ground “Are you and your family better off than you were 13 years ago?” Ask yourself this, Labour says, echoing Ronald Reagan. Of course not. Living standards will fall and every public service will continue to decay. The government can expect few thanks for preventing another monster rise in energy bills, when people are still paying twice as much as a year ago. Headlines on falling inflation will impress few when voters find prices don’t fall, but keep climbing. “You could have been even worse off” is not much of a slogan. Out there, the biggest wave of strikes rolls on, yet there was nothing here for public sector pay. The only tax break goes to the top 1% who are already soaring ahead while others fall back, given a bonanza on already over-subsidised pensions to prevent a handful of NHS consultants retiring. With UK childcare costs the highest in Europe, that £4bn will help parents back to work. This shows how oppositions can force change: Labour’s “party of the family” promise of broader and deeper wraparound care has spooked the government. With weakened staff ratios of 1:5, it’s no restoration of Sure Start and crucial early years education. Have ministers looked after five two-year-olds all day long? Jam tomorrow, as much of this is not due until the other side of the election. Yet this bidding war for best early years policy is a giant leap forward in political priorities. This budget lays the turf for the election, and it’s all on Labour’s home ground: green growth, services and cost of living. Minor repairs here and there only act as public reminders of all that is lost since 2010. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Miatta Fahnbulleh: No proper plan to kickstart the economy After a lost decade during which economic mismanagement has led to the biggest squeeze in living standards for generations, the chancellor had two big jobs to do today: insulate people from the cost of living crisis, and jump-start the economy to reverse the decline in living standards. He bottled both. And the result is a projected 5.7% fall in real incomes in the next two years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility – the largest two-year fall since records began. The chancellor showed how out of touch he is with the reality of people’s lives as he failed to boost the incomes of those who have been hit the hardest. Nothing for the public sector workers we all rely on, or for families on low pay who have been pushed further below the breadline. Holding the energy price guarantee at £2,500 was right, but this is a small reprieve for families facing bills that are double what they were two years ago. We needed a great homes upgrade to insulate millions of homes and the rollout of free basic energy to keep bills down for good. But the biggest own goal was the lack of a proper plan to kickstart the economy. In the US, Joe Biden has laid down the gauntlet for action on green investment. Hunt should have taken a leaf from Biden’s book and boosted much-needed investment in green transition to build new industries, create good jobs, revive our communities and boost prosperity in every part of the economy. Hunt’s failure to make the big calls today will cement this lost decade and leave millions paying the price. Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation Katy Balls: Hunt still faces pressure from Tories on taxes Ahead of the spring budget, there were three areas where Tory MPs were the most concerned: childcare, defence and tax. Each is seen as an electoral vulnerability at the next election. Jeremy Hunt has tried to provide on all three – but each comes with a catch. The Ministry of Defence received a spending boost, but the pledge to raise defence funding to 2.5% will only come into effect “as soon as fiscal and economic circumstances allow”. That could be some time. With Labour trying to make childcare a dividing line at the next election, the government was under pressure to act. It was drawing criticism both from Trussites upset that the former prime minister’s plan to slash childcare ratios had been shelved and “one nation” Tories who were angered that nothing had been provided to replace it. The promise of 30 hours of free childcare a week from nine months old for working parents has been welcomed in the party with relief. However, it will only be introduced in full in 2025 – after the next election. But the trickiest area for Hunt with his own party relates to tax. He ignored calls to halt the planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Hunt has been privately telling MPs that the capital allowance he announced means it is a win for low-tax Tories as “it’s the effective rate of corporation tax that counts”. However, it’s a position that leaves many in the party frustrated. While Hunt echoed Rishi Sunak in declaring the need to first bring down inflation, they will soon struggle to use this defence. One of the best pieces of news today comes not from Hunt, but the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that inflation is due to fall by more than half to 2.9% by the end of the year. It means that there is a growing expectation that Sunak and Hunt will embark on a range of tax cuts closer to the election. If they don’t, they will face the wrath of already impatient MPs. Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political editor Frances Ryan: Work is a virtue, Mr Hunt? Compassion is too “Work is a virtue,” Jeremy Hunt declared ominously, setting the tone for a “back to work” budget that revved up pressure on the long-term sick and lowest earners. Childcare was one of the few areas to see a genuine boost. But look at the details: many carers on universal credit will have to meet more work search requirements to receive any help. The plan to finally scrap the much criticised work capability assessment is on paper a relief to disabled people, but recipients must wait anxiously to hear what replaces it. That the government will be “rigorously” extending the toxic benefits sanctions regime shows that, under the Tories, the poorest will always get more stick than carrot. Stepping up a policy that is proven to push people to food banks is particularly cruel at a time when many are already struggling to eat and heat. Hunt proudly giving £100m to support charities to help them with the most disadvantaged was classic Conservatism. Forget the dignity of state entitlement – give the poor piecemeal charity and call yourself generous for doing it. Yet the real insight came as much from what wasn’t in the budget as what was. Hunt rejected pleas to create a social tariff to help the poorest and disabled pay energy bills, or to raise meagre benefits to cover the soaring costs of living. Contrast that with the huge pension giveaway to the largely very wealthy. This was a budget that tinkered at the edges of Britain’s crises, while making life harder for the poorest and disabled. Work is a virtue? Compassion is too. Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist Louisa Britain: So much for a ‘back to work’ budget Disappointingly, this “back to work” budget proposed no plan to match unemployed people in Britain into sectors suffering from post-Brexit shortages. More than 70,000 visas were issued to foreign nationals to work in the care sector last year, not to mention construction, hospitality, logistics, agriculture or the NHS. Increased benefit sanctions for unemployed and underemployed adults means rises in sudden extreme harms such as utility disconnection, eviction and suicides, which will only deepen barriers to work in Britain’s most vulnerable communities. Meanwhile, the £10m for suicide prevention charities will not fill the hole left by the aggressive erosion of social security, ever-rising rents and underfunded NHS mental health care facilities. The promise that disabled people will be able to keep benefits, and that the work capability assessment will be scrapped leads to the obvious question – will that also mean the scrapping of the limited capability for work and work related activity premiums currently offered to those of us who aren’t well enough to return to work? Zoom working is still not an avenue for our most unwell and incapacitated. Improved childcare payments available to working families in receipt of universal credit will come as a welcome boost to parents on low wages, but only where those parents do not face additional challenges. So, too, will lowering the age for free or supported childcare. This might eventually go some way to the “back to work” mission statement. Little else here will. Louisa Britain is a commentator and campaigner focusing on disability and low-income issues. She is the editor of the forthcoming collection One in Five Rebecca Long-Bailey: Gimmicks and spin instead of real help For a multimillionaire chancellor to deliver a budget that offers so little for hard-pressed families during the cost of living crisis is outrageous. On a day when so many of Britain’s key workers were forced to strike over poverty pay, Jeremy Hunt’s offering to them is an insult. Instead of using the budget to announce a thoroughly deserved pay increase for the doctors, teachers, university, rail and public sector workers, on strike today and throughout the week, Hunt has given us more of the same. There is little for the low-paid or poverty-stricken households. All we get are pathetic gimmicks and spin. The announcement that energy bills will be kept at the same rate for just three months is ridiculously inadequate. Hard-pressed families need a guarantee that after three months the cap will be lowered significantly to reflect the falling wholesale energy costs already seen. Increasing the living wage to £15 an hour, a major improvement in benefits for the poorest, and much better pay deals for all public sector workers, should all have been in the budget. A genuine tax on oil and gas companies and the introduction of a wealth tax on the assets and profits of the super-rich, could easily fund a massive injection into our public services. Widespread “in work” poverty and cuts to workers’ pay are the reasons why so many dedicated public servants are forced to strike. But instead of seeking to make the super-rich pay more, the Tories are imposing more cruel sanctions on benefit claimants instead. Once again, the Tories have delivered a budget that makes struggling families pay for the crisis they themselves caused. Britain desperately needs a budget to tackle the cost of living crisis, and this didn’t come anywhere close. Rebecca Long-Bailey is the Labour MP for Salford and Eccles Lucy Pasha-Robinson: The crisis in childcare is finally impossible to ignore At last, the Conservatives are waking up to the transformative potential of affordable childcare for Britain’s bottom line. Better late than never. Jeremy Hunt’s plan to invest £4bn in free nursery places for one- and two-year-olds looks like it could offset some of the untenable financial pressures facing parents, and stem the flow of women leaving the workforce to care for families. But as always, the devil is in the detail. The earliest that parents will be able to access those extra hours for two-year-olds is April 2024 – and then, just 15 hours. Deliberate underfunding of “free” places for three- and four-year-olds has picked every last scrap of meat off the bones of our early years provision. Widespread nursery closures, owners operating at a loss, a staffing and retention crisis: a fat question mark remains over how exactly early years providers will cope with any influx in demand for extra places, even if they are funded at cost. Hunt is hoping to shore up the ailing sector by injecting £288m into the existing free childcare scheme for three-year-olds by 2024-25. Could that be enough to restore the sector to full health? It’s unlikely when the government’s own pre-pandemic estimates found it would cost an extra £2bn to fully fund the existing provision. Relaxing staff to child ratios is part of Hunt’s plan to reduce financial and staffing pressures on early years settings, but there are concerns for the quality of care provided to the children at the heart of these plans, not to mention their lack of evidence basis. There are reasons to be hopeful. The economic argument for fixing our childcare woes is becoming impossible to ignore. Britain’s two main parties are now jostling with increasing urgency to come up with the best childcare reform package ahead of the next general election. The Tories’ plan is far more radical than many would have imagined – finally, a concession their future depends on.

2021-03-18T16:30:34Z,Australia lags far behind other top economies on 'green recovery' pandemic spending,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/19/australia-lags-far-behind-other-top-economies-on-green-recovery-pandemic-spending,"Australia is the worst performer on a list of the world’s 50 largest economies for “green recovery” spending to kickstart economic growth after the Covid pandemic, according to research conducted for the United Nations environment program. The research suggests Australia spent US$2bn on green initiatives during the coronavirus recovery, compared with US$57bn in France, US$54bn in South Korea, US$47bn in Germany, US$42bn in the United Kingdom, US$41bn in China and US$24bn in Japan. Germany spent $9bn on hydrogen alone. The work draws on evidence collected up to February 2021 by Oxford University’s Economic Recovery Project. The initiative is supported by the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. Brian O’Callaghan, an Australian economist and engineer who leads Oxford’s Economic Recovery Project, told Guardian Australia the research indicates that governments are falling short on green recovery spending in global terms. Australia got the wooden spoon – coming in at the bottom of the list. The UN-backed research differentiates between rescue and recovery spending during the crisis. Rescue spending encompasses management of the public health crisis and fiscal support to insulate against the economic shock, whereas recovery spending focuses on rebuilding and retooling economies post-Covid. “What we found is Australia has spent considerably more on recovery initiatives than most other countries, I think only the United Kingdom has done more,” O’Callaghan said. “That’s understandable because Australia is at the tail end of the virus and we are trying to get the economy going again, while other countries are still in it. Interestingly, Australia has also been a standout on green spending, but unfortunately, on the negative side. “Overall we find that 18% of total recovery spending around the world has gone towards green initiatives, but in Australia, the figure is 2%. Of the major economies, Australia was the worst.” O’Callaghan said this was “a missed opportunity” for the Morrison government and a bad outcome for the country. “The consequences for Australia of low green investment are mammoth on both economic and climate grounds,” he said. “This is the time for us to be reorienting our economy to industries that will drive future growth. The notion of a gas-fired recovery is ridiculous and the world sees that. Recession enables rebirth – now is not the time for dirty initiatives.” Last year, the International Monetary Fund urged both major and developing economies to pursue a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The IMF said if nations applied a combination of carbon pricing and green stimulus, coupled with compensation for lower-income households to make the transition fair, the world would plot a sustainable path out of deep recession and combat the growing climate crisis. Some Australian business groups have also urged the government to pursue a green recovery. Australia also remains under pressure from key allies to lift the level of climate policy ambition. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Thursday the UK expected Australia to “stretch” climate commitments and set out a plan to meet them before a major summit later this year. This week, Morrison reiterated his intention to reach net zero emissions “as soon as possible and preferably by 2050” and transition Australia to a “new energy economy”. he made the comments in a conversation with Joe Biden’s special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry. The US and the UK last week issued a joint statement urging all countries “to take the steps needed to keep a 1.5C temperature limit within reach, including through ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to cut emissions and reach net zero”. Official projections released in December suggested the Morrison government was not yet on track to meet its 2030 emissions target of a 26% to 28% cut compared with 2005 levels. Scientists say that target is roughly half of what Australia should be doing over that timeframe. The Australian ambassador to the US, Arthur Sinodinos, this week implied the Morrison government was considering updating its targets before the Glasgow conference, known as Cop26. Sinodinos told the US Studies Centre event in Canberra it was “better to underpromise and overdeliver” when setting emission reduction targets, and Australia wanted to work with the US on technologies that would “really move the dial”. “Our view is targets are something which are important in their own regard, and Australia is doing further work on what that means in the future as we go to Cop26,” he said.",Australian politics; Climate crisis; Environment; Coronavirus; Business; Australia news,Australia news
2022-01-14T13:51:01Z,Leading UK fracking firm taken over by green energy group,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/14/leading-uk-fracking-firm-taken-over-by-green-energy-group,"A high-profile UK fracking company has been taken over by a green energy group and now has an anti-fracking campaigner as a director. Yorkshire-based Third Energy was at the forefront of efforts to produce fossil gas and intended to use high-pressure fluids to fracture shale rocks under the county. But it was hampered by permit delays and fierce local opposition. Now the company has been taken over by Wolfland Group, a renewable energy company. It has halted all fossil fuel production from its conventional gas wells and has no plans for further exploration or development. Instead it will focus on green energy, including solar farms, and the use of existing wells for geothermal energy and the burial of captured carbon dioxide emissions. Steve Mason was a leading figure in the anti-fracking campaign in Yorkshire and is now a director of Wolfland Group. “The current energy crisis has shown that we must be energy independent as a nation and that fossil fuels need to be urgently replaced by clean renewable energy supplies, which will lead to cheaper energy and help us tackle climate change,” he said. “We believe we’re now a real-life example of walking the talk and turning stranded fossil fuel assets into green energy solutions.” Mike O’Shea, chief executive of Wolfland Group, said: “Taking a dirty fossil fuel fracking company and flipping it into a green energy beacon [is] an amazing opportunity.” Russell Hoare, managing director at Third Energy, said: “Our [previous] shareholder was actively pursuing oil and gas development in the US and Ukraine. It was difficult to find green investment with the balance still swinging towards fossil fuels. Now we can say we have absolutely no interest in fossil fuels and we can move forward to a sustainable future.” Nevertheless, the company will not be changing its name. “Third Energy perfectly describes the energy transition that needs to take place in the UK,” said Mason. “The first energy was fossil fuels, the second energy was nuclear and now the third energy is renewables. It’s a perfect brand for renewable energy.” Gas prices are currently very high and rising energy bills have sparked fears over the rising cost of living for many families. A few commentators have called for increased gas production in the UK, but experts say this would do nothing to reduce dependence on the fuel or its cost, the price of which is set by international markets. Instead, campaigners are calling on Boris Johnson to provide home insulation for people on low incomes and a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to fund emergency support for vulnerable people.",Fracking; Renewable energy; UK news; Business; Energy industry; Energy; Environment; Gas; Fossil fuels,Environment
2022-09-23T10:08:46Z,Does Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget offer any solutions to Britain's crises? Our panel decides | Katy Balls and others,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/23/kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-offer--britain-crises,"Polly Toynbee: In the looking-glass world of Trussonomics, it’s borrow like there’s no tomorrow Imagine if Labour blew up the rules to balloon already soaring inflation, borrowing without knowing the cost, spending on evidence-free pet projects to benefit its own favoured core backers while falling into recession. Cue collapse in markets, a run on the pound, flight of capital, interest rates soaring, foreign raiders snatching UK companies, collapse in consumer confidence: actually, that’s happening. In the looking-glass world of Trussonomics, it’s borrow like there’s no tomorrow to reward bankers with bonuses, the rich with huge 5% top tax cuts, second homeowners with stamp duty cuts, with nothing much for the middle or the poor. The Conservatives’ trick through the ages was to persuade ordinary voters that what serves the rich serves “the economy” and ultimately them too – the nonexistent trickle-down Joe Biden just excoriated. But that took deceit and pretence: Cameron’s “big society”, Johnson’s “levelling up”. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng’s lack of guile is their one virtue. Fairness is not on their menu and they say so: deliberately accelerating inequalities is their “growth” plan straight from the eccentric rightwing pamphleteers. So far, they’ve had no poll bounce. Will tax cuts yield enough to outweigh alarm at a denuded NHS, care and public services? Shock and awe looks bold, but watch it blow back on them. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: This is a huge gamble. And it won’t take long to see if it has backfired The Conservative party has reinvented itself once again. In this fiscal event, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng have undone much of the work of the Tory party over the past few years. It’s hard not to read his pledge to “turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth” as an attack on the last 12 years of Tory government. For all the talk of a mini-budget, the announcements are anything but small – with an estimated £45bn worth of tax cuts. Not only are they economically risky, they’re politically difficult. The decision to abolish the 45p rate of tax for the highest earners is in the words of one Tory backbencher “what a diplomat would call brave”. The unease among Tory MPs who backed Rishi Sunak was clear in the Commons chamber as the announcements rolled out. Ultimately, today’s announcements are further evidence of the clear blue water opening up between Labour and the Conservatives. Supporters of Keir Starmer will be quick to weaponise the lifting of the banker bonus and tax cuts for the rich. The bet Truss and Kwarteng are making is that the package of measures will lead to growth. The reason they went so big with today’s announcement was twofold. First, they have only a limited period before the next election to try to get the economy going so time is of the essence. Second, Truss’s team know that political capital tends to go down not up so they want to push through her plans when her stock is highest. It is intended to set the framework for the next two years. But it’s ultimately a gamble – and it won’t take long to find out if it has backfired. Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor Miatta Fahnbulleh: A missed opportunity to tackle the crisis head on Make no mistake, today’s announcement was not for most of us, but the very wealthiest in society. At its heart was a massive transfer of income to the wealthy. A string of tax cuts – abolishing the top rate of tax, lowering corporation tax, reversing the national insurance rise, cutting stamp duty – disproportionately benefit the rich and provide no answers to the cost of living scandal. They don’t help the people who need it the most and rob our creaking public services of the investment they desperately need. The energy price guarantee will take the sting out of the cost of living crisis for many, but millions of families on low and modest incomes will still feel it. This is a mini-budget completely divorced from this reality. The chancellor missed the opportunity to tackle the crisis head on. He should have provided additional protections for families on low to modest incomes through a cost of living allowance, plus a much needed boost to benefits, paid for by toughening the windfall tax on energy producers and increasing the tax paid on wealth. He should have put the building blocks in place to get us out of this energy crisis, for example through a Great Homes Upgrade, which would help to reduce the energy we use by insulating millions of homes and ramp up the production of clean energy through cooperative energy providers owned by the public. Boosting green investment could have unlocked the growth Truss and Kwarteng claim to want. Instead, this was a budget that put ideology over common sense. And it is the country that will pay the price. Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation Nick Butler: Kwarteng believes in markets. But will they believe in him? Winning University Challenge is not a qualification for being chancellor of the exchequer. On the contrary, youthful victory can breed an exaggerated self-belief. Who needs the scrutiny of the Office for Budget Responsibility (which he has refused) or the help of an experienced permanent secretary in the Treasury (whom he has sacked) when you know it all? Unfortunately, the financial markets can sense bluster as the fall in the pound since he took over on 6 September demonstrates. Nowhere is the bluster more evident than on energy. The government has taken on the price risk for the next six months – a necessary but not sufficient response. Nothing has been done to augment short-term supplies of imported gas or to add to the UK’s minimal levels of storage. Fracking and development of a few small North Sea fields will not provide any extra supplies for years to come. There is no examination of which price increases are justified and which are not. Companies producing power from wind and nuclear have not seen their costs increase but continue to milk a broken system. There is no serious attempt to limit energy demand. Unless Vladimir Putin is in the mood to surrender, the risk of further increases in gas prices this winter is very high. Once in place the subsidies will be hard to remove. The bill will be enormous and could be far higher than the unexplained £60bn estimate, adding to a new level of borrowing which the chancellor avoided spelling out. This time round even Kwarteng could not answer the starter for 10 – the most important question of all for the financial markets – who pays? Kwarteng believes in markets. But will they believe in him? Nick Butler is a visiting professor at King’s College London, a former group vice president for strategy and policy development at BP, and an adviser to Gordon Brown James Perry: This only helps the new super-class of extreme wealth holders The intellectual underpinning of, and justification for, this mini-budget is “trickle-down economics” – the idea that wealth trickles down from the wealthy to everyone else. The data is unequivocal that this doesn’t happen. Rather than trickling down, the last 50 years has shown us that new wealth creation drifts like snow into the hands of the already wealthy. And when it is there, it is hoarded. The top 1% of households have 230 times more wealth than those in the bottom 10%. So this budget is built on ideological self-delusion – extreme wealth holds back the economy, leaves public services underfunded and creates social division. Kwarteng today has scrapped the top rate of tax and the cap on bankers’ bonuses. This only helps the new super-class of extreme wealth holders – a small number of people who hoard an eye-watering amount of wealth. Britain was built on fair play, playing by the rules, being in it together. If this government is serious about “levelling up”, there is a simple and obvious move for it to make. Tax extreme wealth. Doing so will create a structural change in the public finances and promote social cohesion. And what’s more, it’s popular – supported by 70% of the public and 64% of Conservative voters.

2020-09-14T20:57:22Z,Biden calls Trump a 'climate arsonist' as president denies science,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/14/biden-trump-wildfires-messages-campaign-trail-california,"The climate crisis and record wildfires in the western US forced their way into the presidential campaign on Monday, with Joe Biden calling Donald Trump a “climate arsonist” and Trump falsely claiming that the planet “will start getting cooler” and that the science is still uncertain. The historic fires in California, Oregon and Washington have killed at least 35, forced tens of thousands to evacuate and subjected millions to some of the worst air pollution in the world – yet the subject has been slow to penetrate mainstream politics, amid the Covid-19 pandemic and a national reckoning on racial injustice. In a speech in his home town, Wilmington, Delaware, on a warm afternoon on the heels of the hemisphere’s hottest summer yet, Biden emphasized the wildfires’ connection to the human-made climate crisis and pitched his plan to invest in green infrastructure in order to create jobs and stimulate an economic recovery from the pandemic. “If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires, how many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out, how many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms?” Biden asked. “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze … when more of America is under water?” The former vice-president highlighted how the climate crisis is touching all Americans, from the western fires to midwestern floods, droughts and windstorms and Gulf coast hurricanes. Trump meanwhile blamed the fires on poor forest management, spoke of “exploding” trees, and disputed the science showing the world will only get hotter if fossil-fuel and other climate emissions from human activity are not steeply curtailed. During his visit to California, for a briefing on the wildfires and to bestow awards to California national guard members who helped rescue campers stranded by one of the strongest of dozens of infernos, Trump also questioned the usefulness of US climate action. “When you get into climate change, well, is India going to change its ways? Is China going to change its ways? Is Russia going to change its ways?” he told reporters when he arrived in Sacramento. “We’re just a small speck. They make up a big preponderance of the pollution.” The US is in fact the biggest historical emitter of climate pollution, although China is currently the top emitter. In a later briefing, Trump interrupted an official, Wade Crowfoot, the secretary of California’s Natural Resources Agency, to argue the climate “will start getting cooler, you just watch”. Crowfoot responded: “I wish science agreed with you.” To which Trump retorted: “I don’t think science knows, actually.” Crowfoot later tweeted: “It won’t actually get cooler, Mr President,” alongside a temperature graphic. Lacking forest management does exacerbate wildfires, but hot and dry conditions because of climate change are a major contributor. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, in the briefing with Trump, acknowledged a need for better forest management but said: “We come to the perspective, humbly ... that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this.” The responses from Biden and Trump illustrate the importance of the November election in determining the trajectory of global climate action. If Biden wins, the US will recommit to climate efforts, potentially encouraging deeper action from the rest of the world. The scale and speed of Biden’s response would depend largely on congressional politics and could be hampered by his hesitancy to call for a rapid end to the use of fossil fuels. But he has vowed that climate will be a top priority. If Trump wins, he will continue to cheerlead fossil fuels, stripping environmental standards and helping the industry compete with clean energy. Julien Emile-Geay, an associate professor of earth sciences at the University of Southern California, said: “Voters will soon have to choose between an administration invested into denying objective information – including, but not limited to, all the science it finds inconvenient – and a Democratic ticket that, for all its faults, at least acknowledges this reality. “This is what political choice has turned to in 2020: a referendum on objective reality.” In his speech, Biden said Trump “has no interest in meeting this moment. He’s already said he wanted to withhold aid to California, to punish the people of California. Because they didn’t vote for him. This is another crisis. Another crisis he won’t take responsibility for. The west is literally on fire.” The conditions in the US are precisely those climate scientists and activists have warned about for years. On the west coast, dozens of fires are burning. On the Gulf coast, states are bracing for a possible second major hurricane this season, as Hurricane Sally heads for eastern Louisiana and the Florida panhandle. “It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America,” Biden said. “This is Donald Trump’s America. He’s in charge.” Globally, most countries are likely to miss a 2020 deadline to advance their climate plans, the United Nations climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, told Climate Home News. That includes China – the biggest emitter of heat-trapping climate pollution. A 2015 international agreement was meant to be the first step for countries to begin to significantly limit warming. But the world is far off track. Having warmed more than 1C since industrialization, it is now on a path toward 3C or higher.

2022-05-24T09:13:35Z,Sunak says he can’t help the cost of living crisis. What about these five simple steps? | George Dibb,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/sunak-cost-of-living-crisis-business-green,"Rishi Sunak has claimed there’s nothing he can do about the external global circumstances driving the cost of living crisis, but he’s dodged the real question: how can he best respond, and avoid an escalating crisis and a costly recession? In fact, there are fair, green solutions to this crisis staring us right in the face. And they’re solutions that should get support from business. Over the past few days, the trickle of increasingly panicked messages from businesses on the cost of living crisis has become a flood. Already alarmed by the Bank of England’s warning of a looming recession and “apocalyptic” price rises, business leaders were spooked when Sunak’s speech at the CBI last week left many people wondering if he understood the scale of the challenge. At the weekend, the chief executive of E.On – a company not known for its economic radicalism – declared that “the most important thing is that the government intervenes” and the chancellor must “tax those with the broadest shoulders”. Consumer spending drives the economy. If people are struggling to pay their gas bills, they have less money in their pockets to spend on the high street or a restaurant meal. Which is why, as the CBI’s director general, Tony Danker, has said, Sunak’s first step should be investing in social security via increases in universal credit and legacy benefits to prevent families falling into destitution. This would also help to stabilise the economy, not fuel inflation. Income tax cuts wouldn’t help here. They’d give a big bonus to the rich, but the poorest, already facing the choice between heating and eating, wouldn’t benefit at all. Second, we need a serious industrial strategy to boost confidence, give long-term business certainty and restore investment in the UK’s productive capacity. Sunak promised to increase private investment with a “super-deduction” incentive, but in fact it fell in the last quarter. To make this long-term vision work, Sunak should break up the Treasury and form a new Ministry for Economic Strategy with the target to drive investment-led, green growth. Third, rather than continuing to slip on our green ambitions, we must double down. Every home newly insulated and each wind turbine erected across the UK will reduce household fuel bills. We need to make this investment before 2050 anyway – so let’s do it now, to support the economy and bring down electricity bills sooner. As Danker said, non-inflationary, green investment opportunities are there for the taking, but government must “confirm them, launch them and fund them”. To do this we should build on the lessons learned during the pandemic and form a government taskforce to drive public and private sectors to collaborate better, spur business innovation and unblock the supply chain. We need an effective civil service, not one with a recruitment freeze and job cuts hanging over it. That collaboration, after all, not greed or capitalism, is what got us Covid vaccines and could bring lower energy bills too. Next, the government must make clear to businesses that just as they were supported in the pandemic, now companies must themselves act responsibly. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, misrepresented the problem when he said wage restraint was most important in stopping inflation. In fact, companies can reduce their profits too, to keep prices down – as the Bank has since acknowledged. Profits have gone up over recent decades, particularly in uncompetitive, concentrated sectors. In a particularly egregious example, petrol stations haven’t passed on the fuel duty cut to customers, benefiting their bottom line at the public’s expense. Evidence from the US suggests that recent rising prices have been disproportionately driven by rising profits, not wages. The real issue is that we’ve been too relaxed about some companies in some sectors building too much market power for too long. Their excessive market power is pushing prices higher still. At the same time, the risk of a wage-price spiral is low because of a collapse in trade unionism. The last time inflation was at 9%, more than half of workers were in a trade union; today it’s less than a quarter. Consequently, not only are wages failing to keep pace with inflation, but we’re seeing their biggest fall since records began. Instead of forcing workers to take the strain, companies should show profit restraint and cut their dividend payouts. Finally, as fossil fuel companies pile up huge, unexpected profits from the very crisis that is pushing millions into absolute poverty, it’s fair for the government to redistribute these into welfare and income support. Even the former Treasury minister Jesse Norman and the CEO of E.On seem to agree. Like Italy, we should levy a windfall tax on oil companies whose profits have soared merely because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Extraordinary unearned profits call for extraordinary measures. Sunak needs to realise that intervening now to avert a recession, help the worst-off families and secure a green transition is the best way to support everyone. This is the most responsible thing to do. In fact, as the penny-pinching chancellor should realise, we simply cannot afford not to.

2021-12-01T02:47:45Z,Australia’s biggest privately funded battery under construction at Hazelwood power station site,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/01/australias-biggest-privately-funded-battery-under-construction-at-hazelwood-power-station-site,"Australia’s biggest privately funded “big battery” is being built on the site of the former Hazelwood power station in Victoria’s Latrobe valley, Macquarie Group and Engie say. The 150MW battery will use existing infrastructure at the Hazelwood site to connect to the electricity grid, the companies said in a statement. Engie shut down Hazelwood, which was Australia’s dirtiest coal-fired power plant, in 2017 and demolished its chimneys using explosives last year. The battery, which is already under construction at an estimated cost of $150m, is due to be up and running by November 2022. It will be smaller than the 350MW battery planned for the nearby Yallourn coal-fired power station when it shuts down in mid-2028. Macquarie and Engie said that in addition to storing electricity during off-peak times and delivering it back into the grid when demand is highest, the battery will help stabilise supply by helping to control the frequency at which it is delivered – something that is expected to become increasingly important as the amount of renewable energy in the system increases. The battery will be built, operated and maintained by Fluence, a joint venture between German electronics group Siemens and American power generator AES, under a 20-year contract. It will support the transition to green energy and help “ensure that electricity networks are resilient, reliable and flexible”, Greg Callman, the global head of energy technology at Macquarie’s Green Investment Group, said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Engie shuttered Hazelwood with just five months’ notice in 2017 – a scenario that the Victorian government has avoided with Yallourn by arranging with its owner to close the plant, which delivers about 20% of Victoria’s electricity, in 2028, four years earlier than planned. Before Engie closed it, Hazelwood produced about 25% of Victoria’s electricity and was responsible for about 14% of the state’s emissions. The nearby open-cut mine from which it sourced brown coal also burned out of control for 45 weeks in 2014 after a bushfire spread into it. Engie’s chief executive for Australia and New Zealand, Augustin Honorat, said the company had a “long-term commitment” to Hazelwood and the Latrobe valley that included remediating the site and acting as “the builder and owner of a new energy asset that helps with the decarbonisation of the energy system”.",Energy; Australia news; Energy; Environment; Business; Coal; Victoria,Australia news
2021-11-04T14:15:36Z,Banks are still financing fossil fuels - while signing up to net zero pledges | Mariana Mazzucato,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/04/banks-are-still-financing-fossil-fuels-while-signing-up-to-net-zero-pledges,"Despite the stark warnings of climate breakdown from the IPCC and the UN, it’s business as usual for fossil fuel capitalism. An astonishing 56% of the G20 nations’ Covid-19 recovery funds for energy have gone to fossil fuel companies. In April, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) chaired by Mark Carney was launched to bring together leading financial corporations to redirect finance towards achieving net zero by 2050. Yet many of its signatories remain among the world’s top backers of fossil fuels. Some have even issued new financing to companies expanding fossil fuel infrastructure since signing up with the GFANZ. Oil extraction in the Amazon is being financed by GFANZ members HSBC and Citi, for instance, while Deutsche Bank, MUFG, and Credit Agricole are issuing bonds for a company that constructs pipelines in Indigenous territories. These are just some of the more prominent players in a financial system that remains too tightly entwined with fossil capitalism through unaccountable and complex global flows between fossil fuel corporations and private equity firms, asset managers, pension funds and other financial institutions. At Cop26, Rishi Sunak announced that the UK will become the world’s first “net zero-aligned finance centre” – seemingly a response to accusations that banks are not doing enough. His move was instantly criticised by climate campaigners as little more than a “marketing slogan”. If the Glasgow summit is to live up to its status as the “finance COP”, we need to radically transform the global financial system so that it serves public purpose over private profit. The GFANZ is a start, but it doesn’t go far enough. International agencies and national governments need to impose stringent conditions on how financial corporations operate, switching investments out of fossil fuels and into zero-carbon activities. Through carbon tariffs, renewable energy subsidies and state investments, fossil capitalism can – and should – be rendered unprofitable. A massive expansion of state-owned green investment banks will be critical for transforming finance. These provide patient loans and grants, used to fund research and development and startups in zero-carbon technologies. A promising example is the Scottish National Investment Bank, which invests millions across Scotland to deliver climate goals. Across the world, public banks are already the pioneers of green lending: they invest nearly as much as all private banks combined in the green economy, despite accounting for only 20% of total global banking assets. Importantly, public banks and public wealth funds retain a substantial stake in the capital created by the green transition – through, for instance, equity shares and revenue participation agreements. If we want to ensure a socially just – and thus effective – transition, green investment banks must be governed democratically, and their financial assets should be shared collectively among workers and citizens. This could take the form of a citizens’ dividend that would provide everyone with a guaranteed minimum income, for example. Such institutions can transform shareholder capitalism, which feeds profits back to company shareholders, into stakeholder capitalism, in which citizens and workers have a democratic ownership stake. “Business as usual” only leads us down the road of no return. We urgently need to change direction towards a radical industrial strategy that puts climate action at the forefront of financial investments. This will mean restructuring capitalism around a renewed sense of public purpose, channelled through ambitious missions to renew the capacities of the state and meet the challenges of the climate crisis. In practice, this means setting measurable goals such as creating good green jobs for unemployed coal workers, as exemplified by Spain’s national Just Transition Strategy, bringing stakeholders together to achieve them, and redirecting resources. New institutions will be needed to push forward this economic transformation. Europe already has its Organisation for Nuclear Research, known as Cern, which pools technology and resources for particle physics. We need an equivalent body for climate technology that would pool investments in climate action across countries and sectors (the G7 Panel on Economic Resilience, which I was part of, has already recommended precisely this). We also need a new social contract between the state, capital and labour. This will mean transforming the government’s reliance on parasitic public-private partnerships that socialise the risks and privatise the rewards of important public projects (such as the UK’s test-and-trace programme). To prevent this from hampering climate action, governments should enforce new conditions that ensure private contractors promote decarbonisation. They could follow Sweden’s example, which recently insisted that contractors only use green steel, made without coal. Governments could also take inspiration from Germany’s state-owned development bank, KfW, which offers loans to the steel industry that include conditions to reduce carbon and emissions. Or the French and Dutch Covid bailouts for national airline carriers Air France and KLM, which enforced conditions including cutting domestic flights that compete with rail travel and reducing absolute carbon emissions. Conditions like these need to be extended across the board to make it impossible for carbon-emitting companies to operate. At Cop26 it should be clear to delegates what lies at the root of climate catastrophe. The type of capitalism we have created is driving environmental breakdown and needs to be fundamentally redesigned. There is no time for tinkering; we need radical transformation now.

2022-03-05T08:00:19Z,Corporate tree-planting drive in Scotland ‘risks widening rural inequality’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/05/tree-planting-drive-scottish-highlands-risks-widening-inequality,"A drive by wealthy companies to plant forests in the Scottish Highlands to offset their carbon emissions risks creating even greater inequalities in rural areas, a major report has warned. The analysis says a surge of Highland estate sales to major corporations and cash-rich investors, such as Aviva, Standard Life and BrewDog, has driven up land prices sharply and increased the elitism and exclusivity of land ownership, while they aim to limit climate heating. John Hollingdale, a community ownership expert, argues that much stricter rules on land ownership, tax breaks and forestry subsidies are needed to ensure the rush to meet government forestry and net zero targets has the widest public benefit. The Scottish and UK governments have targets to plant 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of new woods and forests across Britain a year. Scottish Forestry, a government agency, is midway through a three-year programme worth £217m to plant 46,500 hectares (115,000 acres) of new woodland by April 2025, roughly equivalent to 93m trees. In a report for Community Land Scotland, a land reform body, Hollingdale said those investments were further subsidised by exemptions from inheritance tax, business property tax relief, and income and corporation tax on profits for commercial woodland, as well as non-domestic rates exemptions. Calum MacLeod, policy director for Community Land Scotland, said: “The paper’s detailed analysis and recommendations shows that green finance mechanisms need to be fit for purpose in terms of a just transition by making land use sustainable in ways that significantly benefit local communities.” Standard Life Investments, Aviva and BrewDog are the best-known examples of companies that have spent tens of millions of pounds in the last year buying land for forestry, peatland restoration and woodland creation to offset their carbon emissions or sell climate-focused investments to their clients. Known as natural capital or green finance investments, corporations have come under intense pressure to absorb or offset their carbon emissions to hit the Paris climate accord goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C by 2050. To the alarm of land reform campaigners and the National Farmers’ Union, that has led to land prices more than doubling in some areas of Scotland, as the competition for upland estates and farmland intensifies. Purchases by big companies such as the beer company BrewDog remain relatively rare but they reinforce another more subtle trend, Hollingdale argues. Increased funding for forestry and its tax advantages means existing owners can increase the value of their land and businesses by moving into woodland creation. While that has environmental benefits, it can make owners less likely to sell, pushing up land values by increasing scarcity. Hollingdale’s report warns this trend also prices out local communities hoping to buy their land to increase local employment, tourism, ecological management and micro-businesses. In 2020, the Scottish Land Fund, which funds community buyouts, stopped taking applications after five months because its £10m budget was oversubscribed. That has since been doubled to £20m, but surging land prices may soon swallow up that increased funding. Hollingdale recommends green financing projects are regulated to ensure they support genuine carbon offsetting; that ministers remove tax exemptions which distort land prices, and increase sales taxes on agricultural buildings; and that land owners are required to produce management plans and introduce public interest tests for large estates. Hamish Trench, the chief executive of the Scottish Land Commission, an official body focused on reforming highly concentrated patterns of land ownership, believes there is a “real risk” green finance investments will further concentrate the ownership of land and its benefits. In 2019, the commission said, just 87 owners – made up of private owners, charities and state-run bodies – controlled 1.7m hectares of rural Scotland. Trench said it was essential the financing was used in the public interest. “How do we harness this new finance coming in so it actively supports the mixed and community ownership model? We see an opportunity to do that,” he said. Sarah Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, which represents many large landowners, said this trend was still in its infancy but had tremendous economic potential. There were still numerous opportunities for community groups and social enterprises to buy land, often with public or private support. “Significant funds could flow into Scotland – benefiting nature, people and jobs,” she said. “Green investment has the potential to provide landowners of all types with revenue streams and community owners and farmers may well benefit from these emerging opportunities. However, these are very early days for all landowners.”",Scotland; Climate crisis; UK news; Environment; Communities; Society; Inequality; Trees and forests; Aviva; Standard Life; Business; BrewDog; Food & drink industry,UK news

An assessment by MEPs of the funding proposals from 23 member states so far submitted to the European Commission found a legion of examples of projects that it is claimed risk undermining the green credentials of the recovery and resilience facility (RRF). Under the RRF, the EU will provide grants worth a total of €312.5bn plus €360bn in loans to the 27 member states, which are currently submitting their national plans to the commission for approval. Among the cases picked out as being of concern is the potential for funding for a line of 34 electricity towers alongside the Riera de Santa Coloma, designated as a protected natural area under the EU’s Natura 2000 initiative, which is an important point for migrating birds in north-east Spain. The project is an overground offshoot of the construction of an ultra-high-voltage underground power line connecting France and Spain. “The Spanish plan includes as a part of the cross-border electrical connections between Spain and France the ‘Mediterranean interconnection’, which runs 200 metres next to a Natura 2000 area,” MEPs said in a letter to the commission. “The environmental impact assessment is insufficient and out of date. It does not present the basic information necessary in its substantial impact on endangered species.” The Italian government, meanwhile, has suggested in its national plan that a steel plant in Taranto, which was at the centre of an environmental scandal in 2012 that led to the imprisonment of its then owners, could receive financing. The plant is seeking to build less polluting furnaces but this would happen alongside maintenance of the two current coal blastfurnaces, local campaigners have been informed. “To date, the steel plant lacks an environmental impact assessment and a health impact assessment,” MEPs wrote. They said that under the objective of “innovation and modernisation” in the agricultural sector, the Italian government was offering incentives for replacement of older machinery which allows for the purchase of diesel tractors. The MEPs said this was in effect “incentivising the use of fossil fuels”. Concerns were raised that initiatives with little positive environmental impact were being misdescribed in some national plans in order to meet a target of 37% of spending being on green investment. One such proposal from the Czech Republic is support for entrepreneurship, 40% of the funding of which is said to be of benefit in tackling the climate emergency. The replacement of coal-based boilers by gas-based heating systems is also categorised as being a green investment by some member states. In a letter to the commission, the co-leaders of the Greens in the European parliament, Ska Keller and Philippe Lamberts, said the principle of “do no significant harm” and a requirement to correctly categorise environmentally friendly investments had been “circumvented, ignored or simply not addressed – leading to greenwashing and in some cases to a potential breach of the 37% spending requirement for green investment”. Lamberts said he was concerned that the recovery fund would become “just another greenwashing exercise”. A commission spokesman confirmed receipt of the MEPs’ letter. He said: “A plan that does not reach the target or which contains measures that that do significant harm to environmental objectives will not be accepted. “The regulation envisages two months for the assessment and for the translation of its contents into legally binding acts.”",European Commission; European Union; Europe; World news; Environment,World news
2022-01-16T18:29:01Z,Scottish auction for offshore windfarm permits expected to raise £860m,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/16/scottish-auction-for-offshore-windfarm-permits-expected-to-raise-860m,"Scotland’s largest-ever auction of permits to construct offshore windfarms is expected to raise up to £860m when the results are announced on Monday. Crown Estate Scotland, which is running the auction, hopes that windfarms with as much as 10 gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade, effectively doubling the amount of electricity generated in Scottish waters in a transition which has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs. The programme, known as ScotWind, has attracted frenzied interest from domestic and international bidders, and could set new records for values placed on the plots of seabed being leased for turbines. In the first ScotWind leasing round, 8,600 sq km of Scottish seabed is on offer across 15 areas, enough to develop windfarms which could power every Scottish household and save more than 6m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The windfarms could more than double the capacity built or planned in the seabed around Scotland over the coming decade. At the moment, offshore windfarms in Scotland generate about 1GW. Projects that have received consent and those being built amount to less than 10GW. The Moray East windfarm has become Scotland’s biggest source of renewable energy, generating up to 950 megawatts from 100 turbines. It will be overtaken by Seagreen next year with 1GW of capacity. Located around 27km off the Angus coast, the £3bn windfarm is a joint venture between Perth-based SSE Renewables (49%) and France’s TotalEnergies (51%). The winning bids – and the prices paid – are expected to be announced at 10am on Monday. Crown Estate said in July that 74 offers had been submitted for ScotWind. Many come from consortiums. Among them is Denmark’s largest energy company Ørsted, which pioneered the first ever offshore windfarm in 1991 and has teamed up with Italy’s Falck Renewables and the floating wind expert BlueFloat Energy. Other bidders include renewable energy investment funds such as Australia’s Macquarie Bank Green Investment Group, which has partnered with the Scottish offshore wind developer Renewable Infrastructure Development Group; big utility companies involved in existing projects, such as SSE and Scottish Power; and large oil companies, including Shell, France’s Total, Italy’s ENI and Norway’s Equinor. Crown Estate Scotland lifted the cap for the auction bids from £10,000 to £100,000 per sq km last year. If every bid is submitted up to that maximum cap, the sale could raise £860m. Melanie Grimmitt, global head of energy at the law firm Pinsent Masons, said this leasing round had shown that there was significant appetite for investment from within the UK and abroad, which bodes well for a second ScotWind seabed leasing round later this year. “This is crown state Scotland’s first seabed leasing round and marks an important chapter for Scotland’s offshore market, but with proposed windfarms from the leasing round expected to save in excess of 6m tonnes of carbon emissions, it is also an important milestone for the UK’s overall net zero commitments,” she said. “Developers will be keeping an eye out to see if and how the application process and criteria for the next round might differ from this one given how popular and competitive it has been.” Crown Estate Scotland is a separate organisation to the crown estate, which manages the Queen’s assets in England and Wales, and its profit is passed to the Scottish government. Some of the proceeds are expected to be ploughed into preparing the workforce for the switch from North Sea oil and gas to wind power. The transition to renewable energy means that as fossil fuel jobs disappear, thousands of workers will need retraining. • This article was amended on 18 January 2022.

2021-12-14T18:35:04Z,The Guardian view on levelling up: rhetoric belied by Covid reality | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/14/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-rhetoric-belied-by-covid-reality,"Two years ago, empowered by a new 80-seat majority in the House of Commons, Boris Johnson promised on the steps of Downing Street to “level up” the country. Since then, his government has laboured without success to offer definition and substance to a concept that, while giving off an egalitarian vibe, remains amorphous and elusive. The publication of the levelling-up white paper has been delayed until the new year, amid reported arguments over how much money the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is willing to make available for the prime minister’s flagship political project. While ministers prevaricate, the pandemic has ensured that pre-existing inequalities are deepening to an alarming degree. The latest confirmation of this came in an analysis published this week by the New Economics Foundation, which found that the poorer half of the population has seen its disposable income squeezed since the election of 2019, while the richest 5% are better off by £3,300 a year. The regional disparities which Mr Johnson has pledged to address have also worsened; the NEF found, predictably, that incomes in the south-east have risen far faster than those in the north. In general, white-collar workers easily able to work from home have saved and prospered, and seen the value of their property rise in the sustained house price boom. The continued growth in international stock markets has further benefited the asset-rich. At the other end of the spectrum, employees on fixed-term contracts and in precarious work have not been covered by furlough, while a miserably low level of basic social security support ensures that food bank usage remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Single parents, finds the NEF analysis, have been particularly hard hit. Inflation, rising bills, the cut to universal credit and next year’s scheduled increase in national insurance contributions risk tipping many more stretched household budgets over the edge. Unarguably, Covid has widened Britain’s wealth gap still further, accelerating a divergence already in train for decades. The fortunes of the asset-rich have waxed while those of the asset-poor have waned. Any meaningful consideration of how to level up Britain in the wake of the pandemic must surely take account of this egregious reality. In a report on UK household wealth published in the summer, the Resolution Foundation thinktank noted that successive governments have stubbornly ignored the trend of rising asset prices, allowing tax revenues to stay constant despite more than a doubling in levels of wealth. This, it judged, was “unsustainable”, given the pressures on public finance. Yet Mr Sunak, determined to bolster his low-tax credentials, has just shelved proposals to generate £14bn a year by raising capital gains tax. A national debate regarding fairer taxes on wealth is overdue. The rhetoric informing Mr Johnson’s levelling-up agenda has variously prioritised green investment in the north and the Midlands, the need to develop vocational skills and training, and the rejuvenation of public services. None of this can be done on the cheap. As the Omicron variant threatens the livelihoods and prospects of the economically precarious, it is time to link levelling up to a new fiscal settlement for post-pandemic times.",Coronavirus; Infectious diseases; Inequality; Boris Johnson; Conservatives; Politics,Opinion
2022-02-02T19:38:46Z,"Green opportunities missed in UK levelling up strategy, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/green-opportunities-missed-in-uk-levelling-up-strategy-say-experts,"The need to reach net zero carbon emissions, and the green jobs that could be created in doing so, received scant attention in the government’s levelling-up strategy, an omission slammed by green campaigners and businesses. The mention of “the green industrial revolution and transition to net zero” came second bottom of the list of 16 priorities in the levelling-up paper published on Wednesday, promising £26bn of capital investment, though green analysts said it was not clear if any of this was new money or how it would be spent. The strategy did not include any commitment to insulate the UK’s draughty homes, despite the current energy price crisis, or to shift the UK away from its expensive reliance on imported gas. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the climate crisis thinktank E3G, said: “As energy bills go through the roof due to the rocketing cost of gas, it is worth remembering that the most energy-leaking housing stock in western Europe is in the north of England. Fixing it would slash energy bills and emissions whilst boosting the economy of the north. Failing to put that at the heart of this levelling up strategy is a spectacular own goal.” Renewable energy should also have played a greater role, argued Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology. “[The paper] is a missed opportunity,” she said. Pointing to Humberside, where investment in offshore wind has driven a resurgence of manufacturing jobs, Skorupska said it could be “replicated on a much wider scale” if ministers took action. Cara Jenkinson, cities manager at the climate charity Ashden, said: “We are really surprised and disappointed to see the absence of green skills and commitments connected to net zero.” Economists have told the government since soon after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that a “green recovery” would create jobs, reduce long-term costs and put the UK on track to meet its carbon targets. They have urged for schemes such as home insulation; installing electric vehicle charging networks; constructing cycle lanes and pedestrian areas; planting trees; and building flood defences. These projects would reduce energy consumption, cut emissions, help guard against the worst impacts of the climate crisis, and have health and social benefits, such as less air pollution and more liveable cities. Ed Birkett, head of energy and environment at the thinktank Policy Exchange, said the paper dwelt on some of the risks to jobs from the shift away from high-carbon industries, but had much less to say about how to craft a green future. “It is surprising that the white paper makes very little mention of how the government will encourage green industries to locate in the UK, and specifically in the left-behind areas,” he said. There were a few examples of green investment: the £1bn automotive transformation fund, for electric vehicle manufacturing and battery gigafactories; £160m for ports, to encourage the manufacture of offshore wind turbines; and £1bn for carbon capture and storage. Some of the other funds could have a beneficial impact on the green recovery, such as £5bn for rural broadband, and transport funding amounting to £5.7bn in eight city regions – with £5bn for “buses and active travel” – and £96bn to be spent on the integrated rail plan. However, political opponents said the plans did not amount to a green recovery to level up the country and shift the UK to a low-carbon footing. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat climate and energy spokesperson, said: “The silence from ministers on net zero and green jobs in their levelling up plans is deafening. Delivering a fair and just transition to net zero should be at the heart of the government’s levelling up agenda. Yet today we heard nothing on how to ensure that more deprived regions and communities do not shoulder the biggest burden.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “A real plan to level up would be one that invested in the good green jobs of the future, with an ambitious Green New Deal to transform homes, buildings, local transport and energy supply, and a nature and net zero test for all infrastructure spending.”",Green economy; UK news; Politics; Climate crisis; Environment; Green jobs; Green politics,Environment
2020-05-22T06:00:17Z,We now have the proof: greening the economy doesn't come at the price of prosperity | Fiona Harvey,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/greening-economy-prosperity-financial-crisis-coronavirus,"Everest is once again visible from Kathmandu, after decades shrouded in pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions have fallen to levels last seen in 2006. Nature has returned to our streets with a quack and a flurry, and people are waking to birdsong in inner cities as the roar of traffic recedes. Clear skies bring little cheer at the food bank, however. Birdsong might lift the heart, but it won’t pay the rent. The environmental renaissance that has come with lockdown shows both the necessity of cleaning up our filthy air and atmosphere, and the dangers of associating economic ruin with environmental gain. Daily greenhouse gas emissions fell by a quarter in many countries when the lockdown bit hardest, according to the first comprehensive study this week, and by early April were 17% down on last year. At the same time, the global economy plunged 6% and half the global workforce now face the loss of their livelihoods, says the International Labour Organisation. Getting people back to work will mean rapidly rising carbon emissions, as it did after the financial crisis of 2008, unless strong action is taken by governments. Already, emissions are climbing: they will be only 4% down on the year if lockdowns are lifted next month. For environmentalists, it may seem tedious to have to explain yet again why it makes economic sense to save the planet – there wouldn’t be an economy without the environment, so if we trash it “growth” will cease to have much meaning. But we teeter on the threshold of what could be the greatest depression for centuries. People who are losing their jobs and homes, with only politicians’ promises to put in their bank account, have every right to ask whether now is the time to prioritise the climate – or couldn’t it wait a year or two while we sort out this catastrophe first? That question has a clear answer: a green recovery can produce higher returns on public spending and create more jobs in both the short term and the long term, compared to the alternative of pouring stimulus cash into the fossil fuel economy. Those findings come from a study of the potential for a green recovery, based on a survey of finance ministries and central bankers, and a comparison with the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, conducted by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, former World Bank chief economist Lord Stern, and leading economists from Oxford University. After the financial crisis in 2008, calls for a green recovery were partially successful. About 16% of the global stimulus spending was green, including subsidies for renewable energy, seed funding for research and development, and new technology such as electric vehicles. That proportion may seem small, and the effects of the rest of the spending – much of which went on carbon-intensive projects such as concrete construction and coal – were soon apparent: carbon emissions, which had fallen 1.4%, rebounded by a record amount of nearly 6% in 2010. Yet the green stimulus bore fruit. Renewable energy expanded, and the cost of wind and solar power fell far faster than predicted, to the point where both forms of power are now competitive with fossil fuel generation, without the need for subsidy. If that was possible from just 16% of stimulus spending, what could be done if the proportions were reversed? We are much better prepared to create green jobs now, according to the Oxford study. Shovel-ready projects, from insulating homes to widening cycle lanes, abound. Electric vehicle charging points are needed around the world, and the slack in public transport can be used to upgrade rail networks. Car companies, with government incentives, could hasten the move from petrol and diesel engines. The renewable energy industry has progressed in the last decade, making home solar installation cheap and offshore wind farms viable. All of these are labour intensive and would provide quick returns on taxpayer cash. There are fledgling industries that could soar with a government boost. Fatih Birol, the widely respected executive director of the International Energy Agency, points to hydrogen and batteries as two major areas “now ready for the big time”. Hydrogen, in the form of ammonia, will be key to decarbonising shipping, but take-up has been slow due to lack of investment. If governments get it right, the structural changes needed to bring emissions to net zero in the next 30 years will come with a gain in jobs and security. But more needs to be done to ensure that people see the positive, rather than associate falling emissions with falling prosperity. Much of the public discussion so far has focused on attaching “green strings” to bailouts for established industries such as airlines, fossil fuels and car manufacturing. Those are certainly needed – as the failure to attach conditions after the 2008 crisis clearly shows – but can seem like punishing industries already on their knees. Workers on airlines and in shale fields are workers too, with mortgages to pay and families to care for. Shrugging off the loss of their jobs as the casualties of a cleaner future is not good enough: there must be a clear path to high-quality alternatives. After the financial crisis, capital did not reel for long – the initiative was soon recaptured by austerity advocates and increasingly by populists who persuaded voters in many countries that the rollback of the state was the price of fiscal stability. The same forces are still in place: Donald Trump’s White House has already seized the excuse to repeal dozens of regulations on clean air and water, threatening to reverse environmental protections to a pre-Nixon state. If things are to be different this time, people need reassurance on jobs above all, and hymns to nature must be sung to the backing hum of industry.

2022-11-17T13:43:37Z,Will the autumn statement do enough to ease Britain’s crises? Our panel’s verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/17/will-the-autumn-statement-do-enough-to-ease-the-recession-our-panels-verdict,"Polly Toynbee: ‘These Tories forget nothing and learn nothing’ No contrition. Not for Liz Truss, not for their self-harming Brexit deal, nor for 12 years of going backwards. Recession, eight years of growth wiped out, rising unemployment, falling wages: all this is confirmed by the Office for Budget Responsibility today. But these Tory Bourbons forget nothing and learn nothing. There’s no remorse for George Osborne’s austerity that stripped the country bare and wiped 1% off GDP. Instead, here comes the austerity reprise, but far worse now that the Tories are cutting spending on skeleton services in a state of collapse. The usual flurry of spending announcements can’t blot out the warning of Rob Whiteman, the head of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. He says: “Public services are going to need increases of about 20% just to stand still, and we are not going to see anything like that.” More for the NHS and social care doesn’t begin to compensate for years of their worst funding ever. The NHS spends 20% less per person than 14 similar EU countries, the Health Foundation reveals today. There’s no chance of reducing the waiting lists, the National Audit Office warns. Even Tory home counties council leaders are finally breaking their silence to warn they will go bankrupt. “Eye-wateringly difficult,” said Jeremy Hunt, but whose eyes are watering most? “To be British is to be compassionate,” the chancellor claimed at his most unctuous. True, he hasn’t cut benefits yet again, but his government slashed them in seven of the last 10 years to the lowest among similar countries, as millions of children go hungry to school. Look where Tory “choices” have left us, with the worst wage growth in 200 years and one in five key workers earning so little they bring up their children in poverty. Meanwhile shareholders had a bonanza and bankers’ bonuses doubled. Covid and the war in Ukraine don’t explain why Britain faces the lowest growth in the G20 – bar Russia. An extraordinary poll today suggests the public will neither forgive nor forget. With things so hard for so many, Ipsos found a third of those interviewed expected the autumn statement to make things worse, a third expected they would be no better, and only 22% expected improvement. The sheer effrontery of Hunt’s claim that “Conservatives do not leave our debts to the next generation” is breathtaking. No, he leaves it to Labour after the next election, a callow political trick. We wait for Labour’s policy responses: tax rises in this under-taxed country can only help Labour’s future, while spending cuts are unthinkable. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: ‘Copying Blairism will only aggravate MPs on the right’ When Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled his not-so-mini-budget, Tory MPs quickly saw red over his and Liz Truss’s headline move: to cut the top rate of tax. As Michael Gove put it in an interview in the weeks afterwards: “That is a display of the wrong values.” This autumn statement is intended to say the opposite. The Truss era of “libertarian jihadists” – as one Tory MP, now a minister, labelled them – is over and, under Rishi Sunak, the party is trying to move to the centre ground. Not only has tax been raised for high earners, with people to start paying the 45p rate at £125,000 rather than £150,000, Hunt was quick to emphasise spending increases for the NHS and schools as well as a rise in the “national living wage” and benefits going up in line with inflation. The attempt by the Tories to park their tanks on Labour lawns isn’t exactly subtle – with announcements that the former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt will advise on integrating health and social care and Tony Blair’s delivery chief Michael Barber will help with the skills agenda. However, no Labour hires can dress up the dismal economic outlook. For all the talk of helping the most vulnerable, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that living standards will fall 7% over the next two years – wiping out all growth from the previous eight years. Already the Liberal Democrats are preparing to go on the attack over the squeezed middle. Even if Sunak can convince the public that these are the best steps given the circumstances, the harder audience could be the one right in front of him: Tory MPs. The tax rises and enhanced windfall tax go against the instincts of many. The idea of copying a form of Blairism, too, will only aggravate MPs on the right of the party further. When Sunak became prime minister, the party made an uneasy truce to rally behind him in a bid to end the psychodrama of the past few months. As he put it to MPs in his first private address to them: unite or die. We’re about to find out which option the Tory parliamentary party is going to choose. Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor Miatta Fahnbulleh: ‘The chancellor prioritised fixing a fiscal crisis that does not exist’ We are facing one of the deepest and longest recessions in 100 years at the same time as millions are being squeezed by soaring prices. Real household incomes are set to fall by 7% over the next two years, the biggest fall on record. Cushioning people from this double hammer blow should have been the chancellor’s No 1 priority. Instead, he prioritised fixing a fiscal crisis that does not exist. The extension of the energy price guarantee, increase in the living wage and uprating of benefits and pensions in line with inflation are welcome. They will take the sting away, but won’t be enough to insulate millions who are already struggling to afford everyday essentials. And for public services facing £43bn of cuts a year due to inflation, the failure to plug this gap will push our schools, hospitals and local services further into crisis. He could have reversed the outstanding tax cuts in the mini-budget, closed the non-dom tax loophole, and equalised wealth taxes with income taxes to do this, but he chose not to. The wrong political choice. With a painful recession looming, Hunt missed the opportunity to give the economy a £30bn-a-year green investment boost that would have allowed us to retrofit millions of homes, deliver a clean energy system that we own, upgrade public transport and build the infrastructure we need for the future. Reviving our economy in the short term and building our resilience for the long term. We have had 12 years of Conservative party making the wrong choices for the economy. We are weaker and poorer as a result. It seems the chancellor has learned nothing from this – and we will all pay the price. Miatta Fahnbulleh is an economist. She is standing to be Labour’s parliamentary candidate in Camberwell &amp; Peckham Rachel Clarke: ‘This doesn’t even cover half the NHS budget shortfall’ It’s the weasel words that are hardest to swallow: Hunt’s pretence that failing to address the NHS’s real-terms, multibillion-pound funding cuts is in any way compatible with slowing the collapse of the NHS, let alone reversing it. Thanks to inflation, the NHS is already facing a £7bn shortfall in its budget this year. Today’s announcement of an extra £3.3bn of NHS funding doesn’t even cover half of that. We are, in other words, still facing de facto budget cuts – at a time when the scale of avoidable deaths and patient suffering has never been more indefensible. Worse was that the chancellor couldn’t resist in indulging in some not-so-subtle NHS bashing, presumably as a sop to his party’s libertarian wing. “I’m asking the NHS to join all public services to tackle waste and inefficiency. We want Scandinavian quality alongside Singaporean efficiency,” he said, suggesting the NHS is somehow uniquely at fault. Yet as the country’s longest-serving former health secretary, he knows full well how brutally the NHS has been pared to the bone – and how forcing us to run on empty makes it only harder to streamline services. Let’s be blunt. If the government was truly committed to “putting the NHS first”, as Hunt has claimed today, it would provide the financial support necessary to genuinely drive down waiting lists and stop patients dying in corridors, in stranded ambulances and in abject misery, over and over again. Hunt likes to insist he is a patient safety champion, but this budget is an exercise in managing optics, not reality. Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Tessa Khan: ‘The chancellor has sided with the oil and gas industry’ The chancellor rightly diagnosed climate breakdown and energy affordability as two of the biggest challenges we face, but has sided today with the industry driving both: oil and gas. Until this year, the UK offered among the most lucrative tax conditions for oil and gas producers in the world. The rise in the rate of the windfall tax to 35% is therefore welcome, but it is a temporary fix when what is needed is permanent reform. More alarmingly, Hunt has failed to close the gaping tax loophole that allows companies such as Shell to avoid tax if they invest in new oil and gas fields. It also gives them an even bigger handout if they choose to power their oil and gas rigs using wind – despite the fact that the vast majority of emissions come from burning, not extracting, oil. Not only will this see billions in lost tax, it sends us in precisely the opposite direction to the one that will get us out of this hole for good. This is the “highway to climate hell”, that the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned world leaders about at Cop27. It is also the route to permanently high energy bills. Electricity generators have also been hit with a 45% windfall tax but without the generous allowance for new investment that oil and gas companies benefit from. This is an absurd outcome given the dual crises we face of climate breakdown and energy affordability. Tessa Khan is executive director of climate action organisation Uplift Frances Ryan: ‘The public will pay for the Tories’ failures’ Hunt pulled out some rabbits – extra social care, schools and NHS funding, and capping social rent rises – but it couldn’t distract from the grim news: public spending on already crumbling services will be gutted in the long term. This statement was a lesson in kicking the can down the road. Delaying the social care cap. Delaying major cuts until after the next election. Those who rely on the state pension or benefits must get through a cold winter before the 10% rise in payments arrives next year. It was all everyone else’s fault, though. Euphemisms of “efficiencies” and “difficult decisions” suggest such public funding cuts are reasonable and necessary, even noble. “Global forces” give the impression every major economy is in this position. But it cannot be forgotten: we are largely in this position because of the fallout of Truss’s calamitous mini-budget. The Resolution Foundation calculates that the Truss government cost the country £30bn – doubling the sum that the Treasury has had to raise. Not to mention the impact of Brexit. The public is still reeling from the last decade of cuts: struggling to get a GP appointment, languishing on social care waiting lists or taking children to a rundown local park. Twelve years of Tory failure have ratcheted up a staggering bill. But it is the British public who will pay – in more ways than one.

2021-12-21T17:42:20Z,EU in row over inclusion of gas and nuclear in sustainability guidance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/eu-in-row-over-inclusion-of-gas-and-nuclear-in-sustainability-guidance,"The European Commission is facing a backlash from Greta Thunberg and fellow climate activists over plans to include gas and nuclear energy in a “green” investment guidebook. Both energy sources are expected to feature in the next part of the EU’s “taxonomy for sustainable activities”, which is expected at the end of the year, following a period of intense political bargaining between the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; and Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz. The EU taxonomy is a green classification system that is intended to guide investors to projects that are in line with Europe’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 and better protection of nature. An EU official said gas and nuclear were likely to have “amber” status, meaning they would not be in the “green” category with wind and solar power, but would feature in the taxonomy. A senior EU diplomat said they expected to see nuclear in the text because “Von der Leyen seems to have promised it to Macron and the other nuclear states”. EU efforts will be closely watched by the UK, which is developing its own green taxonomy that the government says will “help clamp down on greenwashing – unsubstantiated or exaggerated claims that an investment is environmentally friendly”. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Since then, the project has been overshadowed by a fierce political row that culminated when EU leaders meeting in Brussels last week were forced to abandon plans for a joint statement on energy policy. France wants a stamp of approval for nuclear, while Poland and eastern European states insist gas is labelled a “sustainable” investment. Germany’s new Social Democrat chancellor is under pressure from his Green coalition partners not to give in to pressure to include nuclear or gas in the system. Scholz downplayed the taxonomy last week as “a tiny issue on a much broader topic”. However, the growing expectation of a Franco-German bargain that brings gas and nuclear into the taxonomy has triggered an excoriating response from Thunberg and nine fellow climate activists. In an article on the Euractiv website, the young activists accused EU leaders of making empty promises at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, which ended with a fragile hope of keeping alive a target to limit global heating to no more than 1.5C. “There is no space for cowardly decisions, like allowing for this fake climate action,” they wrote, citing the taxonomy. Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said there was no need for Von der Leyen to include gas and nuclear in the taxonomy. “We have a taxonomy that is now working, and green labels for green activities have been agreed,” he said, referring to the first taxonomy list covering renewables and other green investments signed off earlier this month. “We don’t need green labels for gas and nuclear.” Including gas in the taxonomy would be inconsistent with promises at Cop26 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, Eickhout said. “If Europe now starts calling [gas] green then you can forget about the 1.5 degrees.” The European Commission is expected to publish the draft taxonomy on 31 December, allowing a few weeks of consultation with experts and governments. The final proposals may be published on 12 January and could only be blocked by a super-majority of EU member states – an outcome no one expects.",Energy industry; European Commission; European Union; Europe; Business; Greta Thunberg; Environment; Green economy; Nuclear power; Gas; Environmental activism; World news; UK news; Fossil fuels; Energy,Business
2022-10-25T09:00:03Z,‘You have to be thick-skinned’: what is it like to lose the status of a top job?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/25/lose-status-top-job-liz-truss-advice,"On the evening of 7 May 2015, Vince Cable watched coverage of the general election at home. For more than two decades, he had been a Liberal Democrat MP for Twickenham; since 2010, a member of the cabinet, too. In the coalition government he was a long-serving business secretary, president of the board of trade and a privy councillor. Cable ran a constituency office, one in parliament and a major Whitehall department. He was responsible for thousands of staffers, plus a whole host of junior ministers. Then, quite suddenly, he was not. By the early hours of 8 May each of these roles and responsibilities had been swiftly removed from the former right honourable member. The general election results deftly demolished the coalition, leaving sweeping losses for the Liberal Democrats in their wake. Cable’s 12,000-majority seat was won by a Conservative party challenger. The cut and thrust of the democratic process does little to ease this experience for those who hold top-tier public office. In a matter of moments, one can go from wielding the highest levels of political power and influence to almost none. Just a few fateful weeks ago, Liz Truss’s decade-long rise through ministerial ranks culminated in her becoming prime minister. Now, after 45 days, it’s all over. Cable may well know how she feels. His long career also came to an abrupt and unwelcome end. “That night was incredibly difficult on a personal and political level,” Cable says now, firmly retired from frontline politics. “We’d assumed the Lib Dems would do badly, but Twickenham was thought to be one of those that we would hold on to.” Anyone who leaves a job – whether on their own terms or otherwise – may find themselves in a similar situation. For many, work doesn’t just dictate how we spend our time, it’s a defining feature of our personalities; a core facet of our identity. This is certainly true for those at the top of institutions or organisations where their names are so closely connected with their place of work. So, when titles we have held are suddenly stripped away and consigned to the past, it can feel a little disorienting; exposing, even. How do we begin to navigate that? According to the psychologist Linda Papadopoulos, whether grappling with retirement, redundancy or resignation, it can be a struggle to adapt. “These changes are tough for humans,” Papadopoulos says, “especially when we’re in jobs where it’s bound up with our identity, and those on a treadmill of positions of power. There’s a shift in how we see ourselves, but how others see us as well.” Moving on from such a public defeat, Cable adds, wasn’t easy: “It was tough walking through Twickenham to have people commiserate you. It was a constant reminder of my loss.” Seeing so many of his fellow Liberal Democrat peers find similar fates was reassuring, though. “What made things easier is we all went down with the ship,” he says. “Had we been 56 Lib Dem MPs and only three had lost? I’d have felt it personally. But we were nearly all defeated – those few who survived were in fairly unique situations.” Finding comfort in these comparisons, Papadopoulos suggests, is human nature. “Basic evolutionary psychology tells us we are status-driven creatures,” she says, “programmed to check out how happy we are in relation to others. It’s why it’s so difficult sometimes to feel good about yourself without looking to see if we’re running faster or jumping higher than someone else.” For Jennie Formby, Labour’s general secretary for two years under Jeremy Corbyn, focusing on the challenges of the job after her departure was vital. In April 2020, when Keir Starmer won the Labour leadership election, Formby found herself on a call with the new leader of the opposition. “I congratulated him on his mandate, and explained we’d been preparing for the handover,” she recalls. “Immediately, he told me he wanted me to announce I was stepping down.” “Of course it was a privilege,” she says, “but it’s not a great job. It’s tough. There are so many elements, competing interests and responsibilities. I’d been working every evening. Every weekend. Every holiday. Something was always happening. In 2018, I was on holiday in Turkey, and there was only one place in the villa that got a phone signal. I spent hours standing in that spot. I was ready to move on.” For those more attached to their positions, however, this approach might offer little consolation. While Lord John Browne’s resignation as chief executive of BP in 2007 – after 12 years in the job and more than four decades with the company – was voluntary, it came after a messy legal battle that saw him ultimately outed in a kiss’n’tell story running in a Sunday tabloid. In the aftermath, he attempted to detach himself from his previous professional life entirely. “I suddenly had a clean sheet of paper,” Browne says. “I thought to myself: you have to look forward not backwards, as my late mother – a survivor of Auschwitz – always told me. So I did. I built a new career and a completely new life, nothing in common with that which came before. That certainly helped.” Of course, the media continued to report on his case. “I was strongly advised by a journalist friend of mine not to read a single article in the papers about BP or myself for an entire year,” Browne recalls. “This friend kept them all for me, and said if I was still interested a year later I could have them. That was great advice. I quite literally started again, which was refreshing.” Adjusting to a life without the trappings of the top job, Browne says, was trickier. “When you’re CEO of a big company there are all sorts of people looking after you and doing things for you,” he says. From reservations to research, every need catered for. “Then you’re all alone. I had no secretary, no staff, no support. I had to build that all up for myself.” Emma Reed Turrell is a psychotherapist, author and podcaster. How we respond to these endings, she suggests, often depends on how prepared we are for that event coming round. “Humans aren’t good with things we didn’t see coming. If we expect something to end,” she says, “our nervous system can prepare for it in advance. Either way, we have a set of reactions and we’ll grieve: there’s still a transition cycle of shock, resistance, sadness then finding new meaning. But being ready for such a change means we likely won’t face the trauma of an unexpected loss.” This is precisely how Alexandra Shulman explains her departure from British Vogue, where until 2017 she had been editor-in-chief for 25 years. “I decided to leave Vogue of my own volition,” Shulman says, “which meant the process wasn’t painful but exciting. And I didn’t leave feeling I had unfinished business, having been there for such a long time.” Still, that’s not to say leaving such a career-defining, high-profile gig was straightforward. For decades, Shulman had been synonymous with the magazine she edited. “When you leave a job that’s more than a job but a role,” she says, “you have to be sure it’s the right decision.” As soon as you leave, Shulman says, all that comes with it disappears. “Anyone who thinks it’ll stick to you is wrong,” she says. You realise the invitations, access and status don’t come with you. “It really is: ‘The king is dead, long live the king.’ People are often shocked by the suddenness with which that happens.” “It’s odd for your caption to always be ‘former’ something,” Shulman adds, “rather than a present or actual something. It amuses me, but one could find it annoying. I’ve accepted that’s what people will think of me as.” And then comes the challenge of your replacement defining their new leadership, which often means contrasting it in opposition to what came before. “You don’t realise how quickly people are going to want to reposition what they’re doing as the important thing, rather than what you did,” Shulman suggests. There were reports of a rift between Shulman and her successor, Edward Enninful; in a 2020 interview, Shulman said she was made ‘persona non grata’… “And that’s tough,” Shulman says. “Obviously, you think you’ve done a good job. You have to be prepared to be thick-skinned.” Formby describes a deep sense of frustration with the Labour party’s new leadership (“there’s a lack of honesty now at the top of the party, a selling out”); Cable laments the dismantling of his legacy – the sale of the Green Investment Bank; the scrapping of his industrial strategy – with similar anguish. “After the defeat I had coffee with Sajid Javid who was at the time, briefly, business secretary,” says Cable. “Javid told me that [the industrial strategy] had my name and my party’s name all over it, so the Tories wanted to bury it. Cynical, yes, but that’s how they were. It was difficult to see legacy issues being trashed.” Ultimately, it’s pragmatism that prevails for most; accepting that change is inevitable. “Humans come unstuck when we don’t change,” says Reed Turrell. “We are meant to move and evolve. Society has created a negative connotation that something ending is a loss and a bad thing, but there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be the beginning of a new chapter instead.” Sometimes, that’s not limited to the person stepping down. After 14 years at the helm of Greenpeace UK as executive director, John Sauven saw his resignation as a positive step forward and a necessity – for his future and that of Greenpeace. “It’s a privilege to run an organisation like Greenpeace,” he says, “with access to those people and resources. When you step aside you lose that ability for impact. But there are also a new range of experiences open to you, whether advising your successors or starting things afresh.” When weighing up his future, this lifelong Arsenal fan looked to Arsène Wenger for guidance. “He did a great job, of course, as manager,” Sauven says, “but really I think a lot about how he should have left a few years earlier on a high, rather than being forced out, and having fans chanting in the stands for him to leave. It’s all about timing. Staying around until you’re pushed out, or the organisation goes into decline, is never a good idea.” At his leaving party, Sauven reflected on his years in the NGO top job. “I gave a speech at the end,” says Sauven. “I said I was leaving Greenpeace and my wife was, too. It was tongue in cheek, but you’re married to the job. There were three of us, really in our marriage. When you run any sort of organisation, it can become all-consuming. Going from full throttle on the accelerator to being still – as you do the day you leave – was a major change. You take a breath, and step back to look around in a way you don’t otherwise have the time to.” In 2017, Cable returned to Westminster as Twickenham’s MP – and soon became his party’s leader. In 2019, he stood down from both positions of his own accord. Perhaps Boris Johnson had this in mind when he considered a rapid return to Downing Street last weekend. “Retirement can be a deadening experience,” Cable says. Trying to have a positive mindset from the outset at the end of his career was essential in offering him direction and solace in the days after that transformative defeat, Cable says. “We went off to my wife’s farm in the New Forest, and plotted a nice holiday in Corsica, and the things we’d do next. You can’t just sit around and be an old man waiting to pass on into the next world.” Years on – and a world away – from that night in May 2015, he’s sure that “having a forward project” kept him going. What did that look like for Cable? He got to work writing a political thriller and “started dancing lessons”. We’ve all got to start again somewhere.",Work & careers; Liz Truss; Politics; Health & wellbeing; Alexandra Shulman; Vince Cable; John Browne,Money
2022-01-03T12:18:54Z,Fury as EU moves ahead with plans to label gas and nuclear as ‘green’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/fury-eu-moves-ahead-plans-label-gas-nuclear-green,"The European Commission is facing a furious backlash over plans to allow gas and nuclear to be labelled as “green” investments, as Germany’s economy minister led the charge against “greenwashing”. The EU executive was accused of trying to bury the proposals by releasing long-delayed technical rules on its green investment guidebook to diplomats on New Year’s Eve, hours before a deadline expired. The draft proposals seen by the Guardian would allow gas and nuclear to be included in the EU “taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities”, subject to certain conditions. The taxonomy is a classification system intended to direct billions to clean-energy projects to meet the EU goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Habeck, who became the economy and climate action minister last month as part of a traffic-light coalition of Social Democrats, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, said the plans “water down the good label for sustainability”. Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”. Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”. She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.” She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation. However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans. France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said. He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power. Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date. Nuclear power could only be included if a project demonstrated it had a plan to deal with radioactive waste. NGOs accused the commission of seeking to evade scrutiny. WWF, a member of an official expert group on the taxonomy, said the commission had allowed just eight working days – until 12 January – to provide a formal response “to this highly complex and controversial file”, whereas most Brussels consultations last four weeks. “The European Commission couldn’t have tried harder to bury this proposal,” said the WWF spokesperson on sustainable finance, Henry Eviston. “For fossil gas and nuclear, we get a document written behind closed doors and published on New Year’s Eve. If the EU is confident in this proposal, it must hold a public consultation.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through “delegated acts” – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The plans have already attracted the ire of Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, who say this “fake climate action” contradicts the EU’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

2021-11-18T15:24:50Z,National Grid profits surge on back of European energy crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/18/national-grid-profits-surge-on-back-of-european-energy-crisis,"Europe’s energy crisis has sparked a profit surge for National Grid after its subsea power cables connecting the UK to the continent generated greater revenues on the back of record highs in the electricity market. National Grid secured higher prices to transmit electricity through its cables running from the UK to Belgium and France, and also benefited from the early startup of the North Sea Link, the world’s longest subsea power cable, which links the UK to Norway’s hydropower. The FTSE 100 energy company reported first-half profits had increased by 86% to £1.1bn on the same period a year earlier, when Covid-19 lockdowns led to a slowdown in energy markets. The increase was in part helped by record-high electricity prices in the UK in recent months. The half-year results were also buoyed up by National Grid’s acquisition of Western Power Distribution (WPD), the local power grid company running grids for the Midlands, south Wales and south-west England, for £14.2bn in March. The group added that earnings a share for the full year would be “significantly above the top end” of its 5%-7% guidance at the beginning of the year. John Pettigrew, the company’s chief executive, said National Grid’s focus would be on “delivering critical and green investment to enable the decarbonisation of power, transport and heat” to help create a “clean, fair and affordable energy transition” in the UK and US markets. Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the WPD acquisition had “juiced overall returns” for National Grid, while the early completion of the UK-France network was “the cherry on top”. “National Grid’s planted itself firmly at the centre of the electric revolution,” Hoy said. “It’s not often that a utility offers that kind of growth opportunity, so NG could turn out to be somewhat of a gem within the sector.” National Grid runs the subsea cables and the high voltage transmission networks in England and Wales, as well as the regional WPD electricity network, and plans to sell a majority stake in its gas transmission grid, which covers Great Britain, to help pay for the acquisition. Pettigrew said the sales talks were on track because there was a recognition among potential buyers that “gas will have a role to play” for many years ahead, and the opportunity to invest in solutions to decarbonising the UK’s gas system, for example by blending gas with hydrogen. National Grid also plans to sell the Rhode Island network from its American business, which runs gas and electricity networks in the north-eastern US, by March 2022. Hoy warned that without the proceeds from these sales National Grid’s debt from “could become a crippling burden”, and added that “a lot can go wrong in six months”. The earnings surge from National Grid’s cables running to Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Norway more than offset the shutdown of one of the UK’s most important power cables running from England to France after a fire in September. The blaze at the Sellindge converter station in Kent forced the shutdown as energy markets rocketed to all-time highs amid global energy supply difficulties. National Grid said “extensive work” would be needed to bring the 2,000 megawatt (MW) power link back to full service. Around half the cable’s capacity remains shut, of which 500MW will return from October 2022 and the final 500MW in December 2022.",National Grid; Energy industry; Utilities; Business; UK news,Business
2022-03-21T22:00:36Z,Energy transition will test Queensland’s resilience like never before – we need to act now | Anne Tiernan and James Boyle,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/energy-transition-will-test-queenslands-resilience-like-never-before-we-need-to-act-now,"A decade on from Queensland’s “summer of disasters”, the state’s south-east faces another mammoth clean-up and recovery effort. According to the deputy premier, Steven Miles, the recent floods are the 90th natural disaster event to impact Queensland since 2011. Recovery will take time, requiring resilience, discipline and focus from leaders and communities who were tired and depleted from a pandemic even before the rivers and creeks started rising. But a bigger test of Queensland’s resilience is looming. Geopolitical tensions may be driving demand for (and royalties from) exports like coal and liquid natural gas, but globally the energy transition is accelerating. Recent research from the Centre for Policy Development reveals the Australian impacts will be concentrated in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. CPD’s analysis estimates more than 10% of jobs are exposed in seven Queensland local government areas, with more than half of all jobs at risk of disappearing in the Isaac and Central Highlands LGAs. Unlike disaster management, which is informed by the widely accepted prevent, prepare, respond and recover (PPRR) framework, there is no playbook for the energy transition. It is being improvised in response to a complex, emergent global challenge being confronted by all sectors in all countries, simultaneously. As recent closure announcements in NSW highlight, the window to act is shrinking fast. Queensland’s response to the twin challenges of economic recovery and the energy transition presents opportunities to embed lessons from the state’s successful management of Covid-19 and acknowledged strengths in disaster management. These put people at their centre and recognise the importance of ensuring that individuals across the state are secure, that risks and hazards are identified and prepared for, and that responsibilities and opportunities are fairly distributed and shared. How might this be achieved? Queensland’s success will hinge on how it handles the two dilemmas at the heart of the transition: which groups receive support, and who benefits from a green jobs boom – if policy settings enable it to eventuate. The support dilemma is starting to emerge in the Hunter Valley with the early closure announcement of Eraring power station. Understandably, the immediate focus is on workers and their livelihoods – the NSW government set aside $550m to support a green “manufacturing renaissance” in the Hunter, and transition planning negotiations have opened between Origin Energy, workers, unions and the government. Yet past experience suggests the negative impacts of the closure won’t end with directly affected workers. Wider job losses are expected among essential and service workers – cohorts that tend to comprise more women and minorities. Historically, these “invisible communities” have been excluded from transition planning, leaving them without assistance and precarious. Our research suggests the lesson for Queensland is clear. It must develop the new energy workforce - while also providing adjustment packages, retraining and support for workers and their families impacted by coal-related closures. However, to ensure communities remain viable and livable, attention must also be given to supporting non-energy workers and identifying at-risk cohorts in real time as local challenges emerge. The benefits dilemma is less intuitive. Green jobs have been promised, but the majority are temporary, confined to the construction phase. The number of continuing, operational jobs will be much smaller. Meanwhile, corporate green investment plans all focus on the same places at the same times. A boom cycle is surely inevitable, and not all growth is unambiguously good. Gladstone’s experience during the LNG construction boom highlights the dangers for local communities, particularly the most vulnerable. In just a few short years, Gladstone locals experienced a dramatic deterioration of housing affordability and amenity, labour market distortions which drained essential workers, and unsustainable demands on public services and social infrastructure. Again, the lesson is clear: careful coordination, sequencing and local governance that integrates economic and social imperatives are critical. This will help to ensure that growth is sustainable and that its benefits are shared, including and especially by local people and businesses. Success will turn on public-private collaboration Unlike Queensland’s disaster response, which has evolved and improved through practice, there is only one chance to get the energy transition right. Because the stakes are higher, it’s crucial that policies reflect lessons learned from previous industrial transitions. Four lessons stand out: impacts on population cohorts vary; regional exposure is asymmetric and unevenly distributed; impacts occur in different places at different times; and long-term outcomes depend on economic renewal strategies that are nuanced to local strengths. There are reasons for optimism. Queensland is unique in owning its energy infrastructure, from generation to transmission and distribution. The state has an unusually large public sector footprint – health and social assistance are the fastest-growing employment sectors and also key to economic diversification. These instruments offer creative potential for policymakers to smooth the transition, but there are limits to what the government alone can achieve. Navigating the energy transition will require mission-oriented collaboration. Pandemic and disaster recovery are straining government bandwidth. The innovation needed to drive change will need to come from the outside in, requiring business, the not-for-profit sector, universities and others to shift from seeking individual opportunity to mobilising strategic partnerships. This behaviour shift is not new – cross-sectoral collaboration that leverages local capability and connects it to a statewide network is a feature of Queensland’s disaster management framework. All Queenslanders impacted by natural disasters will recognise that preparation and adaptation are far preferable to predictable crises. Long-term recovery and reinvigorating local communities is the material challenge. The same will be true of the energy transition. There is no excuse to ignore lessons of the past. Our political, business and community leaders must take this opportunity to lay the foundations for inclusive, sustainable prosperity, now and into the future. We all have a responsibility to ensure that no Queenslander is left behind. Dr Anne Tiernan is a policy research consultant with interests in inclusive growth.

2022-01-11T18:08:04Z,"Johnson’s political weakness leaves climate agenda at risk, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/boris-johnson-climate-action-net-zero-conservative-party,"The government’s climate agenda is under threat as Boris Johnson’s popularity slumps, according to green campaigners who work closely with the Conservative party. As the prime minister faces further lockdown party allegations, and angry Conservative MPs seek answers over energy price rises and the cost of living crisis, analysts fear the government’s commitment to net zero is facing its most severe test yet. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the E3G green thinktank and a veteran government adviser, said: “Johnson has been the standard bearer for net zero, and lots of people were happy about that. There is now a sustained assault from the right on net zero. They see the prime minister’s political weakness, and they see net zero as a flank on which to attack him.” Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is meeting backbench Tory MPs this week to calm fears that the squeeze on incomes caused by rising inflation and soaring gas prices will turn away voters, particularly in “red wall” seats in the north of England. He is under pressure from vocal quarters to abandon green measures such as carbon levies, which play a small role in energy bills. Although experts have criticised the government’s net zero plans as falling woefully short on ambition and funding, Johnson is still seen as more engaged with the climate crisis than any of his Tory rivals and has made net zero a personal crusade, with a 10-point plan to “build back greener”, published after the first Covid lockdown. He is influenced by close advisers and allies including his wife, Carrie Johnson, who works for a conservation charity, and his father, Stanley, a prominent “green Tory”, as well as friends such as Zac Goldsmith, the former owner of the Ecologist magazine, whom Johnson appointed as a minister in the Lords. Chris Venables, the head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “There is definite jeopardy in Boris Johnson’s weakness, as he has been the champion. But the forces of good are now rallying behind the green agenda. It does help that the facts are on our side.” Johnson’s main rivals in the cabinet – Sunak and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who are both seen as leadership contenders – have been particularly notable in distancing themselves from net zero efforts. Megan Randles, a political campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “This year there have been more missed opportunities than bold measures by Sunak and Truss. Sunak didn’t mention the climate once in his party conference speech; his spending review failed to kickstart a green recovery, and he is reported to have curbed Johnson’s climate ambitions and hindered Cop26. Truss actively undermined climate action in the Australia trade deal.” On the Tory backbenches, a small but vocal group – the “net zero scrutiny group” – of about 20 MPs has been courting media attention by blaming gas prices on green measures that they say should be scrapped. Analysts and experts have pointed out that the UK’s overreliance on fossil fuels carries most of the blame, and that insulating homes and investing in green energy at home would alleviate the problem. Bob Ward, the policy director at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at the London School of Economics, warned of attempts to undermine public support for climate action. “The growing crisis around energy prices threatens to delay implementation of the policies necessary to make the net zero target credible,” he said. “There is a small but noisy group of Conservative MPs, whose voices are being amplified by the usual suspects in parts of the media, who are attempting to mislead the public about the roots of the current crisis, blaming green energy policies rather than the true cause: wholesale prices of natural gas.” Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who oversaw Cop26, also aimed a coded warning at his party in an interview with the Guardian late last year. He said delivering on the UK’s net zero target must be a “focus across the whole of the UK government” or the achievements of the Cop26 climate summit would be “just a bunch of meaningless promises”. Chris Skidmore, a former energy minister, is also rallying Tory backbenchers to support net zero under the banner of the “net zero support group”. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance, noted: “Fortunately, a few eccentrics aside, the Conservative party is committed to climate action. Business-friendly Tories are pushing for more ambition, while MPs across the country are demanding and celebrating green investment in their constituencies. Net zero and nature are increasingly at the heart of the party, and Boris Johnson can take some credit for that.” Any change of direction to reduce emphasis on tackling the climate crisis could also play badly with voters, who back climate action, argue campaigners. Dave Timms, the head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: “Deep concern about the climate crisis now reaches every part of British society, so the public mandate for the radical action to slash UK emissions is there. The words on every minister’s lips should be delivery, delivery, delivery.”",Green politics; Boris Johnson; Conservatives; Politics; Greenhouse gas emissions; UK news; Environment; Climate crisis,Environment
2021-10-11T18:04:30Z,The Guardian view on cabinet splits: a fight for a party’s heart and soul | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/11/the-guardian-view-on-cabinet-splits-a-fight-for-a-partys-heart-and-soul,"The row between the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is not a semantic joust, but a fight over the economic direction of the Tory party. Mr Kwarteng is looking for a bailout for businesses struggling with the jump in energy prices, and claimed on Sunday that he was “speaking” to the Treasury. Hours later, Mr Sunak’s advisers shot back. There were no talks. And this was not the first time, the Treasury source added, that Mr Kwarteng had “made things up in interviews”. Boris Johnson authorised his spokesperson to rebuff the Treasury. Both cabinet ministers were, said No 10, working to “mitigate the challenges”. What the spat revealed is the unresolved issue within the corridors of power of how to resource a “green industrial revolution”. This policy is key to the government’s plan to level up parts of the country and deliver jobs to constituencies that switched from Labour to vote for Mr Johnson. Yet no credible plan has emerged from Whitehall. Time is running out. Pledges for carbon capture projects, for green steel plants and to roll out home insulation are worthless without being backed by cash. The Treasury, alas, is not going to let the climate emergency change its view that rises in government spending have to be paid for by rises in taxation. Mr Sunak is behind plans, it is said, to reduce carbon emissions by increasing household bills by hundreds of pounds a year. Keep things under tight fiscal control now, reasons Mr Sunak, and the Tories will be in a position to cut taxes before the next election. In his party conference speech, Mr Sunak pointedly praised his predecessor George Osborne for his austerity measures. For the chancellor, fiscal conservatism is a Tory vote-winner. Mr Kwarteng has other ideas which appear more in touch with Mr Johnson’s gut instincts. The business secretary, it seems, wants payouts for families to offset green energy bills in the drive towards net-zero emissions. Getting the state to give money directly to households would allow consumers to pay for green investment – and create jobs via subsidies for businesses. This is the Tory “Santa Claus theory” of economics. Rather than be a political Scrooge and insist on lean budgets with tax increases to balance spending, Mr Kwarteng seems to believe that Conservatives should bestow gifts to deliver economic dynamism. Like-minded ministers have been publicly agitating for Mr Sunak to borrow at least £50bn to attract private capital to finance decarbonisation. This is the Tories’ real green revolution: to create employment in new industries, controlled by lightly regulated private companies, without creating government jobs. It is moot whether private companies can be productive, in a narrow economic sense, without being environmentally destructive. But Mr Kwarteng thinks it is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong. He may be right. Next week, the government is supposed to set out how much it will spend a year to reach its net-zero targets. So far it’s budgeted just a quarter of the £20bn needed annually. It would be unforgivable if Treasury penny-pinching meant Britain failed to play its part in meeting the challenge of the environmental crisis.",Politics; Rishi Sunak; Kwasi Kwarteng; Conservatives; Boris Johnson,Opinion
2022-03-18T10:53:42Z,Could Ukraine war help end west’s reliance on hydrocarbons?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/18/could-ukraine-war-help-end-wests-reliance-on-hydrocarbons,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have a profound impact on the world’s race to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, climate experts have warned – but it may not all be negative. Vladimir Putin’s attempts to wield his dominance over European energy supplies as a weapon to limit interference in his war appear in danger of backfiring. Europe is embarking on a clean energy push that could reduce Russian gas imports by more than two-thirds, while the UK will set out an energy security strategy within days that will emphasise renewable power. In the US – as well as pumping more fossil fuels – president Joe Biden is renewing efforts to pass his mauled green investment package. David Blood, the prominent financier who with Al Gore founded Generation Investment Management, believes the Ukraine war should boost green energy. “The irony is, this war is funded by the west’s dependence on Russian hydrocarbons. There is now significant evidence to show that hydrocarbons are not just environmentally unsustainable, but that they weaken the social, political and economic fabric of our world too,” he said. “This war provides even more evidence of why there is no time to waste in transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards a cleaner future.” This fresh impetus to decarbonisation probably caught Putin by surprise, as he had been “happy to use climate to exacerbate tensions within the west”, said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US, and a former high-ranking World Bank climate expert. She said EU countries’ commitment last year to reach net zero emissions by 2050 may have fed into the Russian president’s calculation that he should no longer delay his long-standing ambitions over Ukraine. Every step towards clean energy in Europe diminishes his economic hold over EU states: Europe gets 40% of its gas from Russia, rising to 60% for Germany, but that demand must all but disappear by 2050 if the net zero aspirations are to be met. “Putin’s understanding of what decarbonisation, especially in Europe, would mean for Russian energy exports in the medium and long term may have been one factor in the timing of his invasion of Ukraine now,” said Kyte. “The more time passed, so the appetite for fossil fuels would diminish. However, the nature of the west’s pivot away from Russian fuel in response was likely not part of the calculus.” In the long-running UN annual negotiations on the climate, Russia has played a low-key but not outwardly obstructive role for decades. Todd Stern, former US climate envoy under president Barack Obama, and who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said Russia “didn’t try to throw sand in the gears” but did little to help. “Nothing I’ve ever seen suggests [Putin] has had any desire to be an active, high-ambition player,” he added. “I doubt climate has entered into his calculations except when he thinks he can get something for it.” Something Putin could get for it has been to foment populist culture wars, particularly in the US where he acted, according to Kyte, as the “climate whisperer” to president Donald Trump, “encouraging scepticism of scientific consensus”. Russian social media bots and troll farms honed their disinformation techniques for years on lies about climate science. Yet Putin himself is believed not to be a climate denier, and listens to Russian experts who have made clear the climate chaos that will come from rising carbon emissions. The deeper question is whether the Russian president regards those ravages as a problem. Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and rising sea levels will scour the planet, but those impacts will be diffused across the vast landmass of Russia – the biggest country on the planet, but sparsely populated compared with rivals such as China, India and the US. According to the comprehensive report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published at the end of February, Russia will fare far better in terms of the impact on agriculture than regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and the US. Its productivity for some key crops such as wheat could increase. The biggest risk the IPCC found to Russia was permafrost thaw. Putin is even hoping to exploit some aspects of the climate crisis, such as the melting of the Arctic ice cap, which could open up new shipping passages and make oil and gas drilling easier. Russia is notably pushing its Arctic territorial claims, even while invading Ukraine. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate change adviser, says the Russian president has no scruples over inflicting climate catastrophe on the rest of the world, while seeking advantages for himself. “Putin has acted with utter contempt for the climate, just as he has violated all norms on human rights and international sovereignty,” said Bledsoe, who is now at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC. “He is planning massive new oil and gas developments in the Arctic, which would devastate that fragile region, including by hastening the disappearance of Arctic sea ice, which is crucial to global climate stability. And he has done nothing to prevent Siberian tundra melt, which will unleash gigantic new methane releases. Putin has made Russia a climate outlaw state.” In an optimistic analysis, if the Ukraine war accelerates the shift to renewable energy in the EU, the UK and the US, it could mark a turning point for the world’s efforts to decarbonise. Campaigners warn the opposite could also be true, and an expanded role for fossil fuels could push the goal of staying within 1.5C of global heating out of reach. But Stern believes that fear could be overdone. “What China does or does not do to meet the call of the Glasgow climate pact to ramp up its [emissions-cutting target] will almost surely have much greater impact on account both of China’s carbon footprint, and the power of its example for other high-emitting developing countries,” he said. “Whether the US Congress delivers climate legislation will also make a big difference.” Even in the best case, however, the human cost and suffering inflicted recklessly and willingly by Putin in Ukraine will cast a deep shadow over the world’s efforts to prevent climate breakdown. Governments scrambling to deal with the military threat, the refugee crisis and the economic impacts of this Russian-made crisis will be in a poorer position to concentrate on the looming threat of the climate emergency. “By definition, [the war] demands intensive focus and so diminishes the amount that relevant leaders focus on climate,” said Stern. “When you’re trying to get big things done, that diminishing of focus can matter.”",Climate crisis; Russia; Vladimir Putin; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; World news; Arctic; Fossil fuels,Environment
2021-10-20T07:52:41Z,MPs urge pension schemes to cushion economic effects of UK’s net zero plan ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/20/mps-urge-pension-schemes-cushion-economic-effects-uk-net-zero-plan,"UK public sector pension schemes could deepen divisions in society unless they use their billions of pounds of investment to cushion communities pivoting away from carbon-intensive industries such as steel and carmaking, MPs have said. The cross-party group argues towns and regions across Britain could be devastated by a rapid switch to low-carbon technologies, leaving them to face the same future as mining towns hit by pit closures in the 1980s, unless pension funds take account of the impact of investments on vulnerable households and businesses. In a report that focuses on the investment decisions made by the local authority schemes, the MPs said submissions made by pension experts, thinktanks and members of parliament indicated “that the failure to understand both the social and economic dimensions to net zero risked a political backlash”. It comes a day after the government published its long-awaited strategy for reaching net zero by 2050. While the measures put forward by ministers were criticised by the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the independent statutory body that advises ministers on how to reach net zero, as failing to meet the challenge, the MPs said they may still leave some communities without the resources to make the transition. The report said: “Reference was made to the Gilets Jaunes protests in France and to other public protests, such as opposition to the closure of coalmines in Poland and the fuel protests in the UK. “The inquiry heard several times that in the absence of a just transition there could be resistance to climate action. As Lord Deben, the chair of the CCC, told the inquiry: ‘We are not going to do the transition if it isn’t just, because society won’t accept it.’” The five-strong group of MPs said the government should “explicitly recognise and articulate a high-level commitment to a just transition”. Funds in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS), which rank among the biggest in the UK, were told that they should make the same commitment and consider how their investments impact on inequality and the government’s plans to level up the regions alongside supporting businesses that cut carbon emissions. The LGPS is made up of 88 funds with 6.2m members and assets of £276bn at the end March 2020. Pension funds could protect communities dependent on high-carbon industries by introducing plans to manage any divestment programmes over a number of years, rather than simply switch funding overnight. A risk register of regions, industries and households most affected by the financial costs of climate change could also inform investment decisions, the report said. Unions and business leaders have privately shared their concerns that a rapid move towards carbon taxes and green investment that excludes industries that use high levels of fossil fuels will wipe out parts of Britain’s manufacturing industry, unless they are offered financial support to update equipment and develop new technologies. Clive Betts, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for local authority pension funds, said: “Major industrial changes are rapidly coming down the track. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1980s which left workers and communities behind, government urgently needs to be planning for an orderly and just transition to net zero.” Councillor Doug McMurdo, the chair of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, said: “As responsible long-term investors we have to ensure our work to achieve net zero actively support a just transition. However, we cannot do it alone. The scale of challenge and potential opportunities requires sustained commitment across society and from government.”",Green economy; Climate crisis; Business; Environment; UK news,Environment
2021-10-13T15:54:05Z,Matt Hancock will hope new job can help restore career and public image,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/13/matt-hancock-will-hope-new-job-can-help-restore-career-and-public-image,"Matt Hancock’s turbulent time working at the heart of the UK’s biggest public health crisis in living memory cost him many allies in the party and his affair caught on camera cost him his dignity and public image. But his new job as a UN special representative focused on economic development in Africa could be the start of his attempts to rebuild his career. The grand announcement, which included the tweet of his invitation to take up the role, suggests he is keen to turn attention to his new direction. One senior diplomat with experience of the UN suggested, with raised eyebrows, that the announcement of Hancock’s UN job had evoked rather grander headlines than it deserved. They pointed to others, such as Gordon Brown and the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who have “special envoy” roles appointed by the secretary general. Hancock will report to a UN agency, the Economic Commission for Africa. No 10 and the Cabinet Office said the government did not nominate Hancock for the role but that permission had been sought from the ministerial watchdog. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said it was poor timing to announce the appointment on the day of a damning report by the health and science select committee into the pandemic. “Apparently, the one British export the Tories are successfully promoting is their own disgraced former cabinet ministers,” she said. “Right now, the only role that Matt Hancock should have is answering questions to the ongoing ICO investigation into his own conduct, and the promised public inquiry which the government continues to delay.” The former health secretary’s stock was very low by the time of his departure, especially with MPs on the right of the party, because of discontent with lockdown rules, of which he was seen as the main proponent. Some critics in the party attempted to spread mischievous rumours about a return at the last reshuffle, but Hancock looks likely to remain a backbencher for some time. Allies of the former health secretary have said since his departure that he will remain deeply loyal to Boris Johnson in hope of a comeback, and feels he has much more to give in government. “I don’t think his career is over,” one former cabinet colleague said. “His delivery skills are extraordinary.” He still has high-profile friends in government and outside. The Guardian understands it was the campaigner Nimco Ali who introduced Hancock to Dr Vera Songwe, the UN undersecretary general, who made the appointment. Ali, a leading anti-FGM and women’s rights activist, is a Home Office adviser on violence against women and a close personal friend of Carrie Johnson, the prime minister’s wife. Cabinet ministers and senior MPs were quick to show public support, with tweets from Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Damian Green congratulating Hancock on the move. Hancock had told allies he was interested in taking up an international role and indicated his interest at a fringe event at the Conservative conference – the only one he attended. He told the audience at the panel on Africa investment, which included Ali and the Kenyan ambassador, that he wanted to turn his focus to bringing private investment to Africa. The job description will have little to do with Hancock’s expertise in health. He will work to develop policy on new financial markets on the continent and develop green investment facilities. Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, said the appointment was “sickening” because of the UK’s poor record on vaccine access in developing countries.",Matt Hancock; UK news; Politics,Politics
2021-11-21T22:30:08Z,"Labour will not ‘throw cash at’ UK’s problems, Keir Starmer to tell CBI",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/21/labour-will-not-throw-cash-at-uks-problems-keir-starmer-to-tell-cbi,"Keir Starmer will make a pitch to win over Britain’s business leaders by promising a Labour government will not simply “throw cash at” the country’s problems. Speaking to the CBI’s annual conference in the Midlands, Starmer will put fiscal discipline at the heart of his party’s appeal to a sector Labour believes has been alienated by Boris Johnson’s government. Starmer will tell businesses that Labour “absolutely don’t think that the solution to every problem is to throw cash at it”, promising to run “a stable government and a tight ship”. He will highlight Rachel Reeves’s tough approach to the public finances, saying: “We will never spend money just for the sake of it.” He will also announce the creation of a new skills advisory panel, including former education secretary David Blunkett, to ensure Labour has the right policies on preparing young people for work. Labour has previously attacked the government for wasting billions of pounds during the pandemic on “crony Covid contracts”, as it tries to chip away at the idea that the Conservatives can be trusted with taxpayers’ money. Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said a Labour government would set up an “office for value for money”, which will scrutinise government spending decisions before taxpayer resources are committed. Labour has already made some significant spending pledges, however, including the shadow chancellor’s promise of £28bn of green investment each year until the end of the decade, to facilitate the transition to net zero. Some business groups have reacted angrily to aspects of government policy in recent months, including the prime minister appearing to blame the private sector for the shortage of HGV drivers that caused a fuel crisis earlier in the autumn. Starmer will say a Labour government would seek a better long-term deal for hauliers with the EU, as he repeats the call he made in his party conference speech for the government to “make Brexit work”. Fleshing out that idea, he will say Labour would seek regulatory equivalence for financial services; argue for Britain to maintain its data adequacy status, allowing digital firms to compete with EU rivals; and negotiate for mutual recognition of professional qualifications. “I believe all of this is achievable by robustly defending our interests, and patiently negotiating,” Starmer will tell his audience. Starmer has been careful to insist the issue of Brexit cannot be reopened since Labour was comprehensively defeated in the 2019 general election, having himself been instrumental in persuading his party to adopt a pro-second referendum policy. Labour hopes to unite its remain and leave-supporting voters by highlighting concerns about economic issues, including the rising cost of living, with inflation climbing, and national insurance contributions set to rise in April. Starmer’s emphasis on fiscal discipline is intended to contrast with the approach of his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader promised his party they will “never again go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government”. He has also said he does not think the big six energy companies should be brought into public ownership, in a rejection of the sweeping nationalisation Labour planned in 2019. Lord Blunkett will be joined on Labour’s skills advisory panel by former senior civil servant Rachel Sandby-Thomas and businessman Praful Nargund, director of an IVF provider, Create. They will tour the country with the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, talking to teachers, children and educational experts. Blunkett said: “Nothing can be more important than spreading what works, embedding high-quality and inspirational teaching and learning, and adapting a curriculum that provides motivation to young people at every stage, and reassurance to employers that they will have literate, numerate, creative and responsive employees for the future.” Labour has already announced that it would place careers advisers in every school, and beef up the teaching of digital skills. “Young people are ambitious, optimistic and excited for their futures. Yet far too many are being let down by a Conservative government that’s living in the past,” Starmer will say. The CBI conference is being held across multiple sites and will also feature a speech by the prime minister, who is expected to highlight the prospects for green jobs across the economy.",Keir Starmer; Labour; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Business; Politics; UK news; Boris Johnson,Politics
2022-04-12T05:00:09Z,Labour has shelves of  winning policies. Now the party must get people to listen | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/12/labour-winning-policies-party-keir-starmer-public,"Ripe plums fall into Labour’s lap. Without the opposition lifting a finger, each day brings another revelation that tells wavering voters all they need to know about what these bumptious ministers think of the little people for whom they set the rules. The world of golden wallpaper, 3am Downing Street karaoke parties and £335 trainers might have provided vicarious glamour in normal times, but not when living standards are plunging and so many people have raw memories of lockdowns and lives lost. I was recently sent the words of the chair of a local Conservative association. With shameless cynicism, his “political overview” opened by referencing war: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine has taken the headlines away from Partygate. The absence of a vote of no confidence in the leadership means we now have the opportunity to stabilise the leadership and rebuild trust with the electorate and of course our lead in the polls.” As it is, recent polls put Labour at 39%, the Tories on 35%. “Rebuilding trust” looks a bit herculean right now. A newly “serious” Johnson-of-Ukraine could revive party loyalties. If not, Labour could win as the capable, clean and decent alternative to this corrupt, arrogant and politically tin-eared crew. But I am taken aback by people I meet – keen followers of politics – who struggle to define what Labour stands for. “On your side” is OK, but Labour still fumbles for what George HW Bush once clumsily called “the vision thing”. Oppositions struggle to be heard. Labour is brim full of policies, more radical than it gets credit for, more radical than Tony Blair’s in 1997, but often lost in the government’s noisy command of the news agenda. Some do land with impact, That windfall tax on North Sea oil companies awash in profits – to help recompense hard-pressed bill-payers and extend the warm home discount – hit home against the chancellor’s mean austerity. Rachel Reeves, who has promised to be “the first green chancellor”, mapped out a huge £28bn-a-year green investment to kickstart the economy with battery “gigafactories”, insulating 19m homes, and massively increasing wind power; but Labour hasn’t yet received the credit its ambitious plans merit. The same goes for Reeves’s promise to abolish small business rates – replacing them with a 12% tax on big tech – to restore high streets. As Reeves reviews an estimated £175bn worth of tax reliefs, she has already committed to equalising tax rate on earned and unearned incomes, as well as targeting landlord rents, private equity and “carried interest” loopholes. It makes a strong contrast with these non-dom, tax-minimising ministers, never straight about their money until half-truths are dragged out of them. Sajid Javid’s former non-dom status, because his father was born in Pakistan, defies any notion of tax fairness: if it was morally OK, why drop it when you enter politics? Labour’s radical tax clean-up needs to be heard, and to yield richly for the Treasury. While the government’s promised employment rights bill has vanished, Labour – true to its name – would revolutionise the power balance in the workplace. Reeves has promised “radical insourcing” to bring services back into the public sector from profiteering contractors. Labour policies would have made P&amp;O’s disgraceful abuse impossible, by banning zero-hours contracts, “fire and rehire” and bogus self-employment. It would ensure employment rights started on day one, and that all workers enjoyed the benefits of sick pay, parental leave and protection from unfair dismissal, with flexible hours the default. These policies would transform millions of working lives. A new right for unions to recruit in every workplace, and fair pay agreements in every sector, would reset decades of rewards unjustly flowing backwards from workforce to shareholders, turning the tables on bad employers not just in sectors such as care, deliveries, warehouses and retail, but higher up the scale as well. Yet here too, Labour struggles to be heard. As voters would expect from Labour’s successes on schools and the NHS whenever it has been in power, the party has convincing priorities for repairing the damage done to both since 2010. It has pledged a renewed emphasis on early years, permanent mental health support in every school, universal breakfast and after-school clubs, and a youth drop-in mental health hub in every area. “Excellence” plans are not all Gradgrind: they include a guarantee for every child on arts, sport and expeditions – funding that was stripped out by Tory cuts. An eye-catching pledge to charge VAT on private school fees would raise £1.7bn to spend on state schools, and is in stark contrast to Rishi Sunak’s personal £100,000 donation to Winchester college. The need to clean up Westminster – with its tainted donations and lobbying by MPs with second jobs – hardly needs mentioning. Levelling up, too, is natural Labour turf, in its DNA, from restoring the £20 cut to benefits to introducing a genuine national living wage. The party has pledged not to “balance the books on the backs of working people” as George Osborne and Sunak have done. While the government fails on its impossible northern promises (not one spade is in the ground for its proposed local rail projects), Gordon Brown is producing local devolution plans. At local elections in May, crime will be home territory for former chief prosecutor Keir Starmer. On Monday, he promised to create “victim payback boards” for local communities to settle antisocial behaviour. These may sound like small potatoes – but many complain about being powerless to act in their neighbourhoods. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, recently made a speech calling for a radical rethink of foreign policy, and laying out what “make Brexit work” should look like, swivelling back to European security, reversing army cuts and escaping Britain’s fuel dependency on autocrats. He promised to restore the country’s soft power against what he fears is the “age of authoritarians”, with full foreign aid and a strong BBC World Service and British Council. In two years, Starmer has turned Labour into a force that is now well beyond its initial “permission to be heard” stage. Now, people need to know what Labour will do. The policy samples I’ve mentioned are random: I could list shelves-full of others, each costed under Reeves’s grip, her fiscal rules underpinned with a new “office for value for money”. For the first time in recent years, Labour is starting to lead on the economy. But it’s still not trusted on defence, where Labour is on 19% and the Tories 38%. Put out more flags and talk loudly of security, for defence now tops Ipsos Mori’s list of public concerns. Labour can’t let Boris Johnson’s posturing occupy this ground. But policies on their own are not enough. A few chosen beacons need to illuminate the way. This shadow cabinet barely needs lift a finger to discredit this self-disgracing government, but Labour has yet to crystallise its meaning. It takes time to implant an idea in the public mind, and time may be short, if Johnson’s fortunes ever momentarily look up and he dashes for an election.

2021-11-18T19:15:47Z,The Guardian view on rail cuts: levelling down not up | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/18/the-guardian-view-on-rail-cuts-levelling-down-not-up,"The government’s Integrated Rail Plan, published on Thursday, is in fact neither integrated nor a plan. If it had truly contained an integrated approach, it would have addressed national rail needs as a whole. It would have confirmed Boris Johnson’s election promise to build both the north-south HS2 line in full and the west-east Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). It would then have committed to upgrading the remaining rail network to provide fast and regular urban connections and commuter services, especially in the north. It would also have contained a proper strategy for enticing goods services back on to rail and away from the roads. Instead, Grant Shapps unveiled what is, in reality, a cost-cutting exercise. It has been dictated by the Treasury’s refusal to allow public infrastructure spending to exceed 3% of gross domestic product. Under this self-imposed fiscal rule, rail is competing with green investment, broadband, hospitals, schools and even space rocketry for new capital spend – and, as Thursday’s document proves, it is losing out. As a result, the transport secretary has abandoned the eastern leg of HS2 along with major parts of the trans-Pennine NPR project – while going through ludicrous presentational contortions to avoid saying so. In their place, announced with a brass neck that even Mr Johnson would have struggled to equal, the transport secretary trumpeted a cobbled-together set of cheaper upgrades and short-term fixes as if they add up to a better deal than the axed projects they replace. This is, quite simply, untrue. Underlying it is the reality of the UK’s unequal regional investment. Figures from the IPPR North thinktank show that, in the past decade, the north of England received £349 per person in transport spending, while London got £864. If the north had received the same level of spending as London, it would have had £86bn more since 2010. Mr Shapps’ plan, worth £96bn, will take until 2050 to complete – which is 29 years away and more distant than the planned completion of the original full HS2 in the 2040s. The new money will therefore perpetuate regional investment inequalities, not remove them. It does not level up but level down. Lost opportunities are legion. The eastern leg of HS2 has been scrapped, but there will still be a high-speed link between Birmingham and East Midlands, a significant part of the original route. At the same time, there is potential provision for another new HS2 route between Leeds and Sheffield – but only part of it involving a possible new dedicated line - as well as an upgrade , part of the proposed electrification of the Midlands mainline, between Sheffield and East Midlands. In other words, the eastern leg will be half-built, with a gap in the middle. Something similar is proposed for the NPR, with new track between Warrington and Huddersfield, but only upgrades between Warrington and Liverpool and between Huddersfield and York. Freight rail opportunities, with their huge environmental benefits, are barely discussed. This is not a joined-up railway and it is not joined-up government either. These proposals mark a loss of governmental nerve about important rail infrastructure. But they are also a reality check about its airy promises on both levelling up and building back better. They seem to recognise that the next general election will not now fall into the Conservatives’ lap. Caught between a spending-averse Treasury, and the fear that new Tory voters in the north and Midlands want a quicker pre-election payback if they are not to revert to Labour, Mr Johnson has ordered a retreat from ambition. He hopes all this will give him room for general election handouts and more warm words. But it is evidence that his words and promises are not to be trusted. • This article was amended on 25 November 2021 because an earlier version said there would be “another new line between Leeds and Sheffield”. It is more accurately described as the potential provision of a new HS2E route between the two cities.",Rail transport; Economic policy; Transport; Rail industry; Boris Johnson; Conservatives; Politics; Grant Shapps,Opinion
2021-10-05T13:00:53Z,IMF cuts global economic forecast as pandemic ‘hobbles’ growth,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/05/imf-cuts-global-economic-forecast-as-pandemic-hobbles-growth,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned the world economy remains “hobbled” by the Covid-19 pandemic as she revealed her organisation has revised down its forecast for global growth this year. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, said the most serious obstacle to a full recovery was the vaccine divide between rich and poor nations and warned the global economy could suffer a cumulative $5.3tn loss over the next five years unless it was closed. Speaking ahead of the IMF’s annual meeting next week, Georgieva called on rich countries to make good immediately on their pledges to share stockpiles of vaccines with developing countries. “We face a global recovery that remains hobbled by the pandemic and its impact,” she said. “We are unable to walk forward properly – it is like walking with stones in our shoes! “The most immediate obstacle is the ‘great vaccination divide’ – too many countries with too little access to vaccines, leaving too many people unprotected from Covid.” In July, the IMF predicted 6% growth for the global economy in 2021, but Georgieva said this would be scaled back in new forecasts to be published in next week’s World Economic Outlook. After a summer hit by supply-chain bottlenecks and rising inflationary pressures, the IMF chief said momentum in the US and China – the world’s two biggest economies – was slowing. Although next week’s outlook will still predict a strong bounceback from the decline in global output seen in 2020, Georgieva said “the risks and obstacles to a balanced global recovery have become even more pronounced: the stones in our shoes have become more painful”. Low-income nations were being hit by a combination of limited access to vaccines and a lack of the policy firepower deployed by rich nations to cope with the economic impact of the virus. Georgieva said the divergence in economic fortunes was becoming “more persistent”, adding that while output in advanced economies was projected to return to pre-pandemic trends by 2022, it would take many more years for emerging and developing countries to recover. “We can still reach the targets put forward by the IMF, with the World Bank, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization, to vaccinate at least 40% of people in every country by the end of this year, and 70% by the first half of 2022,” the IMF managing director said. “But we need a bigger push. We must sharply increase delivery of doses to the developing world. Richer nations must deliver on their donation pledges immediately. And, together, we must boost vaccine production and distribution capabilities; and remove trade restrictions on medical materials. “In addition to vaccines, we must also close a $20bn gap in grant financing for testing, tracing, and therapeutics. If we don’t, large parts of the world will remain unvaccinated, and the human tragedy will continue. That would hold the recovery back. We could see global GDP losses rise to $5.3tn over the next five years.” With the COP26 conference in Glasgow, Scotland, a month away, Georgieva said fighting climate change was critical. She called for robust carbon pricing, much higher green investment and support for the most vulnerable. A successful green transition could raise global GDP by 2% this decade and create 30m new jobs, she added.",Global economy; International trade; Business; Economics; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Kristalina Georgieva; World news; Coronavirus; Vaccines and immunisation; Society; Supply chain crisis; Cop26; Climate science,Business
2021-07-15T05:00:33Z,Trillions of dollars spent on Covid recovery in ways that harm environment,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/15/trillions-of-dollars-spent-on-covid-recovery-in-ways-that-harm-environment,"Trillions of dollars poured into rescuing economies around the world from the Covid-19 crisis have been spent in ways that worsen the climate crisis and harm nature because governments have failed to fulfil promises of a “green recovery” from the pandemic. Only about a tenth of the $17tn in bailouts provided by governments since the start of the pandemic was spent on activities that reduced greenhouse gas emissions or restored the natural world, according to analysis from Vivid Economics, published on Thursday. Of the total spending, most went on emergency measures, such as wage payments, to keep economies afloat. But about $4.8tn of the spending, including outlays on road construction, bailouts for airlines, and boosts to food production, had a clear environmental impact – and Vivid Economics found that most of that impact was negative. About $3tn was spent in ways that would increase greenhouse emissions and harm the natural world, outweighing the $1.8tn spent globally on green projects, such as renewable energy and low-carbon transport. Jeffrey Beyer, an economist at Vivid Economics and lead author of the report, said the “green recovery” that many governments promised last year had not materialised. He said: “Definitely governments could have done better. They’re spending public money on things that harm the public. It’s just shocking and impossible to justify. In some instances it would also have been cheaper to make better decisions.” Renewable energy, for instance, is cheaper than fossil fuels for power generation in most parts of the world, while the cost of electric vehicles has also dropped rapidly. Few governments had taken account of the impacts of nature, and in some cases they loosened environmental regulations, such as legal restrictions on logging and the need for environmental impact assessments for developments, citing Covid-19 as the reason, with little justification. Beyer added: “We did not see a sufficient shift to green spending. It’s hard to be optimistic when you look at the evidence about how much climate change and nature have really not been considered in public spending decisions.” Economic stimulus spending had a negative environmental impact in 20 of the 30 countries that Vivid surveyed. The EU as a whole, Denmark, France, Spain and Germany, all made a strong show by turning more of their stimulus spending to environmentally beneficial ends. But some leading economies did not act so well; China and India spent far more on projects that would harm the climate and nature, such as coal-fired power plants. Russia came bottom of the league in terms of the harm caused by its stimulus. The picture in the UK was “mixed”, said Beyer. The British government brought forward a 10-point plan, including investments in offshore wind energy and low-carbon innovations. However, ministers scrapped the green homes grant, a programme to help insulate housing, after only six months and following a litany of failures. The US stimulus has also been altered, with political wrangling over Joe Biden’s planned $2tn package having reduced the amounts to be spent on “green” job creation in areas such as renewable energy. Beyer said the full impacts of the US spending plans were not yet clear. Brian O’Callaghan, lead researcher on the Oxford University Economic Recovery project, said analysis by the Oxford Global Recovery Observatory had found more than 560 examples of environmentally positive spending. He said there was still uncertainty over what would happen to stimulus spending, especially in view of the new variants of Covid-19. “Despite lacklustre green investment to date, there remain strong opportunities for governments to jump on to green industry transitions to bring economic recovery alongside environmental progress,” he said. Vaccine programmes would help countries further shift their spending to a long-term focus, which would help with green investment, O’Callaghan said. “Policymakers must consider how green incentives can be integrated to traditionally neutral spending – for instance, requiring new hospitals to have the highest standards of energy efficiency, requiring new schools to be 100% powered by renewables, or mandating that all government-funded construction follows green procurement standards.” Edward Barbier, professor of economics at Colorado State University and author of a landmark report on the 2008-09 financial crisis, which found about 16% of the stimulus then was “green”, agreed. He said: “It is understandable that some of this additional stimulus [for Covid-19] is less green than anticipated. But for it to be environmentally harmful and damaging to nature is inexcusable and ultimately will make many worse off for failing to head off the looming climate crisis and other global environmental risks.” He urged the G20, whose ministers and leaders will discuss the recovery from Covid alongside the climate crisis in meetings ahead of the Cop26 climate talks in November, to step up their efforts. “At some point, we need to transition from stimulating the existing ‘brown’ economy and implement long-term investment and pricing reforms to create the infrastructure, innovation and incentives for the green economy we want and urgently need. “The major economies of the G20 must take the lead on such a global strategy. As this report shows, they are failing so far to do so. It is imperative that the G20 take up this challenge immediately and begin formulating a post-Covid green recovery strategy as a collective priority.”",Economics; Environment; Biodiversity; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Pollution; Fossil fuels; Natural resources and development; Energy; Wildlife; Green economy; Conservation; Green politics; Business; Global development; World news,Business
2022-01-30T19:25:03Z,Sink or swim: Macquarie plunges back into crisis-hit UK water industry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/misunderstood-macquarie-takes-another-go-in-uk-water-industry-southern,"The UK’s water industry has for years promised to clean up its reputation for pollution incidents, leaks and murky financial dealings. Yet once again, it is hoping for a clean start. In total, water companies spilled raw sewage into coastal bathing waters more than 5,500 times last year, prompting a another investigation by the Environment Agency and the industry regulator, Ofwat, in November. Weeks later, Ofwat raised a red flag over the financial health of three of Britain’s biggest water companies – Southern, Yorkshire and SES. The regulator expressed concern about “weak levels of financial resilience” and levels of customer service that lagged behind the rest of the industry. For Southern, the resilience report gave a snapshot of the company’s financial health before an equity injection from a familiar character in the water sector’s chequered history, the Australian investment bank Macquarie. Macquarie gained notoriety for its role as the owner of Thames Water between 2006 and 2016, when it attracted fierce political scrutiny for extracting billions in shareholder dividends while Thames’s debt soared. By 2018 the Labour party had called for the sector to be returned to public ownership. But five years after selling out of Thames, the Australian infrastructure investor was given the regulator’s blessing to return to run one of the most troubled water companies in the industry – a move that raised eyebrows in the industry. The £1bn in fresh equity for Southern over the summer followed Ofwat’s decision to enforce a record £90m fine against Southern for deliberately pouring sewage into the sea, and came with a promise to invest a further £2bn over the next four years. Macquarie has not stopped there. Within months of its return to the UK’s water sector, it agreed to invest £130m in green bonds issued by a subsidiary of Affinity Water, and £120m in Anglian Water’s debt. The passive investments are part of the bank’s sprawling set of investments in UK infrastructure. Macquarie owns the Green Investment Bank, which was set up with UK taxpayer funds and controversially privatised four years ago. Under its ownership, GIB’s profits more than quadrupled to £144m for the year ending March 2021, compared with the year before. It has paid a total of £174m in dividends to Macquarie, which also owns gas networks, airports and telecoms service companies across the UK. Aileen Armstrong, a senior director at Ofwat, said the regulator had “really welcomed the money coming into the regulated business” while being “clear about the expectations on what the company needed to do for customers. “We have wanted to see a turnaround, and a component of that is an equity injection into the company, which is what this transaction did. We have been very clear – and would be with any prospective new owner – about what we expected of the regulated company and the need for a turnaround in the operations there,” she said. One senior industry source said Ofwat’s decision to give Macquarie its blessing to return to the water industry showed “just how desperate they were” after Southern’s record pollution fine and its troubling financial position. “Southern was not an attractive prospect for investors, and the company’s management was, perhaps unsurprisingly, on its knees. Investors would not have been falling over themselves to take a share of Southern,” the source said. However, Martin Bradley, the head of Macquarie’s “real assets” team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said his bank was happy to return to the UK’s water industry despite “misunderstandings” over its ownership of Thames and the concerns over Southern’s financial health. “We didn’t pay a premium for Southern Water,” he said. “We invest in long-term infrastructure, and there’s nothing more long-term than the provision of utilities like water. This is what we do, and we think we’re quite good operators.” Macquarie’s spell at Thames was far from blemish-free. In 2017, the water company was fined £20m after admitting it dumped 1.4bn litres of raw sewage into the River Thames at six sites in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire between 2013 and 2014. The water company’s finances were also a cause for alarm, with Macquarie criticised for selling Thames with almost £11bn of debt after a decade in which the bank paid itself £1.6bn in dividends, ran up a £260m pension deficit and paid next to no UK corporation tax. A former senior Thames employee said of Macquarie: “Were they an effective, focused investor? Absolutely. But can you expect them to operate a utility in the public interest? Well, only if you are certain that the regulatory framework rewards the good behaviours and penalises the bad. Ofwat hasn’t always done that.” The characterisation of the Australian bank as a “vampire kangaroo”, or an aggressive asset stripper, has sometimes been unfair, he added. “They did extract more out of the company than would be ideal, but it was in full sight of the regulator. And where it made sense under the regulatory framework for Macquarie to invest in Thames, they were happy to invest too,” he said. Macquarie’s interests in the water sector are part of a more than £50bn of investment in UK infrastructure that it has either arranged or invested directly since 2005. These include Cadent, which is the UK’s largest gas distribution network operator, as well as the operator of Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Southampton airports and the broadcast service provider Arqiva. “We didn’t need to convince the regulator,” Bradley said of Macquarie’s return to the UK water industry. “Ofwat has said they’d be keeping a close eye on the situation at Southern Water. They expect us to deliver, and we expect to deliver.” The former Thames employee said that at the end of the day, Macquarie was driven entirely by the bottom line and the letter of Ofwat’s regulation. “They were always in it for the money, and they were able to use the regulatory regime to take an aggressive approach at times,” he said. However, there have been concerns for some time that there has been “underspending in areas that Ofwat didn’t measure” that has led to “an accumulation of problems over decades”. Armstrong said there had already been “quite a lot of change in the regulatory regime since Macquarie was last in the sector”. “Over the last few years we’ve been very clear about making sure there is financial resilience in the sector and that the companies are focused on delivering good operation performance,” she said. Hopefully this time, Ofwat has been clear enough. The regulator can wash its hands of the past only so many times.",Utilities; Regulators; Pollution; Business; Environment; UK news,Business
2021-10-27T17:46:24Z,‘Cop26 own goal’: despair over budget backing for flights and roads,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/27/cop26-own-goal-despair-over-budget-backing-for-flights-and-roads,"Rishi Sunak’s decision to make domestic flights cheaper, freeze fuel duty and spend £21bn on roads just before the Cop26 climate summit has prompted a furious reaction from green campaigners. The chancellor’s budget speech did not mention the climate crisis despite the UK-hosted summit of 196 nations opening in Glasgow on Sunday. The UK’s cut in foreign aid funding has dented its climate credibility with developing nations but was in effect cut further by the inclusion of Covid vaccine donations. “The chancellor declared the UK was entering an ‘age of optimism’ but instead he extended the age of fossil fuels,” said Luke Murphy, at the Institute for Public Policy Research. “Sunak talked for longer about beer duty than our duty to future generations to address the climate crises. This budget was an own goal for a government that should be leading the world into a new low-carbon age [at] Cop26.” Katie White of WWF said: “The budget announcements take us headlong in the wrong direction. If the chancellor is serious about levelling up and improving life chances for future generations then he must invest now to deliver the net zero transition. Future generations won’t forgive or forget those who fail to act while there’s still time.” Sunak halved the tax on domestic flights, which are already far cheaper and more polluting to take than trains. Air passenger duty was increased by £4 on “ultra-long” flights over 5,550 miles, from £87 to £91. But Sunak said: “Less than 5% of passengers will pay more.” Overall, the changes are a tax giveaway of £30m a year. “Just five days before the start of Cop26, it was astonishing that the chancellor didn’t even mention the words ‘climate’ or ‘nature’,” said the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas. “This wasn’t just a failure to address the climate emergency, it actually took us backwards. It’s hard to think of a greater dereliction of our responsibility as Cop26 hosts.” There was £1.5bn of new funding for public transport, but Paul Tuohy, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “The commitment to spend billions on road building and continue to freeze fuel duty will come as cold comfort to the many households with no car who continue to be pummelled by rising rail and bus fares. How can our leaders hold their heads high at Cop26?” The government said it had mobilised £26bn of government capital investment for the “green industrial revolution” since announcing a 10-point climate plan a year ago and would leverage new private investments of up to £90bn by 2030. The Green Alliance said Sunak had left a shortfall of £21bn a year in investment, while Labour has pledged £280bn in green investment by 2030. Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, which has more than 100 Conservative MPs and peers as members, said: “New spending on levelling up, improving regional transport, and scaling up R&amp;D will support the government’s net zero mission. But the chancellor missed an opportunity to position net zero at the heart of the Treasury’s long-term economic strategy, to align the tax system with our environmental goals, and to plug some important funding gaps, such as incentives for owner occupiers to insulate their homes.” Shane Tomlinson of the green thinktank E3G said: “It is now clear that there is an increasing divide between the prime minister’s ambition for a green industrial revolution and the chancellor’s willingness to make this happen.” Sunak said the previous cut in the UK’s foreign aid budget from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5% would be reversed by 2024-25. But Claire McConnell of E3G said the Treasury had in effect further cut aid by including vaccine donations and “special drawing rights” it got as a windfall from the IMF. “For a successful Cop26, the UK needs the support of low- and middle-income countries. Instead, the government is directly damaging those countries, and the relationships it needs.” Jayne Harrold of consultants PwC said: “With Cop26 around the corner, it is surprising to see that the chancellor did not present more of a green-focused budget. It is possible he is holding back on these topics for Cop26.” The Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology welcomed new green business rate relief supporting the installation of renewable energy, but said the absence of other major measures was a missed opportunity before Cop26. A £230m investment boost in the UK’s offshore wind manufacturing sector, was welcomed by Dan McGrail, the chief executive of RenewableUK, while Jo Evans of the Advanced Propulsion Centre was also pleased with financial support for electric cars: “Continued support creates wealth and takes us closer to achieving net zero ambitions.” Additional reporting by Heather Stewart",Autumn budget 2021; Cop26; Climate crisis; UK news; Environment; Green politics; Green party; Caroline Lucas; Air transport; Road transport; Politics; Travel and transport; Rishi Sunak; Conservatives,UK news
2021-06-04T09:00:36Z,Private finance won’t decarbonise our economies – but the ‘big green state’ can | Daniela Gabor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/04/private-finance-decarbonise-economies-green-state,"The pandemic, we often hear, is forcing a rethink in economics. We are leaving behind one model: the austerity-obsessed small state that outsources the job of macroeconomic stability to unelected central banks. Central banks, in turn, worked to target inflation under a regime of benign neglect for unemployment; it was assumed, meanwhile, that the bond market should and would discipline governments into fiscal rectitude. Now, the Biden administration’s “once in a generation” spending plans suggest a paradigm shift is under way. It puts governments, through fiscal policy (taxing and spending), back in the driving seat. In this sense, macroeconomics has the potential to become more democratic. But are we celebrating too soon? The big test of the paradigm shift, possibly the fundamental test, is how we go about decarbonising our economies. There are two ways to organise the low-carbon transition: through the state itself or through the financial sector. What might be termed the “big green state” approach involves massive public investments in green infrastructure and industries. When private finance recently lamented Biden’s infrastructure plans, it was objecting to a big-state route to decarbonisation that rejects the rhetoric of public-private partnerships. Indeed, the “big finance” approach wants the state – through its fiscal and central bank arms – to simply guide the private sector by changing price signals. In this scenario, the state plays a smaller role, making carbon expensive by forcing companies to pay for polluting. For instance, Germany recently introduced a €25 (£21) tax per tonne of carbon emissions on petrol, diesel, heating oil and gas. Higher carbon prices, the wisdom goes, will incentivise producers and consumers to transition to green energy. Private finance is there to lend the money that this transition requires. The numbers behind private green investment seem to add up: there is now $30tn (£21tn) in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) assets. The green “rush” is expected to accelerate as central banks move to decarbonise their operations and reduce subsidies to carbon-intensive activities. Take the Bank of England’s plans: under its new environmental mandate, it argues that the transition to net zero must be largely financed by private finance (as opposed to the state), in an orderly fashion that requires central banks to subsidise green and only “escalate” to penalising carbon financiers if, over time, companies fail to meet commitments towards decarbonisation. The strategy of cuddling carbon financiers is at the heart of the Cop26 conference that takes place this year in Glasgow. The hot new private sector gig for high-level public employees is green finance. But the world of “green finance” has injustice and inequality built in. It reduces democratic government action to higher carbon taxes, which often place the burden of decarbonisation on the poor. Government spending is to be directed to “derisking” private infrastructure, to cover the gap between the fees paid by users of essential public services and the commercial rates of return expected by private investors. Yet having privatised public services while hiking carbon taxes on ordinary people threatens a political backlash, which will reduce politicians’ appetite for meaningful decarbonisation measures. It will also reinforce the pressures to trust global asset managers to set the pace of green investment, even though the financiers’ “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) rush is rife with greenwashing: PR exercises that stick green labels on high-carbon activities. This greenwashing is a feature, not a bug, of big finance-led decarbonisation. It allows private finance to both enjoy the green subsidies promised by central banks and to protect profits from democratic forces that may, one day, transition from cuddling to penalising carbon financiers. The big finance approach owes its political appeal to fiscal fundamentalists who point to Covid-19-related surges in public debt to argue that the state simply cannot afford to green the economy. Instead, financiers dangle trillions of ESG investments in front of politicians, seducing them into believing the market will take care of the climate crisis. This validates unambitious carbon politics, as we see all too clearly in the EU’s sustainable finance initiative, which created a green public standards system. Four years after it was launched, this classification system for “sustainable” activity is now under serious threat of greenwashing from member states that want to include natural gas and other dirty activities within its scope. In turn, European commitments to develop in parallel a system that works towards penalising dirty lending have evaporated. Surrendering to vested carbon interests is easier when politicians cannot rely on a plausible green macroeconomic paradigm; instead they are still confronted, on a daily basis, with threats that inflation-concerned central banks will withdraw their protective hand from government bond markets. Indeed, central banks worried about the inflationary pressures triggered by economies reopening are now furiously debating how quickly to allow borrowing costs to rise. Climate activists should be prepared to fight the battle against fiscal fundamentalists with a simple message: the government is not a household. It has central banks on its side, and if there is a macroeconomic lesson the pandemic has taught us, it is that central banks can do a lot. In high-income countries, central banks have bought almost all debt issued by governments in 2020. They can and should continue to work closely with governments to accelerate decarbonisation. We cannot rely on private finance to lead us out of a climate crisis it has systematically contributed to. We have to disempower carbon financiers, and we do that by making the democratic state – not investors – lead the way forward.

2021-09-03T16:39:31Z,The Guardian view on Germany’s election: struggling to move on from Merkel | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/03/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-election-struggling-to-move-on-from-merkel,"In September 1998, when a relatively youthful Gerhard Schröder defeated Helmut Kohl and ended his 16-year reign as German chancellor, the victorious leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) told supporters that the country had opted for “a change of generation”. Mr Schröder’s triumph turned a page on the cold war era, aligning Germany with a fresh-faced centre-left resurgence in western democracies led by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. It was, in the political vernacular, a quintessential “change” election. Almost a quarter of a century later, Angela Merkel will stand down of her own accord later this month – the first chancellor to do so – after equalling Mr Kohl’s longevity in office. But this time, ahead of a 26 September election, German voters seem to be somewhat reluctant to move on. None of Ms Merkel’s prospective replacements come close to matching her popularity. Fewer than one in five see the chancellor’s own preferred successor, the CDU/CSU candidate, Armin Laschet, as the best option to replace her. Caught on camera laughing during a visit to a town devastated by floods, Mr Laschet has fought a lacklustre campaign and has become a liability for his party. A poll last week found that from highs of around 35% at the start of the year, the CDU/CSU’s ratings have plunged on Mr Laschet’s watch to the low twenties and fallen just behind the SPD for the first time since 2006. The Greens electrified the contest by topping polls in the spring. Their extraordinary surge seemed to embody a widespread desire for a more environmentally driven politics to meet net zero pledges. But they too have lost their mojo as the party’s candidate for chancellor, the inexperienced Annalena Baerbock, struggles to recover from allegations of plagiarism and financial mismanagement. The travails of the two former frontrunners have thus cleared the stage for the battered and bruised SPD, for years a symbol of the apparently terminal decline of European centre-left parties. Remarkably, the SPD now narrowly leads the race to take charge of the new era. Yet even this Lazarus-style resurrection can be seen as a tribute to the enduring appeal of Merkelism. The 63-year-old SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, has served as a fiscally cautious finance minister in the outgoing government. He is basing his pitch on being a safe pair of hands, much in the former chancellor’s mould. A recent SPD campaign ad even joked of Mr Scholz as “Er kann Kanzlerin” (“he can do chancellor”), using the feminine form of the German word to underline a message of continuity with his predecessor. If Ms Merkel were standing, she would almost certainly win. After 16 years in office, that is some compliment to her political skills and consensual style of government. But as Germany faces up to major challenges, such as meeting some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world and dealing with a rapidly ageing population, a new generation of leaders will need to make their mark in new times. The makeup of any future coalition is almost impossible to predict, such is the uncertainty of a race in which the lead has changed hands three times. The economically liberal FDP, for example, could become a kingmaker after 26 September, cancelling out centre-left commitments to higher taxes, more state spending and green investment. With three weeks to go until polling day, Germans find themselves looking through a glass darkly at the country’s post-Merkel future. • This article was amended on 5 September 2021. An earlier version said the SPD campaign advertisement about Olaf Scholz used the phrase “er kann Kanzerlin” and translated this as “the can-do chancellor”; the German phrase is “Er kann Kanzlerin”, which translates more correctly as “he can do chancellor”.",Germany; Angela Merkel; Europe,Opinion
2021-07-19T17:32:38Z,The Guardian view on Germany’s floods: another wake-up call | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/19/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-floods-another-wake-up-call,"Earlier this month, the German Greens unveiled an election poster designed to reassure voters who might be wary of their environmental radicalism. “Economy and climate without crisis”, went its slogan, suggesting that ambitious carbon reduction targets could be met without undue pain for jobs and industry. Days later, ecological crisis struck, in the form of the devastating floods that have overwhelmed western Germany, and parts of Belgium and the Netherlands. More than 190 people are so far known to have died, following flooding of an intensity and scale that has shocked scientists. The record levels of rain in north-west Europe followed record-breaking heat in the Americas. Extreme weather events are becoming the new normal, as climate models have long predicted. But some of the recent spikes have outstripped scientific predictions. The eventual impact of the floods on Germany’s September election remains to be seen. But this disaster, which the country’s main political parties have broadly agreed was related to global warming, has thrust the climate crisis to the forefront of the campaign. On Sunday, Angela Merkel, who is standing down as chancellor, insisted that Germany needed to “up the pace in the fight against climate change”. Less impressively, the conservative frontrunner to succeed her, Armin Laschet, was caught on video sharing jokes with bystanders during a visit to a flooded town. As the president of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the worst-hit states, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union can make amends by getting to the bottom of a lethal failure to translate satellite warnings into evacuations on the ground. Anguished debate in Germany is understandably focused on why, given the increased frequency of flooding as a result of the climate crisis, more efficient early warning systems were not in place. But the floods also underline the vital longer-term importance of September’s poll. Germany is Europe’s most powerful and influential state. As nations face up to the hard choices involved in meeting ambitious net zero targets, the timing and context means that the post-Merkel election will be a bellwether for green political hopes throughout Europe and beyond. Having briefly led in polls during May, Germany’s Greens have endured a difficult few weeks. The party’s candidate for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock, has suffered a series of political embarrassments, including allegations of plagiarism and overembellishing her CV. Though they remain on course to finish second to the CDU, the Greens have so far failed to seize the moment to make the case for a step change in levels of green investment in Germany, and at EU level. Meanwhile, the CDU’s manifesto, published last month, shows little sign of the economic radicalism necessary to deal with the climate emergency. Instead, Mr Laschet seeks to restore Germany’s constitutional debt brake as part of a post-pandemic return to fiscal conservatism. The stakes of this debate are enormous. As well as learning to cope and adjust to extreme weather events linked to global heating, there is a need to treat them as a warning of even worse to come if the world does not properly invest in a green future. In the autumn, Germany has an opportunity to give a lead.",Germany; Flooding; Extreme weather; Europe; World news; Climate crisis; Environment; Angela Merkel,Opinion
2021-10-13T23:01:34Z,Rishi Sunak urged to cut business rates to unlock billions in investment,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/14/rishi-sunak-urged-cut-business-rates-unlock-billions-investment,"Employers’ groups representing more than a quarter of jobs in Britain have called on Rishi Sunak to cut business rates in the budget later this month to unlock billions of pounds of investment in the economy. In a joint statement ahead of the chancellor’s post-lockdown budget, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and 41 other leading trade groups are demanding fundamental changes to the system, which taxes companies based on the premises they occupy. Representing more than 260,000 businesses and 9 million employees between them, the trade groups warned failure to take action would weigh on the government’s ambition to create a high-wage, high-productivity and high-investment economy. The intervention will add to pressure on the chancellor to cut business rates after a flurry of demands from “red wall” Tory MPs and a proposal from Labour to phase them out entirely. Companies are looking for help from the chancellor as they face severe headwinds from soaring costs and supply chain disruption caused by Covid and Brexit. The industry groups – representing all sectors of the UK economy from airports to pubs, shops, construction and manufacturing – said the current system served as a tax on investment and could hold back firms from spending on green projects and boosting their operations outside London and large cities. Their statement urged the chancellor to announce a cut in business rates alongside other reforms to lower the burden on firms, including removing disincentives for green investment. Under the current system, a company investing in its physical premises by installing solar panels or heat pumps could add to the value of the building, raising its rateable value and therefore the firm’s tax burden. The recommendation echoes proposals made by the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, at last month’s Labour conference. Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates and eventually replace them with a new, as yet undefined system that she said would reward investment, with a particular focus on businesses investing in decarbonisation and green technology. Labour is seeking to position itself as an ally of business while Boris Johnson’s Tories raise taxes on firms despite soaring costs facing companies and weaker economic growth. Responding to the CBI statement, Reeves said it was clear the business rates system was no longer fit for purpose. “It penalises high-street shops in favour of online giants and deters businesses from investing in new green technologies,” she said. According to the trade associations – which include the British Retail Consortium, UK Hospitality and the Federation of Master Builders – up to 50% of business investment is potentially subject to business rates. The groups told the chancellor that decisions made this autumn would dictate the shape of Britain’s economic recovery from the pandemic and whether firms could meet ambitious targets to decarbonise the economy. Issuing the warning in a joint statement, they said: “If we as a country are to truly level up and meet our net zero commitments, leading by example in the year we host Cop26, then unleashing a wave of business investment should be the focus.” Sunak is due to conclude years of consultations on the future of the business rates system at the autumn budget, after repeated delays to a fundamental government review. Several major companies, including Tesco, B&amp;Q and Waterstones, have warned the government that failure to take action would put thousands of high street jobs at risk, while allowing online giants to avoid paying fair taxes. With far smaller physical footprints, in cheaper locations outside big city centres, digital firms pay less in business rates than traditional retailers with vast networks of high street stores. Earlier this year it emerged the Treasury was mulling options for an online sales tax as part of the business rates review. While such a step would be supported by some large retailers, it is opposed by others including large trade bodies. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist of the CBI, said Sunak could not afford to delay taking action on business rates. “If the government is serious about achieving its net zero ambitions, kicking reforms further into the long grass cannot be the answer,” she said. “Action to get investment flowing into and around the UK is sorely needed to reinforce our recovery. The government deserves credit for convening the supply chain advisory group to unblock temporary challenges, but as we’re seeing with energy prices, there is no substitute for longer-term planning and investment.” A government spokesperson said it would conclude the business rates review this autumn and had provided extensive business rates relief worth £16bn during the pandemic, with support continuing until March next year. “We’ve also shown we are committed to supporting investment through the tax system, extending the Annual Investment Allowance increase for another year and introducing the super-deduction – the biggest business tax cut in modern British history.”",Economic policy; Autumn budget 2021; Business; Budget; Rishi Sunak; Retail industry; Politics; UK news; Tax and spending; Supply chain crisis; Brexit; Coronavirus; Labour,Politics
2021-08-12T05:00:10Z,"UK spending far more on polluting policies than green ones, says WWF",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/uk-spending-far-more-on-polluting-policies-than-green-ones-wwf,"The UK government is spending many times more on measures that will increase greenhouse gas emissions than on policies to tackle the climate crisis, according to an analysis of the spring budget. Only £145m in the March 2021 budget was devoted to environmental spending, most of it on the post-Brexit emissions trading scheme for industry, according to an analysis by the conservation charity WWF. But the cost of tax breaks to companies to encourage investment came to more than £34bn, while maintaining the fuel duty freeze – for an 11th consecutive year – is costing about £4.5bn in lost revenues. Tensions over the government’s commitment to net zero emissions, and the potential cost of policies to meet the target, are said to be one of the chief bones of contention between the prime minister and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The two are said to have had at least one blazing row recently. In all, WWF found that measures in the 2021 budget that would increase emissions were worth about £40bn. The findings come from a new “budget tagging tool” developed by the charity with help from Vivid Economics, which measures the impact of policy decisions that affect the environment. Isabella O’Dowd, the head of climate at WWF, said: “The spring budget showed a disconnect between the government’s rhetoric and the reality of what it’s doing. The ambition [on emissions-cutting targets] is great, but now we really need to see the policies that will deliver.” She said the landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published on Monday, which found the world was heading for more than 1.5C of global heating within the next two decades, showed how urgent it was for ministers to act. The UK will host vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, this November in Glasgow, aimed at bringing all countries together with new national commitments to cut emissions in line with the ambition of the Paris agreement of holding temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become more devastating. “With nature in freefall and the climate in crisis, the clock is ticking for the planet,” said O’Dowd. “It’s not yet too late to prevent global warming rising above 1.5C – that is in our hands. But the UK government must play its part by keeping every climate promise it has made.” She said separate estimates showed the UK could benefit to the tune of about £90bn in the form of new jobs, health benefits and infrastructure if the government took a greener approach to investment and spending. A spokesperson for the Treasury said the government rejected the WWF analysis. “These misleading claims fail to recognise the £12bn we already pledged to spend in support of our 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution. The budget built on that with further funding allocations and ambitious plans on green finance, and the UK Infrastructure Bank, which will help finance green projects across the UK.” In the budget, Sunak announced a new measure that would allow companies to claim their spending on certain productivity investments, plus an extra 30%, against any tax they owed. This “super-deduction” was spoken of at the time as a measure that could help to spur green investment. However, there is no guarantee that any of the investment covered by it will be green, and critics have pointed out that companies investing in new fossil fuel development could claim the tax break. WWF urged the government to put in place a “net zero test” so that all policies would have to be proven to contribute to the net zero emissions target, or at least be compatible with it, in order to be adopted.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Green economy; Green politics; Environment; UK news; Cop26; WWF; Climate crisis; Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Boris Johnson; Politics,Environment
2021-08-18T05:56:05Z,Green groups raise oil and gas clean-up fears as Woodside takes over BHP assets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/18/green-groups-raise-oil-and-gas-clean-up-fears-as-woodside-takes-over-bhp-assets,"Woodside Petroleum has not given a guarantee it will pay for billions of dollars in decommissioning and remediation costs linked to a portfolio of oil and gas fields it has agreed to take over from BHP. Green groups say Woodside lacks credibility in paying for clean-ups after selling a floating rig, Northern Endeavour, for a nominal amount to a company that collapsed three years later without paying decommissioning costs estimated at between $200m and $1bn. Woodside has claimed the sale was reviewed by regulators and approved. “We are committed to working with the Australian government and our industry peers to collaboratively develop and improve the decommissioning framework so that it strengthens protections for the environment, taxpayers, the government and industry.” In May’s budget, the Morrison government slapped a levy on the entire offshore oil and gas industry to pay for the decommissioning of Northern Endeavour, sparking outrage among producers who had nothing to do with the operation. BHP has agreed to merge its $20bn worth of oil and gas assets into Woodside, creating a company that will rank among the top 10 petroleum companies in the world, in return for 48% of the newly enlarged entity. The assets include 50% of a field in the Bass Strait, operated by ExxonMobil, that has been operating since 1969 and is now starting to run dry, requiring decommissioning that could cost as much as $1bn. The enlarged Woodside will be responsible for decommissioning the assets when they reach the end of their lives. It is understood BHP will transfer a total of about $3.9bn of rehabilitation costs into the merged entity. Rather than obtain a written guarantee from Woodside that it will meet the decommissioning costs, BHP is instead relying on due diligence it has done on Woodside’s portfolio and its positive view of the financial strength of the merged entity. Adding to BHP’s comfort, management of the newly enlarged Woodside will be drawn from both BHP and Woodside. However, the deal has alarmed environmentalists. “Given Woodside’s record with Northern Endeavour, questions must be asked whether it will attempt to avoid decommissioning responsibilities in the Bass Strait,” Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at activist shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anthony Collins, a campaigner with the climate change movement 350 Perth, said Woodside was “acting as BHP’s ‘useful idiot’; taking on a burden that BHP has decided is too toxic to touch”. “Woodside itself has demonstrated that it has no interest in anything other than producing as much oil and gas as possible and has neither the ability nor the willingness to make its business model appropriate for the times in which we live,” he said. The Woodside chief executive, Meg O’Neill, refused to say how much the company expected to pay to decommission Bass Strait. She said that when doing due diligence on the BHP deal “decommissioning was absolutely one of our key focus areas” and the valuation of the assets done for the merger “fully accounts for those decommissioning obligations”. “We obviously as an experienced offshore operator have experience in this and we’ve had our best people digging into it, so we’ve got a good understanding of what Bass Strait decommissioning costs are likely to be,” she said. “I think it’s worth bearing in mind that those costs are spread out over probably 20 years. “Bass Strait continues to be an asset that will be very productive and generate value for the merged company over the near term and in the decades to come.” A Woodside spokesperson said the Northern Endeavour sale “was reviewed by the regulators and approved at the time”. “Subsequent events have been disappointing, but neither the government or industry can go back in time and reverse approvals that were granted at the time,” the spokesperson said. The Woodside shares received by BHP will then be distributed to BHP shareholders, on the expectation that those with green investment criteria will sell them.",Business; BHP; Australia news; Business; Mining; Scott Morrison; Australian politics; Environment; Oil; Gas; Fossil fuels; Woodside,Australia news
2021-11-04T11:30:22Z,"Countries have failed to adapt for unavoidable climate damage, UN says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/countries-have-failed-to-adapt-for-unavoidable-climate-damage-un-says,"Extreme weather driven by climate breakdown is hitting the world “with a new ferocity”, the UN has said, but countries have so far failed to prepare for the widespread damage that is now inevitable even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Developing countries are particularly at risk, but they are unable to muster the cash needed to defend people and resources from flooding, droughts and sea level rises. They are likely to need between $140bn and $300bn a year by the end of this decade to cope with the impacts, but in 2019 received only $80bn in climate finance, which included cash to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The UN Environment Programme (Unep) said on Thursday at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow that without much greater focus on adapting to the impact of the climate crisis, millions more lives and livelihoods could be at risk. In its sixth Adaptation Gap report, Unep called on donor countries to focus more international aid on climate adaptation and find ways to involve private-sector finance, and it called for all countries to use more of the trillions they are pouring into economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic to help protect against the impacts of climate breakdown. Such efforts could create jobs and prosperity as well as protecting people, experts said. Inger Andersen, the executive director of Unep, said that although efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature rises must continue, countries meeting at Cop26 must also put more effort into preparing for the impacts of the climate crisis that are now inevitable even if the world fulfils the Paris agreement and limits temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. She said: “[This year] was the year in which climate impacts hit developed and developing countries with a new ferocity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, meanwhile, warned we have at best a 50% chance of limiting global warming to a 1.5C temperature rise this century. So, even as we look to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions – efforts that are still not anywhere strong enough – we must dramatically up our game to adapt.” Smaller developing countries face the hardest task, as much of their infrastructure already tends to be in poor shape, and people have few spare resources to cope with the impact of sudden extreme weather such as floods or storms, or to withstand longer-duration impacts such as droughts. In the past two years, Covid-19 has further depleted their already scant resources, leaving them even more vulnerable. Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said: “This latest report from the UN shows that the world is not doing enough to prepare for extreme climate events such as floods, droughts and wildfires that cause severe disruption to people’s lives. Even if Cop26 finished with a plan to phase out fossil fuels and cut emissions to zero, we would still have to live with the impact of the warming we have already caused, which we know has made many types of extreme weather events much more likely. Adapting to climate risk means taking a proactive response, by investing in better buildings, infrastructure and early-warning systems.” Funding projects that make developing countries more resilient to these impacts is hard, however. While building a windfarm or installing solar panels yields a quick and tangible return and is attractive to investors, projects such as managing agricultural land for drought, installing early-warning systems in case of flood, building shelters and other means of preparing people for extreme weather do not produce a clear profit. Although the funds for adaptation rose by 50% from 2017-18 to 2019-20, Andersen said this was still far too low. The report also cited OECD data showing that the top 10 donors funded more than 2,600 projects with a principal focus on adaptation between 2010 and 2019. About eight in 10 countries have now adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, according to Unep, an increase of 7% since 2020. Yet some methods of helping people adapt can have multiple benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, restoring mangrove swamps or coral reefs in coastal areas to act as a buffer against sea level rises and storm surges can sequester carbon dioxide and foster healthy populations of fish and other wildlife, as well as providing tourist revenue. Early efforts to prepare for the impacts of extreme weather also reduce the need for rescue spending when disaster does strike. Adaptation has often been overlooked at international climate talks, in favour of the urgent task of cutting emissions. But the UN has been trying to highlight adaptation at the Cop26 talks, with its secretary general, António Guterres, repeatedly calling for half of the $100bn a year in climate finance to be delivered by the rich world to poor countries to be devoted to adaptation. Scientists backed up Unep’s call. Brian O’Callaghan, the lead researcher at the Oxford University economic recovery project, who has shown that a green recovery from Covid-19 could generate jobs and economic benefits, said: “Covid-19 recovery spending has so far not prioritised green investment – and more than any other sub-category, adaptation and resilience needs have been ignored. By failing to invest in climate adaptation, it seems like we’ve gone skydiving and decided we don’t need a parachute.” Job opportunities range from building flood defences and changing city infrastructure to planting trees around water courses and on hillsides to prevent landslips, restoring wetlands and peatlands, as well as town planning, building communications networks, preparing healthcare systems, educating children to prepare for disaster, and research and development into new technology. But Lisa Schipper, an environmental social science research fellow at Oxford University, said some adaptation efforts in the past had been misdirected, and lessons must be learned from those failures. “We need to rethink the design of projects so they involve local actors in order to incorporate a deep understanding of what drives vulnerability to climate change,” she said.",Cop26; Climate crisis; Environment; World news; Extreme weather; Flooding; Wildfires,Environment
2020-11-16T11:50:56Z,"Bank of England needs more powers to decarbonise economy, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/16/bank-of-england-needs-more-powers-to-decarbonise-economy-say-experts,"Urgent reforms of the Bank of England are needed to help decarbonise the financial system and boost green investment as Britain recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, a group of leading academics has said. The New Economics Foundation thinktank and Positive Money campaign group said landmark changes needed to be made by the government to give Threadneedle Street more powers to cut carbon emissions. In a letter to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, the organisations and a group of leading academics said urgent changes to its mandate were needed to help Britain meet its net zero carbon emissions target. Signatories of the letter include Willem Buiter, a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, Nouriel Roubini, the American economist, and Stephanie Kelton, the author of The Deficit Myth. It comes after Sunak announced that large companies and financial institutions would be forced to come clean about their exposure to climate risks within five years, as part of a tougher disclosure regime to help make Britain a net zero carbon country by 2050. To demonstrate the government’s commitment to tackling global heating, the chancellor also said the UK would launch its first green government bond. Following the lead of 16 other countries including Germany and Sweden, the bond will be sold to big City investors next year, with the money raised paying for investment in carbon-reducing projects and the creation of green jobs. Although welcoming the measures, the campaigners warned the steps left too much to financial markets to self-regulate climate risk. “They assume that markets are efficient and financial institutions can effectively self-regulate. The 2008 global financial crisis served as a wake-up call to the reality that financial markets left to their own devices are prone to excessive risk-taking,” the letter said. The signatories, which also include the economist Steve Keen and former Green MEP and economist Molly Scott Cato, said further steps were therefore necessary to decarbonise the banking system, including reforms to Threadneedle Street’s powerful regulatory toolkit. It also called on the Treasury to use the Bank’s resources to fund the launch of a new Green Investment Bank. It comes after the energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, said earlier this summer that he expected the government to set out plans for a successor to the Green Investment Bank “in the not-too-distant future”. The original green bank, used for financing low-carbon projects, was sold off under Theresa May three years ago in a £2.3bn privatisation deal with the Australian bank Macquarie. Calling for a new vehicle to be launched, the academics suggested proceeds from the Bank’s Covid corporate financing facility (CCFF) – which offers cheap loans to large companies in exchange for corporate bonds – could be used to capitalise the new GIB. More than £15bn has been lent to struggling companies through the scheme, including airlines, carmakers and oil firms despite government assurances of a green economic recovery from Covid-19. Fran Boait, the executive director of Positive Money, said: “The measures announced by the Treasury and the Bank of England this week are positive steps, but they are just baby steps considering what needs to happen to shift UK finance in line with the Paris agreement and the government’s net zero target. If the government wants to show leadership ahead of Cop6 it will have to go further.”",Bank of England; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Coronavirus; Economic recovery; Business; UK news; Rishi Sunak; Andrew Bailey; Economics; Economic policy; Climate crisis,Business
2021-10-01T10:50:50Z,Climate experts give cautious welcome to Labour’s green policies,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/01/climate-experts-give-cautious-welcome-to-labours-green-policies,"Climate experts and campaigners have given a cautious welcome to Labour’s proposals to tackle the escalating ecological crisis but urged the party not to back away from a broader “green new deal” agenda to ensure a rapid and fair transition to a low-carbon economy. During its party conference in Brighton, Labour set out measures including an annual £28bn green investment fund, a mass retrofitting programme, a pledge to decarbonise steel and a “net zero and nature test” for every policy. The headline plans echoed many of Labour’s initiatives for a green industrial revolution that were set out in detail at the last election. Many experts applauded the scale of the proposals, describing them as “a good first step” to ensure the UK meets its climate targets. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has been leading Labour’s push on climate and in his speech to conference promised it would be the party of “climate justice and economic justice together”. However, some campaigners said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, needed to explicitly back a “transformational green new deal” – including the nationalisation of key industries, which he ruled out this week – to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy was conducted at sufficient speed and scale to tackle the climate crisis and, crucially, improve the lives of ordinary people through better jobs, improved housing and public health. On Friday it was reported that allies of Starmer were pushing him to demote Miliband, with one party source telling the Times the shadow business secretary was “veering away from his brief in a strange way”. Labour said there were no current plans for a reshuffle, and any move against Miliband – a well-respected environment secretary in the last Labour government and former party leader – would be met with dismay by climate experts and many party members. It would also dent Labour’s credentials before Cop26, the international climate summit in Glasgow in November. Climate experts welcomed the party’s plans on Friday. Sam Alvis, the head of green renewal at the Green Alliance thinktank, which last month calculated the government needed to spend an extra £22bn a year to meet the UK’s climate goals, said: “This is a big increase in ambition that would go a long way in getting to net zero carbon emissions and restoring nature … [it] puts pressure on chancellor Rishi Sunak to follow suit with a similar programme in the spending review.” Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it would be important to see the details behind the headlines, but added the plans were broadly in line with those set out by the government’s own advisers on the Climate Change Committee. “The overall figure of £28bn is in the right sort of area to ramp us up to where we need to be between now and 2030 … it is a good first step.” Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, also welcomed the policies, saying it was clear “that tackling the climate crisis and supporting a fair transition” was central to Labour’s agenda. But she said “big questions” remained around the “speed and nature of the transition” under any future Labour government and the party’s readiness to show “real leadership in guiding a just transition away from dirty, expensive and unreliable technologies like oil, gas and nuclear”. Climate and social justice activists inside and outside the party said that, although the policies did not go far enough, they highlighted the power of their campaigning over the past two years – from school strikes to Green New Deal Rising, Extinction Rebellion to Labour for a Green New Deal – and vowed to continue to push the party to go further. Hannah Martin from Green New Deal Rising, the youth climate movement that challenged Starmer over his climate commitments during conference, said the spending commitment “only happened because of the activism of young people”. “While it’s a good first step towards the level of investment we need, we still have a leader of the opposition who is running away from young people and won’t talk to us about this crisis.” Martin said her generation had faced multiple crises, including recessions, pandemics, climate breakdown and rising poverty. She added: “We know that only a wide-reaching green new deal at the speed and scale required where we transform our financial systems and put power back into the hands of communities is going to work and we need leaders who have the courage to fight for it.” Kate Hicks, from the grassroots campaign group Labour for a Green New Deal, said the party had taken a “big step back from 2019”. “Labour should be the party of green jobs, but Starmer has ditched the policy he needs to achieve it: public ownership. Without it, we can’t wind down polluting industries at the pace that’s needed, and we can’t make sure that workers are retrained for quality, well-paid jobs.” Delegates at the Labour conference overwhelmingly backed a motion calling for the party to adopt a series of radical climate policies including the nationalisation of the energy sector, the creation of a “national nature service”, “a government programme creating millions of well-paid, unionised green jobs with publicly owned entities” and “mass investment in green technologies and renewables”. Hicks said this showed there was still “a huge and growing wave of grassroots support behind a transformative green new deal”. “Some, like Ed Miliband, appear to recognise this, and we urge the rest of the leadership to follow his lead,” she added.",Labour conference 2021; Green politics; Labour; Environment; Politics; Ed Miliband; Keir Starmer; UK news,Politics
2021-07-17T15:00:03Z,Green transport can only succeed with a greener grid ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/17/green-transport-can-only-succeed-with-a-greener-grid,"The challenge of decarbonising the UK’s roads, railways and flight paths will rely on harnessing the UK’s cleaner energy system to power the future of the transport sector. Carbon emissions from the UK’s energy industry have tumbled in recent years, largely due to the shutdown of old coal power plants in favour of more renewable energy. But senior energy industry sources have warned that the UK’s ambitious targets to drive down carbon emissions from the transport sector will require an acceleration of green investment in the energy system too. “The energy industry has a huge role to play in facilitating the decarbonisation of transport,” said Graeme Cooper, the head of future markets at National Grid. He says a green transport system will require a multibillion-pound investment to rewire ageing power grids and fit vast amounts of electric-vehicle charging infrastructure. Additionally, it will spur a boom in demand for green energy to produce hydrogen for heavy trucks, ferries and long-haul coach travel. “There will be an uptick in demand for energy, so we need to ensure that we are future-proofing, putting the right wires in the right place for future demand. We also want to ensure that the energy we’re plugging in for the increased demand is as green as possible,” Cooper said. The energy regulator, Ofgem, recently gave the green light to a £300m investment spree to help triple the number of ultra-rapid electric car charging points across the country over the next two years. Energy networks are expected to install 1,800 ultra-rapid charge points at motorway service stations and a further 1,750 charge points in towns and cities. It’s a taste of what’s to come if the UK hopes to meet its green transport targets. The Energy Networks Association (ENA) estimates that by 2028 the industry will have needed to invest in enough grid connections for charging points to power 8.2 million electric vehicles. A green transport system will also require the equivalent of about 30 terawatt hours of hydrogen fuel per year by the middle of the century, which will require roughly a tenth of the UK’s current electricity use to manufacture, it says. Peter Kocen at the ENA said the speed of the transition would require a new approach to regulation – one that helped energy companies invest in anticipation of the boom in green transport. “The regulatory environment sets out investment over a five-year period and requires energy networks to provide evidence of immediate ‘need’ for this investment. But energy networks also need to be able to be responsive to the energy transition, including investing before there’s the immediate need,” Kocen said. Scottish Power is the only UK energy company that invests in the full energy “value chain” – from generating renewable electricity to running power transmission lines and electricity grids, and supplying homes. It believes the challenge ahead may be even greater. The company’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, told the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders this year that the company was preparing for more than 30 million electric vehicles to be on the road by 2040. “By 2050, we’ll need something like 25 million private chargers and 3 million public ones,” he told the trade group’s international motoring summit last month. “That will only be possible if the electricity distribution networks are suitably reinforced to cope with all the additional demand, and a system of fair access for remote or deprived communities is in place.” In addition, heavy transport “like bin lorries, big buses and boats, [which] are unsuited to battery power” will need green hydrogen – made using renewable electricity and water – to help heavy vehicles, he told the Observer. The company plans to invest £10bn over the next five years in projects ranging from “wind and solar power plants to battery storage – from smart grids to EV charge points and hydrogen electrolysers” to help meet the need for car charging and low-carbon transport. “In a couple of decades’ time, UK electricity demand will double, as transport, heating and industry all make the shift from carbon. In short, we need to electrify the hell out of everything over the next few years if we’re going to meet our net zero targets,” he said.","Energy industry; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Greenhouse gas emissions; Business; Climate crisis; Environment; Travel and transport; Hydrogen power; Renewable energy",Business
2021-10-19T16:38:50Z,"It’s Tory rebels, not Boris Johnson, who will set the pace on Britain’s road to net zero | Rafael Behr",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/19/tory-rebels-boris-johnson-britain-net-zero,"Boris Johnson’s recruitment to the global crusade against carbon emissions is, by his own admission, recent. On a visit to New York last month, the prime minister confessed to a back catalogue of newspaper columns that “weren’t entirely supportive of the current struggle”. He was making excuses for Anne-Marie Trevelyan, his trade secretary whose record of climate scepticism tilts into outright denial. (In 2012 she derided “global warming fanatics” for believing that the ice caps were melting.) Around the same time, Johnson was querying the scientific consensus, dabbling in crackpot theories about sunspots and disparaging windfarms. In his defence, the prime minister has since declared that “the facts change and people change their minds”. At most, half of that statement is true. It was a fact that human activity was heating the planet when Johnson cavilled, and it is still a fact now. A newly acquired belief is not necessarily insincere. Or rather, sincerity is the wrong test to apply to a man who believes things while he is saying them but adapts what he is saying to suit the audience. When Johnson was a backbench MP, plotting to be Tory leader, it was expedient to have one set of convictions. As host of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow next week, he needs a different set of opinions. In terms of Britain’s contribution to carbon reduction, the recentness of the prime minister’s conversion matters less than the forces that might hold him to the cause or prise him away from it. He did not pick a side in the Brexit referendum until February 2016, yet the shallow roots of that conviction were no impediment to radicalism. When forecasting Johnson’s behaviour, the salient factor, probably the only one, is the calculation of his political self-interest. The omens are not great. In the short term, there is pressure to be green. At Cop26, the world will be watching. Downing Street’s pride is at stake. The government’s net zero strategy, launched today, reflects that scrutiny with ambitious pledges to boost green investment and infrastructure. And after the summit? The familiar flow of Westminster politics resumes, with the prime minister’s eyes drawn to events much closer than the 2050 horizon, where Britain is due to be carbon neutral; closer than 2035, by which point fossil fuels are supposed to have been eliminated from UK electricity generation; closer than 2030, when all new cars sold should be electric. The furthest point in the distance on which Johnson can hold a gaze is the next election, due in May 2024 but feasibly sooner. Meanwhile, he is vulnerable to distraction by the demands of a 24/7 news cycle. This problem is not unique to Britain. The rewards of good climate policies are enjoyed by future generations; the costs are paid by people who vote now. That is not an attractive bet for most politicians, least of all the myopic kind obsessed with headlines and poll ratings. There are good arguments for present sacrifices in exchange for future rewards. Johnson himself used them recently when raising national insurance to fund health and social care. But the self-interest calculus there was simpler. He doesn’t want to fight an election in which Labour can accuse the Tories of underfunding the NHS through a pandemic. Run the same equation with subsidies for replacing gas boilers with heat pumps, or road-pricing to compensate for a drop in vehicle excise duty, and it doesn’t balance so neatly. Even tax-allergic Tories submit to the political logic of bailing out the health service. They have limited patience for what they see as a pattern of leftward lurches by a leader who neglects his party’s core values. There is already a caucus of MPs – the “net zero scrutiny group” – poised to cause trouble as the bills for a green transition start to land. Conveyed by serial Brexit rebel Steve Baker, the NZSG does not explicitly reject climate science (although it is fair to say its members have some ground yet to cover on the journey away from scepticism). The argument is couched in terms of value for money and fairness: carbon neutrality is a luxury service, and government should not extract the subscription from ordinary families, who are likely to be squeezed in coming months as inflation bites. That view gets a sympathetic hearing from the chancellor, although the penny-pinching gloom was excised at the 11th hour from a Treasury review published alongside the net zero strategy. No 10 clearly did not want any rain on Johnson’s parade route up to Glasgow. Still, the prime minister cannot resist indulging the caricature of ecology as a metropolitan lifestyle fetish for vegans and remainers. That was the implication of an article he wrote in the Sun this week, reassuring readers that “the Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi”. There are Conservative-friendly ways to rebut the net zero sceptics, and ministers do make them from time to time. They point at potential jobs growth and a UK competitive advantage in new industries. They might also note that Margaret Thatcher was a pioneer of political leadership on environmental issues, championing the ban on CFC gases to plug the hole in the ozone layer. There is an appeal to the principle of conserving a precious heirloom – the natural world – as a legacy for our grandchildren. The clue is the party’s name. For the most part, Britain’s Conservatives are mercifully uninfected by the more deranged strain of climate denial that has captured the US Republicans. But climate politics still gets trapped in a polarising vortex where a cause can be sacred only to one side. The right decides that cutting carbon emissions is a socialist ruse to suffocate markets, and adopts a belligerent anti-regulation stance, more Thatcherite than Thatcher. The left denounces that position as proof that the real obstacle to progress is capitalism, which appears to vindicate resistance on the right. There is a compromise zone in the unfashionable centre ground, where the problem of getting from a dirty economy to a clean one is solved by a combination of state intervention and private sector innovation. That is indeed the approach Johnson’s net zero strategy adopts. What the government is saying on the subject is not wrong, but what the prime minister says has not always been a reliable guide to what he will do. Today he is a climate evangelist. Not long ago he was a sceptic. Today he is on the right side of the argument because the political facts changed to make it worth his while standing there. But the mood in the Conservative party changes more often and more violently than scientific consensus. Boris Johnson knows which is his true master.

2021-08-03T18:00:03Z,Britain could be taking the lead in tackling the climate crisis. Where’s the ambition? | Keir Starmer,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/03/britain-climate-crisis-where-ambition-cop26-tories-labour-green-recovery-plan,"It used to be said of a good politician that they were able to make the weather. The metaphor has acquired a literal sense in recent years as humanity’s effect on the climate has become clear. In early July, downpours and flash floods hit parts of Glasgow. As I begin a two-day visit to the city tomorrow, the world is looking ahead to November, when countries’ representatives will gather in Glasgow for the 2021 UN climate change conference (Cop26). The world is looking to Britain, as host of the summit, to deliver. We cannot afford to miss this moment, but I fear we will. The urgent need for a coherent response is in front of our very eyes. In recent weeks flash floods have immobilised parts of Britain, Germany and China. Towns built on rivers have been destroyed and there have been frightening scenes of train commuters trapped underground in rising water. Record heatwaves and fires have ravaged parts of North America. All over the world, unusual weather events show that dystopia is not on the horizon. It is here today, all around us. This is a test of the prime minister’s ambition for “global Britain”. Based on the government’s actions so far, or lack of, it’s implausible that this ambition will be met. In 2015, the Paris agreement achieved unprecedented global commitments. Paris defined the “what”; an agreement at Glasgow is now needed to supply the “how”. Paris set the collective ambition to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This now needs to be translated into concrete action, coupled with an unequivocal promise to deliver. Time is short and history will not forgive a failure to act now. Yet at this vital moment, Boris Johnson is missing in action, while his climate spokesperson is busy advising people to freeze their leftover bread. When the issues at stake are so large it really is irresponsible for the response to be so small. This is a challenge that encompasses diplomacy, economics, finance, and targeted investment. A credible government now would be demonstrating serious ambition. Look at President Biden in the United States, who says that when people talk about climate, he thinks about jobs, and who has a plan for green investment. Labour has the same ambition. We have a plan to support jobs while cutting the substantial majority of our emissions by the end of this decade. But we need to act immediately. The Office for Budget Responsibility points out that acting early could mean we need an average of annual investment of just 0.4% of national income between now and 2050. The first step in that ambition should be a £30bn investment in a green recovery from the pandemic. That investment would create hundreds of thousands of secure jobs across the whole country. It would ensure that we buy, make and sell more in Britain. We would be rejuvenating our car industry while helping it move to the production of electric cars. We would be powering our homes with offshore wind turbines built in Britain and we would be manufacturing clean steel to build our schools, hospitals and railways. Labour would pass a Clean Air Act to improve the air we breathe and the water in our rivers. Every decision we made – from spending to infrastructure – would have to pass a robust “net zero and nature test”, to make it consistent with our environmental ambitions. Under the Conservatives, we are a long way off our climate targets. Among the G7 countries, the UK’s green recovery and job creation plans rank sixth. Rather than substance, Johnson is responding with a cabaret of soundbites. He has promised to make us the “Saudi Arabia of offshore wind” yet all he has delivered is offshored jobs, with turbines built thousands of miles away from Britain. He promised a green housing revolution before axing his own green homes grant. And as proven by the chaos around a new coalmine, his own advisory climate change committee has warned that this government is blundering into “high-carbon choices”. Forty years ago, a Conservative government ensured that the effects of de-industrialisation were felt very unevenly across the nation. Without good leadership, the same will be true of decarbonisation, with good, unionised, secure jobs replaced by insecure work. Under my leadership, Labour’s green transition would be a fair transition. That is the promise of a Green New Deal: an economy that is greener and fairer at the same time. With 100 days to go before the end of Cop26, the world needs a truly historic result in Glasgow. Often, when politicians talk about the climate crisis, they make an emotional plea for action on behalf of our children’s generation. As a parent, I know first-hand the desire to give your children a better future. But the future is already with us. It’s desperate that we have a government so firmly rooted in the past.

2020-07-01T14:51:59Z,Reannounced and reheated: Johnson's 'new deal' plans fall short in every way | Miatta Fahnbulleh,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/01/reannounced-and-reheated-johnsons-new-deal-plans-fall-short-in-every-way,"Prime minister Boris Johnson’s speech promised to “build, build, build” as he invoked the spirit of Franklin Roosevelt, but his plans fell far short of matching the US president’s legacy. The pandemic has shone a spotlight on Britain’s longstanding problems. Vital frontline services such as health and social care have been stripped bare, our weakened social security system has left millions without an adequate safety net, and the contributions of key workers have been underpaid and devalued. None of this was addressed in Boris Johnson’s speech. Instead, he reheated announcements on infrastructure spending designed well before the pandemic hit. Some pledges are taken out of the £600bn-plus capital investment that the chancellor outlined in the March budget. Others, such as the £12bn for affordable housing have already been announced. Even on their own terms, the sum of £5bn is paltry: Germany’s stimulus is worth €130bn, it’s seven times smaller than the UK’s investment stimulus response to the financial crisis in 2008, and a 200th of the size of Roosevelt’s New Deal. Before the crisis hit, activists and politicians were calling for a green new deal to tackle inequality and the climate crisis. Coronavirus made this all the more important – as a result of the widespread job losses, more than ever we need a government programme to train people and create jobs in green industries. In the short run this would help stimulate the economy, and in the long run prepare us for the next crisis. We’ve seen what happens when we fail to act in time and build resilience into our economy – let’s not repeat the same mistakes. Johnson said that we need to “build back better”, but the most important part of that phrase isn’t the “building” part, it’s the “better” part. In order to respond to the crisis at hand, the government must commit to protect people facing real hardship by beefing up our social security safety net and investing in vital public services like health, social care and housing. Against the backdrop of estimated unemployment levels not seen for 25 years, the government could bolster our social security system with a minimum income guarantee. It could stem the crisis in our social care system and bring forward reforms to create a national care service – comparable to the NHS – providing high quality care for all, free at the point of use. The government will need to take decisive action to tackle inequality between people and places – including by creating well-paid, decent jobs for the swelling numbers of unemployed. A green fiscal stimulus of at least £20bn a year, investing in low-carbon energy, transport and technology could create hundreds of thousands of jobs, while helping us achieve net zero carbon emissions. We are at a moment of real change where we need to see meaningful action from the government to fulfil the promise made at the election and to make all our lives better. The vulnerabilities that have been laid bare by this pandemic are forging a new consensus for the need for change. A new poll shows that only 6% of the British public want the economy to be run how it was before the crisis with nearly 60% wanting to see changes in how the economy is run. There is also support from business, trade unions and civil society for change. And so there is, in the midst of a crisis that has shown us both what was broken and what is possible, a growing sense that we must not go back to the way things were. The one thing Johnson got right – when he talked about the New Deal of the past – was to recognise the scale of the change we need to see. • Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation",Coronavirus; Boris Johnson; Economic growth (GDP); Economic recovery; Environment; Economics; Politics; UK news,Opinion
2022-07-19T05:35:20Z,Tuesday briefing: Why the next PM will offer net zero on climate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/tuesday-briefing-why-the-next-pm-will-offer-net-zero-on-climate,"Good morning, and if you’re in the parts of the UK where temperatures are heading for record highs today, I hope your night’s sleep was less sweat-ravaged than mine. Yesterday afternoon, similarly damp Conservative MPs packed into a sweltering committee room in Westminster to listen to their candidates for leader talk about the climate crisis – and while the meeting did elicit a U-turn from Kemi Badenoch, who finally joined the others by saying she would back the government’s net zero target, to some observers was an air of unreality about the whole thing. As much of the country wilted under conditions that will only become more common as the planet heats up, and parts of Europe continued to deal with wildfires, backbenchers who support the net zero targets viewed the fact that all five candidates have nominally committed to the UK’s climate targets as a success – but many observers fear that the pledges are only skin deep. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson skipped a Cobra meeting to manage the UK’s response, instead attending the Farnborough airshow. A few hours later, Tom Tugendhat was eliminated from the race – but the limited plans laid out by those who remain have drawn scepticism from climate experts. I spoke to the Guardian’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey about what the change of prime minister will mean for the climate – and whether there’s any hope of a new Conservative environmentalism. Also! We asked you yesterday to tell us how you’re handling the heat, and Nimo has assembled some of the most interesting responses. Particular thanks to Oscar, who I’m going to emulate in getting even more out of the Guardian and the Observer by using old print copies to cover the windows. First, here are the headlines. Five big stories Monarchy | Generations of the royal family have concealed details of assets worth more than £180m through a series of legal applications that have been granted in total secrecy, a Guardian investigation has found. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appointed an experienced security official as acting head of the domestic security agency after a shake-up that has renewed questions over Russian intelligence infiltration of key ministries. Labour | Keir Starmer has ruled out even an informal post-election deal with Liberal Democrats, following a similar pledge about the Scottish National party, as Labour seeks to close down Conservative accusations about a possible coalition. Child health | One in four children in England are on diets, research suggests, with the proportion who are considered healthy but trying to lose weight almost tripling. Scientists called the rise in dieting among children of a healthy weight “alarming”. Climate | As record breaking heatwaves sweep Europe, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that humanity is facing a “collective suicide” if things don’t change immediately. Guterres stated that “half of humanity is in danger zone.” In depth: What a change in PM means for the environment When Boris Johnson finally resigned, Fiona Harvey published a piece that noted his government’s many failures on the climate crisis, but also warned of something worse in store. “One group will be lamenting the end of the Johnson era,” she wrote. “Green Tories have seen the prime minister as their best hope for years, and are concerned that his successor will not live up to his promises.” Ten days later, as the candidates to succeed Johnson have competed to arrive most belatedly and inadequately at an endorsement of net zero, that message seems pretty prescient. “Johnson has achieved very little,” Fiona said. “But nobody else in the higher echelons of the Conservative party gives a stuff. He was the only champion green Tories had.” The commitment of the contenders to replace him is so flimsy that in an interview with Fiona at the weekend, Cop26 president Alok Sharma dangled the threat of resignation. Yesterday, there were signs that had made at least some difference: Liz Truss joked to the Conservative climate hustings that her main priority was avoiding Sharma’s exit, Helena Horton reports. “They’re all trying the green stuff on now,” said Fiona. “But they’re all deeply unconvincing.” Here’s the breakdown of where the candidates stand, and what the consequences might be: *** What’s making the Tory contenders so weak on the climate crisis? 1 Themselves Only Penny Mordaunt has set out a detailed positive view of the case for tackling the climate crisis since the race began (in an interview with the Guardian) – and she has also promised to cut green levies and halve VAT on fuel. Kemi Badenoch called the target a form of “unilateral economic disarmament” before she finally said she would abide by it yesterday. The two most senior candidates do not have convincing track records, Fiona says. “Liz Truss was awful as environment secretary,” she said. “She was foreign secretary for Cop26, but she did nothing in the run-up, hardly went, and never talked about it again.” When she was asked about net zero at the Channel 4 debate on Friday, she quickly pivoted to “a new survey of nature”. “That was pathetic,” Fiona said. “Biodiversity is important, but we know the state we’re in. We don’t need to start counting voles.” As for Rishi Sunak, “he was dreadful at the Treasury. He blocked funding for insulation, investment, carbon pricing – he just kiboshed everything.” 2 The political climate When they have been asked about the climate crisis, the candidates have mostly seemed to have answered a different question – about the cost of living. Perhaps the best way to understand their qualified commitments in public is as a demonstration that they recognise the gravity of that problem, instead. At the ITV debate, Truss said achieving net zero mustn’t “harm people and businesses”. The rest of the candidates followed a similar line. “The cost of living crisis has made all of this far more complicated than it’s been for years,” Fiona said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a “double-edged sword”: “If we had more wind and solar, we wouldn’t have this problem with the cost of gas. But you have people saying, dig up the coal. Squeeze every drop of oil from the North Sea.” 3 The electorate Not the national electorate, which polls show clearly supports action on net zero – but the MPs and then party members who will choose the next prime minister. Perhaps more important than the well-known climate deniers on the right of the parliamentary party are the limits to support on the other side. “The Conservative Environment Network is about 100 backbenchers, but it’s incredibly soft – you can be part of the climate sceptic groups at the same time,” Fiona said. Green Tories’ confidence in the viability of their position, she noted, was so low at the start of the campaign that they took a “let’s not make a fuss about it” line for fear of nudging the future leader into an anti-net zero position that they would later have to abide by. They’ve since abandoned that approach, as yesterday’s hustings suggests – “but there are still few for whom this is the make or break issue”. The evidence about what Tory members think is mixed (and they’re hard to poll reliably). While Alok Sharma told Fiona that Conservative voters support net zero commitments, a YouGov poll yesterday found that only 4% of members view the 2050 target as one of their top three priorities. *** What does this mean for the net zero target? 1 It will not be abandoned in law An important reason that candidates have accepted the net zero target in principle: it’s almost impossible to remove. One of Theresa May’s last acts as prime minister was to enshrine it in law, “and even with a majority of 80 you’re unlikely to be able to undo that.” International environment minister Zac Goldsmith told Channel 4 news last week that “No UK parliament is going to delegislate.” 2 It may well slip further down the list of priorities So the next government may not abandon the letter of the law. But that doesn’t mean it will abide by its spirit. “The real worry is that you get someone who says they are committed to net zero, gives us all the platitudes, but does nothing about it,” Fiona said. “We’ve had something of that for the last three years under Johnson – a government that doesn’t actually grasp it wholeheartedly.” Whether the next PM winds up being Sunak, Truss, Mordaunt or Badenoch, all four have set out policies that would specifically make reaching the target harder. 3 A new conservative environmentalism could emerge … eventually Fiona does see some grounds for optimism in Conservative mayors like Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands “going all out for green investment in their areas. They want the jobs.” And she notes that MPs in red wall seats “can see that they have no investment story to tell their communities – and tax cuts are not important to their voters. The way to reach them is to argue: how can you have a hopeful economic narrative for this country if you don’t base it on green growth?” But if that project is to come to fruition within the Conservative party, it is likely to be a long game. And on days as hot as today, the urgency of the problem is more obvious than ever. Heatwave mailbag Yesterday, we asked you to tell us how you’re dealing with the extreme heat. Here’s a selection of your best suggestions: “We’ve taped pages of your fine paper over many of our windows to keep the sun out. Now our house looks derelict and like something you might raid for supplies in The Last of Us. At least it’s cooler than usual, though.” Oscar --- “I’m a young 73 and coping with the extreme heat by using ice packs. I wrap them in a towel and rest my wrists on them while watching television in my shady room. I use them, wrapped in a towel, to cool my dog’s bed, too. I keep spare ones in the freezer and I’ve given some to my neighbours. Also, I fill my hot-water bottle with cold water and put it in the freezer for one hour and then take it to bed.” Christine --- “My wife and I have a two-week-old son, so have been a little nervous to see the forecast temperature go up and up. We’re giving our baby his first baths to try to clear sweat and relieve his heat rash. The heat means he wants to feed even more than usual, so it’s really important that his mother stays hydrated. Clothing can be quite tricky. He’s largely just wearing a nappy, but any breeze can throw his temperature regulation off balance so we have to have a thin blanket ready to drape across him.” Ben and Constance --- I sit with my feet in a bowl of ice-cold water. This cools the blood as it circulates around the body. I keep the curtains shut all day. I open the window and doors in the cooler times so that the colder air can circulate around the house.” Henrietta --- Neuropathic pain gets exceptionally worse in extreme heat. So I will stay in a darkened room, drink plenty of room-temperature water plus the odd hot drink (anything ice-cold makes the heat feel only worse) and just relax.” Annie What else we’ve been reading Amelia Gentleman’s piece about Sheila Seleoane, who lay dead in her flat for two years before her body was found, is beautifully reported and written. Stories like this sometimes imply that “nobody cares” – but Amelia reveals that Sheila’s neighbours did care; it was the forces structuring their lives that made their worries impossible to act on. Archie British reality TV is no longer a moral vacuum that sees producers ply contestants with alcohol to maximise drama. Amelia Tait talks to former reality TV stars from Big Brother and Love Island about why reality TV is becoming increasingly sober. Nimo George Monbiot sees the extreme heat in the UK as evidence that climate incrementalism – which “campaigns, issue by issue, sector by sector, for gradual improvements” – is a terrible mistake. He writes: “Only a demand for system change … has the potential to match the scale of the problem and to inspire and mobilise millions.” Archie Kelsy Burke writes about her journey to naked yoga and how it has changed her life, explaining: “Our nakedness was a reminder of what we have in common as we navigate how best to live and relate to one another in our shared social world.” Nimo Elle Hunt, a former work obsessive, found her drive easing off during the pandemic - and like many others, her life came into better balance as a result. She speaks to some very cheerful people who are part of “the great reevaluation”.

2021-10-26T11:38:01Z,"In his budget, Rishi Sunak will say the UK needs to cut spending. Don’t believe him | Michael Jacobs",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/26/budget-rishi-sunak-uk-cut-spending-public-debt,"After all the budget spending announcements Rishi Sunak has made in the run-up to the actual event tomorrow – on children’s services, regional transport, the minimum wage and public pay rises – you could be forgiven for thinking that the chancellor will be explaining the importance of public spending in an economic downturn. He won’t. Following his speech to the Tory party conference, we can be pretty sure that Sunak will say that what he is actually doing is “fixing the public finances”. By which he will mean, “after the emergency spending of the pandemic, I am reining spending and borrowing back in to reduce the nation’s overall debt”. How can he appear to be both a spendthrift and a miser at the same time? First, he has more money to spend than he had planned for, because the economy has had a sharp growth spurt which has brought in more tax revenue than anticipated. Second, he has used the familiar sleight of hand by which apparently new announcements have been combined with existing budgets to make them look larger. Third, the public sector pay rise will have to be paid for out of departmental budgets which (with the exception of health) have already been forced to take cuts. For most of the public services provided by central and local government, this budget will look like the return of austerity. The argument Sunak will make is that, at about 100% of GDP, public debt is now at an unsustainable level. Future generations, he will say, should not have to pay for present spending. If debt is not brought down, the markets will punish the government by raising the cost of borrowing. So the government must reduce the deficit (that is, the borrowing required this year, which contributes to the overall level of debt), which means cutting spending. Higher spending would stoke inflation – already on the rise – forcing the Bank of England to raise interest rates and thereby choke off the recovery. The problem is that none of these sentences is true. Public debt is indeed higher than in recent years, but it was more than double the current level after the second world war, when the economy grew particularly strongly. The ratio of debt to GDP is not a significant number, whether 100% or any other. Economically what matters is the cost of servicing the debt, and the value of the things that government borrowing is paying for. Due to near-zero rates, the interest payments the government makes on its debt are now at their second lowest level in 70 years, at just 6% of tax receipts. The Bank of England now owns 37% of all government gilts, and repays the profit it makes on the interest back to the Treasury. (This has saved the government as much as £100bn over the last decade.) The Bank can continue to finance government debt at low interest rates, which means that financial institutions will continue to buy UK bonds: there is no sign of demand for them falling away. The government therefore still has room for further sustainable borrowing. More important, it has many highly productive investments for which it should borrow. Last week it published its “net zero” strategy to cut UK greenhouse gas emissions. But as many environmental organisations pointed out, the spending it has allocated will not achieve its stated aims. We know that green investment – in areas like insulating homes and improving public transport – has multiple benefits. It not only cuts emissions but creates jobs and improves productivity – and in some cases can reduce poverty and tackle air pollution, too. It is particularly odd that the Treasury should claim (as it did in its Net Zero Review last week) that future generations will not wish to be burdened with the debt for such spending. It would seem much more likely that they will be very grateful for spending that helps reduce the ravages of the climate crisis they would otherwise experience. The government proclaims its commitment to “levelling up”, the reduction of geographic and other inequalities. But here, too, public investment is needed. The reason why so many parts of the country feel economically “left behind” is because the private sector by and large doesn’t want to invest in them – it much prefers London and the south-east. So any serious programme of levelling up is going to need government investment to fill that gap – particularly in areas such as transport infrastructure and new industries, many of them green, which can both create jobs and make places more attractive for private investment. The government says that it wishes to improve the UK’s infrastructure. It has even set up a national infrastructure bank for the purpose – though without giving it adequate funds. But it should be concerned, too, about the country’s “social infrastructure” – the services that also enable an economy to expand but often get overlooked by mainstream economics: health, education, childcare and social care. These make the workforce more productive and the latter allow women, in particular, to work more hours (creating more tax receipts in the process). There are very simple economic principles at work here. Investment and spending generate economic multipliers that reduce unemployment and help income growth. Borrowing that supports growth will therefore pay for itself over time. Despite what the chancellor might say, it is only such growth that will bring down the debt. We know from the experience of the last decade that trying to reduce government deficits by cutting spending is self-defeating: by withdrawing demand – particularly investment – austerity slows the recovery, and therefore fails to bring in the tax receipts that can enable borrowing to come down. The economy is not like a household, as Margaret Thatcher insisted; debt will fall much more quickly if the government invests than if it does not. But what of inflation? The chancellor is bound to invoke its spectre. But as the governor of the Bank of England has acknowledged, the current spurt of inflation has temporary causes: higher global energy prices and global supply-chains shocks. It is not the result of spiralling wage demands of the 1970s kind. In the end the only way to defeat inflationary pressures is to invest in productive capacity. As more than 70 academic economists and nine thinktanks told the chancellor in an open letter over the weekend, it would be economic folly to cut public investment and spending just as the recovery is stalling. Sunak will say that he is bound by his fiscal rules. But like every other chancellor in recent times, he has invented these rules himself, to suit his own political ends. Many economists now argue that it is time to replace such rules with more sensible fiscal mechanisms. And what are Sunak’s political ends? The answer is not hard to find. After 18 months in which big spending and government intervention have proved essential and successful, the rhetoric of sound public finances acts like a comfort blanket for Conservative MPs and party members made anxious by tax increases. Sunak is following where many chancellors have gone before: pitching for the party leadership under the guise of fiscal responsibility. It may – or may not – be good politics. It is terrible economics. Michael Jacobs is professor of political economy at the University of Sheffield, and managing editor of NewEconomyBrief.net",,Opinion
2021-08-03T18:00:03Z,"Boris Johnson ‘missing in action’ ahead of vital climate talks, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/03/boris-johnson-missing-in-action-ahead-of-vital-climate-talks-says-keir-starmer,"Vital UN climate talks are at risk of failure because Boris Johnson is “missing in action” while his climate spokesperson talks about freezing bread, Keir Starmer has warned. The Labour leader said there is already “dystopia” all around caused by climate breakdown, but Johnson’s ambition to tackle the scale of the crisis is irresponsibly small. The UK will host the Cop26 summit in Glasgow this November, where countries must set out plans for drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for this decade, to avoid catastrophic and irreversible changes to the climate. “As host of the summit, the world is looking to Britain to deliver,” writes Starmer in today’s Guardian. “We cannot afford to miss this moment, but I fear we will.” The government was off-track to meet its own climate targets, while ministers scrapped measures to reduce emissions such as the green homes grant insulation scheme, and were allowing high-carbon development, such as a potential new coalmine, Starmer wrote. The prime minister was delivering “a cabaret of soundbites” rather than the global leadership needed, he charged. “All over the world, unusual weather events show that dystopia is not on the horizon. It is here today, all around us,” he wrote. “At this vital moment, our prime minister is missing in action, while his climate spokesperson is busy advising people to freeze their leftover bread. When the issues at stake are so large, it really is irresponsible for the response to be so small.” Downing Street has faced mounting criticism over its conduct of Cop26, the outcome of which some observers described as “hanging in the balance”. The government’s host year kicked off with scientists chastising ministers over plans for a new coalmine in Cumbria, while diplomats despaired over the decision to slash overseas aid, considered a disastrous signal to other countries as a crucial goal of Cop26 will be raising $100bn a year for the developing world. The prime minister’s spokesperson for Cop26, Allegra Stratton, has also made headlines recently, appearing to reject electric cars, suggesting people could join the Green party, and saying the government’s 2050 net zero emissions target was too far off. Diplomatic eyebrows were also raised when John Kerry, the US climate envoy, made a major speech in Kew Gardens that no government minister attended. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Boris Johnson has mastered the dark art of setting bold long-term targets but ducked implementing policies that will make a difference. He needs to start delivering on the tough choices needed for a successful low-carbon economy. As host of the Glasgow summit, the world’s eyes are on us to prove there is a solution to the climate emergency. If we fail, the summit fails. So far the omens are not good.” Starmer told the Guardian in an interview that the impression was one of a government long on climate rhetoric but short on action, and hampered by Johnson’s own character. “[Success at Cop26] requires leadership, diplomacy and coalition-building. But the prime minister’s reputation on the global stage is not good – he is known for rule-breaking, rather than coalition-building,” he said. Starmer said he was moved to intervene as he began a two-day visit to Glasgow, to meet members of a local youth forum and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, to discuss young people’s perspectives on the climate crisis and Labour’s plans for green investment. “Sitting by and watching this government fail to lead would be the worst possible thing Labour could do. If we can goad them into stronger leadership that would be better for Britain and the planet.” “He [Johnson] should be leading from the front,” said Starmer. He said Labour – like US president Joe Biden – would have more credible and serious ambition, with a £30bn investment in a green recovery from the pandemic. Whitehall insiders said the government was working hard behind the scenes on the talks, with Cop president-designate Alok Sharma taking on a punishing travel schedule to key countries. Last week, ministers from more than 50 countries met in London, with some progress on forging relationships among countries that have been unable to meet in person for more than 18 months, but disappointment on efforts to make a bold commitment to phase out coal. Some major countries – including China and India – have also yet to produce plans for their emissions cuts to 2030, a crucial goal for Cop26. Some participants in the talks praised the government for staying firm on its target of holding global heating to 1.5C, and said there was still time to craft a deal that would set the world on a path to meeting the 2015 Paris agreement, and staving off the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Early next week, amid recent extreme weather around the world, the stakes for Cop26 will be raised higher still, when scientists produce a long-expected landmark report on the climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected on Monday 9 August to deliver the starkest warning yet that the world is heading for widespread devastation unless emissions are brought down sharply in the next decade.",Cop26; Climate crisis; Climate science; Boris Johnson; Keir Starmer; Politics; Environment; UK news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Scotland,Environment
2021-05-05T05:00:07Z,Pension funds urged to help UK reach net zero climate goals,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/05/pension-funds-urged-to-help-uk-reach-net-zero-climate-goals,"Pension funds must set a target of net zero emissions for their investments if the UK is to meet its climate goals, influential figures in climate activism have urged. Many people are unaware of whether their pensions funds are invested in fossil fuels or high-carbon activities, and even companies that have publicly committed to reaching net zero emissions may have pension fund investments that are still wedded to high-carbon businesses. As the UK prepares to host the UN climate talks Cop26 in Glasgow this November, several prominent climate campaigners have written to the Guardian to urge pensions companies to sign up to green investment principles. The signatories are: Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris agreement; Nigel Topping, the UK government’s business champion for Cop26; Richard Curtis, the film-maker and co-founder of the campaign group Make My Money Matter; and Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of the charity Business in the Community. “[Cop26] is a unique opportunity for Britain to showcase how our financial system can be leveraged to tackle climate change on the global stage,” they wrote. “To achieve this, we must all commit to making our money matter, starting with our pensions.” While an increasing number of companies are aligning their business activities with the UK’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, pension investments are lagging behind. “Why is it that a company working hard to achieve net zero in their operations continues to invest millions into a pension which does the opposite?” the signatories asked. They urged all companies to sign up to the green pensions charter, which requires businesses to ensure their company pension scheme achieves net zero emissions by 2050, as well as setting short-term targets to halve the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their portfolios by 2030. Emissions targets for the next decade are crucial to ensure that the goals of the Paris agreement, of holding global temperature rises well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C, can be met. Some big pension funds have already committed to the green pensions charter principles, including Scottish Widows, Aviva, Nest, the BT pension scheme, and some local government pension schemes. About £400bn is now invested in 15 schemes that are aligned with the net zero and 2030 targets. The UK pensions sector accounts for about £2.6tn in funds, so any shift towards investing in lower-carbon portfolios would have a strong effect in investment and business. The signatories wrote: “If we want to deliver healthy returns for our retirements, as well as ensure a healthy world for our grandchildren, 2021 needs to be the year that we unleash the power of our pensions … What’s the point in saving for retirement in a world on fire?” Individuals can write to their pension scheme managers to ask whether their investment portfolios are exposed to climate risk, and shareholders can vote at company annual general meetings. Pension fund investors can wield substantial influence over the companies whose shares they hold, and their long-term outlook means that the risks of the climate crisis are having an increasing impact on their projections. The UK government is considering strengthening financial disclosure requirements on publicly listed companies, that would require them to assess and publish details of the risks they face from climate breakdown. Finance and business will be key to success at Cop26, and Topping is leading a Race to Zero, by which companies commit to a mid-century net zero target and emissions limits for the next decade. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England and a UN climate envoy, recently announced a new initiative called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, under which banks and financial institutions, including Barclays, HSBC and the insurer Axa, have signed up to similar commitments.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Environment; Cop26; Pensions industry; Business; Pensions; Money; Consumer affairs; Fossil fuels; Fossil fuel divestment; Ethical money,Environment
2021-05-24T14:51:36Z,Britain’s electric car charging network boosted by £300m funding,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/24/britain-electric-car-charging-network-ofgem-points,"Britain’s energy regulator has approved a £300m investment spree to help triple the number of ultra-rapid electric car charge points across the country, as part of efforts to accelerate the UK’s shift to clean energy. Ofgem has given the green light for energy network companies to invest in more than 200 low-carbon projects across the country over the next two years, including the installation of 1,800 new ultra-rapid car charge points for motorway service stations and a further 1,750 charge points in towns and cities. The investment will be undertaken by regional network companies to benefit urban areas including Glasgow, Kirkwall, Warrington, Llandudno, York and Truro. It will also cover rural areas, with some charging points aimed at commuters at train stations in north and mid-Wales. The regulator hopes the extra investment to make car charging points more convenient will help to address motorist “range anxiety”, which is frequently mentioned as a key reason why drivers are wary about choosing an electric vehicle over a fossil fuel model. The UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and phase out hybrid vehicles from 2035 as part of its plan to reduce road transport emissions. However, only 11% of new car registrations last year were for ultra-low emission cars. The regulator’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said drivers “need to be confident that they can charge their car quickly when they need to” if the UK hoped for a “rapid take up” of electric cars, which “will be vital if Britain is to hit its climate change targets”. The transport minister Rachel Maclean said the investment would add to the 500,000 electric cars already on the UK’s roads “as drivers continue to make the switch to cleaner, greener vehicles”. The spending initiative, which will add 65p to customer bills for the next two years, will also include new projects to upgrade Britain’s electricity grids so they can power more low-carbon heating and connect to new low carbon energy projects such as windfarms and solar arrays. Brearley said the investments were a “down payment” on the £40bn of green investment that is expected over the next seven years to power the UK towards its ambition to cut carbon emissions to net zero in the next 30 years. The CBI, the business lobby group, said on Monday the UK could unlock nearly £700bn in growth opportunities by 2030 by decarbonising the global economy and growing trade as it emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. Alongside the regulator’s £300m spending programme, the government has revealed a £166m fund to support new green technologies. The cash injection will include £60m to help develop low-carbon hydrogen, £20m to help roll out projects to capture the carbon emissions from heavy industry, and a further £20m for fund research into “industrial decarbonisation” run by Heriot-Watt University. The funding for the government’s green industrial revolution will also include £37.5m to help the UK become a leader in technology which can remove carbon emissions from the air. One so-called “direct air capture” project to win government support was put forward by the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which plans to use the reactor’s heat to run the carbon capture equipment. The energy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the “major cash boost” would target the UK’s most polluting industries to encourage “the technologies we need to rein in our emissions and transition to a green economy” while reducing costs for businesses and boosting investment and jobs. “Just six months ago, the prime minister set out a clear 10-point plan for creating and supporting up to 250,000 British jobs as we level up and build back greener from the pandemic. Today we’re boosting our armoury for the fight against climate change and backing innovators and businesses to create green jobs right across the United Kingdom,” she said. • This article was amended on 26 May 2021. Sizewell C nuclear plant plans to use the reactor’s heat to run carbon capture equipment, not its extra electricity as stated in an earlier version.","Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Environment; Motoring; Technology; Motoring; Money; UK news; Scotland; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Ethical and green living; Travel and transport; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Energy; Fossil fuels",Environment
2021-08-12T07:00:11Z,Fairness will be key to successfully tackling the climate crisis | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/12/fairness-key-tackling-climate-crisis-inequality-pandemic,"The message from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change could hardly be clearer. Business as usual means global temperatures will rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within two decades. Preventing that happening will require a massive and rapid drop in the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted. Diagnosis is the easy bit. The question is not whether human beings are on a collision course with nature but how to use the time left to bring about the far-reaching economic changes required to avoid catastrophe. The response to the pandemic has shown what’s possible in an emergency. Governments hit the panic button as hospitals filled up with Covid-19 patients. A combination of private and public sector action brought forward vaccines much more speedily than anybody could have imagined in the early months of 2020. Finance ministries in rich countries spent freely to prevent a medical crisis becoming an economic and social crisis. The imperative was to save lives, not balance budgets. But it would be unwise to assume the response to the two crises will be exactly the same. Governments reacted to Covid-19 by imposing restrictions on personal freedom unprecedented in peacetime. In theory Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron or Mario Draghi could insist that a new range of curbs are needed in a war against climate change. In reality, they will be wary of going down the compulsion route, not least because the experience of the pandemic is that there is only so much the public will tolerate. Lockdowns work for a while, but then people chafe at the restrictions. Telling them they have to stop doing things they enjoy – foreign travel, for example – will be a last resort for politicians. July was Heathrow’s busiest month since the start of the pandemic. Britain, France and Italy each account for about 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, and it seems unlikely that they will insist on their citizens making sacrifices that are not matched by those in other countries. The yellow vest fuel protesters have already shown Macron how unpopular action to tackle climate change can be. What’s true for democracies is true for autocracies as well. China is by far the world’s biggest polluter, accounting for 28% of global emissions, but its rapid economic growth and political stability has relied on migration from the fields to the factories, where people earn more and owning a car is a symbol of success. So while the Chinese Communist party is aware of the risks of climate change and is investing heavily in renewables, it also fears slower growth will lead to higher unemployment and political discontent. Hence China is building new coal-fired power plants at the same time as it is home to nearly half the world’s electric passenger vehicles and one in three of the world’s solar panels. Most African countries are at an earlier stage of development than China and for them growth is not a luxury but the means to tackle hunger and infant mortality. Johnson won’t get very far at the November Cop26 conference in Glasgow telling poor people that they will have to make sacrifices in order to save the planet, especially in light of the decision to cut Britain’s aid budget. It is not going to be easy to replicate the urgency with which countries responded to the pandemic. Despite the floods and the forest fires, there is always a temptation for politicians to put off tough decisions in the belief that they have more time to act. Rishi Sunak is cavilling at the upfront costs of hitting the UK government’s net zero target. Nor does Keir Starmer’s £30bn green investment plan match the scale of the challenge. The lesson of the past is that smart people can come up with solutions to seemingly intractable problems given the right incentives. Putting economies on a climate-war footing would accelerate technological change, replicating what happened between 1939 and 45, a period that saw advances in the use of flu vaccines, jet engines, computers and blood plasma transfusions. For that to happen there needs to be a different sort of political economy, based around redistribution, taxing pollution rather than jobs, investment in innovation, and cooperation between countries. Donald Trump would never have bought into this agenda, but Joe Biden might. Glasgow will be a test of political will. The commitments made in Paris six years ago are consistent with temperatures rising by 3C, and need to be strengthened. A sign of multilateral intent would be plans for a steadily rising carbon tax, the phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies and the naming and shaming of the most significant greenhouse gas emitters. Inequality, both within and between countries, remains the most serious impediment to tackling climate change and progress will be slower unless it is addressed. The architects of the New Deal in the 1930s understood that responding to the Great Depression was not just about spending money on public works and providing jobs for the unemployed; it was also about giving more power to organised labour, curbing Wall Street and imposing higher taxes on the rich. The New Deal was merely part of a package that included full employment and the US decision to fend off the threat of communism in western Europe through the redistributive mechanism of Marshall aid. Updating the New Deal for the modern age requires a green dimension. It also needs a social dimension to ensure buy-in from the low-paid people and those likely to lose their jobs in the inevitable low-carbon shakeout. If governments want people to switch from gas boilers to heat pumps they are going to have to foot the bill. If they want poor countries to skip the fossil-fuel phase and move straight to energy systems based on renewables, they are going to have to come up with a modern version of the Marshall plan. Building back greener means building back fairer.

2021-08-18T11:30:08Z,UK government ‘failing to help local leaders achieve net zero’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/18/uk-government-failing-to-help-local-leaders-achieve-net-zero,"The government is failing to provide local leaders with the investment and resources they need to achieve net zero, according to the mayor of Newham. Rokhsana Fiaz, the first woman to become a directly elected mayor of a London borough, said her council’s “appetite [to achieve net zero] is high: we’ve got the knowhow and we know where the problems are” but, she said, the government isn’t providing local leaders with what they need. Fiaz said that the government is “all talk” when it comes to fulfilling its promise that the country will be net zero by 2050 and will have achieved 78% reduction in emissions by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. “We get all these grand statements without any significant material resource for local government to be able to really mobilise practical measures that can help,” she said. “One of the things that I have major problems with, with regard to the government’s talk about embracing climate emergency response, is that it’s not putting its money where its mouth is,” added Fiaz, whose Newham borough is one of the most deprived and diverse in Britain. Johnson had claimed his government would achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 with policies such as stripping out gas boilers and switching to electric or hydrogen cars. But a Treasury review of the costs has been delayed since the spring with Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said to be increasingly concerned that the costs would make the policy politically toxic in the “red wall” seats won by the Conservatives in December 2019. Fiaz said the government is “basically not prepared to give us the £1 per person, per day” her borough needs to accelerate its response to the climate emergency. Instead, she said, Johnson has allowed his green agenda to be thrown into chaos by fears that the costs could play badly with working-class families in newly won Tory seats. “This is a travesty because the working class in the UK’s most deprived communities are harmed by climate emergency more than any other [UK] people,” she said. “This is a social justice issue and the government needs to stop using the working class as a political football to kick around and a convenient excuse to not to live up to its word.” New research by UK100, the cross-party network for locally elected leaders in the UK who have pledged to switch to 100% clean energy by 2050, has found that with the right kind of public investment, more than 2,700,000 good green jobs would be created in the move to a low carbon economy: significantly more than the 1,900,000 currently employed in the furlough scheme. Many of them will be in the manufacturing heartlands or red wall areas. The Guardian contacted directly elected mayors from Cornwall to Edinburgh. Most called for additional central government funding and powers to enable them to achieve net zero in their communities by 2045, five years earlier than the target set by the UK government. In some cases deadlines were even earlier. In many authorities, local ambition is significantly outstripping that of the national government. The quickest way for government to achieve net zero targets, argued Jamie Driscoll, the mayor for North of Tyne, would be by devolving funds and powers to mayoral combined authorities. “We are efficient and know how to make things happen quickly in our local areas,” he said. “We need government to match our energy and ambition … We must make government understand what levelling up really means.” Peter Taylor, the mayor of Watford, said funding cuts made it hard for local authorities to fulfil their ambitions on climate and sustainability. “Before Covid, we saw our funding from central government cut by 70% over a 10-year period,” he said. “As a local authority we are doing everything we can to reduce the negative impact we are having on the planet but given those funding cuts from central government, we ultimately cannot do everything.” Most of the country’s directly elected mayors have ambitious plans for their area and believe that transitioning to a green economy will be key to their success. Norma Redfearn, the mayor of North Tyneside, pointed out that “the low carbon economy is predicted to grow four times faster than the rest of the economy over the next decade, providing a wealth of opportunity”. Reskilling will be a key part of that: retraining workers in retrofitting, or electric vehicles. Tracy Brabin, the mayor of West Yorkshire, has set up a green skills partnership and Andy Street, mayor of the West Midlands, is creating a green skills plan in order to work out how the industrial base can decarbonise. The Bristol mayor, Marvin Rees, is calling for “new powers for local authorities to enable the transition locally, and ensure that national bodies, in the public sector or regulated industries, plan the energy transition locally – for example, to create local strategic energy bodies to do this”. His area has a wide range of green jobs, “from advanced engineering and renewables to waste management”. But in order to carry out its One City Climate Strategy – which would decarbonise the city and create 10,000 jobs – it would need an estimated £9.2bn. And Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, told the Guardian that the government must ensure that cities and regions within the UK are given the powers and funding to effectively support the national emission reduction targets, and to deliver the bold changes needed in their local areas. He announced London’s Green New Deal Fund last year and argues that “climate action will drive our economic recovery, create a fairer London and boost job creation efforts, rather than damage them”. A total of 32 mayors and council leaders from across the UK recently co-signed a UK100 statement calling for a power shift from Whitehall to help local and regional authorities transition to net zero across sectors including energy, transport and the built environment. More than 60 leaders signed a second UK100 statement: the net zero pledge to go faster than central government targets. Dan Jarvis, the mayor of South Yorkshire city region, told the Guardian: “The scale of investment is simply inadequate in relation to the threats we are facing, and the potential benefits of action.” “The climate crisis is ultimately a much greater threat than Covid, and we are running out of time to deal with it. The pandemic – which is an economic crisis as well as a health one – should be treated as a precious opportunity to create fundamental change, rather than return to the status quo … Green investment will create jobs and boost the economy while ensuring that the massive public spending we’ll need over next few years actually produces a lasting public good.”",Greenhouse gas emissions; UK news; Environment; Climate crisis; Local government; Mayoral elections; Local politics; Politics; Society,Environment
2021-12-09T11:30:09Z,How will humanity endure the climate crisis? I asked an acclaimed sci-fi writer | Daniel Aldana Cohen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/09/climate-crisis-kim-stanley-robinson,"To really grasp the present, we need to imagine the future – then look back from it to better see the now. The angry climate kids do this naturally. The rest of us need to read good science fiction. A great place to start is Kim Stanley Robinson. Robinson is one of the most brilliant writers of the genre. During Covid quarantine, I read 11 of his books, culminating in his instant classic The Ministry for the Future, which imagines several decades of climate politics starting this decade. The first lesson of his books is obvious: climate is the story. Compared with the magnitude of the crisis, this year’s United Nations climate summit, Cop26, was a poorly planned pool party where half the guests were sweating in jeans, having forgotten their swimming suits. If you’re reading this, you probably know what climate science portends – and that nothing discussed in Glasgow was within rocket range of adequate. What Ministry and other Robinson books do is make us slow down the apocalyptic highlight reel, letting the story play in human time for years, decades, centuries. The screen doesn’t fade to black; instead we watch people keep dying, and coping, and struggling to shape a future – often gloriously. I spoke to Robinson recently for an episode of the podcast The Dig. He told me that he wants leftists to set aside their differences, and put a “time stamp on [their] political view” that recognizes how urgent things are. Looking back from 2050 leaves little room for abstract idealism. Progressives need to form “a united front,” he told me. “It’s an all-hands-on-deck situation; species are going extinct and biomes are dying. The catastrophes are here and now, so we need to make political coalitions.” The point of Robinson’s decades of sci-fi isn’t to simply counsel “vote blue no matter who.” He told me he remains a proud and longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). But he does want leftists – and everyone else – to take the climate emergency more seriously. He thinks every big decision, every technological option, every political opportunity, warrants climate-oriented scientific scrutiny. Global justice demands nothing less. Robinson’s “all-hands” call is even more challenging on technology and economics than on electoral campaigns. He wants to legitimize geoengineering, even in forms as radical as blasting limestone dust into the atmosphere for a few years to temporarily dim the heat of the sun. As Ministry dramatizes, and as he reminded me, there’s a good chance that a country being devastated by climate breakdown will try this, whether it’s authorized by the international community or not. More broadly, Robinson seems to be urging all of us to treat every possible technological intervention – from expanding nuclear energy, to pumping meltwater out from under glaciers, to dumping iron filings in the ocean – from a strictly scientific perspective: reject dogma, evaluate the evidence, ignore the profit motive. It’s an admirable view. And Robinson is no blinkered techno-optimist: some of the most compelling characters in his novels use science to reject swaths of technological development. He doesn’t necessarily want to pursue every form of geoengineering that we investigate, but he wants us to debate them. As he put it to me: “science good, capitalism bad”. He sees the development of the scientific method as a phenomenon as universal to the human condition as art. In his ice age novel Shaman, one character invents a new kind of ankle brace while another invents a new kind of cave painting. I’m attracted to this vision. But I’m not convinced that the science v capitalism binary is as clear in practice as Robinson asserts. We live in a world where capitalist states and giant companies largely control science. (Just consider the moral insanity and capitalist logic of global vaccine apartheid.) Some of the biggest backers of technology to capture carbon and store it underground are oil companies like Exxon. Yes, we need to consider technologies with an open mind. That includes a frank assessment of how the interests of the powerful will shape how technologies develop. Robinson could learn from the positions of activists of color, especially Indigenous and environmental justice groups, who fight against “false solutions” based on centuries of exploitation and sacrifice. Robinson’s imagined future suggests a short-term solution that fits his dreams of a democratic, scientific politics: planning, of both the economy and planet. It’s a grandiose imperative, but the underlying insight is sound, and it’s borrowed from Robinson’s reading of ecological economics. That field’s premise is that the economy is embedded in nature – that its fundamental rules aren’t supply and demand, but the laws of physics, chemistry, biology. The upshot of Robinson’s science fiction is understanding that grand ecologies and human economies are always interdependent. Robinson believes that once progressives internalize the insight that the economy is a social construct just like anything else, they can determine – based on the contemporary balance of political forces, ecological needs, and available tools – the most efficient methods for bringing carbon and capital into closer alignment. Success will snowball; we’ll democratically plan more and more of the eco-economy. Seen from Mars, then, the problem of 21st-century climate economics is to sync public and private systems of capital with the ecological system of carbon. Robinson’s elegant solution, as rendered in Ministry, is carbon quantitative easing. The idea is that central banks invent a new currency; to earn the carbon coins, institutions must show that they’re sucking excess carbon down from the sky. In his novel, this happens thanks to a series of meetings between United Nations technocrats and central bankers. But the technocrats only win the arguments because there’s enough rage, protest and organizing in the streets to force the bankers’ hand. Robinson thus gets that climate politics are fundamentally the politics of investment – extremely big investments. As he put it to me, carbon quantitative easing isn’t the “silver bullet solution,” just one of several green investment mechanisms we need to experiment with. Robinson shares the great anarchist dream. “Everybody on the planet has an equal amount of power, and comfort, and wealth,” he said. “It’s an obvious goal” but there’s no shortcut. Moving in that direction, he argues, requires radical pragmatism – preventing ecological collapse, while ratcheting up public control of investment. We just can’t know in advance what works best. In his political economy, like his imagined settling of Mars, Robinson tries to think like a bench scientist – an experimentalist, wary of unifying theories, eager for many groups to try many things. And there’s something liberating about Robinson’s commitment to the scientific method: reasonable people can shed their prejudices, consider all the options and act strategically. This blurring of science and politics is what draws me to his work, even when I (often) disagree with his conclusions. Like the great socialist film-maker Ken Loach, Robinson is a leftist who portrays debate as one of the greatest activities in organized social life. It’s in that sense that Robinson’s optimistic opposition between science and capitalism is most compelling: not beakers versus banks, but social action based on thoughtful discussion of social and ecological needs instead of the murderous supremacy of profit. Of course, there are limits to people’s good sense. Robinson gets that too. The years ahead will be brutal. In Ministry, tens of millions of people die in disasters – and that’s in a scenario that Robinson portrays as relatively optimistic. And when things get that bad, people take up arms. In Ministry’s imagined future, the rise of weaponized drones allows shadowy environmentalists to attack and kill fossil capitalists. Many – including myself – have used the phrase “eco-terrorism” to describe that violence. Robinson pushed back when we talked. “What if you call that resistance to capitalism realism?” he asked. “What if you call that, well, ‘Freedom fighters’?” To be clear, Robinson insists that he doesn’t condone the violence depicted in his book; he simply can’t imagine a realistic account of 21st century climate politics in which it doesn’t occur. He has spoken approvingly of Andreas Malm’s book How to Blow Up a Pipeline, which urges sabotage against the fossil fuel industry. Malm writes that it’s shocking how little political violence there has been around climate change so far, given how brutally the harms will be felt in communities of color, especially in the global south, who bear no responsibility for the cataclysm, and where political violence has been historically effective in anticolonial struggles. In Ministry, there’s a lot of violence, but mostly off-stage. We see enough to appreciate Robinson’s consistent vision of most people as basically thoughtful: the armed struggle is vicious, but its leaders are reasonable, strategic. And the implications are straightforward: there will be escalating violence, escalating state repression and increasing political instability. We must plan for that too. And maybe that’s the tension that is Ministry’s greatest lesson for climate politics today. No document that could win consensus at a UN climate summit will be anywhere near enough to prevent catastrophic warming. We can only keep up with history, and clearly see what needs to be done, by tearing our minds out of the present and imagining more radical future vantage points. If millions of people around the world can do that, in an increasingly violent era of climate disasters, those people could generate enough good projects to add up to something like a rational plan – and buy us enough time to stabilize the climate, while wresting power from the 1%. Robinson’s optimistic view is that human nature is fundamentally thoughtful, and that it will save us – that the social process of arguing and politicking, with minds as open as we can manage, is a project older than capitalism, and one that will eventually outlive it. It’s a perspective worth thinking about – so long as we’re also organizing.

2019-09-14T10:00:54Z,Lib Dems set out radical agenda for tackling climate emergency,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/14/lib-dems-set-out-radical-agenda-for-tackling-climate-emergency,"Citizens’ assemblies will decide what action should be taken on the climate crisis, the Treasury’s ability to stymie green measures will be neutralised and the Green Investment Bank will be revived under proposals set to be key planks of the Liberal Democrats’ general election bid. Along with sweeping reform of Whitehall, including bringing back a department of climate change, local government would be given new powers to cut emissions, there would be a moratorium on airport expansion and an end to fracking, and the UK would achieve net-zero carbon status by 2045 – five years sooner than the current government goal. “Moving to net-zero is a complete game-changer,” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem spokesperson for the environment and climate change, told the Guardian. “The whole of government and society need to understand the need to get to net-zero – everything we do needs to be seen in terms of that target.” Under the proposals to be presented to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth this weekend, a new minister, who will attend cabinet, would be appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and oversee policy across departments to ensure it meets the zero-carbon pledge. “The biggest hurdle [to climate policies] was always the Treasury,” said Hobhouse. Soon after Theresa May unveiled her zero-carbon target this summer, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, claimed it would cost too much. “Having a chief secretary to keep reminding the chancellor of the need to get to net-zero is key,” said Hobhouse. To gain public support for urgent action on emissions, the Lib Dems would convene citizens’ assemblies across the country to debate new measures. These would include ways to ensure a massive expansion of electric vehicles and better public transport, and how to encourage new technology such as heating homes with hydrogen instead of gas. Councils would also be given greater powers over planning, for instance to promote electric vehicles, cycling and walking. “Citizens’ assemblies would not replace politicians’ decision-making, but would inform the options,” said Hobhouse. “We need decisive action – the government is not doing anything, they are dithering.” The Green Investment Bank, created under the coalition government, was sold off under George Osborne. Under a Lib Dem government, a replacement would be set up with public money, and have the powers to borrow money from the private sector. Hobhouse said Brexit was getting in the way of tackling the climate emergency: “Brexit means having less money, and it is very counterproductive. We need international cooperation – climate change is a global problem.” The Lib Dems would end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 – 10 years sooner than the Conservatives – and stop fracking. There would also be more support for onshore wind and solar, which Hobhouse said the Conservatives had “stopped in their tracks” by drastically changing incentive schemes and planning laws. Green campaigning groups, keen that the climate crisis should not be overshadowed by Brexit as a general election looms, welcomed the Lib Dems’ focus. “Our country may be divided over Brexit, but it is not divided over the need for action on the nature and climate emergency – polling is consistently showing that concern over climate is at an all-time high and a large majority support urgent action,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK. “Now we need the climate and nature crisis prioritised at the highest level of government, and billions in new funding, to deliver on the rhetoric. We must stop things like airport expansion that make meeting net-zero even more difficult.” Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the government’s net-zero target currently lacking anywhere near enough policy to back it up, we’d like to see all parties thinking about what they’d do to make sure the target is actually reached. It’s no good talking about a net-zero future while pursuing a programme of roadbuilding, airport expansion and fracking.”",Liberal Democrats; Liberal Democrat conference; Politics; UK news; Environment; Climate crisis,Politics
2021-08-10T06:00:12Z,"UK’s green economy nearly four times larger than manufacturing sector, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/uks-green-economy-four-times-larger-than-manufacturing-sector-says-report,"The UK’s low carbon economy is now worth more than £200bn, almost four times the size of the country’s manufacturing sector, with growth expected to accelerate in the coming years, according to new analysis. Despite what experts say has been lacklustre and patchy support from central government, the analysis found more than 75,000 businesses from wind turbine manufacturers to recycling plants employ more than 1.2 million people in the green economy. Experts say the sector not only has the potential to help tackle the climate crisis but also create sustainable jobs and improve people’s quality of life – with cleaner transport, reduced air pollution and better insulated homes. But they warn that if the UK is to make the necessary rapid and fair transition to a low carbon economy, the government must mobilise all sections of society – from trade unions to local authorities, community groups to businesses – behind a “national programme of transformation”. Prof Patrick Devine-Wright, of Exeter University and a lead author with the IPCC, said: “We need everybody to pull together or we have no chance of meeting these ambitious targets and staving off what are going to be really, really damaging climate consequences.” He said in the coming years many day-to-day aspects of people’s lives would need to change, from the way homes are heated to how people get around town and cities, from what they eat to where they work. “We need nothing less than a societal process of transformation in place alongside this vision of new technology, devices and infrastructures,” said Devine-Wright. “Unless we connect all those dots up, I don’t think it is going to happen in the timescale that is required.” Today’s research shows that the low carbon sector is worth £205.7bn in the UK. Using a similar methodology, kMatrix found the manufacturing sector is worth £55.6bn and the construction sector is worth £132.9bn. Wind, wave and tidal, and solar power have all grown rapidly in recent years, according to the data, which shows that overall the low carbon sector grew by 7.4% during the financial year 2018/19 to 2019/20 and contracted by -9.0% during 2019/20 to 2020/21 but is expected to bounce back in the post-Covid recovery. Over the next week, the Guardian will highlight low carbon schemes and projects around the UK – from regenerative farmers to private recycling companies, via hydrogen jet fuel, net zero whisky, retrofitting builders, and hemp milk – showing how they are not only helping reduce emissions but also improving communities, creating jobs and improving living conditions. But the current ad hoc nature of the low carbon economy, with some sectors and regions racing ahead while others are being left behind, has raised fears that existing inequalities could be entrenched unless the government sets out a clear plan. Experts say trade unions, local authorities and communities must be given a direct role in the process, especially in areas that are dependent on high carbon industries, to ensure the move to a green economy is rapid and fair. Hannah Martin, of campaign group Green New Deal UK, said there was now “a rich tapestry of climate focused community activity” with “people coming together to build resilient communities that will be the blueprint for how we live in the future”. She highlighted a range of projects, from communal food gardens to regional home retrofit programmes. But she warned: “Change at the community level cannot be done in isolation from a holistic strategy at the speed and scale required from the central government, which must both provide the regulatory support and finance required for local communities to innovate and create responses to the climate crisis that are unique to their situation and experience. “ The UK government has been widely criticised for its failure to set out detailed policy proposals to meet its ambitious climate targets. Nick Molho, the executive director of Aldersgate Group, an alliance of business and policy leaders, said that for the net zero transition to deliver jobs to local communities across the UK, the Government’s upcoming net zero strategy should include close collaboration with local authorities and community groups. Molho called for a UK-wide body to “support the workforce as the UK economy moves to net zero emissions” backed by by local transition bodies – made up of local industry, government, unions, and educational sector representatives. “[They] could be tasked with carefully planning the changes needed in their areas to support a successful transition to net zero emissions,” he said. During the buildup to the key climate meeting in Glasgow later this year, ministers have faced widespread criticism for a string of failures that include trying to open a new coalmine, issuing new licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, pushing ahead with a £27bn road-building plan, scrapping the green homes grant insulation programme, and cutting overseas aid. Last month, the government’s own climate advisers criticised the lack of policy detail, with the chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, Chris Stark, saying “progress was illusory”. Ed Miliband, who is heading Labour’s climate team, said that the failure of the government to grasp the challenge and opportunities offered by moving rapidly to a low carbon economy was holding back communities across the UK. “Tackling the climate emergency could transform our society and our economy, creating new jobs wherever people live, growing British industries and making our businesses more competitive,” the shadow business secretary said. “It could clean up our air, protect nature, ensure everyone has a warm home with affordable energy bills, and help to tackle the deep inequalities we face between our regions.” He said “there were lots of green shoots across the country” but argued this was thanks to “imaginative people, communities and businesses” rather than a comprehensive plan from central government. “To truly transform our economy, we need government to show leadership and bring forward a green investment plan equal to the scale of the emergency we face and the task of economic transformation.” The report, by analysts kMatrix Data Services, which produces annual assessments of the low carbon economy for businesses, academics and local authorities including the Greater London Authority, was based on 900 data sources from government, the private sector and academia. It used a different methodology to the Office for National Statistics annual assessment of the green economy, including supply chains and networks and includes a broader category of sectors from wind and solar power to geothermal and water and wastewater treatment. The report’s author, Sarah Howard, of kMatrix, said: “This data, by examining the full extent of the low carbon economy from the grassroots up, shows us just how important it already is for the UK economy and the progress already made. “It also illustrates the chains and networks of supply are present and scalable, enabling the significant growth required in the wider sector. What we need now is a comprehensive policy framework and the required rapid growth can be achieved.”",Green economy; Environment; UK news; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions; Manufacturing sector,Environment
2021-03-15T19:27:43Z,The Guardian view on Europe's social democrats: time to come back from the dead | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-europes-social-democrats-time-to-come-back-from-the-dead,"Over the past decade, many of Europe’s centre-left parties have been battered, bruised and not infrequently humiliated at elections. In France, the Socialist party languishes at below 10% in the polls. The Dutch Labour party underwent a near-death experience at the general election of 2017. Italy’s Democrats have lost swaths of working-class support to the populist right and were at one point eclipsed by the Five Star Movement. Germany’s Social Democratic party (SPD) has slipped badly behind the Greens. Soul-searching about the future of the left has not been confined to Britain and Labour. This week, elections in the Netherlands are likely to see the dismal record continue. The Labour party is predicted to improve only modestly on its dire performance of four years ago, when it lost 75% of the seats it held. But the weekend offered the first tentative signs that, after the wilderness years, the wheel of political fortune may just be turning for Europe’s beleaguered social democrats. It would be premature to read too much into the disastrous performance of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party at two state elections, where it scored its worst-ever results. Both regions were already controlled by political opponents – Rhineland-Palatinate by the Social Democrats and Baden-Württemberg by the Greens. The results were also heavily influenced by Covid-related factors, from the slow rollout of the vaccination programme, to corruption claims involving alleged kickbacks to CDU politicians from mask procurement deals. The eventual impact of these issues on September’s general election is difficult to predict. Nevertheless, this was a damaging setback for the European Union’s most powerful and successful centre-right party. Suddenly, the CDU appears vulnerable, despite its sizeable lead in national polls. As chancellor Angela Merkel prepares to step down, a new three-way coalition – between the Greens, the SPD and the liberal Free Democrats - has emerged as a genuine possibility. For the SPD, which has haemorrhaged support while serving as junior partner in a CDU-led grand coalition, this would represent a road to renewal and rehabilitation. Meanwhile in Italy, the Democratic party’s new leader, Enrico Letta, has also been talking up the possibility of a future centre-left alliance. At the last election, in 2018, the Democrats fought, and lost, alone. On Sunday, Mr Letta hinted at a first electoral pact with the environmentally-friendly Five Star Movement. Such alliances can take advantage of an ideological sea-change. Following the financial crash of 2008, the European centre-left paid a calamitous price for enacting the EU economic orthodoxy of austerity. Social democrats ran or participated in governments associated with cutting state spending and lowering the living standards of the less well-off. Their number included Mr Letta, prime minister of Italy from 2013 to 2014. But the twin challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate emergency have buried that old consensus. The EU’s €750bn Covid recovery fund, its largest-ever stimulus package, has itself been dwarfed in scale by the Biden administration’s $1.9tn equivalent. Big government is making a comeback, driven by the urgent need for green investment to meet slipping climate targets, and the priority of ensuring post-Covid economic growth. The map of political priorities is thus being re-drawn in a way that should be meat and drink to parties that lost their way in the 2010s. The road to redemption for the traditional centre-left will depend on forging new alliances, particularly with the newly influential green movement.

2021-06-12T08:00:25Z,"Calls for G7 spending restraint misguided, warns Lord Stern",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/12/calls-for-g7-spending-restraint-misguided-warns-lord-stern,"Wealthy nations must ignore calls to rein in public spending as the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace, or risk a fresh crisis, the climate economist Nicholas Stern has warned. Leaders of the G7 industrialised countries are meeting in Cornwall this weekend, to discuss vaccines, the recovery from the pandemic, and the climate crisis. They must tie these issues together and forge a green recovery that would shift their economies permanently to a low-carbon basis, said Lord Stern, former World Bank chief economist and former adviser to the UK Treasury. He warned that calls for spending restraint were misguided. “It would be a mistake to confuse fiscal responsibility with premature austerity,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “Fiscal responsibility is crucial, but in this case you must build up the fiscal position as growth returns. Premature austerity will threaten growth, it will choke off growth and make the fiscal position worse.” More investment is needed in the green economy to boost low-carbon technologies, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, and to invest in the necessary changes to infrastructure, such as home heating, in order to reach the targets of net zero emissions by 2050, which all the G7 countries have signed up to. Stern said now was the time to make such investments, rather than holding back. He pointed to the recovery from the financial crisis of 2008, when some governments including the UK moved quickly to cut public spending in a quest to cut the deficit and “balance the books”. Many economists argue that such austerity policies hindered the return to growth and caused unnecessary hardship. Stern also warned governments to avoid the seemingly easier path of a Covid-19 recovery boosted by a boom in pent-up consumer spending, which might seem attractive in the short term but would fail to build the foundations for long-term sustainable and low-carbon growth. “We need strong investment to recover in a strong and sustainable way,” he said. “We want to avoid a consumption-led recovery, like the Roaring 20s of 100 years ago. That would be a mistake. What we really need is an investment-led recovery, if it is to be sustained and sustainable.” With greenhouse gas emissions rebounding rapidly from their dramatic falls during last year’s coronavirus lockdowns, fears are rising that some governments are missing the opportunity to reset their economies with policies that promote low-carbon activity and phase out fossil fuels. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog, said some countries were taking the actions needed, and urged all to follow their example. “Europe is going very much in the right direction, on its green recovery efforts,” he said. The EU has a “green deal” plan, covering all aspects of the economy from agriculture to transport and energy, and several member states have their own massive green recovery programmes, including France, which is funnelling about a third of its $100bn recovery funds into green and low-carbon ends. Birol also pointed to the efforts of US president Joe Biden, who is pushing recovery spending plans worth trillions through Congress, with a focus on renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure. “In the US, I very much hope this recovery plan goes through which includes lots of critical measures for a green recovery,” he said. But he warned that much more effort was needed in other G7 nations. “Other countries are following suit, but this is not yet a success story, on the green recovery among the G7,” he said. “There are steps in the right direction, but it is not there yet.” He added that the G7 countries should be doing more to help developing countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions, in the global effort to reach net zero by mid-century, and to halve emissions by 2030, which scientists say is needed to hold temperature rises within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. He said a seven-fold increase in spending on clean energy investments, from $150bn to more than $1tn, was needed in the developing world. “If you reduce emissions in Jakarta, or Bristol, Oslo or Detroit, it has the same effect,” he said. “But it is much cheaper to do so in developing countries – and they are receiving much less investment than the advanced economies.” One of the key topics on the G7 agenda is supplying climate finance to developing countries, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown. Rich countries have failed to meet the target they set for providing such finance, which was supposed to reach $100bn a year by 2020, but has fallen short by about $20bn. Stern said the developed world should aim to double the climate finance from public sources, from $30bn a year in 2018 to $60bn a year by 2025. Birol added that the development banks funded by rich countries should be given a mandate to invest in low-carbon projects and a green recovery. He said: “The G7, being some of the richest nations, have a moral responsibility [to provide such help] but also a huge economic opportunity, to support green investment in the developing world.”",Nicholas Stern; Green economy; Austerity; G7; Climate crisis; World news; Coronavirus; Economics; Global economy; Business; Environment,Environment
2020-12-12T10:00:34Z,Talk is cheap when it comes to climate action. Now the government must deliver | Matthew Pennycook,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/12/talk-is-cheap-when-it-comes-to-climate-action-now-the-government-must-deliver,"The coronavirus pandemic and the jobs crisis it has precipitated are rightly consuming our immediate attention. Meanwhile, the climate and environment emergency has not gone away. These intersecting crises demand urgent and coordinated action. When it comes to averting catastrophic global heating, the science is unequivocal: bold action is required, and it is required now. As the UN has warned, limiting warming to 1.5C requires “far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” for which “the next few years are probably the most important in our history”. Viewed in that existential context, both the UK’s 2050 net zero emissions target and the government’s new 2030 target are the absolute minimum that we should aim for. Cognisant of the accelerating nature of the climate crisis, the Labour party seeks to go further and faster, and it remains our firm ambition to achieve the substantial majority of the UK’s emissions reductions by the end of this decisive decade. But while Labour will continue to make the case for the highest possible ambition, we must also hold the government to account on its existing targets. This week’s landmark report by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) highlights just how challenging those targets are. It set out in exhaustive detail both the scale of the task ahead and the sweeping changes necessary in every sector of the economy. According to the CCC, to reach net zero by 2050, not only will our power system have to be fully decarbonised within the next 15 years, but rapid progress will have to be made in sectors such as transport and housing, where the impact on people will be much more acute with “every new car and van, and every replacement boiler” required to be zero-carbon by the early 2030s. Yet the report also demonstrates that the transition to a low-carbon economy is both entirely feasible and, if managed correctly, hugely beneficial – not only opening up significant new industrial opportunities but also promising hundreds of thousands of decent jobs in every nation and region, cheaper bills, warmer homes, and a host of other health and environmental benefits. And with the estimated costs of decarbonisation continuing to fall, it makes a convincing case that there are net gains for our economy that will offset upfront investment over the long term. Of course, these benefits will only materialise if the government delivers on its promises. To judge solely on the basis of Boris Johnson’s rhetoric, one would be forgiven for thinking the government he leads is firmly on track to net zero. Yet as things stand, not only is it way off track to meet the legally binding target, but the government’s own projections indicate that it’s not even on track to meet the less ambitious one that preceded it. We need a step change in delivery. Achieving net zero is going to require a major nationwide investment programme, one that is government led and frontloaded. That’s precisely why Labour recently challenged the government to bring forward an ambitious stimulus package geared towards decarbonisation, in order to fight the twin crises of unemployment and climate breakdown by supporting the creation of up to 400,000 new low-carbon jobs in every region of the country over the next 18 months. Yet the government has shown little appetite for acting decisively to close the net-zero investment gap. The prime minister’s recent 10-point climate package contained just £3bn of new money – half the amount the Tories have funnelled into overseas fossil fuel projects in the last decade. With no new green investment whatsoever in the spending review, it is now clear the chancellor has broken his commitment to “a green recovery, with concern for our environment at its heart”. But as well as investment, delivering net zero also requires the government to urgently bring forward a clear, credible and comprehensive strategy. Given the necessary pace of change, the public will rightly demand to know how ministers are going to help millions of families move from gas boilers to clean heating systems or cover the upfront costs of electric vehicles. They are owed answers to those and many other questions as soon as possible. The public will also want to know that any strategy for net zero has fairness at its heart. It is imperative that decarbonisation in the decades ahead avoids the mistakes of deindustrialisation in the 1980s. That is why Labour is determined to fight for a green industrial revolution: one that properly supports people and places through the transition, that actively involves individuals and their communities in the process, that ensures that the benefits of green investment are realised here at home and shared across all nations and regions, and that tackles entrenched inequalities. Doing so is not only morally right; it’s the only way to sustain public support as we make the shift to a low-carbon economy. Announcing targets is easy; achieving them is the hard part. To date the government has been long on aspiration but short on tangible progress. As the host of the critical COP26 UN climate summit next year, the UK had a duty to raise its climate ambition, and at today’s climate ambition summit it needs to persuade others to do the same; but the government now needs to move beyond the talk and demonstrate to the world that it has the policies and the political will to deliver on that ambition. • Matthew Pennycook is shadow minister for climate change",Climate crisis; Environment; Climate science; Science; Politics; UK news; Greenhouse gas emissions,Opinion
2021-01-22T18:25:02Z,The Guardian view on electric cars: greener roads are good | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-electric-cars-greener-roads-are-good,"The prospect of a cleaner motor vehicle fleet is drawing closer. In November, the UK government announced that a ban on new petrol and diesel car sales would be brought forward to 2030. Advances in battery technology mean the tipping point at which electric vehicles become cheaper than other types, without subsidies, could come within five years. Fast-charging electric car batteries are on the horizon, with five-minute “fill up” times in sight. This is good news for the climate, with transport emissions one of the biggest obstacles to meeting reductions targets, nationally and globally. Also welcome for the UK is the announcement by Nissan that in future it will source 62 kilowatt-hour batteries for its popular Leaf model from the factory next door to its Sunderland car plant, instead of importing them from the US. On vehicle emissions, there is some way to go. While last year saw a 43% rise in electric car sales, they made up just 4.2% of the total. So far, Norway is the only country where they are the most popular cars. SUVs have been the second largest cause of rising global emissions over the previous decade – and worryingly their sales continue to rise in Britain. Much work remains to be done to stop people choosing vehicles that are making the world’s biggest problem worse. The joy in Sunderland ought to be tempered by the fact that Nissan will continue making its SUV Qashqai there. The benefits for the workforce should blind no one to the environmental risks. Plans to limit emissions from heavy goods vehicles are also needed. Last month the Committee on Climate Change recommended a ban on diesel HGVs by 2040, which it said was necessary if the UK is to meet the target of net zero by 2050. With the freight industry facing severe disruption because of Brexit, new environmental goals are likely to meet resistance. But with electric vehicles responsible for around 30% less carbon dioxide than fossil-fuel-powered cars in the UK (in France, where the electricity supply is cleaner, the figure is nearer 70%), the path to a greener transport future is becoming clearer. As with solar and wind energy, prices are falling faster than expected, and battery technology is an important part of the green investment strategy that should follow the pandemic. The phasing out of cobalt in newer batteries is also encouraging, given the ethical and labour issues connected with mining the mineral in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Electric cars do not obviate the need for other affordable transport options, or for big reductions in overall road traffic, especially in cities. Battery disposal is a problem, as is the use of coal power in some manufacturing. But since cars are part of life, it is good that they are getting greener.","Environment; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Manufacturing sector; Nissan; Sunderland; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Pollution; Air pollution; Technology; Technology sector; Ethical and green living; Motoring; Travel and transport; UK news; Automotive industry",Opinion
2021-08-13T10:15:10Z,Treasury blocking green policies key to UK net zero target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/13/treasury-blocking-green-policies-key-to-uk-net-zero-target,"The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK’s own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian. A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future. The UK’s credibility as host of the Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow rests on a clear net zero strategy – but publication has been postponed until near the eve of the summit, giving the UK little leverage to bring other countries to the negotiating table with the tougher carbon targets needed. Meanwhile, steep cuts to overseas aid have severely damaged the UK’s standing internationally, experts on the UN talks said. Jamie Peters, director of campaigning impact at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Treasury has been helping to fuel the climate emergency for far too long. The reality is that a rapid transition to a zero carbon future would be far less expensive than delaying the green measures we so urgently need, and that will create significant economic opportunities and new jobs.” Civil society groups, thinktanks and political insiders said the Treasury had refused to commit to the spending needed to shift the UK’s economy to a low-carbon footing. Complaints about the potential short-term costs of net zero policies have been one flashpoint during weeks of high tension between the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the Guardian understands. Kate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “There are strong reports that Rishi Sunak is intent on blocking climate spending at exactly the moment we need it most, and that his fingerprints sit heavily on moves to delay or block crucial investment to cut emissions from buildings or gas boilers.” The lengthy charge sheet against the Treasury includes: scrapping the green homes grant insulation scheme; freezing fuel duty while slashing electric car incentives; mulling cuts to air passenger duty on domestic flights, while making above-inflation train fare increases; failing to cut VAT on green home refurbishment; underfunding the new infrastructure bank; and delaying the phasing out of gas boilers. There have also been glaring omissions and delays. For instance, the transport strategy failed to back road pricing, which many believe will be essential to reducing emissions, which have remained stubbornly high as more people buy SUVs. Both the hydrogen strategy and heat and buildings strategy have been delayed until autumn, as has the overarching net zero strategy. Not all of these policies were under direct Treasury control, but the Treasury holds the purse strings and can effectively veto plans by other departments that require government investment or might raise costs for consumers. “The Treasury is at the root of this,” said Ed Matthew, campaign director at E3G, a green thinktank. “They are completely obsessed with short-term costs. It’s bonkers.” Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The Treasury has this huge institutional resistance to medium term economic benefits [that entail short term costs]. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider it.” Ministers and advisers are understood to be anxious that costs such as switching to heat pumps from gas boilers, estimated from £5,000 to £20,000 for some households, or the higher purchase price of electric cars, will hurt consumers’ pockets. But the independent committee on climate change has said the costs of net zero are affordable and falling, at about 1% of GDP by 2050, while green investment will generate new jobs, and policies can be devised that shift the costs from lower-income households and distribute them fairly. Moreover, as this week’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out, extreme weather is already here and will get worse. As recent flooding has demonstrated, the costs of inaction will far outweigh the costs of action. Even observers normally sympathetic to the government find the Treasury’s reluctance concerning. Josh Buckland, author of a report for the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The Treasury is absolutely crucial to net zero. It has taken some welcome steps thus far to drive green finance and investment, but the jury is still out on how far it is willing to go given wider pressures on the public finances.” Buckland, a former environmental adviser to Johnson, believes that Sunak, known to be a fiscal “hawk” and free-marketeer, is not ideologically opposed to climate action. He said that while the Treasury was traditionally reluctant to commit spending on any issue, Sunak “also has a lot of priorities as we recover from the pandemic”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, disagrees. “Their ideology is standing in the way – they think that it can be done by the market and it can’t. They are held back by thinking this can all be done by the private sector, when all the evidence is that this has to be done by the public and private sectors.” Recent calls by Conservative MPs including Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay to halt the race to net zero, which have received a warm welcome in sections of the press, have suggested that some MPs may also sniff electoral advantage in being seen to be anti-green. Blagojevic said: “The chancellor’s position may be politically expedient for him in trying to court the small number of Tory MPs intent on delaying climate action. Ultimately, though, history will not look kindly if he is the chancellor who tried to hobble our chances of reaching a low-carbon future, with all the growth, good jobs and stable better future it offers.” If the UK is to meet its net zero targets, ministers will have to face down backbench critics. E3G’s Matthew said: “It’s becoming understood [by the government] that you can’t just leave it to the market to deliver net zero, as that isn’t going to happen. For a Conservative government, that’s an inconvenient reality.” Last year, as the world was plunged into recession after the first lockdowns, Johnson appeared to grasp this when he promised to “build back greener”. Since then, however, few spending plans to reduce emissions have been brought forward, other than the green homes grant. Johnson also produced a 10-point plan setting out areas of focus, including nuclear power and offshore wind, but this was dismissed by many experts as a wishlist rather than a strategy. The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the 10-point plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and announcing plans to issue £15bn in green bonds over the next year.” As the UK prepares to host Cop26, the government will be trying to persuade other countries to set out clear policies on emissions cuts for the next decade, a task much harder if ministers have no policies of their own. Ultimately, says Venables, only one person can sort this out: “The prime minister needs to get stuck in, to make the difficult decisions, and soon.”",Green economy; Tax and spending; Cop26; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Politics; UK news,Environment
2021-05-20T02:26:24Z,New Zealand budget 2021: Ardern boosts welfare to fuel Covid-19 recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/new-zealand-budget-2021-ardern-welfare-covid-19-child-pvoerty-housing,"New Zealand’s centre-left government has unveiled what it called the largest boost to welfare payments in “more than a generation” as the centrepiece of its budget, and pledged to fuel a Covid-19 recovery by addressing the country’s most pressing social problems. “Previous downturns have made inequality worse,” said Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, in written remarks to reporters in the hours before the budget was announced. “We’re taking a different approach.” The plan to stimulate economic growth by directing spending towards child poverty measures, health, education and the climate crisis was a “two birds, one stone” agenda, she said. But despite New Zealand’s better-than-forecast economic recovery from the shock of the pandemic, Ardern and her finance minister, Grant Robertson, sounded notes of caution about ongoing global volatility, justifying “careful fiscal management” to pay down lower-than-forecast debt. Robertson told the Guardian on Thursday that New Zealand’s “relatively strong” financial position had licensed his move to boost welfare. But, he added, the move had an economic basis. “By lifting benefits we’re talking about having that money be spent in the communities where people live,” Robertson said. “That’s the best part of a billion dollars a year going into the economy.” Ardern said New Zealand would emerge from the pandemic “stronger”. New Zealand has posted one of the world’s most successful Covid-19 responses following strict, early lockdowns of the country when the virus first emerged; unemployment is half of what was projected at last year’s budget – sitting at 4.7% in the March quarter, lower than both the OECD average and that of neighbouring Australia. A return to surplus was projected for the government’s books by 2027, according to Treasury figures on Thursday. The NZ$3.3bn (£1.6bn) Ardern’s government will spend on increasing benefit payments and allowances for tertiary students over the next four years amounts to a rise in benefits of between $32 and $55 a week per adult, according to government documents supplied on Thursday. The payment increases begin in July, and will increase again in April next year. The changes would lift between 19,000 and 33,000 children out of poverty, the government said – a key pledge of Ardern’s government. According to the latest figures, 157,800 children in New Zealand live below the poverty line. The boost to benefits also brings welfare payments into line with recommendations from a 2019 report that Ardern’s government commissioned but was susbsequently criticised for failing to implement. Some analysts welcomed the decision to use a moment of sustained economic stimulus to address poverty – but said living costs had increased dramatically in the two years since the welfare report was written. New Zealand’s median weekly rent was $540 in January, according to figures from the property website TradeMe – $60 a week higher than the same month in 2019. “It’s a way to make things look a bit rosier than they might currently appear because comparing to a few years back doesn’t reflect current reality,” said Brad Olsen, an economist with Infometrics. He added that he was concerned landlords would increase rents further in response. “But it’s an important move and recognises the challenges that lower-income families have faced,” he said. The budget did not contain significant new measures to cool the overheated housing market, an issue that has vexed successive governments, including Ardern’s. But Treasury figures released on Thursday suggested rocketing house prices would peak this year. Robertson said he expected a sharp adjustment “but a necessary one” to the cost of homes in 2022 as a result of changes to housing tax policy announced earlier this year, before house prices were expected to start rising again beyond 2022. Other government spending pledged over the next four years included: An extra $200m for the drug-buying agency Pharmac. $380m to build 1,000 new houses for Māori over the next four years. Increased funding for the regional boards that run hospitals, and for primary care, and $486m for a plan announced earlier that will scrap the boards and replace them with a national health authority. $2bn in new education spending, with a focus on school property costs. $300m for the Green Investment Finance fund to support low-carbon technologies and low-emissions vehicles. $127m in allowances to support 16,000 people to undertake job training. Treasury papers supplied on Thursday forecast that government debt would not balloon as much as suggested a year ago, when Robertson borrowed heavily to finance Covid-19 recovery measures alongside the 2020 budget. The government’s books had moved from surplus before the pandemic to deficit in 2020. But the deficit projected for 2021 – $15.1bn, or 4.5% of GDP – is lower than was expected six months ago, and $8 bn less than the previous year. Judith Collins, the opposition leader from the centre-right National party, said during a Parliamentary speech on Thursday that Labour’s Budget consisted of “handouts” and “empty announcements”. She decried the spending for those on welfare. “All New Zealanders are feeling the pinch,” Collins added. The government lacked a path to prosperity and should have prioritised business confidence to improve jobs and wages, she said. Ardern, responding in parliament, noted that the economic recovery from Covid-19 had progressed more swiftly than expected. New Zealand has “carved our own path”, Ardern said of the country’s emergence from the pandemic. “And our own path has been successful.”",New Zealand; New Zealand politics; Asia Pacific,World news
2021-11-22T06:28:58Z,Monday briefing: Thousands of homes being built in flood zones,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/22/monday-briefing-flood-zones,"Top story: ‘Protections must be put in place’ Hello, I’m Warren Murray and this is the briefing, all of a Monday morning. More than 5,000 new homes in flood-risk areas of England have been granted planning permission so far this year. Insurers said they were concerned about the numbers of homes being built where owners were at risk of experiencing “traumatic and devastating losses”. But builders say the housing shortage means even flood-risk areas have to be used – and the climate crisis means more defences and mitigation measures need to be put in place. An investigation by Greenpeace this year found that one-third of England’s most important flood defences were in private hands, with more than 1,000 in a poor state of repair. The government said it was investing over £5.2bn in flood and coastal defences in England, which would improve protection for more than 336,000 properties. “Our national planning policy is clear that floodplain development should be avoided wherever possible, and protections must be put in place when building in these areas is necessary – we expect local planning authorities to follow this guidance.” * * * Car ploughs into Christmas parade – At least five people have been killed after a vehicle was driven at speed through a Christmas parade in a town in Wisconsin, police have confirmed. A red sport utility vehicle ploughed into marchers in Waukesha about 20 miles west of Milwaukee on Sunday afternoon, also injuring more than 40 people. Police had opened fire on the vehicle in order to try to stop it, said the town’s police chief, Dan Thompson. One person of interest was in custody, he said, and the vehicle involved had been recovered. * * * Johnson, Starmer woo CBI – Boris Johnson is to announce that all new buildings in England will have to install electric vehicle charge points from 2022. In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) today, the PM is due to say that the government expects it to lead to 145,000 new charging points each year. The government will also support a loan programme worth £150m to help British small and medium enterprises, including green businesses, commercialise their research. Keir Starmer will tell the CBI a Labour government would not “throw cash at” the country’s problems. Starmer will aim to woo a sector that Labour believes has been alienated by Johnson’s government. Labour has attacked the government for wasting billions of pounds on “crony Covid contracts”. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has said Labour would set up an “office for value for money”. Labour has made significant spending pledges, though, including £28bn of green investment each year until the end of the decade. * * * Isis suspects buy freedom – Suspected Isis members are buying their way out jail in north-east Syria for the equivalent of £6,000 each, according to interviews with two freed men and official documents. As part of the deal, they sign a declaration promising not to rejoin any armed organisations and to leave the parts of north and east Syria under control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). About 10,000 such men are held in three overcrowded SDF-administered prisons in north-east Syria. Separately, Bethany Haines – whose father, David Haines was captured by Isis in Syria and beheaded – has described watching the video of his murder and looking an alleged Islamic State killer in the eye in court. In the programme The Isis ‘Beatles’: Blood On Their Hands, to be broadcast on ITV today, Bethany tells of flying out to see El Shafee Elsheikh appear in court. He is charged over the beheading of four US hostages but not her father’s murder. “He just stared right into my eyes and I stared back. I’m not going to be intimidated by him. I’m not going to look away.” * * * Crossrail at turning point – Hopes that Crossrail will open in central London in early 2022 – this time on schedule – have been boosted as the troubled £19bn scheme moved into its final phase of testing at the weekend. The trial operations phase will comprise more than 150 exercises over three to six months, involving thousands of volunteer passengers, to ensure that the Elizabeth line, as Crossrail will be known, is ready for full passenger service and can cope with emergency situations. TfL bosses have committed to open the line in full in the first half of next year. Initially, passengers will need to change trains between the new central underground section and the services already running from Reading in the west and Shenfield in the east, but TfL hopes some trains could run from suburbs across the city centre by next autumn, ahead of a May 2023 deadline. * * * A dill – A “mortified” Australian TV reporter has tried to explain how he bungled an exclusive interview with Adele about her new album, 30, because he hadn’t actually listened to it. Matt Doran and a crew flew to London for the chat, which reportedly cost A$1m to secure and would have been Adele’s only Australian interview. After Doran conceded during the interview that he had only heard one track from her latest work, 30, the interview was canned. Doran said he missed the email that contained a preview of the album. Sony refused to release the footage of the interview. Today in Focus podcast: Huma Abedin on being herself As Hillary Clinton’s most trusted aide, it was her job to stay out of view.

2021-09-29T14:41:48Z,The verdict on Keir Starmer’s Labour conference speech ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/29/the-verdict-on-keir-starmers-labour-conference-speech,"Steve Richards: It is a myth that a leader ‘taking on’ a section of their party reaps electoral dividends Keir Starmer’s first speech to a proper party conference was unusually long. That’s fine. The duration was a form of release for him, a serious-minded leader trapped by a pandemic, finally securing an audience. Starmer adopted some techniques from the New Labour era, necessary ones if the party wants to secure wider appeal. But there was more radical verve than compared with the mid-1990s: a high-spending green new deal and the announcement earlier this week of the ending of charitable status for private schools being two emblematic examples. (David Blunkett almost lost his job as shadow education secretary after raising this possibility in the buildup to the 1997 election.) Starmer also claimed “levelling up” as a Labour issue, again with plenty of ammunition to do so. He dealt well with the heckling and much of the media will praise him for his responses. But the two bigger UK parties are broad coalitions, always burdened by deep internal differences. It is one of the myths of British politics that a leader “taking on” a section of their party reaps electoral dividends. Labour leaders feel under considerable pressure to do so in a way that no Conservative leader does. Neil Kinnock’ s famous speech in 1985 when he challenged Militant tendency was an act of stunning political courage, but obscured a potent argument in the same address about the benevolent potential of the state, his counter to Thatcherism. The argument remained hidden. Labour was slaughtered in the election that followed. Unity or election victory is a false juxtaposition. An impression of unity is a precondition of election victory. Starmer is a leader of integrity and substance, pitted against a PM he has called a “trickster”. This is potentially a compelling juxtaposition, but there is a risk for him that most voters will note only a troubled party compared with the deceptively united front on display at the Conservatives’ conference next week. Steve Richards’ latest book is The Prime Ministers We Never Had Polly Toynbee: Here begins the rebuilding of trust One good – very long – speech can’t win elections, but it can change the weather. Hecklers, there were a few, but then again too few to bother him. Usefully Starmer could rouse the great majority in the crowd to drown them out – also a reminder of how he vanquished the Corbyn remnants this week. He’s no natural barnstormer but his strength was always to be the serious contrast to trivial Boris Johnson, ready when the public tires of that clown-showman’s knavish tricks. The themes were strong, if familiar, but he made them his own: crime and security, which belongs to the chief prosecutor; work, forged by his toolmaker father; and the value of care, impressed upon him by his nurse mother. Surprises? We saw genuine emotion from a shy man – the trustworthiness and the seriousness are already priced in. And no one can call Labour policy-free now, with more radical plans than anyone expected. Blairite? In fact there was nothing like the extreme Blair/Brown caution when approaching the 1997 election – though the homage to all they achieved in power was long overdue. He may not use the word, but if socialism is the language of priorities, as Aneurin Bevan said, he rightly put the climate emergency top of his bill: that eye-watering annual £28bn green investment proposal strips bare the fakery of Johnson’s no-plan targets. Working rights and mental health were eloquently promised, with a lyrical pledge for arts and sport and outings for children. His call to “Make Brexit work” will stick, as the nation queues for petrol. Few but political obsessives notice conference speeches, but messages percolate out over time. By mysterious osmosis people will know Starmer better after this week, and they’ll be a step closer to envisaging an alternative prime minister: the longer chaos reigns around the country, the more they need one. Here begins the rebuilding of trust after Labour’s great calamity at the last election. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Zoe Williams: Those who backed his campaign in the first place had hoped for more Starmer’s speech revealed three critical weakness – the first rhetorical, the second programmatic, the third both. But it wasn’t without merit. With long, impassioned personal stories, the Labour leader resituated the ideas of crime and security around the killing of a young woman by her violent ex-partner and the murder of Stephen Lawrence – thus managing to knit together his lawyerly image of punishing the wrongdoer with the anti-sexist, anti-racist values of the crowd. He pulled off something else, too: “Let’s get totally serious about this,” Starmer told a conference hall that was itching, at this point, to stand up (though whether in ovation or escape it was genuinely hard to say): “We can win the next general election.” The end of his statement was unspoken – “so long as you lot pipe down” – yet somehow almost everybody managed to get it. But Starmer is still genuinely uncomfortable talking about himself. In the early days of his leadership, those with his ear used to plead with him to show more of his background. Starmer still finds this toe curling, and though he has finally been persuaded of its necessity, he goes at it with a sincerity that is over-baked and painful to watch. “The eye on the object,” was how he repeatedly distilled his father’s craftsmanship. It was meant to mean something, but in God’s name, what? Honest, working people, staring at things; those are Labour Values. Second, there was a large amount of Blair tribute act (antisocial behaviour? We’re seriously going back there?), fleshed out with Blair in-jokes (“education – I’m tempted to say it three times”). Giving a speech to Labour members, to signal to non-Labour members that you’re no longer in hock to the members, using jokes that only a Labour member would ever laugh at: it was all dense with irony. Third, Starmer’s speech had a kind of Men-in-Black effect. It wiped the mind of any memory of what you wanted to hear and replaced it with nothing that anyone would disagree with, creating a kind of self-cleaning brain where ideas go to vanish (the exception was his name-checking Rachel Reeves’s speech on Monday, which was ambitious). Probably even Boris Johnson, in his cups, would agree that Starmer would make the better prime minister. So “better than the other guy” was his pitch – but those who backed his campaign in the first place had hoped for a bit more than that. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Moya Lothian-McLean: Only concrete action will convince the wider public that he’s a tool for their betterment Keir Starmer’s conference speech was billed by his colleagues as the most important of his life. Although this suggests a degree of precariousness, Starmer delivered it from a comfortable position: he had used the past few days in Brighton to carry on the job of purging the left. His demeanour illustrated this: Starmer spoke confidently and empathically, though he wasn’t quite able to embody that all-too elusive charisma, even with a few gags. His stall was set out early. He began by “[welcoming] home” former MP Louise Ellman. This week, he said, Labour had got its “house in order” and could now get on with the business of opposition. Just what that business looks like to Starmer has so far been muddy. He ascended to leadership by promising socialism and party unity via 10 pledges. His speech omitted name-checking, although several points could have potentially won over the left wing of his party – if he hadn’t spent a year alienating them. Framing his political motivation through his upbringing – “I am not from a privileged background” – Starmer laid out a commitment to working people. Under Labour, a fully funded NHS – with 8,500 new mental health workers – would shift from emergency care to prevention, he said, and the party would pursue the Green New Deal policy that he has been accused of abandoning. He was even confident enough to throw jabs at SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (perhaps not the smartest move to regain lost ground in Scotland). But regular heckles from the listening delegates reminded us that much of his rhetoric was just that – talk. Starmer’s actions have contradicted much of what he professes to stand for. References to NHS pay and fair wages were met with cries about Starmer’s limp response to the question of pay for nurses in England earlier this year – as well as jibes of “£15 an hour”. “Shouting slogans or changing lives?” was Starmer’s response to one heckler, which served only to highlight that he has yet to convincingly do either. Finishing up on yet another reference to his toolmaker father, the Labour leader walked off to a standing ovation. But only concrete action will be enough to convince the wider public that he’s a tool for their betterment, rather than just another cog in a failing political machine.

2021-03-03T19:54:21Z,'Super deduction' may not be the most effective use of a £25bn tax break,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/mar/03/super-deduction-may-not-be-most-effective-use-25bn-tax-break,"One can usually take a mental break when the budget speech turns to capital allowances. It’s the tinkering bit. This time was different. Rishi Sunak’s “super deduction” regime will allow businesses to offset 130% of investment spending on plant and machinery against profits for the next two years. So spend £10m on new equipment and reduce your taxable income by £13m, as the chancellor put it. It’s an eye-catching pitch to companies as they await the hike in corporation tax in 2023. The cost to the Treasury over the next two years will be £25bn, which is enormous. The Office for Budget Responsibility calculated it is 10 times more generous than the equivalent temporary capital allowance measures introduced after the 2009 financial crash. Will it work? With numbers of this size, it cannot fail to have some impact on business investment, a perennial weakness in the UK economy. Sunak cited the OBR’s forecast of a rise of 10%, or £20bn. And yes, one can see how boards of directors, perhaps hesitating over whether to upgrade a production line until they’ve seen the strength of the recovery, would be encouraged to take the plunge. As PricewaterhouseCoopers pointed out, there may also be “levelling up” benefits since manufacturers, one big beneficiary, are more concentrated outside London and the south-east. But there may also be a reason why such a blunt tool has not been used on this scale in the past. As well as encouraging fresh business spending, the Treasury may also find itself rewarding investment that would have happened anyway. Take BT, whose annual capital expenditure budget is about £4.5bn. Its share price shot up 7% after the budget speech, presumably on the thought of the juicy allowances that can now be claimed over two years for the roll-out of fast-fibre broadband. If BT responds by getting fibre to premises more quickly, that could be considered a benefit for the nation. But the gain may be marginal since the programme is well under way. Any acceleration may also be concentrated in cities, where it is easier to speed up, rather than rural areas. So yes, Sunak should succeed in getting a few cashed-up companies to invest more rapidly than they might otherwise have done. But is this the most effective use of a £25bn tax break? It feels unlikely. It’s time for a business rates review The big supermarkets may have expected to get something for their money when, after squirming in the spotlight for too many months, they handed back their relief from business rates last autumn. The prize for doing the honourable thing, or so they probably imagined, would be the launch of a fundamental review of the entire business rates system. It didn’t happen in the budget. Maybe the Treasury has decided a proper review is best conducted when it is easier to judge how much of the boom in online retailing will stick. But the review does need to take place – and soon. The current system is patently unfair on bricks-and-mortars retailers who pay rates on shops at values that are out of date by more than half a decade. Ken Murphy, the chief executive of Tesco, has previously made the point that many of the high streets affected most severely by the current rates system are those at the centre of the government’s “levelling up” plans. Exactly right. Another round of temporary Covid tweaks and reliefs on rates will be welcomed by smaller retailers. But the main event – a full review – cannot be delayed much longer. Infrastructure bank needs solid foundations The chancellor was on weak ground in claiming to be launching “the first ever UK infrastructure bank”. We used to have something similar. It was the Green Investment Bank (GIB), created by George Osborne in 2012 and then sold to Macquarie of Australia in 2017. At least the previous experiment proved the concept works, even if Osborne himself never seemed entirely convinced. Public money was used to back green projects from windfarms to street lighting systems. Private capital followed in its wake. There was even a small profit for the Treasury on disposal. Let us hope the latest creation lasts longer than a single chancellor’s period in office. When they’re done well, these public-private partnerships can be very effective in getting infrastructure built.",Spring budget 2021; Tax and spending; Budget; Economic policy; Business; Trade policy; Supermarkets; Banking; Politics; Retail industry; UK news,Business
2021-03-05T07:00:29Z,"New infrastructure bank won't help UK reach net zero, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/05/new-infrastructure-bank-wont-help-uk-reach-net-zero-says-labour,"The UK’s new national infrastructure bank is likely to make little impact on the quest to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, and will fail to plug the gap left by EU investments in the UK, Labour has said. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, announced £12bn of public funding for the new bank in the budget on Wednesday, with another £10bn in government guarantees. The Office of Budget Responsibility found in its economic and fiscal outlook that the new bank would be likely to provide £1.5bn a year in investment and would not increase its forecast for the UK’s economic growth. A spokesperson told the Guardian it had not examined whether the bank would help the UK to meet its net zero targets. Labour said the bank was much smaller than similar banks in Germany and other countries, and contrasted its capital with the £5bn a year the UK gained from the European Investment Bank before Brexit. Labour also called for the bank to be given a “watertight net zero mandate” to ensure that all its investments work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Without a strong mandate, the bank could invest in high-carbon activities. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “We needed climate leadership from government but we got climate failure. Far from transformative investment in infrastructure, the government’s new bank won’t even plug the hole left by the European Investment Bank and will see us trailing way behind countries like Germany.” The government sold off the previous Green Investment Bank, launched in 2012 with a remit to invest public funds in low-carbon projects, in 2017, in a process later criticised for delivering poor value for money. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “The UK infrastructure bank shows this government’s commitment to levelling up and delivering world-class infrastructure to every corner of the UK. It will have a more targeted remit than the European Investment Bank in the UK and better focus on government priorities, including the net zero target and boosting local growth.” Sam Alvis, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said the bank would have a positive but limited impact. “The Treasury is moving in a greener direction, but very slowly. There is good initial funding for the national infrastructure bank, with the potential for creating thousands of jobs, but it falls well short of transformational funding. Without a clear net zero and nature mandate, the bank’s money could in theory go to roads, coalmines or incinerators rather than genuinely green jobs.” Green campaigners are also concerned that the government’s “super deduction” announced in the budget could encourage high-carbon investment. Under the plans, companies will be able to claim tax relief on 130% of investments in equipment and other productivity measures. But the government has so far set no limits that would preclude companies from using the tax break to invest in fossil fuels or high-carbon activities. Kemi Badenoch, a junior Treasury minister, rejected the possibility of restrictions on the use of the scheme when questioned by MPs at a select committee hearing on Thursday. She said: “Those investments are going to businesses of all sizes. We do not have a way of saying this investment is good or not good for net zero … We are focused on jobs, in the most sustainable way possible, but we are not going to strangle economic recovery with regulation that’s not necessary.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “It is shocking that under the super deduction scheme, the government could be giving huge tax breaks to companies to invest in fossil fuel projects which take us further away from our chances of reaching climate targets. Making sure investments are aligned with climate and nature targets would not ‘strangle our economic recovery’. If the economic recovery is not green, it’s simply not sustainable.” Hannah Martin, co-executive director of Green New Deal UK, a pressure group, said: “A super deduction could be tailored to boost the green industries of tomorrow, helping grow the manufacturing base required to deliver electric vehicles, wind turbines and battery and storage solutions up and down the UK. Without green requirements, this tax deduction could de-risk the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, locking-in destructive climate change with the taxpayer footing the bill.”",Infrastructure; UK news; Climate crisis; Environment; Rishi Sunak; Business; Politics; Economic recovery; Economic growth (GDP),Business
2021-01-31T18:25:45Z,The Guardian view on climate progress: the need for speed | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-climate-progress-the-need-for-speed,"The year ahead is an absolutely crucial one in the struggle to keep global heating below 1.5C or 2C, above which the UN has warned of chaos. John Kerry, who is President Joe Biden’s climate envoy, told the BBC that the conference of the parties (Cop26) due to take place in Glasgow in November is the “last best chance the world has … to do what science is telling us we need to do”. Important as the talks are, the decisions taken between now and then are just as significant. Last year saw an unprecedented drop of 7% in greenhouse gas emissions, due to Covid, but a rebound is expected. It is here that attention must now be focused. As governments around the world pump money into economies ravaged by the pandemic, a return to business as usual would be catastrophic. Research carried out after the 2008 financial crash showed that the recovery then was about 16% green, with the majority of stimulus spending directed at carbon-intensive infrastructure and activities. This time, green investment must be more than an add-on. Governments must proactively channel public funds towards renewable energy, green transport infrastructure, home insulation – and away from fossil fuels, especially coal. Most people agree on the direction of travel. Last week, the largest ever opinion poll on climate change revealed that two-thirds of those questioned, in 50 countries, believe heating caused by greenhouse gas emissions is a “global emergency”. Scientists say the world is hotter than it has been for 12,000 years. Climate change has already pushed more than 18 million people in South Asian countries to migrate. In January last year, a landmark ruling by a UN committee said it would be illegal for governments to return people to countries where their lives might be threatened by the climate crisis. The last UN climate conference, in 2019, ended in despair. Since then, governments and businesses have made new pledges, including China’s announcement of a net zero target of 2060. Now the US, derailed for four years by the nihilist denialism of Donald Trump, is back on board. The executive orders signed last week by Mr Biden, including a promise to end fossil-fuel activity on government land and turn the entire federal vehicle fleet electric, were hugely significant. The world cannot afford to wait until November. Net zero targets provide a destination. But action can no longer be deferred. The next decade, as Mr Kerry acknowledged, is crucial. The US must present a plan for emissions reductions by 2030, as set out in the Paris climate deal, without delay. The summit being convened by Mr Biden in April must be more than a warm-up for November; decarbonisation projects, bringing jobs with them, need to start now. The global mood surrounding climate prospects has lifted immeasurably. Statements from the US, and other countries including Japan and South Korea, are all steps in the right direction. But already, the rest of the world lags behind the EU, which a Guardian analysis last year showed is the green frontrunner in the way its post-pandemic stimulus spending has been designed. Delays and prevarications on climate action thus far mean that change must now happen very fast. The most useful move that Mr Biden could now make would be to announce that April’s talks will be the launch pad for a global green recovery. This is no time to sit back. Instead, the world must press on, and speed up. • This article was amended on 2 February 2021. A landmark UN ruling on the legality of returning people to countries where their lives might be threatened by the climate crisis came in January 2020, not “earlier this month” as the article initially said.",Climate crisis; Environment; Cop26; Joe Biden; John Kerry; US news; Climate science; China; Housing; UK news; Asia Pacific,Opinion
2020-11-25T18:28:06Z,Rishi Sunak sets out £100bn investment in infrastructure,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/25/rishi-sunak-sets-out-100bn-investment-in-infrastructure,"Britain’s first national infrastructure strategy will deliver a “once in a generation investment” worth £100bn to spur the country’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis, the chancellor said on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak set out plans for the “highest sustained levels of public investment in more than 40 years” as the government attempted to offset a grim economic prognosis in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The £100bn spending plans for next year are £27bn higher than for last year in real terms, and over the next four years government spending on infrastructure will rise to £600bn, Sunak said. The infrastructure plans are designed to rebuild the economy by creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs while upgrading the country’s roads, railways and full-fibre broadband cables, and investing in green infrastructure to help create a “net zero” economy by 2050. The plans promise to spread investment across the UK’s regions with the help of a new national infrastructure bank, based in the north of England, to invest in infrastructure projects alongside private investors. The bank has been created despite calls for an institution that more closely resembles the UK’s Green Investment Bank, which was controversially sold off in 2017. The new bank will be aligned with the government’s climate aims but will also have a broader focus on “levelling up” regions of the UK which have been neglected in the past. Sunak told the House of Commons: “For many people, the most powerful barometer of economic success is the change they see and the pride they feel in the places they call home.” His infrastructure strategy includes plans to help deliver 860,000 new homes by ploughing £7.1bn into “the biggest ever investment” in new roads, cycle lanes, community facilities and better 4G broadband across 95% of the UK by 2025 in order to support new housing developments across the country. Alongside the infrastructure spending Sunak announced a new “levelling up fund” worth £4bn and changes to the guidelines used by officials to make key investment decisions, known as the Green Book, to favour projects which help support the government’s levelling up agenda. The chancellor’s infrastructure strategy, which was based on recommendations by Britain’s National Infrastructure Committee, offered little new spending for green measures after the prime minister set out his 10-point plan for a climate revolution last week which will be backed by £12bn of funding, including about £4bn of new spending commitments. The exception was a windfall for green transport, including £120m for an extra 500 zero-emissions buses next year, and £950m to future-proof the electricity grid along motorways so that private investors can install high-powered charging hubs at every motorway service area by 2023.",Rishi Sunak; Spending review 2020; Infrastructure; Business; Politics; UK news,Politics
2021-03-12T10:08:50Z,"Green jobs in Cumbria could far surpass posts in coalmine, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/12/green-jobs-cumbria-could-far-surpass-posts-coalmine-report,"More than 9,000 green jobs could be created in Cumbria, according to a report, far more than the 500 jobs promised by a planned coalmine in the county. The report was published the day after the communities secretary reversed his original decision that the mine did not conflict with national policy and was a local matter. Robert Jenrick cited rising controversy and new climate advice as reasons for the U-turn. The government had been criticised by its own climate advisers and leading scientists for failing to block the coalmine, which would produce fuel for steel production rather than electricity generation. Critics said the pit plan seriously undermined the UK’s leadership as it prepares to host a crucial UN climate summit in November. There will now be a public inquiry but it is unclear whether the final decision will be made before the UN summit. The report said the green jobs in Cumbria would mostly result from a quadrupling of renewable energy and energy efficiency overhauls of 90% of buildings over the next 15 years. All seven councils in Cumbria have pledged to become carbon neutral and a target to be net zero by 2037 has been set by the Zero Carbon Cumbria Partnership, which is co-chaired by the county council. Creating the jobs would require many billions of pounds in investment, but the report’s backers said the government’s commitment to a green industrial revolution and to levelling up less affluent parts of the country could support this. “We have a global responsibility to do our bit,” said Karen Mitchell, the chief executive of Cumbria Action for Sustainability, the organisation that commissioned the report. “The coalmine is just looking backwards: why invest in that instead of in new technologies that have a longer-term future?” She added: “We’re in a climate emergency and Cumbria is often at the frontline of that.” The county has been hit by the worst flooding in centuries in recent years, with scientists finding the 2015 floods were made significantly more likely by global heating. Mitchell said she understood the need for jobs in the county, some parts of which are among the poorest in England. But she said green jobs bring additional benefits such as cutting people’s heating bills, reducing air pollution and boosting healthy travel such as cycling: “There are lots of co-benefits that you don’t get when you’re sending people down a deep dark hole.” Prof Rebecca Willis from the University of Lancaster said: “The Whitehaven coalmine proposals are totally at odds with UK climate legislation. Cumbria shouldn’t be chasing dirty jobs with no future, it should be working with government to bring green investment to an area that really needs it.” Cumbria council approved the mine in October. But as the backlash grew, the council said in February it would reconsider the decision in order to take into account climate advice published in December by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the same advice now cited by Jenrick. If approved, the £165m project would be the UK’s first underground mine in 30 years and produce 2.7m tonnes of coking coal a year. The government said this coal would otherwise have to be imported, but about 85% of the coal is planned for export and there is no shortage of such coal globally. West Cumbria Mining, the company behind the plan, threatened legal action against the council last week, while opponents have also threatened court action against the government. The green jobs report, funded by a philanthropic foundation, estimated that 5,800 jobs could be created in renewable energy, mostly onshore wind and solar. Another 2,000 jobs could be in retrofitting most of the 250,000 dwellings in Cumbria, and 500 jobs could be in waste management, increasing the recycling rate to 90%. A government spokesperson said: “The UK is a world leader in the fight against climate change, and we are determined to seize the economic opportunities and build back greener from the pandemic by supporting up to 2m green jobs across the country – including Cumbria – by 2030.” The government said its £12bn plan for a green industrial revolution would unlock three times as much private sector investment and support up to 250,000 green jobs by 2030. On Thursday, the government announced a £95m investment in two new offshore wind ports to be constructed in the Humber region and Teesside, creating 6,000 jobs. It plans to end coal burning in power stations by October 2024. Some northern MPs reacted angrily to Jenrick’s U-turn, with one, Mark Jenkinson, calling it a “kick in the teeth”, but Greenpeace said it was “better late than never”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “After months of pressure, ministers have finally been forced to act. The government must now block the mine and focus instead on creating low-carbon jobs in Cumbria and across the country with a proper green stimulus.”",Coal; Cumbria; Climate crisis; Energy; Green jobs; Fossil fuels; Green politics; Mining; Green economy; Politics; UK news; Environment,Environment
2021-02-08T14:42:15Z,Queen's property manager and Treasury to get windfarm windfall of nearly £9bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/08/queens-treasury-windfarm-bp-offshore-seabed-rights,"The Queen and the Treasury could receive an offshore windfarm windfall of up to £9bn over the next decade, after an auction of seabed plots attracted runaway bids from energy companies including the oil company BP. The crown estate’s first auction of its seabed licences in a decade will earn the Queen’s property manager £879m a year, for up to 10 years, and clear the way for six new offshore windfarms and enough clean electricity generation for more than 7m homes. Under current rules, the crown estate hands its profits to the Treasury before 25% is returned to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant – a funding formula that is due to be reviewed next year. The existing arrangements would more than double the profits made by the Queen and the Treasury from the crown estate, which reported profits of £345m for the last financial year. The Treasury would be in line for up to £659m a year from offshore wind after handing the Queen a share worth close to £220m a year to run the official royal household and pay for repairs to Buckingham Palace. The sum payable to the royal household would be well above the £86m grant in the current financial year – and lead to payments of up to £2bn over 10 years – unless the Treasury decides to adjust the rules next year. The sovereign grant was increased in 2017, from its previous level of 15%, to pay for extensive renovations at Buckingham Palace which are likely to run until 2027. It will stay at 25% at least until the next five-year review in 2021-22. The crown estate’s windfall comes after it received record-breaking bids from energy companies, including big oil and gas producers, hoping to build offshore windfarms off the coast of England and Wales. Oil company BP and its partner, the Germany utility EnBW, will pay £462m a year for the option to develop two offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea, capable of powering more than 3.4m UK households with clean electricity. BP claims it will avoid paying the option fee for the maximum 10-year term by making a final investment decision on the project within four years, and generating electricity from its turbines after seven. At this point the “rent” due to the crown estate would fall to 2% of the windfarm’s annual turnover. Dev Sanyal, the head of BP’s renewable energy business, said he was very confident the company would be able to use its experience delivering multibillion-pound offshore projects to make returns of 8% to 10% on its investment, despite the high upfront cost to the crown estate. The size of the crown estate’s windfall has reignited calls for the profits of the offshore wind industry to be channelled into a “green sovereign wealth fund” that could invest in more green energy projects or local communities. The Green party co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, said the initial capital from a renewable windfall could be invested “for future generations, similar to what we’ve seen the likes of Alaska and Norway do in the past with their oil wealth”. “The boom in value of the right to develop offshore wind is so welcome – a signal that the transition away from fossil fuels is happening at speed. But we need to ensure that the value of this national resource is shared fairly and invested for all our futures,” he said. The crown estate had hoped to avoid a “runaway” auction by overhauling the auction rules in 2019, but industry players that lost out in the recent bidding round claim the changes did not go far enough and allowed for “bonkers” prices that could inflate the cost of the UK meeting its climate targets. The renewable energy arm of Germany’s RWE won the option to develop two offshore windfarms in the Dogger Bank area off the coast of North Yorkshire at a cost of £248m a year, and a joint venture between the French oil company Total and the Green Investment Group won the option to develop a windfarm at a cost of £125m a year. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the energy minister, said the crown estate’s latest leasing round would help power 7m homes and assist the UK in eliminating its contribution to carbon emissions by 2050 while “creating thousands of new jobs and ensuring Britain builds back greener”.",Energy industry; Wind power; Business; BP; Energy; Environment; Renewable energy; Monarchy; UK news,Business
2020-07-28T18:04:31Z,The Guardian view on the green recovery: Britain is being left behind | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-green-recovery-britain-is-being-left-behind,"Senior figures in this government like to view themselves as insurgents against a hidebound Whitehall establishment. This is partly because Boris Johnson won the last election after pledging to “get Brexit done”, breaking the post-referendum stalemate in parliament. But it is also settled wisdom in Downing Street, and in the Treasury, that a more general shake-up is required of Britain’s body politic if it is to become more lithe and nimble, and get ahead of the game. More evidence of this desire to disrupt came on Tuesday in the form of a speech by Stephen Barclay, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Addressing a centre-right thinktank, Mr Barclay heralded a new era of state spending in which the ethos of Silicon Valley would inform departmental decision-making. In the spirit of west coast venture capitalists, government ministers and their civil servants would back schemes that took risks and which would therefore sometimes fail. The interminable delays and inveterate caution that have blighted government projects and investment would become a thing of the past. Inculcating this new Whitehall worldview is seen as fundamental to speedily delivering the “infrastructure revolution” promised by Mr Johnson at the end of last month. The rhetoric is beguilingly avant garde and dynamic (Mr Barclay talked of the Treasury’s “new radicals”). It should also be said that the prospect of a proactive industrial strategy is welcome after lost years of lazy, laissez-faire rhetoric from the likes of George Osborne. But it is ironic that while the government talks a good game, it risks falling grievously behind Britain’s competitors in one of the growth areas that will define the future. The progress made towards a post-Covid-19 green recovery for Britain is proceeding at a snail’s pace. By contrast, Germany, France, South Korea and others have unveiled plans that will pump vast amounts of government money into developing a low-carbon economy. Last month, Berlin announced a £9bn national hydrogen strategy, which it sees as a route to decarbonising transport and core domestic industries, and achieving global leadership in a new sector. Britain has yet to show anything like the same level of environmental ambition. Renowned climate experts such as Nicholas Stern and Lady Brown of Cambridge, the chair of the Carbon Trust, would like to see the establishment of a new green investment bank to generate some momentum and confidence. Lord Stern estimates that about £20bn worth of public money would be needed to set one up. This would be a certain catalyst for major private investment; one recent report estimated that £5bn in public funds could attract up to £100bn in private capital for green projects. The energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has declared his support for the idea. But following parliamentary recess, no decision seems likely before Rishi Sunak’s autumn statement. There is no more time to lose. As Lady Brown has pointed out, in areas such as the production of green hydrogen, Britain has world-leading innovators in a market that is still embryonic and in need of support. Given a fair wind, these companies could expand to become global players in the developing market for green technologies, as well as driving a new generation of carbon-neutral infrastructure at home. But vibrant green growth will only become a reality if government plays its part in a committed public-private partnership. According to the Committee on Climate Change, Britain is manifestly not on course to meet its legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. The committee chair, John Gummer, told a government inquiry that this was because the “radical things’ that needed to be done to shape a green recovery were not being done. A properly funded and ambitious green investment bank could be a gamechanger. Mr Barclay’s “new radicals” should get to it.",Green economy; Environment; Green Investment Bank; Green jobs; Infrastructure; Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy; Business; Climate crisis; Steve Barclay; Politics; Boris Johnson; Conservatives,Opinion
2021-02-24T06:00:02Z,"Be 'muscular' and drive green recovery, Cameron tells Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/24/be-muscular-and-drive-green-recovery-cameron-tells-johnson,"Boris Johnson must be “muscular” in reshaping the economy to bring about a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, former prime minister David Cameron has said, calling for an active policy of industrial intervention. Cameron, who as prime minister from 2010 to 2016 oversaw the UK’s recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, said the lessons from that recession were clear. “My advice would be, from what I learnt, is that as well as the framework [of climate and economic policy], you have to roll up your sleeves and be quite muscular in your interventionism,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “The government has got a strong framework for green energy policy and in green investment, much of which we put in place, but it needs to combine that with active assistance and helping with key green investments that can make a difference,” he said. “There’s every opportunity for this recovery to be a green recovery.” Cameron pointed to the example of his government encouraging the German company Siemens to build a wind turbine factory in Hull. “That is a transformational investment, that only happened because we really helped to make it happen. We cleared all the obstacles out of the way, we helped in lots of different ways. And I think there’ll be lots of opportunities like that [for Johnson],” he said. Johnson has been seen as an instinctively free-market, anti-interventionist Tory in the past, though his response to the coronavirus crisis has shown a willingness to tear up the rulebook. Cameron said that even Conservative prime ministers could overrule the free market when they wanted to. “[Being] Conservative is not intervening everywhere all the time but being quite selective. That’s what Margaret Thatcher was with the motor industry, getting Toyota and Nissan and Honda to come to Britain,” he said. Cameron also wants the government to show leadership on the climate ahead of the UK’s hosting of the Cop26 UN climate summit this November in Glasgow, and as holder of the revolving G7 presidency this year. The former prime minister has joined Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, former Irish president Mary Robinson, and other current and former heads of state, to focus attention on fragile states, and the opportunity to use solar and wind power to bring electric power to the 800 million people who lack it. The Council on State Fragility, of which Cameron is co-chair, issued a call to action to the G7 on Wednesday, with a report that found 90% of the world’s 800 million people who lack electricity live in fragile states. Aid donors gave only $460m for fragile states to gain energy access in 2018, which the council said fell well short of the sums needed. Sirleaf warned: “The Covid-19 crisis has derailed decades of progress on extreme poverty and will continue to have devastating indirect effects on fragile states. A global, concerned push to invest in clean energy in fragile countries could transform lives by powering homes, businesses, schools and hospitals, which will be critical for these countries to recover.” Cameron said solar and wind power were now cheap options to bring power to countries beset by conflict, deepening poverty and instability. “All the stars are in alignment, because distributed green energy systems have become way more cost effective, they’re way more available, and this links in with people’s desire to see action taken to deal with climate change and shortage of electricity in a sustainable way,” he said. “This year with the [UK presidency of] the G7 and the Cop coming at the same time, it’s a very good moment to try and get it done.” Cameron said the government’s decision to cut the overseas aid budget, which he set at 0.7% of GDP, to 0.5%, was “a big mistake” ahead of Cop26 and the UK’s G7 presidency. “It’s both a tragedy and a mistake … particularly as Britain is making its way in the post-Brexit world and wants to prove that it is a global power and can still punch above its weight, and has important elements of soft power. Our aid budget was an absolutely key element [of soft power].” Cameron refused to criticise the government, as many others have done, for giving the green light to a new coal mine in Cumbria. “I need to look at this more,” he said. “When I was prime minister, we really moved decisively away from coal for power. We still have an iron and steel industry that imports coking coal.” He added: “I try to limit my criticism of the government to one at any one time. And what’s happened over DFID [the former Department for International Development, which was axed], and aid is the thing I have called the government out on. On climate change and the targets they’ve set, I think they are still pursuing a very much world-leading strategy, which is what I put in place, and they’ve added to it with more aggressive targets, and I think that’s all to the good.”",David Cameron; Environment; Boris Johnson; Renewable energy; Economic growth (GDP); Coronavirus; UK news; Politics; Cop26; Wind power; Conservatives; Department for International Development (DfID); Energy; World news; Foreign policy,Politics
2020-12-11T14:00:10Z,Starmer urged to start cooperating with Lib Dems if he wants to win,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/11/starmer-urged-to-start-cooperating-with-lib-dems-if-he-wants-labour-to-win,"Keir Starmer is being urged to lay the groundwork for cooperating with the Liberal Democrats and Greens at the next general election, by MPs and campaigners who argue the party will struggle to win a majority alone. In a new report, called We Divide, They Conquer, the progressive pressure group Compass sets out the scale of the electoral challenge facing Starmer’s party after last year’s general election. It warns that Labour would need to achieve a swing of 10.52% – larger than Tony Blair’s in 1997 or Clement Attlee’s in 1945 – to win the 124 seats Starmer requires to secure a fragile majority of one. “The electoral facts point to one conclusion: Labour will struggle to win alone. So the party can choose to lose alone and remain in opposition, or build cross-party alliances, lead a new government and transform the democratic landscape,” the report says. While Boris Johnson’s Conservatives would need a swing of just 3.18% against them to lose their majority, the Lib Dems are in a better position to take some of the Tories’ most vulnerable seats. The report, written by the activists Grace Barnett and Neal Lawson, identifies 59 seats it calls “progressive tragedies”, where the combined vote of Labour and the Lib Dems would have been enough to beat the Conservatives and the Brexit party in 2019. They include London constituencies such as Wimbledon, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon as well as “red wall” seats such as Bury North, Derby North and Bolton North East. There is a history of fierce tribal enmity between Lib Dem and Labour activists at grassroots level, but the report highlights areas of policy agreement. These include a significant increase in green investment; reform or replacement of universal credit; ending rough sleeping, and reform or abolition of the House of Lords. But the authors argue that a commitment to backing a more proportional voting system would open the door to a much closer relationship with other progressive parties, which have long supported the idea. “Labour making a firm commitment to back PR would be a game changer for the Lib Dems and the Greens, incentivising them to campaign and vote tactically. This would make it easier for progressives to elect a Labour-led administration, with a big democratic mandate to introduce PR,” they say. During his leadership campaign, Starmer said: “We’ve got to address the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and they feel their vote doesn’t count” – though he did not go on to spell out an alternative. Compass is setting up groups of activists in Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens, who will work to establish cross-party links and cooperate on shared policy priorities. The Labour MP Clive Lewis will launch the report at an event on Monday alongside the Lib Dem MP and former leadership candidate Layla Moran, the Green MP Caroline Lucas, and the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard. Lewis described the current electoral system as “like a game of monopoly where the Tories are always the banker”. Asked how Labour’s leadership should be preparing to collaborate with other parties, he said: “It’s about humility: it’s about accepting that you don’t have a monopoly on wisdom. There are still so many people in the parliamentary Labour party who think, just with the right leader and the right policies we can win outright, and dictate the future. But the future isn’t going to be dictated, it’s going to be negotiated.” The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, has made clear his focus is on rebuilding the party after the bruising electoral defeat that saw his predecessor Jo Swinson lose her seat. But Lib Dem sources pointed out that the most plausible way of ejecting Johnson from Downing Street involved the Lib Dems, as well as Labour, taking seats from the Tories.",Labour; Keir Starmer; Politics; UK news; Liberal Democrats; Green party; Electoral reform,Politics
2021-03-02T18:05:45Z,UK green recovery: 'government stuck in past' warns Labour,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/02/uk-green-recovery-government-stuck-in-past-warns-labour,"Public investment is desperately needed to kickstart a green economic recovery in the UK, but the government is stuck in the past and reluctant to make the interventions needed, Labour has warned. Ed Miliband, shadow business secretary, told the Guardian: “We need a proper green stimulus. Governments all around the world are recognising that if you want to do the transition [to net zero carbon emissions] governments need to step up. But this government is incredibly reluctant to do what is necessary.” He blamed an outlook of free-market Conservatism that he said was failing to keep up with the need for economic intervention that the challenges of Covid-19 and the climate crisis demand. “This government is allergic to the kind of industry support and intervention that is required. They are stuck in the past, fundamentally they believe in leaving it to the market – but the market can’t cure this.” Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, will unveil this year’s budget on Wednesday and is expected to nod towards a green recovery with £22bn for a new infrastructure bank, and cash for hi-tech projects such as hydrogen and carbon capture. But Miliband warned that key measures, such as renovating homes to make them low-carbon, supporting key industries in the transition to net zero emissions, and overhauling key sectors such as transport and agriculture were likely to be missing. “There is a massive chasm between this government’s green rhetoric and their lack of action,” he told the Guardian. “This budget is the last chance to get the green recovery right.” He called for measures to help key industries reduce their emissions, including aerospace, car manufacturing and steel-making. “The government has high ambitions [for these industries] but is offering low support for them,” he said. For instance, he said, the government set a target of banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, but made little move to put in place a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. On renewable energy, the government has encouraged the building of offshore windfarms, but done little to help companies set up manufacturing in the UK, so that most of the turbines will be made overseas. Miliband also pointed to the chaos surrounding the green homes grant, the flagship green measure announced in last year’s stimulus spending plan. The grant, which provides up to £10,000 for people to insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating, has proved popular, with more than 100,000 applications submitted and many more people wishing to apply. But poor implementation meant fewer than 3,000 measures were installed in the first six months, while many applicants have been left unanswered and builders unpaid. Sunak now intends to withdraw more than £1bn in unspent funding, and may axe the scheme altogether. That would leave the UK without any plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from homes, which make up 40% of the UK’s carbon output. Meanwhile, new homes are being built to poor standards of insulation and with high-carbon heating. Miliband said: “It’s because the attitude of the government is to leave it all to the market. It has been privatised and outsourced, with a piecemeal approach. The money could have been given to local authorities more effectively. The way to do this is to renovate housing street by street.” Even the former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, has called for a more interventionist policy. Cameron, who was prime minister from 2010 to 2016, recalled his experience in leading the UK after the financial crisis of 2008. “My advice would be, from what I learned, is that as well as the framework [of climate and economic policy], you have to roll up your sleeves and be quite muscular in your interventionism,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “The government has got a strong framework for green energy policy and in green investment, much of which we put in place, but it needs to combine that with active assistance and helping with key green investments that can make a difference,” he said. “There’s every opportunity for this recovery to be a green recovery.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change. We are powering forward with the prime minister’s 10-point plan and our energy white paper, implementing our commitments at speed so the UK can build back greener and meet its net zero target. This year we will bring forward further bold proposals, including a net zero strategy, to cut emissions and create new jobs and industries across the whole country – going further and faster than almost any other nation towards protecting our planet for this generation and those to come.” Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, also called for more investment in greening homes, saying reports that the green homes grant would be axed were “deeply concerning”. The Lib Dems are proposing £150bn in spending over three years in areas on green recovery measures. “In the year of Cop26, the chancellor has a real opportunity to seize the initiative and show that the UK is a world leader in tackling the climate emergency. To show global leadership and build a strong recovery from Covid-19 we need real ambition from the chancellor,” he said. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, joined the calls for investment in green jobs and infrastructure, which she said would bring widespread benefits to the economy and to people’s health and wellbeing. “We are still waiting to see the policies and action backed up with the necessary investment to build back greener,” she warned. “The success of the G7 and Cop26 summits this year in leading to greater climate ambition depend on the UK demonstrating true leadership, rather than just talking about it – and the budget is the last opportunity to do that.”",Business; Green economy; Ed Miliband; Politics; Environment; UK news,Business
2021-01-14T10:00:34Z,"Countries adapting too slowly to climate breakdown, UN warns",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/14/countries-adapting-too-slowly-to-climate-breakdown-un-warns,"Millions of people around the world are facing disaster from flood, droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather, as governments fail to take the measures needed to adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, the UN has warned. Nearly three-quarters of countries around the world have recognised the need to plan for the effects of global heating, but few of those plans are adequate to the rising threat, and little funding has been made available to put them into force, according to the UN environment programme’s Adaptation report 2020, published on Thursday. Last year was the joint hottest on record, with a heatwave in Siberia, wildfires in Australia and the US, a destructive Atlantic hurricane season and storms and floods in many parts of Asia. But spending on measures to adapt to extreme weather has failed to keep pace with the rising need, according to UNEP. Only about $30bn (£22bn) is provided each year in development aid, to help poor countries cope with the effects of the climate crisis, which is less than half of the $70bn currently estimated to be needed. Those costs are set to increase further, to between $140bn and $300bn by the end of the decade. About half of global climate finance should be devoted to adaptation, the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has said, with the rest going to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, while private companies are often willing to provide funding for some projects to reduce emissions, such as profitable renewable energy generation schemes in rapidly emerging economies, projects that help people adapt to the impact of climate change, such as early warning systems, flood barriers or storm drains, are often more difficult to finance. Many countries will also struggle to find the resources for climate adaptation because of the coronavirus pandemic, the UN warned. The economic impacts of Covid-19 have pushed adaptation further down the political agenda across the world, while in the longer term the consequences of the pandemic are likely to put additional pressures on public finances, and “might change national and donor priorities in support of climate action”. The UK government recently slashed its overseas aid budget, though the climate spending portion has been maintained. Yet if countries were to prioritise a “green recovery” in their Covid-19 economic stimulus packages, they could help to solve many of these problems, UNEP noted. Economic studies have shown that measures to increase resilience to the impacts of the climate crisis – including planting trees, building flood barriers, restoring natural landscapes and protecting and updating infrastructure such as transport and communications networks – can all provide “shovel-ready” jobs of the kind needed to lift economies out of recession. That opportunity will be missed if countries stick to the economic rescue packages announced to date, which so far have failed to focus on a green recovery, according to the report. The report also found that nature-based solutions should be prioritised. These include planting trees to act as carbon sinks, and as natural flood barriers; restoring mangrove swamps as buffers against coastal storms and sea level rises; halting the destruction of coral reefs; re-wetting bogs and wetlands; and allowing areas of degraded land to regenerate naturally. These tend to be among the most cost-effective ways to adapt to extreme weather, and many also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as healthy soils, vegetation, seas and landscapes store more carbon than degraded land and seas. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while an important priority, will not be enough to erase the need to adapt to increasing extreme weather. The report found that the world would face a rising toll from climate impacts, even if the goals of the Paris agreement – limiting temperature rises to well below 2C, with an aspiration of holding heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – are met. Temperatures have already risen by 1C above the historic norm. Inger Andersen, the executive director of UNEP, said: “We are not saying we can adapt our way out of climate change, but the impacts of failing to invest in adaptation to climate change will be very severe, and it is the poorest in wealthy countries and the poorest in the world who will pay the highest price, and who are most exposed to these impacts.” She said extreme weather events were already taking a toll, so governments should see adaptation as an urgent issue. “The more we can expedite adaption investments, the lower the human costs and the economic costs will be,” she said. “It makes good sense for society.” While governments are struggling with the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, they should plan to use stimulus money with a view to making their countries more resilient to the impact of the climate crisis. “There is a massive injection of the next generation’s money into the Covid recovery – are we going to leave the next generation with a massive debt as well as a broken planet?” She said the first wave of stimulus spending had not prioritised green investment, but that further waves of spending should do so. “There are opportunities here,” she added.",Climate crisis; Extreme weather; United Nations; Flooding; Hurricanes; Environment; World news; Climate finance,Environment
2020-11-25T21:03:15Z,The green bank went south; let's hope Sunak's new version succeeds,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/nov/25/the-green-bank-went-south-lets-hope-sunaks-new-version-succeeds,"A new national infrastructure bank, you say, Mr Sunak, to help reach our carbon reduction targets? Didn’t we used to have one of those? Yes, here it is: the Green Investment Bank (GIB). It was sold to Macquarie of Australia for £1.6bn in 2017. Still, at least GIB offered proof of concept. It wasn’t really a bank, more an investor in hard-to-finance green projects, which covered everything from windfarms to street lighting systems. It succeeded in attracting private capital in its wake and, crucially, made a profit. There was a £186m gain on disposal for the Treasury. The silliness was selling it. George Osborne never sounded enamoured by his own 2012 creation (some thought it a sop to the Lib Dems in coalition days) and Theresa May was probably too distracted by Brexit to stop the sale process. The National Audit Office was scathing, as this column had been, about the airy pledges extracted from Macquarie on future investment. So here we go again, this time motivated in part by the need to replace funding from the European Investment Bank. Let’s hope the government offers proper backing this time. Done well, this stuff works. Roadworthy AA? A six-page passage in the AA’s takeover document should have been titled “confessions of a debt addict”. Here’s the most startling statistic: over the past five years, the AA paid £715m of cash interest on its debts and forked out £166m in refinancing charges. No wonder there was little to spare for paying down the £3.1bn of borrowings that were loaded onto AA when it was shunted onto the stock market by its last set of private equity owners, CVC and Permira, in 2014. Six years later, the tally still stands at £2.6bn and the heaviest reduction work was done years ago – a £175m equity placing in 2015 and the sale of AA Ireland for £99m in 2016. The company has mostly been working for its lenders, as the document makes clear. It was for them that investment was cut when trading profits went into reverse between 2016 and 2018, with predictable effects on membership numbers. Surrender to the lowball £219m bid from Towerbrook and Warburg Pincus is humiliating, but alternatives don’t exist. The banks will not extend a £165m liquidity facility, due to expire next June, unless fresh equity is injected. Shareholders do not want to chase their losses. It is traditional to blame CVC and Permira for the mess but equal blame should attach to the financial firms that backed the float in 2014, declaring, in effect, the AA to be roadworthy despite its debts. Who were they? From the 2014 announcement: Aviva, Blackrock, CRMC, GLG Partners, Henderson Global, Henderson Volantis, Invesco, L&amp;G and Lansdowne Partners. Superior financial analysis was available. This is what Paul Grafton, GMB’s regional officer, representing the AA’s poor old staff – the forgotten party amid the leverage lunacy – told the Financial Times in June 2014: “GMB is baffled as to who would want to get into owning AA given that it is trussed with billions of debts to pay for the cash taken out of it by the private equity owners.” Spot on. Future shaky amid GoCompare deal The magazine and website publisher Future, whose chief executive is Zillah Byng-Thorne, is buying GoCo, the GoCompare owner whose non-executive directors include her. She hasn’t been negotiating with herself – governance guidelines cover these rare situations – but the market still looked quizzically at the £594m cash-and-shares deal. Future’s shares plunged 17%. One can understand why. First, Byng-Thorne used the ugly management buzzword “adjacencies”, which is usually code for an adventure into unfamiliar territory. She did her best to explain the thinking: readers of PC Gamer magazine don’t just want to know the best games and computers, which Future can already help with, they also want to see the best broadband deals, which is where GoCompare would come in. Similarly, readers of Real Homes might want to compare energy tariffs. Well, maybe, but punters, annoyingly, sometimes wander all over the place if they feel the “purchase journey” is a little too mapped out for them. The fit may not be as neat as the theory says it should be. Second, the person genuinely on the other side of the negotiating table was Sir Peter Wood, GoCo’s 29.5% owner. Wood has not made two fortunes from insurance – by founding Direct Line and Esure – without knowing when to deal. He will convert the larger part of his GoCo stock into Future paper, which should comfort both sets of shareholders. But Future’s crew clearly still need some convincing.",Rishi Sunak; Green Investment Bank; Financial advisers; Corporate governance; Investing; Future Publishing; Business; Shares; UK news; Spending review 2020,Business
2020-11-09T08:00:04Z,Will Mitch McConnell strangle Joe Biden's legislative program at birth?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/09/will-mitch-mcconnell-strangle-joe-bidens-legislative-program-at-birth,"After celebrating the winning of a Joe Biden presidency, Democrats are waking to the hangover of figuring out how to govern under the shadow of a runaway pandemic and the potential for gridlock imposed by the man who likes to call himself the Grim Reaper, the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell. The imagined “blue wave” that was to bring Democratic control over the Senate did not materialize, but Biden’s party has not entirely given up hope. There will be two Senate run-off races in Georgia on 5 January, and if Democrats win both, that will scrape a 50-50 tie in the chamber, allowing Kamala Harris, as vice-president, to cast tie-breaking votes. It is not impossible. Voter registration drives look to have succeeded in turning the state blue in the presidential election for the first time since 1992. But it will be an uphill task, and most Georgia observers expect the parties to emerge from the runoffs with one seat apiece, leaving the Senate split 51-49 in the Republicans’ favor. In that case, a Biden presidency would have to contend with the veteran senator from Kentucky who relishes the nickname of Grim Reaper for his lethal treatment of almost all Democratic legislation. He said in 2010 that “the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president”. McConnell failed in that task but made up for it by killing off mounds of Democratic legislation and Obama nominations for administrative positions. So despite winning more votes than anyone in US political history, Biden will have to share power with the head of a chamber in which Wyoming (population 586,107) has the same clout as California (nearly 40 million). “Mitch McConnell will force Joe Biden to negotiate every single cabinet secretary, every single district court judge, every single US attorney with him,” the Democratic senator Chris Murphy told Politico. “My guess is we’ll have a constitutional crisis pretty immediately.” The immediate impact will be on Biden’s freedom to pick a cabinet. Left-of-centre candidates like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, would be ruled out, as would be officials that Senate Republicans have a grudge against, like the former national security adviser Susan Rice and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams who helped Biden’s likely win in Georgia. It will also crush Biden’s aspirations of becoming a latter-day Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with large-scale public investment aimed at creating a low-carbon US economy. Biden could try peeling off the small handful of moderate Republican senators for critical votes, like Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah or Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, but the fear of attacks from the right will remain a powerful disciplinary tool on Republicans even after Trump has left office. Recruiting centrist Republicans might work for individual pieces of legislation but it is unlikely to represent a reliable strategy for governing. That ultimately might depend on the potential for compromise between two old men, both born in 1942, who spent much of their lives in the Senate. The optimists point that McConnell was the only Republican senator to attend the funeral of Biden’s eldest son, Beau, in 2015. “When President Obama and Senator McConnell were at loggerheads over legislation, on more than one occasion McConnell’s office let it be known that if the White House would send Biden to negotiate, the chances of reaching a successful compromise would be substantially enhanced, and that is in fact what happened. So there’s a history here that’s not entirely discouraging,” said William Galston, who was deputy assistant for domestic policy in the Clinton administration. But Galston, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, added that McConnell’s obstructionist record under Obama was significantly less hopeful portent. “If Senator McConnell makes the same decision this time, we’re in for a very grim two years,” he said Wendy Schiller, political science professor at Brown University, argued that Biden might be able to sell some Republicans on infrastructure-building legislation as long as it was not sold as green investment. But overall, Schiller thought Biden would have to be realistic over what will be possible under cohabitation with McConnell. “I think he understands what his job is. It’s not going to be to pass sweeping legislation – this is no FDR or Lyndon Johnson. This is a guy trying to get us back on track to some sort of normalcy in governance,” she said. “That’s Biden’s job, and anybody who’s expecting any grand legislative measures is just living in fantasyland.” • This article was amended on 9 November 2020.

2020-07-06T23:01:15Z,Multibillion-dollar gas projects in jeopardy as global market collapses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/07/multibillion-dollar-gas-projects-in-jeopardy-as-global-market-collapses,"A multibillion-dollar pipeline of projects aiming to ship gas around the world on giant tankers could be in jeopardy because of a collapse in the global gas market, according to a report. A study by Global Energy Monitor has found that spending on new gas terminals needed to ship super-chilled liquified natural gas (LNG) on seaborne tankers has more than doubled in the past year, from $82.8bn (£66.3bn) to $196.1bn. However, many of these projects risk being abandoned because of a glut of fossil fuel supply, which could cause the “gas bubble” to burst. The global market price of LNG had tumbled to record lows before the coronavirus outbreak and has fallen further as lockdown measures across the world’s major economies continue to sap demand for fossil fuels. Ted Nace, the executive director of Global Energy Monitor, said: “LNG’s problems won’t magically disappear with the end of the pandemic. In the power sector, modelling shows that renewable packages are already outcompeting imported gas in South Korea. And every year that goes by, renewables get more competitive.” In a separate report, HSBC warned that the global gas market will remain oversupplied, “not just in 2020 but through most of this decade”. The bank said many LNG projects that are due to begin operations in the middle of the decade will be cancelled or delayed and those that move ahead can expect weaker than expected returns. Greig Aitken, a research analyst at Global Energy Monitor, said LNG was “once considered a safe bet” for investors but is now “beset with problems” because of an oversupply of gas in the market and waning interest in fossil fuels. A decade ago LNG was considered by many to be a “green” investment because burning gas for power emits roughly half the emissions as burning coal and could play a role in dramatically reducing carbon emissions in countries that rely on coal. The LNG boom was stoked by the US shale gas boom, which led to major investments in US export terminals and new import terminals across Asia and Europe. However, many countries have since adopted renewable energy at a quicker than expected rate and are relying on pipelines to import gas at a lower cost than shipping LNG cargoes by sea. Andrew McDowell, the European Investment Bank’s vice-president, said investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure including LNG is “increasingly an economically unsound decision”.",Gas; Business; Commodities; Energy industry; World news; Fossil fuels; Coronavirus,Business
2020-07-14T17:32:51Z,Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z tap into rising alt-milk star Oatly,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/14/oprah-winfrey-and-jay-z-tap-into-rising-alt-milk-star-oatly,"Oatly has sold a minority $200m (£157m) stake to a group of high-profile investors that includes Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z in a deal that values the fashionable Swedish alt-milk brand at $2bn. Malmö-based Oatly is riding high as demand for plant-based milk alternatives soars, with more people switching to vegan or vegetarian diets. The American private equity firm Blackstone, Jay-Z’s entertainment company Roc Nation, Natalie Portman and former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz are among its new shareholders, the company said. While demand for traditional cows’ milk is falling, sales of alt-milk, made from oats, almonds or coconuts, are growing fast, particularly among under-40s, who are willing to spend more on sustainable products that are also deemed healthy. The company says its mission is to turn what people eat and drink into “moments of healthy joy without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources”. It has certainly turned consumers on to oat milk with sales almost doubling to $200m last year, aided by new products including ice-cream and yoghurt. Oatly chief executive Toni Petersson said: “I understand that it may sound naive to actually believe Oatly can change the world – that the impact of what we do can inspire others to make changes that will lead to a global behavioural shift among consumers – but that’s fine.” The cash would be used to fund expansion, including new production plants, and to create jobs in Europe, the US and Asia, he said. Although cows’ milk is still a far bigger market, worth more than £3bn a year in the UK, Britons are buying fewer pints of it than their parents. What was once touted as a one-stop source of health is slipping out of fashion; the average person’s milk consumption in the UK has halved since the 1950s. However, last year UK sales of oat milk more than doubled to £74m, according to the research firm Mintel. The $200m investment represents about a 10% stake in Oatly, putting the firm’s value at about $2bn, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story. The move is being billed as a prelude to a possible stock market listing. Petersson added that getting a major investor such as Blackstone on board was a clear indication that the world is heading in a “new, more sustainable direction”. He said: “Investments from firms like Blackstone in companies like Oatly are a critical step in securing a future of focused green investment … and focuses on urgent, systemic efforts to address the climate crisis.”",Vegan food and drink; Dairy-free; Food & drink industry; Sweden; Jay-Z; Oprah Winfrey; Natalie Portman; Private equity; Corporate governance; Business; Europe,Food
2020-11-25T17:22:04Z,Rishi Sunak's spending review 'will fail to kickstart green recovery',https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/25/rishi-sunaks-spending-review-will-fail-to-kickstart-green-recovery,"A new infrastructure bank, to be based in the north of England, and an emissions-trading scheme covering large portions of industry were proclaimed by Rishi Sunak as evidence that the government is aligning its aim of rescuing the UK economy from the Covid-19 slump with its goal of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050. But for the most part, experts said the chancellor’s spending review and infrastructure strategy failed to give the kickstart to the green recovery that economists have been advising and green campaigners have urged. Of the £100bn to be invested in the UK’s infrastructure, only a fraction seems destined to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while large portions of the spending are in danger of locking in high emissions far into the future. Road-building schemes will account for £27bn, and while housebuilding is a key aim there are few safeguards to ensure new houses will be zero-carbon. There is also little to guarantee that the £4bn “levelling-up fund” will avoid propping up the high-carbon economy. Pedro Guertler, clean economy programme leader at the E3G thinktank, said: “The £1.1bn for green buildings is only 1% of the total [infrastructure] budget. This will not be enough to get on track to net zero.” He called for further multi-year funding for green buildings to give the supply chain confidence to invest. Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of sustainable businesses, said: “A key task for the government in the near future will be to introduce new regulations and market mechanisms to drive private-sector low carbon investment in critical areas such as buildings, heavy industry and nature restoration.” There was praise for the chancellor’s plan for a new national infrastructure bank, but experts warned that it must be given a clear mandate and adequate funding to ensure its investments drive a green economy. “A net zero mission must be put at the heart of the institution,” said Kate Levick, of E3G. “It must also be given full banking powers, an independent remit, and the capital needed to drive our green recovery.” The government’s last attempt, the Green Investment Bank, was sold off only a few years into its mandate, so experts want the latest version to have a long-term vision. Lord Stern of Brentford, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, said: “The new bank should play a vital role in fostering sustainable infrastructure projects and programmes, in managing the risks associated with infrastructure, and in providing assurance to the private sector that it can invest with confidence.” Green campaigners slammed the government for failing to follow through on pledges made last week of a “green industrial revolution” to shift the UK’s economy permanently to a low-carbon footing, set out in Boris Johnson’s 10-point plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Shaun Spiers, executive director of Green Alliance, contrasted Sunak’s announcements with last week’s pledges. “The chancellor’s statement was a chance to back [the 10-point plan] with serious money, but he muffed it. The chancellor gave no sense that he understands the scale of the climate and nature emergencies, or the potential of the green economy for immediate job creation across the country.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace, contrasted the UK’s attempts at a green recovery with those of EU rivals. “The chancellor appears not have pledged a single extra penny towards a green economic recovery today, while wasting tens of billions on polluting new roads,” she said. “This would be a failure for jobs, the economy and the future of our planet. France and Germany get it – they’re throwing a combined £63bn towards carbon-cutting stimulus measures.” Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, added: “With billions of pounds earmarked for a climate-wrecking road-building programme, and inadequate funding for home insulation, eco-heating, buses and cycling, this strategy falls woefully short of what’s needed to meet the UK’s legally-binding targets for building a green future.” There was concern at the lack of funding for infrastructure projects that restore the UK’s natural environment, despite assurances last week by the prime minister that it was a key aim. Hilary McGrady, director-general of the National Trust, said: “This year has shown how important nature and green space are to people. While we welcome confirmation that climate change and the environment remain an important priority for the government, we’ve not seen the long-term funding commitment to deliver the bold changes we need.” Climate campaigners were also dismayed by the slashing of the international aid budget. Pledges by rich nations to provide at least £100bn a year to the developing world from this year, to help poor countries cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, have been central to gaining support from the developing world for the Paris climate agreement. For the UK to renege on its aid spending would send a damaging signal to the developing world, just as the UK prepares to host the next vital climate summit, campaigners warned. “The decision to cut the aid budget will fundamentally undermine the UK’s climate leadership. It will hinder poorer countries’ ability to tackle and adapt to the climate emergency, and sour the UK’s diplomatic relationships in the run-up to the crucial Glasgow climate conference next year,” Newsom said.",Spending review 2020; Rishi Sunak; Politics; UK news; Environment; Coronavirus; Green jobs; Green economy,Politics
2020-09-23T13:49:48Z,Few countries living up to Covid 'green recovery' pledges – analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/23/few-countries-living-up-to-green-recovery-promises-analysis,"Few countries are living up to their promises of a “green recovery” from the coronavirus crisis, with hundreds of billions of dollars likely to be spent on economic rescue packages that increase greenhouse gas emissions, research has found. The US is planning nearly $3tn in spending with few environmental safeguards attached, and little money going to low-carbon efforts, while rolling back regulations that protect nature and the environment. Of the total US stimulus of about $2.98tn, only about $39bn is going towards green projects, according to the analysis. Among the world’s 20 biggest economies, only the UK, Germany and France as individual countries, and the EU as a whole, are planning for a green recovery in which the benefits to the climate and nature outweigh the negative impacts, according to an analysis, entitled the Greenness of Stimulus Index, by Vivid Economics as part of the Finance for Biodiversity initiative. The EU is leading on a green recovery with a €750bn package announced in June, which allocates 37% of funding to green initiatives that improve energy efficiency, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and invest in preserving and restoring nature. All loans and grants will also come with green strings attached, in the form of binding environmental requirements. South Korea is outperforming many of its rivals by spending about $52bn, equivalent to about 15% of its recovery package, on green funding, including support for electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel, over the next five years. Yet even that positive impact is likely to be outweighed by the government’s spending on high-carbon industries, according to the analysis. Separate analysis by Climate Action Tracker, also released on Wednesday, confirmed the EU’s leadership and the green stimulus from South Korea, and raised warnings over the US. Niklas Höhne, of NewClimate Institute, a partner to Climate Action Tracker, said: “Unfortunately, what we’re seeing more of is governments using the pandemic recovery to roll back climate legislation and bail out the fossil fuel industry.” This was particularly evident in the US, he said, but also happening in Brazil, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The UK announced £3bn to be spent on energy efficiency improvements, particularly home insulation, in the next year, but was criticised by green campaigners for failing to grasp other opportunities for low-carbon infrastructure, from electric vehicles to building out broadband to rural areas. One major question is over the role of China, which has given mixed signals on a green recovery. Over the past six months, the country has made plans for an increase in coal-fired power generation, to widespread concern among supporters of the Paris agreement. However, on Tuesday, at the UN general assembly, China’s president, Xi Jinping, committed the country to ensuring emissions peak and start to fall before the end of this decade, and are reduced to net zero by 2060. Such an effort would require sizeable green investment starting quickly, and would imply limits to the construction of new coal-fired power plants. China has yet to detail its plans following Xi’s announcement. Climate Action Tracker said China’s goals would reduce global temperature rises by between 0.2C and 0.3C. “This is the most important announcement on global climate policy in at least the last five years,” said Hohne. Mateo Salazar, the lead author of the Greenness of Stimulus Index, and analyst at Vivid Economics, said one of China’s main attempts to boost the economy after the coronavirus shock had been to hasten coal power permits, which would lock the Chinese economy into higher emissions for decades to come. “This new goal is a vital and welcome course correction,” he said. “The next step will be urgent signalling in China’s Covid-19 stimulus that it will not support a wave of new coal power plants, instead directing recovery funds into measures that cut carbon emissions, such as renewable power, energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, and attaching green conditions to any airline and automotive bailouts.” More than $12tn is being poured into the global economy by G20 governments, but of this only about $3.7tn is going into environmentally sensitive areas such as agriculture, energy and transport, according to the analysis.",Environment; US news; UK news; China; World news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Coronavirus,Environment
2020-07-08T16:28:58Z,Devolved nations call on Treasury for billions in extra spending,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/08/devolved-nations-call-on-treasury-for-billions-in-extra-spending,"The Treasury has failed to quell demands from finance ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for billions in extra spending despite an offer of a further £1.6bn. The devolved governments welcomed some of the chancellor’s initiatives, including a temporary cut to VAT for tourism businesses and fresh incentives to reemploy furloughed staff, but said Rishi Sunak’s package fell far short of the stimulus needed. The finance ministers – Kate Forbes in Scotland, Rebecca Evans in Wales and Conor Murphy in Northern Ireland, called on the chancellor to loosen the Treasury’s strict rules on how their money could be spent – and to authorise much greater borrowing. Forbes said her additional calls for an £80bn green stimulus package had also been ignored. “There is no new capital spend, no extension to the furlough scheme for hard-hit sectors and no further support for households in financial difficulty. A half-price meal out does not help those struggling to put food on the table,” she said. Under the Barnett formula – the Treasury’s complex method for giving devolved governments a share of any new public spending – the Scottish government is due to get an extra £800m, Wales £500m and Northern Ireland £300m following Sunak’s announcements. Those sums exclude the Treasury’s funding of the VAT cuts, re-employment and apprenticeships grants and other UK-wide programmes which cover the devolved nations. Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont have already received an extra £8.9bn in total to fund stimulus and relief programmes to combat the impacts of the pandemic. Alister Jack, Westminster’s Scottish secretary, said Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National party government had now received an extra £4.6bn to spend on its services and policies, including health, education and business rates. He urged her to suspend Scottish property sales taxes to mirror the temporary stamp duty cuts Sunak set out for England and Northern Ireland. The chancellor raised the threshold for the property purchase tax to £500,000. “The chancellor has set out a fantastic package of support. The devolved administration now needs to play its part and show they are serious about Scotland’s economic recovery,” Jack said. The Welsh government said it wanted further clarity on what Sunak’s package meant for Wales, but a spokeswoman said: “We do know that it did not pull the macro levers needed to support the recovery. It ignored the joint calls from devolved nations to ease the rigid fiscal rules that limit our response and made only a passing reference to public services. “We do, however, welcome the kickstart scheme [to help under-25s into employment] which clearly mirrors the Jobs Growth Wales programme we’ve offered to support 19,000 young people in Wales.” Green groups, Scottish Labour and some business groups criticised the package for failing to offer significant long-term reinvestment in bolstering green investment, secure jobs and support for fragile industries threatened by the next widely anticipated recession.",Summer statement 2020; Scotland; Wales; Northern Ireland; Rishi Sunak; Politics; Business; UK news; Coronavirus,UK news
2020-09-23T22:18:02Z,Trudeau pledges tax on 'extreme wealth inequality' to fund Covid spending plan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/23/trudeau-canada-coronavirus-throne-speech,"Justin Trudeau’s government has announced ambitious plans to spend billions on childcare, housing and healthcare – partly financed by taxing “extreme wealth inequality” – as Canada braces for an economically devastating second wave of coronavirus. “We are at a crossroads, and the future is in our hands” the prime minister said in a televised address to the nation Wednesday evening. But opposition parties quickly dismissed the minority government’s proposals, prompting speculation that Canada will soon head into another general election. “Across this country, millions of Canadians have lost their jobs. Many fear losing their homes. And too many have lost hope,” said the Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, who has been self-isolating after testing positive for the coronavirus last week. “Mr Trudeau says we’re all in this together. But Canada has never been more divided.” Earlier in the day, the prime minister’s speech from the throne – which customarily starts a new session of parliament and outlines a government’s priorities – was delivered by the governor-general, Julie Payette, on Wednesday afternoon. The speech included calls for green investment and a plan to create more than 1m new jobs, but was overshadowed by the pandemic which has killed 9,241 Canadians and left 2 million unemployed. In recent weeks, the number of new cases has surged, alarming public health officials and prompting a stern warning from the prime minister. “We’re on the brink of a fall that could be much worse than the spring,” Trudeau said on Wednesday. “It’s all too likely we won’t be gathering for Thanksgiving, but we still have a shot at Christmas.” The government’s address was delivered to a sparsely populated senate chamber: only a handful of members from various parties were present as the rest participated remotely. Two opposition leaders – O’Toole and Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Quebecois – were absent after testing positive for coronavirus. Trudeau’s government has won broad praise for its response to the pandemic – but also criticism from the opposition for its hefty spending on recovery. But in Wednesday’s address, the government said it would do “whatever it takes” to fight the coronavirus and rebuild the economy. “This is not the time for austerity,” said Payette. “This Covid-19 emergency has had huge costs. But Canada would have had a deeper recession and a bigger long-term deficit if the government had done less.” A major element of the speech was a plan to raise revenue by finding “additional ways to tax extreme wealth inequality” including “tax avoidance by digital giants”. The speech also focused on a growing concern over the power of tech companies like Facebook. While Canada has been spared the rates of mortality seen in the neighbouring US, it has seen a surge of cases in recent weeks, and the unprecedented setting and content of the speech underscored the deep impact coronavirus has inflicted. Announcing the prorogation of parliament in August, Trudeau said his government’s previous pre-pandemic throne speech in December had “no conception of the reality we find ourselves in right now”. The prime minister had hinted his government planned a “green recovery”. But a looming second wave of the coronavirus has derailed much of that vision, instead making the immediate response to the pandemic the most pressing issue. Since the summer, cases have jumped from roughly 300 cases per day into more than 1,200 and the economy has remained in the doldrums. The plan to create a million new jobs is meant to address economic concerns. But it comes just as a C$2,000 monthly payment for residents unable to work because of the coronavirus, is set to end on 26 September. While the government plans to relax unemployment insurance rules, it is unclear if all workers will qualify for new benefits. Trudeau’s minority government will need the support of at least one opposition to survive a confidence vote in the coming weeks. While opposition parties had called for paid sick leave guarantees and more funding for provinces, neither were explicitly mentioned in the speech. Following the speech, the Conservative deputy leader, Candice Bergen, said her party was “very, very displeased” with the Liberals’ plan. “We believe that it is not what Canadians need,” she said The NDP leader Jagmeet Singh – whose support appears critical for the Liberal government to survive – suggested he will not support the throne speech without further protections for sick workers and a guaranteed monthly government benefit. “I’m not looking for an excuse to go to an election,” he said. “I don’t think that’s going to help people.”",Canada; Americas; World news; Justin Trudeau,World news
2020-06-18T05:00:40Z,Lib Dems unveil £150bn green coronavirus recovery plan,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/18/lib-dems-unveil-150bn-green-coronavirus-recovery-plan,"The Liberal Democrats have unveiled proposals to invest £150bn in green projects over three years as a way to transform the economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, warning that the government must act soon on the issue. Ed Davey, the party’s interim leader, said there was “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to both tackle potential mass unemployment due to Covid-19, and reshape the economy on more environmental lines. Labour has also announced ideas to rebuild the economy with measures such as training young people to work in green industries. Davey said Boris Johnson appeared to have not yet grasped the urgency of the situation. “You’ve got to have a very high level of ambition, and the way the government is talking about it, I’m not yet convinced their level of ambition is high enough,” he said. “With Johnson I think he may focus on some of the projects that get good headlines but not the ones we really need.” Davey’s proposals would involve investing £150bn in the green economy over the next three years, part of a total £350bn post-coronavirus rescue package. Specific ideas include a so-called green jobs guarantee, giving people training in new, environmental industries such as renewable energy, insulating homes and rewilding projects, paid at least the national living wage. Another pledge would be for at least 80% of energy to be from renewable sources by 2030. “If unemployment is going up anywhere near what people are saying, this is going to be absolutely essential,” Davey said. “There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to solve the massive crisis we’re in.” Properly insulating homes was vital for meeting existing green targets, Davey said, and could rapidly create jobs, with many local authority projects renovating social housing ready to go ahead. This would create jobs in supply chains, and help with those most affected by fuel poverty, he said: “So there’s a big social win there too.” For rewilding programmes, people could work on areas such as tree-planting and peat bog restoration. Other areas of the plan include a requirement for at least half of all Bank of England financing to go into green investment programmes, and a new system of government “climate bonds” to raise extra capital. People would also receive tax incentives on savings and pensions for investing in green areas. Labour has unveiled similarly ambitious plans, with the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, calling for the creation of a “zero-carbon army of young people” doing work such as planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies. Miliband has likened the task to the rebuilding process undertaken by Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, which involved the creation of the NHS.",Liberal Democrats; Environment; Ed Davey; Politics; Coronavirus; Green politics; UK news,Environment
2020-11-26T13:30:06Z,More military spending won't keep Britain safe – but boosting overseas aid could | Mary Kaldor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/26/military-spending-britain-safe-overseas-aid-defence,"In March, when Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it seemed as though Britain, long a nation obsessed with its imperial past and military history, had shifted its concern to the wellbeing of its citizens. The government had accepted responsibility for the safety of individuals and their families, albeit more slowly than some other European nations. Yet after all we’ve learned during the pandemic about the dangers posed by a virus smaller than a dust mite, Johnson’s recent announcement of a £16.5bn increase in defence spending over the next four years (over and above a commitment to increase the existing £41.5bn budget by 0.5 percentage points above inflation) signalled a return to business as usual. The new spending is focused on cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and a military space capability. Johnson said that he had taken this decision “in the teeth of the pandemic” because “defence of the realm comes first”. What does “defence of the realm” really mean? Johnson refers to “our people and our way of life”, yet the dangers we face as a nation aren’t traditional wars: they’re global crises such as pandemics, the climate crisis and rising inequality, as well as security threats associated with terrorism and organised crime. Rather than spending on old-fashioned military defence, the UK’s focus should be on “human security”, a version of security that begins at the level of individuals rather than nation states and considers existential threats of all kinds – from poverty to ill health. In practice, this would mean spending more on climate change action and development assistance, as well as forms of defence spending where the military plays a roll in protecting and assisting citizens both at home and abroad, not fighting wars. But the government appears more focused on traditional military defence than current global issues. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced an enormous reduction in the country’s aid budget from 0.7 to 0.5% of GDP – a move that is devastating for people living in poverty as well as those in conflict zones, and something that could well come back to harm our own security at home. And the prime minister’s recent pledge to spend £12bn on a 10-point green investment plan pales in comparison to Britain’s new defence budget. The decision to increase defence spending was taken before the integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy had completed its work. One probable message of this landmark review, which is expected to be published early next year, is that addressing global challenges so as to ensure the safety of “our people and way of life” goes far beyond military spending. Another likely conclusion is the importance of stabilising and mitigating contemporary conflicts in places such as Syria, Yemen or the Horn of Africa. These “forever wars”, as they have sometimes been called due to the fact they are extremely difficult to end, are very different from classic conflicts of the past. Not only are they fragmented and decentralised, involving complex networks that engage in both political and criminal violence, but they are both local and global in scope, and closely related to other challenges such as terrorism and organised crime that affect us at home. The UK does need a capacity to intervene in such conflicts within the framework of the United Nations, with the aim of protecting civilians, delivering humanitarian assistance and diminishing violence. But this is not the same as classic geostrategic military interventions of the kind undertaken by Russia, the US or Turkey, which are destructive and can prolong violence. Interventions in overseas conflicts should be about saving lives, not fighting wars, and ought to involve a variety of skilled workers, such as humanitarian agencies, health workers, human rights monitors and mediators. Development assistance is particularly important when dealing with these conflicts: it funds humanitarian assistance and can help people create livelihoods, providing an alternative to joining armed groups. These types of intervention might include a role for the police and the military, but only in order to protect civilians, uphold international law and create safe humanitarian spaces (indeed, the Ministry of Defence has established a centre for human security in military operations with this aim). The army can serve as a first reserve of public labour during emergency situations, helping to carry out Covid testing, building emergency hospitals or helping to build flood defences, for example. Likewise, there’s an argument that spending more on high-tech areas of defence is important to protect people at home and abroad. The UK is vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks, election interference and even attacks on key infrastructure. But it’s crucial that these cyber capabilities protect privacy and human rights, and are defensive rather than offensive. The same goes for space. The UK is still a member of the European Space Agency, which has developed capabilities for responding to humanitarian and human security issues – something to which the UK can and should contribute. But developing an independent military space presence in the form of the proposed “RAF space command” isn’t only expensive and difficult, it’s also dangerous: the militarisation of space expands the frontiers on which conflicts can take place. There is a powerful case for increasing our spending on human security issues, especially in the context of the pandemic. This has to include both climate change action and development assistance. But Johnson’s motivation seems to be more about returning us to an era of gunboat diplomacy than preventing and ending violent conflict. In his words, he wants to end “the era of retreat” and bolster “our global influence”. This global influence has been hugely diminished by Britain’s departure from the European Union, where the UK played a key role in external security policy. Cutting development spending will further tarnish Britain’s worldwide image. It is difficult to see how a vision for “Global Britain” can be achieved through increased military spending. Indeed, what is needed for keeping “our people and our way of life” safe is greater spending on human security, not on the destructive, anachronistic tools of geopolitics. • Mary Kaldor is a professor of global governance and director of the conflict and civil society research unit at the London School of Economics",Defence policy; Aid; Global development; Politics; Boris Johnson; Rishi Sunak; Conservatives; UK news; Military,Opinion
2018-03-14T09:51:28Z,Green Investment Bank: why did ministers dodge the real problem? | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/mar/14/green-investment-bank-why-did-ministers-dodge-the-real-problem,"The government’s £1.6bn sale last year of the Green Investment Bank (GIB) to the Australian financial outfit Macquariewas a shambles, it was argued here at the time, and now the public accounts committee agrees. The rough summary of its report runs as follows: in their eagerness to trim a few quid from the national debt ministers accepted a few airy pledges from Macquarie about future investment and called them commitments. The MPs’ verdict makes a nonsense of the government’s claim that a sale would deliver “the best of both worlds” – value for money and a new owner that would definitely use GIB to support UK energy policy and invest in low-carbon infrastructure. The price tag looks OK since the Treasury made a profit of £186m, but the boast about Macquarie’s good intentions has been exposed as an exercise in hopeful assumptions. The Aussie financiers may decide to play ball, but, if they don’t, there is little the government will be able to do. New owners must have a free hand, it might be argued, otherwise it’s hard to sell any asset. In many circumstances that’s correct. The difference here is that ministers claimed a “special share” arrangement would protect GIB. That protection, however, seems paper-thin: as the committee’s report says, it relies on Macquarie continuing to fund the company that owns the special share. The shame is that GIB was doing a decent job. It was never a bank, despite its name. It was an investor in hard-to-finance green projects, everything from wind farms to street-lighting systems, that aimed to attract private capital in its wake. It invested to make a profit and, as the sale price shows, was succeeding. Given the effort to get the institution up and running, the onus was on ministers to ensure a private owner would continue to invest. That implied “specific or legally binding commitments”, says the report – but they weren’t sought. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy argues that, in practice, investments have continued happily under Macquarie’s ownership. Maybe, but year one was never likely to be the problem. The question is whether GIB will still be recognisable five years from now. The manner of the sale was “deeply regrettable”, says Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, deputy chair of the public accounts committee. He’s being kind: ministers knew the problem and ducked it. Takeover Panel: just let it be The City’s bid-’em-up takeover culture can be criticised for doing more harm than good by making it so easy to buy UK companies. But the fights are usually clean. The Takeover Panel, 50 years old this week, can take some credit. In many ways it’s amazing the body has survived. Its most severe sanction, deployed only a handful of times, sounds like it belongs to the pre-Big Bang era. A “cold shouldering” is a declaration that no City adviser should work for the offender. Lesser rebukes usually do the trick. Those that have taken the panel’s rulings to judicial review have lost every time. The process works because the principles of the takeover code remain sound. All shareholders should be treated equally, for example, so there can be no side deals to gain control via the backdoor. Target companies should be protected from perpetual siege. Implementation has moved with the times. When the City invented derivative contracts that could obscure ownership, the panel decreed that positions should be declared as if they were held directly. Put-up-or-shut-up (PUSU) provisions, forcing a bidder to make its intentions clear within 28 days of declaring an interest, became mandatory after Kraft captured Cadbury with a slow “bear-hug” bid. The panel has taken a beating on occasions – the Distillers Guinness Argyll battle in 1986 was a low point – but having a neutral police officer in the middle, capable of making quick decisions, is efficient. There are worse systems. Just look at the US, home of corporate poison pills and battalions of lawyers. If politicians want major reforms to halt bids (as opposed to PUSU tweaks), as Theresa May has sometimes suggested vaguely, they should formally expand the public-interest test beyond defence, national security and media plurality. Those would be political judgments. Don’t try to shuffle such responsibilities onto the panel. Its job is to protect investors against unfair tactical wheezes – keep it that way.",Green Investment Bank; Banking; Business; Energy industry; Corporate governance; Mergers and acquisitions; UK news; Environment,Environment
2018-03-14T00:01:11Z,"Green Investment Bank sell-off process 'deeply regrettable', say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/14/green-investment-bank-sell-off-mps-macquarie,"MPs have accused the government of a “deeply regrettable” failure to put in place strong guarantees that the UK’s green investment bank will continue to support renewable energy after its privatisation. The public accounts committee said it was unclear whether the bank would continue to support the government’s energy policy or climate change goals, because the bank’s new owner is not legally bound to stick to its green aims. The bank was launched in 2012 to spur investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency and other parts of the “green economy”, but sold by government last year to Australian bank Macquarie for £1.6bn. The MPs said that ministers and officials had, in their rush to get the bank off the government’s books as quickly as possible, failed to explore whether they could have won stronger green commitments from Macquarie. In addition, the spending watchdog said the government had sold the bank before assessing its impact, and was unable to say if it had achieved its objectives. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee’s deputy chair, said: “The manner in which it was sold off is therefore deeply regrettable. Government did not carry out a full assessment of the bank’s impact before deciding to sell, nor did it secure adequate assurance over the bank’s future role.” The government established a “special share” to protect the bank’s green goals, but the MPs attacked the government for not pushing Macquarie hard enough for stronger guarantees. “Macquarie told us that the special share or other commitments it made were not a burden and did not affect the price it was prepared to pay,” said a report by the committee, published on Wednesday. Furthermore, the MPs said the trustees of the special share had no powers to approve investment decisions or influence the privatised bank’s investment strategy. The special share arrangement is also contingent on Maquarie continuing to fund the company set up to hold the share, the watchdog added. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: “Selling the Green Investment Bank reveals this government is more interested in making a quick buck from the family silver than in driving innovation in environmental objectives.” The government defended the sale, saying it had made £186m profit for the taxpayer. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the bank, now known as the Green Investment Group “has made substantial green investments since its sale and plays a key role in the government’s green finance taskforce, as part of our clean growth strategy”.",Green Investment Bank; Environment; Banking; Business; UK news,Environment
2020-11-13T05:00:08Z,Ma Jun: China has started to 'walk the walk' on climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/13/ma-jun-china-is-beginning-to-walk-the-walk-on-climate-crisis-action-aoe,"Ma Jun experienced a strange role reversal during Donald Trump’s presidency. Over more than two decades as one of China’s top environmental campaigners, American encouragement for Beijing to cut carbon emissions and temper the damage of rapid industrialisation had been part of the background music. Ma never imagined he would see the US renege on environmental commitments while China began to face up to the challenge. “It’s been frustrating,” says Ma of the past four years as we speak on the phone, the bustle of Beijing audible in the background. “When it comes to environmental collaboration between the governments, it has been hard to do anything.” Before the US election, the Chinese foreign ministry issued a 12-point excoriation of Washington’s record on the environment, criticising the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and failure to protect wildlife – even condemning methane gas leaks from fracking. While the criticisms were likely made in response to a similar State Department factsheet in September, the old dynamic between the two powers on the environment appears to be over. “China has started changing its course. We have seen a lot more ‘walk the walk’ action. China has adopted some tough measures to try to deal with the pollution and environmental damage problem. And we have seen some progress made because of that,” Ma says. When the 52-year-old former investigative journalist wrote the now seminal China’s Water Crisis – published in China in 1999 and the west in 2004 – air pollution, contaminated water and deforestation were largely accepted as the price of China’s rapid economic development. Ma’s writing on the pollution crisis helped provoke an environmental awakening. More than two decades later, China is preparing to host major talks on the environment for the first time at Cop 15 in Kunming in 2021, where the international community will sign up to a Paris-style agreement for nature. President Xi Jinping has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 and ensure China’s greenhouse gas emissions peak during this decade. The next five-year plan, currently being developed, could be the greenest yet. “I think most importantly for China to change its course was the voice made by the Chinese people, by the citizens,” says Ma. “The issue around smog has made a big difference. So many started making their voices heard. Eventually, the government started monitoring and disclosing truthful information.” While more than a million people still die early every year due to air pollution in China, the number of deaths has started to drop and air quality is improving. “The more action taken, the more confidence it gives to decision makers that it will not lead to a massive disruption of society,” adds Ma. Undoubtedly, many challenges remain. Environmental concerns surround the multibillion-dollar belt and road initiative – likely to guarantee China’s role at the heart of international trade for the next century. Parts of the illegal wildlife trade centre on China, driving species extinction across the planet. The current pandemic has only heightened the scrutiny. “Covid-19 has taught people a harsh lesson that we must think more about the relationship between man and nature,” says Ma. “But Sars has taught us that lesson before. People sometimes have a short memory. People understand that we should not consume those wild animals but unfortunately when the pandemic is over, it’s coming back in some way.” China’s government has issued a temporary ban on wildlife markets, just as it did after the 2002-3 Sars outbreak. Campaigners in China have called for the government to make the ban permanent. Ma says he is building an AI app with his partners that will help identify animals that are part of the illegal wildlife trade and are being sold at markets and report the incidences to agencies. “Some people have been found bringing products like ivory and rhino horn into China. I think, increasingly, people are starting to recognise that it’s immoral – not just illegal, immoral. Our younger generation of Chinese, they tend to have a much higher understanding of this.” If the app is successful, it would be the latest in a series of data-led tools helping China make changes on the environment. The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an organisation Ma founded in 2006 that has since become China’s top NGO, provides a live pollution map of the country with data on air and water quality accessible to everyone. People can monitor the outputs of nearby factories and report evidence of environmental violations through the Blue Map app. Ma says the data has encouraged about 16,000 factories to improve environmental standards, many of which form part of the supply chain for major western companies such as Apple, Levi’s and Primark. It has also encouraged the Chinese government to improve its environmental record. Ma’s mission to restore the blue skies and clean water of his youth to Beijing received a further boost with the election of Joe Biden. Hope has returned, he says, the change in tone noticeable from the first time we spoke in October, on the eve of his participation in a Global Landscapes Forum event on the importance of biodiversity in preventing future crises of pandemics and climate change. “There’s so much that could be done by the two countries [China and America]: the two largest economies, the two largest emitters. There’s so much that they should do together,” he enthuses about Biden’s commitment to rejoin the Paris agreement. If the president-elect’s $1.7tn green investment spending plans are carried out in full, his presidency could reduce global heating by 0.1C, according to recent analysis by Climate Action Tracker. That said, Biden is likely to face intense opposition from Republicans at state and federal levels. “I hope there’s healthy competition between the two countries,” Ma continues. “Hopefully they can see the opportunities, not just costs and risks, but also huge potential for a green recovery and green growth.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",Greenhouse gas emissions; Green economy; Climate crisis; Environment; Belt and road initiative; China; Donald Trump; US news; Joe Biden,Environment
2020-10-19T15:56:27Z,Green jobs for graduates: what should you study and how can you reskill?,https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/green-jobs-for-graduates-what-should-you-study-and-how-can-you-reskill,"Leah Bennett has always wanted to make a difference. The 23-year-old graduate from Preston has volunteered to clean up beaches, investigated the politics behind the Amazon forest fires, researched alternatives to plastic packaging and given up her time to edit a digital magazine for the environmental organisation Louder Than The Storm. Jobs with purpose wanted Bennett isn’t alone in looking for graduate opportunities in the environmental sector. A 2018 survey from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy found that almost two-thirds (60%) of 18-24 year olds were interested in pursuing a career in the green economy. Even in other industries, this generation of young jobseekers wants to work for organisations that takes sustainability seriously. The graduate recruitment app Debut found that 89% of female and 80% of male students and graduates say they want to work for an organisation with a strong environmental policy. Increasingly, those credentials are being highlighted in job ads, even if the role itself would not be considered “green”. “It’s becoming a real differentiator for companies,” Kim Connor Streich, marketing director at Debut, says. “And there are an awful lot of opportunities outside of the traditional ‘green’ companies, or on graduate schemes, where you get an all-round understanding of what companies are doing, with the chance to specialise later.” The green boom The good news is that the green jobs market is growing fast. Renewable energy, electric vehicles (EV) and smart technologies are at the heart of the UK’s plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Worldwide, the Global Commission on the Future of Work expects 24m new jobs to be created by the green economy over the next 10 years. Graduates from Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects will be key in helping the UK achieve net-zero carbon emissions, says Jacqui Murray from Innovate UK, who leads the Faraday battery challenge for EVs. But part of her mission is also to encourage young people to appreciate the range of skills that will be needed in a green future. “Stem is always a labour of the heart,” she says. “It’s problem solving and it’s teamwork. It’s something everybody can contribute to. You may not be a world-leading scientist, but you may be someone who can fit the pieces together in a facility in Southampton. “The real power is in the cross-discipline nature of what we do. Stem skills are absolutely going to be at the heart of the green economy, but the ability to communicate and translate those ideas is really important [as well].” The benefit of a fresh pair of eyes Irfan Lohiya, the founder of Green Recruitment Solutions, says he’s seen an increase in demand for graduates in sectors such as waste recycling, water, renewable energy and green investment since he launched his business in 2013. “Organisations have realised that they need to source talent,” he says. “There is an ageing workforce right now in the sector.” A lot of the roles are technical, he adds, and engineering degrees are highly sought after. “Process engineering comes up a lot. Chemical engineering is good because it can be applied to water, waste management and energy process industries.” In the energy and sustainability consulting sector, Inspired Energy launched its first graduate scheme last September, hiring six candidates from a variety of academic backgrounds to spend two years across its different departments. It’s been so successful that the programme is being extended to 20 graduates this year. “[Graduates] are hungry and ready to get started. And we’ve enjoyed having fresh pairs of eyes,” says Matt Jones, commercial director for optimisation at the firm. “Seeing the enthusiasm light up in them when they latch on to this subject is brilliant.” Getting the right job for you Part of the challenge in finding the right role in the green economy is how broad the sector is, says Shannon Houde, a career and executive coach for the impact sector and author of Good Work: How to Build a Career that Makes a Difference in the World. “I break it down into five key categories: corporate responsibility and sustainability; social impact and international trade and development; sustainable finance and responsible investment; environmental (for example, renewable energy); and smart cities and food.” As well as looking to big brands, such as Unilever, Patagonia and Nike, there are opportunities in the public sector, non-governmental organisations, industry associations and consulting. “There are lots of SMEs worth looking at too, from sustainable fashion to vegan food companies,” she says. Future-proofing your career Graduates should emphasise skills such as building relationships, communication, project management, research, analysis and reporting, Houde says. It also pays to focus your attention on one or two impact issues, which you can talk about in an interview. That approach has worked for Bennett, who has secured three paid, part-time internships by highlighting the skills she does have. At the Centre for Global Eco-Innovation at Lancaster University, she’s now working as an environmental and sustainability researcher. “I told them: ‘I’m good at research, I can communicate information and I can make it accessible.’ These skills come in handy in so many ways.” In a challenging post-pandemic jobs market, aligning yourself with the green economy could be a shrewd move, Houde adds. “There’s going to be more and more growth in this space. It is definitely a way to future-proof [your career] way beyond your own personal values.” To search for all the latest green jobs visit Guardian Jobs",,Guardian green jobs
2020-12-13T09:00:02Z,Where's the beef with a greener future that also makes us happier and healthier?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/13/greener-future-will-also-make-us-happier-and-healthier,"Few crises come with a users’ manual. The government’s official climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, have come close, however, with a new 1,000-page tome setting out a blueprint for how Britain can decarbonise its economy and cut emissions to virtually zero by 2050. The committee’s green manifesto, published last week, brings to heel the two most pervasive myths that climate deniers have set to stalk Britain’s climate ambitions. The first is a menacing right-wing imagining of economic hardship in which the “eye-watering costs” of green investment collide with a slowdown in productivity and growth. This is a fallacy easily disproved. Lord Stern’s 2006 report on the impact of climate change was one of the first landmark studies to prove that the cost of failing to take action would dwarf the investment required to help prevent it. The committee’s work proves that, even setting aside Stern’s compelling counter-factual, the price of a sustainable future is lower than expected - and falling. Eighteen months ago, the committee believed that the investment needed to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 could total 1% of GDP a year by the middle of the century. This was already a small price to pay to end Britain’s contribution to the greatest existential crisis of modern times. But its latest work now estimates that this ambition will cost far less. It will require investment of around 0.6% of GDP in the 2030s, and 0.5% by 2050, in large part because the cost of low-carbon technologies continues to fall as they are rolled out at scale. This “manifestly reasonable” £50bn-a-year investment in clean electricity, low-carbon transport and green home heating will be largely offset by the future savings on buying oil and gas. It will also help sate the appetite for investment rather than draw from the government’s coffers, the committee says. The second myth that has dogged Britain’s green agenda is taken directly from the climate-denial playbook on misinformation. Like all propaganda, it galvanises fear, uncertainty and doubt. In this case, it is spreading fear that a future of climate action will be worse than what we have known, coupled with uncertainty over the correct path to take and doubt over whether it will make a difference anyway. The committee puts paid to these doubts by setting out the steps to be taken and exactly how they will make a difference. But it also deftly tackles any dark mutterings about the road ahead offering little more than a grim Malthusian dystopia of joyless personal sacrifice. There will be changes, certainly. But the committee’s work has proved that even steak dinners and overseas holidays will still be on the menu by 2030. Air travel by then is expected to be broadly the same as in 2019 and meat-eating - already on the decline - will be down by just 20%. In reality, the changes in how people live “need not entail sacrifices”, it says; they are more likely to make our lives better. Under the new lore of net-zero, Britain’s future will be brighter and greener. Roads will teem with electric vehicles, which produce zero pollution while running and form virtual battery farms to store and dispatch renewable energy when idle. People will breathe more easily, eat healthier diets and exercise more along cycle lanes and walkways. They will live in warmer homes with lower bills. There will be more green spaces and trees. Natural environments will flourish, and so will we. It brings to mind a punchline aimed squarely at climate deniers: “What if it’s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?” There’s no hoax here, but a better world does lie ahead. And we now know exactly how to get there. So much for Ratcliffe’s belief in a ‘British’ Grenadier Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s plans to build a new off-roader in Britain were accompanied by flattering billets-doux about UK manufacturing prowess. The choice of a south Wales site for the factory was, he said, “a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing”. Playing up the British credentials of the Grenadier – named after Ratcliffe’s favourite London pub – made sense for the prominent Brexiter, but it has come back to bite him after his head was turned by Daimler’s offer of a French factory. The U-turn, all but inevitable since Ineos put in its offer in August, was the first of two blows last week for south Wales: it also lost out on the UK’s first large-scale car battery “gigafactory”. The Welsh government is now playing the spurned lover, trying to claw back some pride and preliminary building costs. It also withdrew a £7.6m state aid offer. There is nothing wrong with taking advantage of a good deal – and Ratcliffe is a consummate dealmaker. Ineos was forged through savvy, debt-fuelled petrochemicals takeovers, but Ratcliffe has since swooped on two football clubs, a cycling team and a leather jacket maker. Picking up a car plant on the cheap is almost certainly a better option than building one from scratch – whatever the location. But what makes the move stick in the craw is the way the company played up its “British” credentials. Ratcliffe has talked of the UK “thriving as an independent nation”, but has been unwilling to back his words with actions. His new residency in Monaco suggests patriotic talk is cheaper than UK income tax. Beyond Ratcliffe’s flexibilities, however, the episode highlights the cold, hard realities of international industry. If the returns are more attractive elsewhere, global capital does not care how much you love your country. A tax on future property gains is a pill voters may just swallow The mistake many anti-poverty campaigners make is to believe that wealth creation is the sole preserve of the super-rich. If households in the very highest income brackets were taxed on their wealth, they say, the public purse would be overflowing. It’s true that wealth has grown hugely in the past 40 years. And much of that wealth is held by the ultra-wealthy. Latest figures show people in the top 10% of the pay scale have, on average, £2.5m in financial assets, while the bottom 10% cannot lay their hands on any. Yet the past four decades have been characterised by a surge in property prices and pension entitlements that have also benefited most middle-income and many low-income earners. A proposal last week for a five-year tax on assets of more than £500,000 would affect tens of thousands of teachers, doctors, and social workers along with company directors and marketing managers, especially if they enjoy guaranteed retirement schemes and live in property hotspots. The Wealth Tax Commission – a group of tax experts and economists brought together by the London School of Economics and Warwick University – recognises this trend. It argues that anyone who has a decent pension and owns a home qualifies as rich, and it is right. But the political fact is that many of these people, most of them over 55, don’t feel rich and won’t vote for a measure that punishes them as if they were. For the past 20 years the only taxes to have had the thumbs-up from MPs are less painful ones. And with respect to wealth, that would limit politicians to putting a tax on the gain in value on properties once they are sold, an idea raised earlier this year by the Social Market Foundation thinktank. Getting even that past voters would be a stretch. But the less direct nature of this potential gains tax – taking a portion of profits yet to be realised – must be the way to go.",Economics; Climate crisis; Climate science; Green economy; Renewable energy; Business; Environment; Energy; Manufacturing sector; Brexit; European Union,Business
2021-02-04T18:14:42Z,Free ports – or sleaze ports? Rishi Sunak's dream of tax-free zones about to become reality,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/04/free-ports-or-sleaze-ports-rishi-sunaks-dream-of-tax-free-zones-about-to-become-reality,"Five years ago a young, unknown MP wrote a pamphlet for a Thatcherite thinktank extolling the benefits of free ports. Now that Rishi Sunak is chancellor, his dream for Britain is – for good or ill – fast becoming reality. This week, alliances of port owners, businesses and local authorities must submit their bids to establish free ports, competing to set up zones exempt from normal tax and regulation. Proponents say free ports can attract investment to areas that have been left woefully short, bringing jobs and prosperity to deprived regions as part of the “levelling up” agenda, helping prioritise greener industry, and breathing new life into, say, the former Redcar steelworks site, or the Grimsby docks. But others fear the move signals the creation of “mini-tax havens” and a race to the bottom on regulation, keeping revenues from councils and the Treasury to line the pockets of business and landowners, with profits sent offshore rather than reinvested in the UK. Support is found predominantly among those who voted – and campaigned – to leave the EU; backers call it a Brexit dividend enabled by the final deal. The EU has started to clamp down on the 80-odd free zones within its jurisdiction, over tax evasion, corruption and crime concerns. Most of the big coastal ports, as well as some inland airports and accompanying industrial zones, are throwing their hats into the ring. In the north-east, the Conservative mayor of the Tees Valley combined authority, Ben Houchen, has championed a policy he says could create thousands of jobs in the region. Deprived areas will be given priority, and bids are expected from around England by Friday’s deadline – from Humberside to Liverpool and London to Bristol. The devolved governments in Wales and Scotland are expected to follow – with caveats – and invite bids at a later date. Within designated zones, stretching up to 45km from ports, the government’s free ports prospectus describes how usual customs, planning and tax measures will not apply. Goods and components will, in effect, remain offshore, allowing, say, a new factory to be built, processing raw materials and components without customs paperwork or tariffs, to re-export as more valuable goods. For the first five to 10 years of that factory’s life, the government proposes, it would pay no stamp duty on its land or property purchase and enhanced tax breaks would be given for construction or machinery costs. Behind the zone’s fences – physical and virtual – business rates would be waived, and employers would not pay national insurance contributions for up to three years for staff members earning less than £25,000. The government says it will “ensure it has the power” to prevent access to national insurance relief for employers who abuse it, for example by dismissing staff after three years. Modelling by the consultancy Vivid Economics for a Teesside free port said the kind of package proposed could create up to 32,000 jobs and boost the regional economy by £2bn over the next 25 years, although “deadweight and displacement” – firms relocating rather than reinvesting – could cut those benefits in half. It projected that the Treasury would lose about 40% of £960m in tax and revenues due in Teesside if free port firms were subject to usual rules, although it argued that the zones would create enough investment to produce a net positive for the exchequer. However, the projection suggested that to be competitive with the likes of Singapore, the UK would need complete exemption from business rates and other taxes. Unsurprisingly, many people are alarmed. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark scheme, says: “These ‘sleaze ports’ are very much mini-tax havens domiciled within the UK. It’s going to leak out into the wider economy – it will result in a massively reduced contribution from business to the Treasury. Businesses which are rooted in communities wish to stay and play a part in society and pay fair tax – why should they be undercut by hot capital and flighty businesses that can exploit these zones?” A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government is committed to combating abusive tax practices, such as avoidance and evasion – these have been a consideration throughout the design of the free ports tax offer.” Monaghan says the zones have proved magnets for illicit financial flows and criminal activity, adding: “One of the reasons for them existing is the absence of regulations and checks – it’s a consequence of what they are.” One of the world’s biggest free zones, Dubai’s Jebel Ali, has been identified by tobacco companies as a major source of contraband cigarettes, while the US last year blacklisted two aviation businesses in the zone for trading with Iranian airlines designated as supporting terrorism or as a threat to US national security. Its operator, DP World, which runs the London Gateway and 70 other ports worldwide, is hoping to transform it into a free port. A spokesperson for DP World said customs officers in Dubai were “praised” by HMRC for helping to stop cigarettes entering the UK black market, adding: “DP World has operations on every continent and moves 10% of the world’s container trade. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards illicit activity anywhere in the world and work closely with the customs and taxation authorities.” Labour has attacked the principles of the scheme, although some MPs in affected constituencies have broken ranks. The SNP is no longer in outright opposition, with Scotland suggesting a middle way – “green ports”, linking tax incentives to sustainable business. Britain’s main maritime union, the RMT, says it supports green job creation but fears free ports could result in workers in some of the poorest communities signing away their rights. Its general secretary, Mick Cash, says: “Without strong employment rights, automatic trade union recognition and tax laws that make sure international owners of UK ports contribute, free ports are doomed to fail the communities they are designed to help.” Ports have moved to allay fears, with a joint declaration by the biggest owning groups – including Associated British Ports, DP World, Hutchison, PD Ports and Peel Ports – that the free ports would be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable and pledging that they “are not seeking to diminish or dilute employment rights”. The Treasury said “no part of the freeport policy would explicitly or implicitly affect” workers’ rights. The contenders The government has said it will name the chosen free ports in England, likely a maximum of eight, in the spring. These ports are expected to bid: Thames A free zone that would cover London Gateway, opened in 2013 by DP World, and the older and smaller Tilbury, owned by Forth Ports. Backers say it could create 25,000 jobs along the deprived Thames Estuary region, with green investment at Ford Dagenham and in Thurrock. DP World is owned by the state of Dubai. Its chair, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, wields extraordinary power as commercial chief and regulator. He is chair of the Ports, Customs &amp; Free Zone Corporation, a government department that includes the Dubai customs workforce, and leader of the Jebel Ali free zone authority, where companies can incorporate and operate untaxed. DP says the chair’s roles are “regularly audited” by the UAE government. Felixstowe-Harwich The Freeport East bid joins local authorities in Essex and Suffolk with two Hutchison-owned ports: Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, and Harwich. As well as taking in major road and rail freight hubs, the free port would link to offshore wind and Cambridge University research programmes. Hutchison Ports Europe, part of the telecoms and infrastructure empire built by the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, made headlines last year by hiring the former transport secretary Chris Grayling on £100,000 a year for seven hours’ work a week. Grayling has assured parliamentary standards committees he will not be advising on “post-Brexit opportunities” and is being kept away from the bid. Liverpool Liverpool city region combined authority has been leading a bid that would combine Peel Port’s Liverpool hub and its operations Manchester and Heysham in one big free zone. Peel says it is considering bids with regional stakeholders across all of its port locations, which include Great Yarmouth and Clydeport in Scotland. Peel Group, the parent company established and part-owned by an Isle of Man resident, John Whittaker, also has a large land and property division in the north-west. The increase in land value alone could produce a huge windfall for one of Britain’s biggest landowners. Bristol The bid is being led by the West of England combined authority. Boris Johnson visited Bristol in the autumn and declared the port a “strong contender”. A number of proposed inland “free port zones” are linked by road and or rail to Bristol port. The Bristol Port company is owned by Terence Mordaunt and David Ord, who bought the port from the city council in 1991. Between them, they have donated £1.9m to the Conservatives, £25,000 to Johnson’s leadership campaign and £50,000 to Vote Leave. Mordaunt chairs the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Forum, whose trustees include the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore.",Economic policy; Economics; Business; Politics; Economic growth (GDP); Rishi Sunak; Trade policy; Tax and spending; Industrial policy; Social exclusion; England; Shipping industry,Politics
2020-09-19T06:00:09Z,A Biden victory cannot bring normal back | Tom Blackburn,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/joe-biden-victory-normal-hard-right,"In recent years, the crisis of liberalism has been much debated, ever since Donald Trump sent shockwaves through world politics by defeating Hillary Clinton to take the White House. Then there were Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders, both of whom mounted a bold (though far from revolutionary) challenge to the liberal centre from the socialist left, calling for a renewal of the welfare state, a redistribution of wealth and power, large-scale green investment and a less belligerent foreign policy. The liberal centre retained enough institutional power – particularly its media support and control over party bureaucracies – to see off both Corbyn and Sanders, winning Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nomination and Keir Starmer the leadership of the Labour party. This isn’t to imply that Corbyn and Sanders were blameless for their defeats. Far from it. Nevertheless, it can hardly be said that in either case the liberal centre triumphed over the socialist left because of the dynamism of its ideas, or the superiority of its vision for society. In fact, it seems resistant to developing any such vision. Some elevate this into a virtue: suspicious of ideology tout court, they prefer to see themselves merely as sensible managers. It wasn’t always like this. In New Labour’s 1990s heyday, centrists made a point of taking ideas seriously. Some of the thinkers grouped around the journal Marxism Today provided intellectual ballast, while Anthony Giddens’ The Third Way offered a polished account of what the New Labour project aimed to achieve, and the logic behind it. Though New Labour governed for 13 years, its gains were built on sand. In the 1990s and 2000s, it could channel some of the proceeds of a finance-led global boom into public services and welfare programmes. But Blairism’s more progressive achievements were largely vapourised by the 2008 financial crash and Tory-Lib Dem austerity. Its ideological preference for market forces over structural state intervention ensured that the root causes of poverty went effectively unaddressed, making any advances in this area easy to reverse. With economic depression and mass unemployment now looming, the old “third way” playbook offers no guidance. Nothing much has filled the void. While centrists still feel very strongly that they should be in charge, they’re reluctant to elaborate on why, and for what. Biden belatedly, and implausibly, poses as a latter-day Franklin D Roosevelt in public, but mollifies rich donors in private. Starmer, meanwhile, hesitates to commit himself to anything concrete, no doubt fearful of being tarred with the brush of “continuity Corbynism”. Attempts to decipher “Starmerism” have so far drawn a blank. In his new book, This is Not Normal: The Collapse of Liberal Britain, the sociologist Will Davies examines how Anglo-American political life came to be dominated by the wilfully unserious. Trump and Boris Johnson goad liberals by flaunting their contempt for prim and proper political norms. As Davies notes, they can do this because public trust in institutions from parliament to the press has cratered, and because of the widespread (and frequently vindicated) suspicion that these institutions work against the interests of the majority, rather than for them. The liberal centre raises hell about the falsehoods of Trump and Johnson, which are undeniably flagrant. However, the brazen fabrications of yesterday – most obviously, those that led to the catastrophe in Iraq, for which there has never been a proper reckoning – did much to pave the way for those of today. And yet only last month, Colin Powell, who personally presented the fallacious case for the invasion of Iraq to the United Nations, was paraded as a star turn at the Democratic National Convention. Likewise, when Tony Blair recently popped up to warn Johnson against flouting international law by breaching certain aspects of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the lack of self-awareness on display was breathtaking. It’s not that Blair’s point was wrong, but the fact that he was the one making it allowed the Tories to issue the obvious riposte that their transgression of international law would pale in comparison to his. Even if the liberal centre were in a stronger position to highlight the cynicism and dishonesty of Trump and Johnson, that wouldn’t be enough without changing the political conditions that gave rise to them. After all, neither Trump nor Johnson came out of nowhere. Trump inherited an apparatus of invasive state surveillance and militarised borders from a predecessor who himself presided over mass deportations, while in Britain, it was New Labour that first indulged bogus moral panics about asylum seekers and laid the foundations for today’s hostile environment. Both Biden and Starmer might win elections simply by appearing to offer their respective electorates a steady hand. But mounting, interrelated crises stare us in the face: environmental, economic, social and political. Addressing any of them would require, for starters, radically curbing the prerogatives of capitalist vested interests wedded to a destructive status quo. It’s not enough just to install more competent and polite managers, and otherwise leave the same arrangements in place. Without far-reaching change, it may be that another shift to the hard right is at best delayed by a few years. In spite of everything, a healthier, happier and fairer world is still possible, though we can’t dither for much longer if we are to build one. It will only materialise, however, if those who want it first recognise that a back-to-normal centrism would offer no way forward. • Tom Blackburn is a founding editor of New Socialist",Politics; US politics; Joe Biden; Keir Starmer; World news; UK news; US news; Labour; Democrats,Opinion
2020-05-28T12:18:34Z,EU pledges coronavirus recovery plan will not harm climate goals,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/eu-pledges-coronavirus-recovery-plan-will-not-harm-climate-goals,"Senior officials have pledged that the European Union’s recovery plan will “do no harm” to the bloc’s landmark goals to tackle the climate crisis and threats to the natural world. Following the unveiling of a €750bn (£671bn) recovery plan to pull EU economies out of the deep economic downturn caused by coronavirus, the European commission announced further details of green spending on Thursday. The commission argues it can raise €150bn in public and private money, up from a pre-crisis goal of €100bn, to help fund greener transport, cleaner industry and renovated homes. At the heart of the plan, the EU proposes to more than quadruple to €40bn a “just transition fund” aimed at moving coal-dependent regions away from fossil fuels. The biggest beneficiaries would be large coal-producing countries, such as Poland, which could get €8bn in grants, Germany (€5.2bn) and Romania (€4.5bn). Frans Timmermans, the European commission vice-president who oversees the European green deal, said the EU needed to ensure it was not putting money into the industries of the past. “For many regions and companies including those relying on coal production and carbon-intensive industrial processes, this economic crisis has raised an existential question,” he told journalists. “Do we rebuild what we have before or do we seize the opportunity to restructure and create different and new jobs?” “In all the actions we are going to take, we apply the ‘do no harm’ principle so you can’t have investment that takes us in a different direction.” Accompanying the €750bn coronavirus recovery plan, the commission has also announced a revamped proposal for a €1.1tn EU budget for 2021-2027. That plan preserves a promise that 25% of EU spending would be dedicated to climate policy, which campaign groups say is not enough. European governments have been wrangling over the long-term budget for two years, leaving the EU institutions with the daunting task of finding agreement on the overall €1.85tn spending plans over the summer. Green campaigners said the €750bn recovery plan lacked conditions to prevent governments from spending funds on fossil-fuel industries. “It’s right for the EU to act in solidarity injecting billions to resuscitate our economies while emphasising a green recovery,” said Jagoda Munic, the director of Friends of the Earth Europe. “But it’s ludicrous not to put any conditions on these funds. Our common future will be shaped by how this money is spent, and allowing strings-free handouts to polluting industries, or corporations who dodge tax or have poor labour practices, will not rebuild the sustainable, fair, caring world we need.” William Todts, the director of the NGO Transport and Environment, said that there was “a worrying lack of detail” on what green investment actually meant. “This plan leaves the door wide open for polluting engines and even aeroplanes to get stimulus money. That’s completely unacceptable.” The commission rejected those claims. “It is completely clear that the greening of the projects and the objective of the green economy is present throughout the whole management of the funds,” said Elisa Ferreira, the EU commissioner in charge of distributing funds to less well-off regions.",Environment; Climate crisis; Coronavirus; European Union; Europe; World news,Environment
2020-07-09T08:31:47Z,"Ofgem's £25bn plan puts climate goals at risk, say energy firms",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/09/energy-watchdog-unveils-25bn-uk-green-investment-drive,"Energy companies have accused the regulator Ofgem of putting Britain’s climate goals at risk by clamping down on returns for green investors in an effort to shave £20 a year from home energy bills. Ofgem has proposed halving the returns that companies can make over the next five years through a £25bn green investment plan designed to prepare Britain’s energy infrastructure for a low-carbon future. Ofgem said the lowest ever energy investor returns, which are paid for through energy bills, will offer a fair deal for consumers and energy company shareholders as Britain undertakes huge investments in electric vehicle charging and grid upgrades to connect new renewable energy and battery projects. Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said: “Now more than ever, we need to make sure that every pound on consumers’ bills goes further. Less of your money will go towards company shareholders, and more into improving the network to power the economy and to fight climate change.” The proposed returns would be half what energy network companies currently earn for upgrading and maintaining Britain’s energy pipes and wires, after MPs and consumer groups had criticised the regulator for allowing the companies to pocket “eyewatering” profits at the expense of consumers. But major energy companies including National Grid, SSE and Scottish Power have warned that setting investor returns at 3.95% – down from the current 7% to 8% – could slow the pace of Britain’s energy transition by making the UK less attractive to investors. There is also concern over Ofgem’s decision to cut the total investment allowed in new electricity grid projects to between £5.9bn and £9.1bn for the next five years, which falls short of the £9.6bn invested over the last five years. The proposed limit is well below the spending proposed by the industry at £10.8bn to prepare for a surge in power demand from electric cars, hobs and heat pumps. Nicola Shaw, the executive director of National Grid, said it was “very disappointing” that the regulator had chosen a “short-term gain” for customers while putting “all the work still needed to reach net zero at real risk”. Ofgem’s plan aims to save £3.3bn of company spending from being passed on to energy consumers between 2021 and 2026. This could mean that energy bills fall by £20 a household in 2021 from where they might have been, though the long-term reduction in bills could drop to £10 a year depending on how much is spent on additional green energy projects over the next five years. But Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said the plans are “so far out of step” with the government’s ambition to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050 that they may “slams the brakes” on a green economic recovery, “or even put it in reverse”. He warned that Scottish Power’s parent company, Spain’s Iberdrola, may opt to invest more in the other countries within its global portfolio, which includes France and the US, rather than earn lower returns in the UK. Brearley said there is no merit to the argument put forward by companies that the investment returns proposed by the regulator will slow down a shift towards green energy. “Ofgem are here to deliver a greener and fairer energy system, and we are passionate about supporting the green economic recovery,” he said. “Quite frankly, at this stage of the process, this is the sort of thing that companies often say.” Brearley said the regulator has undertaken “extensive analysis” to determine “a fair balance between investment and customers” including the rate of return which investors earn from investing in any projects in other countries. The regulator will consult with companies again before delivering its final decision later this year, but may be forced to defend the plans to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) if it does not budge. Energy network companies are expected to appeal against the current rate of return with the CMA, which could further delay progress on green energy investment plans, supply chain contracts and green-collar jobs growth. “My job is to look at the evidence, make sure we make the right decision, and then stand firm,” Brearley said. “We are confident that we have got that balance right.”",Ofgem; Business; Regulators; Energy; Green economy; Environment; Infrastructure; Corporate governance; UK news; Utilities,Business
2020-06-18T18:30:56Z,Radical proposals in Lib Dem policy review suggest shift to the left,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/radical-proposals-in-lib-dem-policy-review-suggest-shift-to-the-left,"The Liberal Democrats could make a decisive shift to the centre left, shedding the final legacies from the party’s period in coalition, under a review of policy ideas overseen by the leadership hopeful Layla Moran. A new booklet, Build Back Better, edited by the MP, is billed as a modern equivalent to the Orange Book, a 2004 collection of essays from Lib Dem figures – including the former leaders Nick Clegg and Vince Cable, and former cabinet minister David Laws – which pushed the party towards a centre-right, markets-based stance. In contrast, Build Back Better, with contributions from more than 40 Lib Dem MPs, members and supporters, includes essays advocating ideas such as a universal basic income, free broadband, and commandeering private health resources to clear a backlog of NHS operations caused by coronavirus. Many of the contributors to the Orange Book went on to serve in the 2010-15 coalition with the Conservatives, a period followed by three generally disastrous elections for the Lib Dems. Moran, the Oxford West MP and education spokeswoman, is seen as the joint favourite to win the party leadership battle, alongside Ed Davey, the interim leader. Davey contributed to the Orange Book and took part in the coalition, and while he has unveiled radical plans of his own, such as a £150bn investment in the green economy, Moran is keen to place herself as the choice of the party’s centre-left. The third confirmed contender is the Bath MP Wera Hobhouse, who is seen as an outsider. Work on the book – which does not form part of Moran’s leadership bid – began two months ago, when the leadership race was postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. The competition has since resumed, with a new leader due to be announced in August. Many of the contributors, who include Cable, are remaining neutral on who they support. Moran said the book was devised to define the party’s “liberal response to coronavirus, so I didn’t really think in terms of positioning”. However, she added, a common theme emerged: “What it shows is we are a party of the centre left – that is where our beating heart lies.” This amounted to a move away from the ideas of the coalition, Moran said, lamenting what she called an overly slow evolution of ideas in the following period. “I think we need to send a signal to both other parties and to the electorate that we are moving on from not just coalition but the last five years,” she said. “It’s very clear that at the next election the positioning is going to have to be to take seats off the Tories. That’s the obvious thing.” She said the Orange Book was seen as a concerted shift to the centre-right. “When people read this, they’ll see it’s a shift to the centre-left. It didn’t set out that way, but it seems to have been the natural response of party members who are writing.” Several essays are about a green recovery from the impact of coronavirus, with Cable arguing for a new and more ambitious green investment bank. Others tackle the rise of technology and the idea of a digital bill of rights. One essay, by a former councillor, Paul Noblet, calls for not just a universal basic income, but universal free services, such as broadband, water and energy. Moran stressed that while the ideas were some way from becoming party policy, she hoped the review would bring a boost to the process of rethinking what the party stands for. “To put it bluntly, since coalition there has been a bit of a dearth of that in the party,” she said. “Of our membership, 50% are new since the coalition. I don’t think we’ve really harnessed the power of their ideas yet.”",Liberal Democrats; Politics; Liberal-Conservative coalition; Nick Clegg; Vince Cable; Ed Davey; Coronavirus; Conservatives; UK news; Layla Moran,Politics
2020-05-20T14:16:20Z,UK’s first car battery ‘gigafactory’ to be built by two startups,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/uk-first-car-battery-gigafactory-amte-power-britishvolt,"Two British startups have announced plans to invest as much as £4bn in building the UK’s first large-scale battery factory, in a move that could prove a major boost to the country’s struggling car industry. AMTE Power and Britishvolt have signed a memorandum of understanding saying they will work together on plans for a plant to make lithium ion batteries, the key component in electric cars as well as energy storage products. Lars Carlstrom, the chief executive of Britishvolt, said the companies had an ambition to build facilities producing batteries with capacity of as much as 30 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year, which would be roughly equivalent to the joint Tesla-Panasonic Gigafactory in Nevada. A factory of that size would create as many as 4,000 jobs, he said. The global automotive industry is racing to secure supplies of lithium ion batteries as manufacturers seek to meet growing demand for electric cars as well as government regulations that limit carbon dioxide exhaust emissions. However, the lack of large-scale battery manufacturing facilities in the UK has raised fears over the future of the country’s automotive industry, including from the Jaguar Land Rover boss, Ralf Speth. Transport costs mean that securing a battery supply close to car assembly plants is attractive for carmakers. The government-backed Faraday Institution estimates 130 GWh of annual capacity will be required by 2040 if the UK is to retain a large automotive sector. The UK recently lost out on a major investment in battery production by Tesla. Elon Musk, the US electric carmaker’s chief executive, blamed Brexit uncertainty for his decision to choose Berlin over a British location. Other battery producers such as Sweden’s Northvolt, South Korea’s LG Chem and China’s CATL have built factories in EU countries. Carlstrom said the UK’s struggles with Brexit had provided an opportunity for the company to approach the market, with other companies unwilling to invest despite the expected demand for batteries from UK car factories. European and UK carmakers have tended to import battery cells, which are then assembled into packs to go in cars, from China and South Korea. However, carmakers such as the Vauxhall owner, Peugeot, have recognised an increasing need to secure a supply of cells closer to home. Securing investment in a UK gigafactory has been a top priority for the government’s automotive industry officials. The government-backed Advanced Propulsion Centre orchestrated the tie-up between two startups. AMTE Power, which was founded in 2013, already runs a small facility in Thurso, northern Scotland, and is looking at sites in Teesside and Dundee for a larger plant capable of 1GWh a year. AMTE, led by the chief executive, Kevin Brundish, focuses on specialist markets such as high-performance cars. Britishvolt is looking at five locations for a larger plant with an annual capacity of 10GWh of batteries aimed at mass-market cars, with the possibility of adding another 20GWh after that. Britishvolt expects to raise the first £1.2bn of funds in the next year, after receiving initial backing from Scandinavian and Middle Eastern investors. The company is confident it can raise funds despite the looming coronavirus recession, as investors look for green investment opportunities. Later stages of building could focus on different technologies, such as solid-state batteries, as development continues.",Automotive industry; Business; Energy storage; Energy; UK news,Business
2020-09-07T05:00:44Z,France's Greens hope to turn summer wave into ongoing tide,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/07/frances-greens-hope-build-summer-success,"Regional and presidential polls over the next two years will show whether the “green wave” that surged through a swath of big French cities earlier this summer heralded a fundamental redrawing of the country’s politics – or a transitory ripple. In June’s municipal elections, Europe Écologie-Les Verts (EELV) – alone or at the head of leftwing majorities – held Grenoble, seized Annecy, Besançon, Bordeaux, Lyon, Poitiers and Strasbourg, and were part of winning coalitions in Paris and Marseille. Amid a broad but not yet decisive advance by green parties across much of Europe, Yannick Jadot, an MEP and one of the French party’s most senior figures, hailed a “historic turning point”. The results revealed “a desire for concrete ecology in action: solutions for commuting, housing, food, rebuilding local economies”, he said; France’s political landscape was being “remodelled around the theme of ecology”. EELV aims to field a full list of candidates in regional elections due next year. Ecology was “no longer a political add-on,” another MEP, David Cormand, said at the party’s summer conference last week. “We are moving from a force of opposition, to a force of government.” The party’s unexpected June election triumph built on an encouraging 13.5% – and third-place finish – in last year’s European parliamentary elections, and represented a remarkable rebound from a disastrous few years for France’s Greens. Jadot withdrew from the 2017 presidential poll to boost the chances of the Socialist party candidate, Benoît Hamon – who then crashed out in the first round with 6.4% of the vote. In the ensuing parliamentary poll, EELV failed to win a seat. But the party now feels that its local victories in former bastions of both left and right show that the foundations of French politics are shifting. The winning formula, it believes, lies in a broad political offering in coalition with a range of other leftist parties around the themes of ecology, social solidarity and a more representative democracy. Critically, the party notes, France’s once dominant Socialist party was willing to play second fiddle to EELV in several successful municipal coalitions. “The time when we were behind the rest is over,” said Sandra Regol, the party’s deputy leader. “It’s now up to the rest to decide whether to join us.” Some analysts think EELV may be right. Since the pro-business centrist Emmanuel Macron blew up France’s political landscape in 2017, crushing the main centre-left and centre-right parties on his way to the Élysée, most have assumed that the 2022 presidential race would be a repeat of his face-off with the far-right Marine Le Pen. “But that’s not necessarily a given,” said Brice Teinturier of the polling firm Ipsos. “An offer that successfully unites the left and the Greens could have a real chance of making it to the second round.” The pollster said the party was attracting, in particular, disappointed left-leaning Macron voters, and that its success reflected French voters’ continuing search for new forms of political expression beyond the left-right divide. “In 2017, that benefited Macron,” he said. “This time it was the Greens who looked different.” There are reasons, however, to be cautious about EELV’s prospects on the national stage. Voters behave differently in local and European elections – where different concerns are in play – than in parliamentary and presidential polls. EELV fared well in France’s cities, but may struggle to impose itself nationally. Crucial to its chances will be a credible presidential candidate – but the party is already bitterly divided over who it should select, and an Ifop-Fiducial poll published after the local elections had Jadot scoring just 8% in the 2022 first round. June’s elections were also held in unusual circumstances, analysts note, with the second round delayed for months due to the coronavirus crisis. “The virus raised public awareness of the issues that EELV campaigns on,” said Ifop’s Jérôme Fourquet. “Many viewed the epidemic through the prism of the environment, of excessive consumption, the destruction of our ecosystems. Voters were much more awake to a more localised, ecological approach. That played a part.” Macron, furthermore, is not giving EELV a free ride: the president recently accepted all but three of the 149 recommendations of a citizens’ commission for the climate and has made green investment central to France’s mammoth €100bn (£90bn) post-Covid recovery plan. His entourage, however, is divided on the best strategy for defeating EELV. Many more left-leaning members of Macron’s La République en Marche (LaRem) believe the only way is to out-green the Greens. “We have to go bigger and faster on the environment,” one LaRem MP said. “That’s what voters expect. We will be punished if we don’t.” Others believe that the presidential party must invent a “pro-business environmentalism”, with green technologies driving an economic revolution. Still others, mainly on the right, believe LaRem must counter EELV directly by attacking its credibility. The Greens’ willingness to ally themselves with the French Communist party and far-left La France Insoumise – as well as the views of some of their newly elected officials – make them a soft target, many in the government believe. The freshly sworn-in EELV mayor of Colombes, Patrick Chaimovitch, was recently forced to apologise after comparing the modern-day French police to the Vichy regime of the second world war. EELV councillors have claimed that 5G technology is harmful to health, which is not supported by science; the EELV mayor of Marseille was confronted with a 2018 tweet in which she called for an end to compulsory vaccinations; and two EELV Paris councillors were excluded from the majority coalition after a heated row with the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo. The party’s supporters say such incidents are inevitable when activists become politicians, and will not deter voters persuaded by EELV’s core message. EELV’s opponents will argue that they preclude the party from becoming a serious political force.",France; Green politics; Environment; Europe; World news,World news
2020-09-21T06:00:06Z,Children urged to strike against lack of action on climate emergency,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/schoolchildren-strike-climate-emergency,"Schoolchildren around the world are being urged to go on strike to protest against a lack of action on the climate crisis. Children and their supporters are invited to take to the streets on Friday, if it is safe to do so, or to go online with their protests “in whatever way suits you best”, according to the organisers. This will be the first such action since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish school strike pioneer and activist, said: “Extreme weather driven by the climate crisis is accelerating around the world, and yet we still don’t treat it as a crisis. We are in a global emergency that affects all of us. However, not everyone is suffering its consequences equally.” The protests will focus on Mapa, a new term for “most affected people and areas”, which the organisers prefer to older phrases such as “the global south”. Protesters are asked to make the Mapa signal, which is two closed fists pressed together with thumbs up, symbolising strength, solidarity and hope. As extreme weather rips across swathes of the globe, including wildfires along the west coast of the US and the most active hurricane season in decades forecast for the Caribbean, the protesters want to contrast the plight of the most vulnerable with the lack of political commitment on the climate, and the rebound in greenhouse gas emissions as many developed economies return to high growth of CO2 emissions. “We live in the midst of a pandemic, but climate change is just as much of a crisis as it was before,” said Fridays for Future, the youth movement sparked by Thunberg’s school strikes, in a statement. “As society is starting to open up in many places in the world, global emissions and resource use is rapidly increasing and we are running out of time … This is not a time to be silent.” Friday’s day of action will come a year on from a global week of protest last September in which it is estimated that more than 6 million people took part. It also comes as schools around the world reopen after the disruptions of lockdown, at the start of the new academic year in the northern hemisphere. The strikes will take place as the UN marks its 75th anniversary with a muted general assembly, which will be mostly online for the first time. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, will make climate breakdown a key focus and call for a green economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, will use his speech to set out the UK’s plans to host the next UN climate summit, called Cop26, in Glasgow next year. The talks were scheduled for this November but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus crisis. At Cop26, world leaders will be expected to put forward strengthened national plans on cutting CO2 emissions, as current commitments under the Paris agreement are too weak to hold global heating to well below 2C (a rise of 3.6F) as the treaty demands. Despite the plunge in emissions as lockdowns were imposed around the world this spring, the rebound now taking place will cancel out any beneficial impact, and stronger policies are needed to make the structural changes necessary to effect permanently lower emissions. Cop26 is seen as one of the last chances to put the world on track to fulfil the Paris accord. The UK has said little publicly on the Cop26 talks, apart from to postpone them, since the launch of Britain’s presidency in February. Green campaigners have grown increasingly concerned at the lack of public engagement, though insiders are keen to point out that meetings of Cop26 officials are continuing behind the scenes. Prince Charles will call on Monday, before the start of the high-level segment of the general assembly on Tuesday, for a greater sense of urgency among world political and business leaders. He wants the lessons of the coronavirus crisis to be used to “reset” the global economy, shifting from a high to a low CO2 footing. The prince will say: “Without swift and immediate action, at an unprecedented pace and scale, we will miss the window of opportunity to reset for … a more sustainable and inclusive future. “In other words, the global pandemic is a wake-up call we cannot ignore. [The environmental crisis] has been with us for far too many years – decried, denigrated and denied. It is now rapidly becoming a comprehensive catastrophe that will dwarf the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.” Johnson is expected to say that the UK will stop funding the development of fossil fuels abroad, as his government’s continued funding for overseas oil and gas exploration has become a source of increasing conflict with campaigners. Campaigners are concerned, however, that loopholes and exemptions will diminish the impact. The prime minister is also likely to refer to a new green infrastructure bank for the UK, to take up from the Green Investment Bank sold off by the Conservative government in 2017. Johnson is also under pressure to bring forward the phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles by five years from 2035 to 2030, a target now supported by Labour and green groups. His announcement of the 2035 target, itself an improvement on Theresa May’s phase-out year of 2040, was intended as the centrepiece of the government’s launch of Cop26 in February, but was overshadowed by the last-minute sacking of his top Cop26 official. Alok Sharma, the UK’s business secretary and Cop26 president, will announce on Monday that Facebook, the car manufacturer Ford and the world’s biggest cement company, LafargeHolcim, are joining more than 1,100 businesses and more than 450 cities in the Race to Zero campaign for a world with no CO2 emissions. He will also inaugurate a new Cop26 energy transition council, bringing together politicians, investors and technical experts to foster the growth of clean energy around the world, and £50m funding for clean energy innovation in developing countries.",Environmental activism; Environment; Climate crisis; Children; Protest; Greta Thunberg; Extreme weather; World news; United Nations; Cop26; UK news; Coronavirus; Schools; Society; Education,Environment
2020-07-09T19:21:21Z,Sharon White proves again need to be radical with John Lewis closures | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/jul/09/sharon-white-proves-again-need-to-be-radical-with-john-lewis-closures,"Department stores have been in decline for years; the rise of online retailing is relentless; and the pandemic is accelerating shopping trends. Even so, John Lewis’s plan to close a supposedly flagship store in the centre of Birmingham – opened as recently as 2015 – was a shocker on another bleak day for retailing jobs. If the UK’s best operator of department stores can’t see a way to make money from modern premises in the country’s second largest city, where can it? There was also an intriguing subplot to the tale. The Birmingham opening was a proud venture of Andy Street, managing director of the John Lewis chain at the time but these days mayor of the West Midlands. Closure “risks being a dreadful mistake”, said Street, implicitly criticising his successors at the partnership. For its part, John Lewis said the store, along with seven others (mainly smaller) earmarked to close, was “already financially challenged”. Perhaps it meant that Street should never have opened it in the first place. After all, John Lewis also has a similar-sized store down the road in Solihull. That little quarrel can run, but Sharon White, chair of John Lewis since the start of the year, has signalled (again) her determination to be radical. She must be, of course, if there’s a chance that 60% to 70% of department store sales will be conducted online even after Covid-19 has passed. But the Birmingham decision suggests her full strategic review will go further than thought. How many of the remaining 34 department stores will be long-term survivors? Meanwhile, shares in Hammerson, John Lewis’s landlord in Birmingham, fell another 9% and one can understand why. The group will have offered its tenant every possible enticement to stay, but couldn’t keep a prime client. If the outlook is weak for John Lewis, it is bearish in the extreme for landlords. Retail rents are down, but clearly have further to fall. Rolls should not delay inevitable rights issue for too long “The Covid-19 pandemic has created a historic shock in civil aviation, which will take several years to recover,” said Warren East, Rolls-Royce chief executive. You bet. Financial headaches for the engine-maker are compounding. The initial whack was known – only 250 engines will be built this year, rather than the intended 450, as Airbus and Boeing slash production. But then there’s the collapse in actual flying to consider. The critical metric, which determines revenues from servicing, is “engine flying hours”. Minus 55% is on the cards for this year, but even 2021 levels are still seen 30% below 2019’s. Then comes currency hedging, a fact of life for a civil aerospace division that gets paid in dollars but clocks up many of its costs in sterling. If the unit will shrink by a third, the same adjustment must be made to hedges. That will cost a thumping £1.45bn between now and 2026. The good news, of a sort, is that Rolls has £8.1bn of liquidity after adding another £2bn borrowing facility. So, even with an astonishing cash outflow of £4bn this year, it can duck and weave for a while, assuming a prediction of a return to positive cash generation of £750m in 2022 remains solid. Ultimately, though, borrowings are too high, which is why Rolls’ debt is now rated as junk. Shareholders expect a £2bn-ish rights issue. East should not delay the inevitable for too long. Outrage is overdone, but one objection to Ofgem plan is fair Jonathan Brearley “flunked” his first test as chief executive of the energy regulator Ofgem, grumbled Keith Anderson, boss of Scottish Power. A “half-baked” plan to halve returns for energy network companies is “gravely at odds” with the government’s ambition to boost green investment and create jobs. Well, yes and no. Ofgem was mugged in the last price review five years ago. The companies made sky-high returns when interest rates fell. The losers, via their energy bills, were consumers. The regulator was bound to be stricter this time. Besides, a real annual investment return of 3.95% – which is what is proposed from next April – ain’t so bad when you think about 10-year government gilts yielding roughly zero. The complaining bosses (and Anderson was merely one of many) have overdone the outrage. But one objection is fair. The UK is competing with other countries for capital and cannot afford to be too far out of line with the international market given the need to accelerate energy transition. Thursday’s proposal was a draft. A fudged compromise ought to be possible.",John Lewis; Sharon White; Rolls-Royce; Airline industry; Ofgem; Energy industry; Retail industry; Business; Manufacturing sector,Business
2020-07-19T07:07:43Z,Can a hydrogen  boom fuel a green recovery for Britain?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/19/can-a-hydrogen-boom-fuel-a-green-recovery-for-britain,"At the entrance to Saltend Chemicals Park, on the outskirts of Hull, there is a small blue heritage-style plaque, placed there four years ago by the Royal Society of Chemistry. It proudly commemorates: “100 years of innovation in supplying the UK with transportation fuels and important base chemicals.” A sense of pride in Saltend’s past is understandable: places like this helped drive Britain’s industrial age. But the biggest, most dramatic innovation of all may be yet to come. This month, the Norwegian energy company, Equinor, (formerly Statoil), unveiled proposals to install the biggest facility in the world for making hydrogen from natural gas, using capture and storage technology to extract and bury the resulting carbon under the North Sea. The Humber region is currently the biggest emitter of carbon in Britain and the second-highest emitter in Europe. Equinor’s plan, if it goes ahead, would amount to a green revolution at Saltend, allowing businesses on the site to convert to clean energy. And if the rest of the region follows suit, by 2030 this windblown stretch of North Sea coastline could conceivably be one of the world’s leading green energy hubs. “This is a plan,” suggests Al Cook, the head of Equinor’s English operations, “which would help transform the UK’s largest industrial cluster into its greenest cluster. We are one of the largest energy producers in the world. Saltend is one of the oldest industrial hubs of its kind. Humberside has all the natural resources required on its doorstep. It is a chance for the UK to get on the front foot in the green energy race.” Get ready for Britain’s hydrogen boom? Definitely maybe. Hydrogen has been the next big thing for longer than its advocates would care to remember. Before Elon Musk, Tesla and electric battery technology, it was commonly assumed that we might all, one day, be driving hydrogen cars. The traditional drawback for investors has been the expensive complexity of actually producing the stuff. But in an era of net zero carbon emissions targets, the green utility of the most common chemical element in the universe is turning it into one of the most fashionable products on earth. “Blue” hydrogen – the kind Equinor hopes to produce in Hull – can be made almost carbon-free from natural gas, by using the capture and storage technology. For groups such as Friends of the Earth, “almost” is not good enough, and the enormous cost of capture and storage has also generated scepticism. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, which is made from renewable sources, bypasses fossil fuels altogether. Both types can be stored and kept in reserve, to be deployed as an inter-seasonal fuel supplementing wind and solar power. Hydrogen, its supporters claim, can also heat homes and workplaces, distributed through the existing infrastructure of the National Grid. It can be used to de-carbonise trains and buses and provide green fuel for heavy-duty vehicles, for which electric-battery technology is impractical. In synthetic form, hydrogen could even help fly zero-carbon planes. All of which led the European Union’s green deal supremo, Frans Timmermans, to tweet this month: “Hydrogen rocks, and I am committed to making it a success.” Presenting an EU strategy aimed at producing 10 million tonnes of H2 by 2030, Timmermans said: “The new hydrogen economy can be a growth engine to help overcome the economic damage caused by Covid-19.” Germany has announced a massive £9bn investment plan. Peter Altmaier, the German minister for economic affairs and energy, explained the logic: “In adopting the hydrogen strategy, we are paving the way for Germany to become the world leader in the field of hydrogen technologies.” In Britain’s energy sector, as other countries invest in the hope of a virtuous cycle of green growth, there is a growing nervousness. Having led the way in early wind farm technology, the UK failed to capitalise and become a major manufacturer and exporter. In the electric car industry, it has fallen far behind Germany and other competitors after failing to invest enough in battery production capacity. Equinor has made it clear that it will only proceed with its blue hydrogen plans for Hull if the government plays its part, sharing the risks of investing in a fledgling industry. “All our experience,” says Cook, “tells us that in projects of this scale and ambition, it only works when governments and companies work together. We will need clear frameworks and assurances and a commitment to investment from London.” Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge, is the deputy chair of the Committee on Climate Change, and one of the country’s most influential backers of hydrogen. She believes that if Britain acts decisively now, it can take a giant step towards meeting the legal requirement for net zero emissions by 2050 and become a world leader in a lucrative new market. “It is urgent for the UK to get on with this,” said King. “In terms of hydrogen technology, we have a very strong position at the moment. In electrolysis, in storage technology and other areas, we have really dynamic companies which we need to help grow.” Britain also enjoys a natural advantage, she points out: the winds that blow in from the North Sea and can be turned into green hydrogen. “This country has the best offshore wind resource in Europe. We have all the ingredients to make this an industry which the UK is really successful at; one which will reduce our emissions and which will provide real export opportunities for cutting-edge technologies. “We could also be selling into a huge export market for hydrogen. We could even get to the position of being sellers of electrolytic hydrogen to Germany.” None of this is likely to happen, though, without significant government intervention, both to lend confidence and to help shape an industry which, at the moment, barely exists. “The challenge is that we’ve actually got to create both supply and demand,” says King. “There’s no point in producing hydrogen unless you have a way of using it. And there’s no point in developing buses, trains and so on unless somebody is going to be able to supply hydrogen to you. “We need the government to form something like a hydrogen industry council to bring the demand and supply side players together to discuss how to start the industry. And, obviously, it would be helpful to know that there would be money available. When I was on the board of the green investment bank, one of the things we saw was the confidence that government gave when it came to investing in early offshore wind. Having government as the lead investor brings in other investors.” Conservative governments are generally averse to a hands-on approach to industrial strategy. With hydrogen, it might be different. Potentially, this is a red wall success story in the making. As King points out: “A successful hydrogen strategy would not be about jobs in Oxford, Cambridge and London. It would be about developing the regions where we bring energy from wind onshore; about places like Hull and Grimsby and all the other places along the coast that have had a really rough time and are in desperate need of an uplift.” After Equinor unveiled its proposals for Saltend, the headline in the Hull Daily Mail read: “Humber hydrogen plant could create 5,000 jobs.” Further up the north-east coast, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen, has led a successful bid for a £1.3m grant to build refuelling stations for hydrogen vehicles. Following last December’s unprecedented string of victories in Labour strongholds, Conservative MPs are now installed in five of the eight seats in the Tees Valley. Houchen has called for the region to be turned into a UK hydrogen powerhouse. The new network of influence is making its presence felt in parliament. One of the refuelling stations will be in Redcar, a seat won for the first time for the Conservatives last December by Jacob Young. Young is the chair of the cross-party MPs working group on hydrogen which was set up in 2018. Alexander Stafford, the MP for Rother Valley – where the Battle of Orgreave took place during the miners’ strike – is another hydrogen advocate. “It would be a great thing,” said Stafford, who sits on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, “if the areas which played such a big part in energy production in the industrial age could now play a new role in producing the energy of the future.” In its latest report, the group calls for the government to urgently set out a national hydrogen strategy, “or risk falling behind”. Given the huge lead enjoyed by countries such as Germany and Japan in electric battery production, says Stafford, “if you are looking to invest, it is far better to look in the direction of hydrogen than at batteries. The whole world is heading towards becoming carbon neutral, with some countries moving quicker than others. So the question is, how can the UK get on the front foot with hydrogen? If it can do so, there will be enormous dividends.” According to King, positive signals have come from the minister for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng. King is hopeful that a strategy will be unveiled before parliament goes into recess at the end of July. “There’s much more agreement now about where hydrogen will play a role,” she says. “In the past, it started out mainly being about light-duty vehicles. It is understood now that hydrogen is about trains, buses, industrial processes and so on.” The stakes could scarcely be higher. Given its lacklustre performance in wind and batteries, if Britain is to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis into a meaningful green recovery that generates growth, hydrogen could be key. The Committee for Climate Change has estimated that a developed hydrogen system could eventually contribute a similar amount of energy to the UK economy as the electricity industry does today. The EU envisions 25% of energy coming from hydrogen by 2050. As governments take the plunge, private investors are placing their bets. The share price of the Sheffield firm, ITM Power, which produces green hydrogen technology, has risen by 1,500% in just over a year. In places like Hull, the green future can’t come soon enough. A few days after Equinor made its pitch on Saltend, a Social Market Foundation study placed the city at the top of the list of places that will find it hardest to bounce back from the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Mike Ross, now a Lib Dem councillor, came to the city 20 years ago as a student. He has banged the drum for green investment in Hull for years. “We became the forgotten city of the floods in 2007. Then there was the crash, and then 10 years of austerity which hit places like this hardest. After Covid, there must be a special effort. This city must not be forgotten about again.” If Hull really does become a vanguard city in a hydrogen revolution, it won’t be.",Hydrogen power; Energy; Energy industry; Environment; Renewable energy; Business; Regeneration; North of England; UK news; Focus,Environment
2020-01-03T06:00:55Z,Royal Dutch Shell may fail to reach green energy targets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/03/royal-dutch-shell-may-fail-to-reach-green-energy-targets,"Royal Dutch Shell is at risk of falling short on plans to invest up to $6bn (£4.6bn) in green energy projects between 2016 and the end of 2020, with its slow progress likely to raise concern that oil companies are not moving fast enough to help tackle the climate crisis. The Anglo-Dutch oil company has spent an estimated $2bn on building a low-carbon energy and electricity generation business since setting up its “new energies” division in 2016. With a year to go, the sum is well below Shell’s own guidance that the total investment between 2016 and the end of 2020 would be between $4bn and $6bn. Shell’s green energy plans are some of the most ambitious in the oil industry, despite assigning just a 10th of its spending pot to “new energies”. Shell told investors in 2017 it would spend between $1bn to $2bn a year developing a clean energy business up to the end of 2020, up from a previous plan to spend up to $1bn a year in the same period. Under the plans Shell would spend up to $6bn on green investment , but instead it is on track to meet a third of this, with only a year left for the company to meet its guidance. Up to the end of 2019, Shell’s guidance suggests it should have spent at least $3bn. In the same four years the company spent more than $120bn developing fossil fuel projects and set out plans to increase its total spending to $30bn a year in the early 2020s. A spokesman for Shell declined to comment. Shell is considered a climate leader within the oil industry despite spending a fraction of its total budget on new energies, which include biofuels, hydrogen and electricity investments. Data from Rystad Energy, a Norwegian consultancy, shows that Europe’s five largest oil companies – Shell, BP, Total, Eni and Equinor – together spent a total of $5.5bn on renewable energy projects to date, comparedwith a combined total budget of almost $90bn last year alone. Stephen Kretzmann, the executive director of Oil Change International, said executives “trumpet their relatively tiny investments in renewables” but continue to “pour more fuel on the fire of global warming every day”. He said: “It used to be the case that some people believed that an oil company that invested even only a small portion of their resources in renewable energy was worthy of praise… because it makes us feel better to believe that the people who run these powerful companies get it.” Oil bosses have voiced support for global climate targets in public but the industry continues to invest an estimated 1% of its annual spending budget on clean energy while producing more fossil fuel products than the Paris Climate Agreement allows. “The executives that run the carbon companies definitely do not get the part about the need for them to make less of the thing that is driving climate disaster,” Kretzmann added. “The big problem isn’t too little investment in renewables - it’s too much investment in, and government support for, fossil fuels.” Shell’s green spending plans were dealt a blow earlier this year when the company missed out on a multibillion dollar race to buy Dutch utility Eneco, which has a large renewable energy portfolio. Shell and its pension fund partner lost out to a consortium of investors led by Japan’s Mitsubishi, which paid $4.5bn for the company. The deal might have pushed Shell’s green investment towards its planned spending range. Shell said it was disappointed it lost the bid, and said that it would continue to invest growing gas and electricity generation from renewable sources. Shell’s previous acquisitions have included UK energy supplier First Utility, a 49% stake in Australian solar company ESCO Pacific, and Eolfi, a French renewable energy developer that specialises in floating wind projects. Shell plans to spend $2bn to $3bn through its “new energies division” every year between 2021 to 2025. The company said it plans to become the world’s biggest electricity company by the 2030s, and hopes to bring a reliable electricity supply to 100 million people in developing countries by 2030.",Oil and gas companies; Shell; Energy industry; Oil; Business; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news; Carbon footprints; Ethical and green living; Greenhouse gas emissions; Commodities,Business
2021-11-23T11:08:43Z,"Boris Johnson’s much-criticised speech to the CBI, in full",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/23/boris-johnsons-much-criticised-speech-to-the-cbi-in-full,"Boris Johnson’s speech to the CBI has been called a “mess”, the “most embarrassing by a Conservative prime minister” since his most recent PMQs performance. It is said to have capped off a “pretty bad bloody fortnight” and left the prime minister struggling to command the confidence of his party. In it he referenced Peppa Pig, “funkapolitan” cafes and his time as motoring correspondent of GQ. Then he lost his place. So how bad was it? Here is the official transcript, judge for yourself: “Great to be here in Tyneside, the number one exporting region of the UK. Great to be with the CBI. And I want to begin with a massive thank you to British business for keeping going, for looking after your employees, for rising to the challenge, for responding to the call for ventilators in those first dark days. Dozens of you – kitchen appliance makers, hairdryer makers, Formula One motorcar manufacturers – turning your production lines over in days to try to save lives. For making the masks and the gowns and the gloves at such speed, turning things round from that awful moment when we realised we simply didn’t have the domestic production. So we have gone from being able to supply 1% of our domestic needs to 80%. And thank you British industry, enterprise, commerce, for producing not just one but perhaps half a dozen vaccines. Because, without you, let’s face it, we would simply not be here. And nor would tens of thousands of people in our country and millions around the world who owe their lives to your resourcefulness and inventiveness. And while I’m on the subject can I ask: who has had your booster? You all look far too young and thrusting to need a booster but get your booster as soon as you can because it is by vaccinating our country that we have been able to get your staff back to their place of work, to open our theatres, our restaurants and to get back for longer now than any other comparator country to something like normal life; even if we are still bumping elbows and wearing masks. I am not going to pretend that everything is going to be plain sailing – we can see the state of the pandemic abroad, the supply chain issues that we’re facing, the pressure on energy prices that we’re all facing, the skills shortages. But don’t forget, folks, my friends, it was only last year they were saying we would have an unemployment crisis now on the scale not seen since the 1980s or 1990s. They were forecasting 12% unemployment. And what have we got? Thanks to you – thanks to the resilience of British business – we have employment back in work at pre-pandemic levels. It was only last year that we experienced the biggest fall in output in a century as we were forced to lock down the economy. Well, look at us now. Thanks to you and thanks to British business bouncebackability, we are forecast to have the fastest economic growth in the G7. And I was there in the 70s and 80s and 90s. And I remember mass unemployment and the misery and the drain of the human spirit. And I would much rather have our problems today, which are fundamentally caused by a return in global confidence and a surge in demand. Because now we have a massive opportunity to fix these supply-side problems, to transform whole sectors of our economy and to tackle the chronic problems underlying the UK economy. The woeful imbalance in productivity across the country, but also the imbalance between British business between the go-getting world-beaters represented by so many people in this room and the long comet tail whose potential is, frankly, yet to be realised; that don’t have the skills – particularly the IT skills, as Rishi the chancellor so often points out – that don’t have the banks behind them, that don’t have the investment. And that is the mission of this country: to unite and level up; of this government, to unite and level up across the whole country. And I’ve got to be honest with you, it is a moral mission. As you get older, the funny thing is you get more idealistic and less cynical. It’s a moral thing but it is also an economic imperative. Because, if this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and, if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. And we would achieve what I believe we can, and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe. And, today, fate has handed us an opportunity to do that. When the first Industrial Revolution began 250 years ago, it was British industry that had first-mover advantage. For hundreds of years, we maintained that pace. Right up until the beginning of the 20th century, we were producing more coal, smelting more iron, building more ships and boilers and making more machines than virtually any other country on Earth. And today, we are on the brink of another revolution: a green industrial revolution. And again, there are many ways in which we have first-mover advantage. And today, I want to tell you in the CBI how Britain is going to win in the new green industrial revolution – provided we act and act now. I have had some pretty wonderful jobs in my life. But among the most purely hedonistic I would rank motoring correspondent of GQ magazine. I drove Ferraris, Maseratis, Nissan Skylines, Proton Sagas. You name it, I drove it. And I learned to admire the incredible diversity of the UK specialist motor manufacturing sector, which is actually the biggest in the world. And I have spent hours in the traffic listening to the porridge-like burble and pop of the biggest and most sophisticated internal combustion engines ever made. And I have heard that burble turn into an operatic roar as I have put my foot down and burned away from the lights at speeds I would not now confess to my protection officers. In that time, that great era, I only tried two EVs – electric vehicles: an extraordinary wheeled rabbit hutch that was so tiny you could park it sideways and I tried the first Tesla for sale in this country for GQ, that expired in the fast lane of the M40 – they’ve got a lot better. And when, a few years later, as mayor of London, I tried to get London motorists to go electric and we put in charging points around the city, I must confess that they were not then a soaraway success. And they stood forlorn like some piece of unused outdoor gym equipment. But 10 years after that, the tipping point has come, hasn’t it? UK sales of EVs are now increasing at 70% a year. And, in 2030, we are ending the market for new hydrocarbon ICEs – ahead of other European countries. And companies are responding. Here in the north-east, Nissan has decided to make an enormous bet on new electric vehicles and, together with Envision, there is now a massive new gigafactory for batteries. And around the world, these cars are getting ever more affordable. And at Glasgow two weeks ago, the tipping point came, as motor manufacturers representing a third of the world market – including the EU and America – announced that they would go electric by 2035. And, of course, Glasgow was far bigger and more important than that: 250 years after we launched the first Industrial Revolution, we are showing the world how to power past coal. When I was a kid, 80% of our electricity came from coal. And I remember those huge barges taking coal up the Thames to Battersea power station and those four chimneys belching fumes into the face and lungs of the city. By the time I became mayor, Battersea was a wreck; closed for being simply too polluting and good for nothing except the final shootout in gangster movies. But, in 2012, we were still 40% dependent on coal. Today, only 10 years later, coal supplies less than 2% of our power and, by 2024, it will be down to zero. And Battersea, of course, is a great funkapolitan hive of cafes and restaurants and hotels and homes, thanks to the vision of the former mayor. And every time I made that point to leaders in Glasgow – about the speed of the switch that we’ve made from coal – I could see them thinking about it and I could see them thinking ‘right, OK, maybe this is doable’. And, when I was a kid, literally 0% of our energy came from wind. And it seemed faddish and ludicrous to imagine that we could light and heat our homes with a technology that dated from ninth-century Persia, I think. And yet, today, look at the coast of the north-east where we are today: row after row stretching out to the North Sea, of beautiful white mills, as we claim a new harvest rich and green from the drowned meadows of Doggerland. And, on some days, we derive almost half this country’s energy needs with the biggest offshore wind production anywhere in the world – and growing the whole time. And that tipping point having been reached, the pace of change is now going to accelerate like a new Tesla. Because I can tell you, as a former motoring correspondent, EVs may not burble like sucking doves and they may not have that arum arum araaaaaagh that you love. But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari. And we are now embarked on a new epoch and, in just a few years’ time, after almost a century of using roughly the same technology, we are going to change radically. We are going to change radically our cars, our trucks, our buses, our ships, our boats, our planes, our trains, our domestic heating systems, our farming methods, our industrial processes, our power generation, and much else besides. And I can tell you the force driving that change, it won’t be government. And it won’t even be business – though business and government together will have a massive influence. It will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, the disciples of David Attenborough – not just in this country but around the world – who can see the consequences of climate change and who will be demanding better from us. And I confidently predict that, in just a few years’ time, it will be as noisome, offensive to the global consumer to open a new coal-fired power station as it is to get on a plane and light up a cigar. And, as the world reaches this pivotal moment post-Glasgow, it’s vital that we recognise not just the scale of the challenge, but the opportunity now for British business and industry. Because, in the end, it is you – it is businesspeople – who will fix this problem. Governments don’t innovate, governments don’t produce new products and get out and sell them in the market place. And, though governments can sell, governments can spend tens if not hundreds of billions, we know that the market has hundreds of trillions. And yet we also know that government has a vital role in making that market and in framing the right regulation. And to ensure that you, the British business, succeeds in this new world, we have set out a 10-point plan for government leadership; a new Decalogue that I produced exactly a year ago when I came down from Sinai and I said to my officials, ‘the new Ten Commandments thou shalt develop’: 1. Offshore wind 2. Hydrogen 3. Nuclear power 4. Zero-emission vehicles 5. Green public transport, cycling and walking 6. ‘Jet zero’ and green ships 7. Greener buildings 8. Carbon capture and storage 9. Nature and trees 10. Green finance And for each of those objectives, we are producing a roadmap so that you in the private sector can see the opportunities ahead and what you need to do. And we are regulating so as to require new homes and buildings to have EV charging points – with another 145,000 charging points to be installed thanks to these regulations. We are investing in new projects to turn wind power into hydrogen and the net zero strategy is expected to trigger about £90bn of private sector investment, driving the creation of high-wage, high-skill jobs across the UK as part of our mission to unite and level up across the country – not just in the green Industrial Revolution, of course, but in all sectors of the economy. And to help you and to build the platform to give you the advantage you need, we are now waging a cross-Whitehall campaign to solve our productivity puzzle and to rebalance our lopsided economy, fixing our infrastructure with investment on a scale not seen since the Victorians. And we must begin with energy and power generation if we are going to have, allow our manufacturing industry to succeed, we must end the unfairness that UK, high-energy intensive manufacturing pays so much more than our competitors overseas. And that’s why we are going to address the cost of our nuclear power and we are all now paying for the historic under under-investment in nuclear power. Which country first split the atom? Which country had the first civilian nuclear power plant? It was this one. And why have we allowed ourselves to be left behind? Well, you tell me. So we are investing not just in big new nuclear plants but in small nuclear reactors as well. And we are consulting on classifying this essential technology as “green investment” so that we can get more investment flowing in and ahead of the EU. Lenin once said that the communist revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country. Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin, Tony, before the CBI, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country. We are electrifying our cars, we are electrifying our rail – last week we announced three vast new high-speed lines, cutting the time from London to Manchester by an hour and creating a new Crossrail of the North, cutting the time from Manchester to Leeds from 55 to 33 minutes, a Crossrail for the Midlands, cutting journey times from Birmingham to Nottingham from one hour and 14 minutes to 26 minutes. But these plans are far richer and more ambitious than some of the coverage has perhaps suggested. To solve this country’s transport problems, you can’t just endlessly carve your way through virgin countryside. You have to upgrade and to electrify; you have to use the tracks that already exist and bring them back into service. And we are doing the Beeching reversals – that’s putting in lines that were taken out, sadly, in the last century. You have to put other transport networks as well, you have to put in clean buses, you have to improve – 4,000 new clean green buses we’re putting in. And, of course, you have to fix the roads as well. We cannot be endlessly hostile to road improvements. And we have to do it now, we have to fix it now. I know that there are some people who think that working habits have been remade by the pandemic and that everyone will be working only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday in an acronym I won’t repeat. I don’t want to be dogmatic about this, but I have my doubts. And it is not just that young people need to be in the office to learn, and to compete, and to pick up social capital, there are also sound evolutionary reasons why mother nature does not like working from home. So I prophesy that people will come back, Tony, they will come to the office and they will come back on the roads and the rail. But people also want choice and that is why we must put in the gigabit broadband – as we are – which has gone up massively just in the last couple of years from 7% when I became PM to 65% at the beginning of next year. And, with safer streets, with great local schools, with fantastic broadband … [Lost it] [Uhhh] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] … people will have the confidence to stay nearer the place they grew up to start business and business will have the confidence to invest. And then, of course, there is one thing that business wants and that this country needs far more than a hundred supersonic rail links, far more than broadband, and that is skills and the people that you all need to staff your business. It’s an astonishing fact that the 16- to 18-year-olds in this country are getting 40% less time and instruction than our competitors in the OECD, and so we’re turning that round. We are focusing on skills, skills, skills; investing in our FE colleges, our apprentices, in the knowhow and confidence of young people. And, since – as everybody knows – 80% of the 2030 workforce are already in work, we are giving every adult who needs it the chance to get a level-three skill – £3,000 for a lifetime skills guarantee. We are supporting bootcamps for everything from IT to entrepreneurship. And, at this pivotal moment in our economic history, we are taking advantage of our new freedoms to deliver freeports, as well as free trade deals, and to regulate differently and better to lengthen our lead in all the amazing new technologies of the 21st century: AI, cyber, quantum computing and all the rest – and all the applications of those technologies to the areas in which we excel. So you get fin tech, ed tech, bio tech, med tech, nano tech, ad tech, green tech. So you sound basically like 15th-century Mexico. And that is what this country is doing. There are only three countries that have produced more than 100 tech unicorns. And they are, as you will know, well which are they? Let’s see who’s been paying attention to any of my speeches in the last few … which, which three nations have produced more than 100 tech unicorns? [Audience-member: The United States, China and the UK.] Correct. They are the US, China and the UK. And the wonderful thing about the more than the 100 tech unicorns is they are dispersed now far more evenly across the whole of the UK than the tech unicorns of some of our rival competitor economies. And that is a fantastic thing. We want to see the dispersal of this growth and development across the UK. That’s why this government has doubled investment in scientific research – and, again, we want to see the benefits of that research across the whole of the country. But, in the end, and this is the most important message of all, there are, there are limits to what governments can do. And I just want to be absolutely clear about this – because this has been an extraordinary period. There has been the financial crisis of 2008 – where government had to intervene on a massive scale, then Covid – when government had to intervene on a massive scale. But government cannot fix everything and government sometimes should get out of your hair. And government should make sure there is less regulation and, indeed, less taxation. And the true driver of growth is not government, it is the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector And Tony, yesterday, I went as we all must to Peppa Pig World. Who’s been to … hands up anybody who’s been to Peppa Pig World? Not enough. I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place – it had very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass-transit systems, I noticed. Even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World – I’m surprised you haven’t been there – was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly, well a sort-of Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC would now be exported to 180 countries, with theme parks both in America and in China, as well as in the New Forest. And a business that is worth at least £6bn to this country – £6bn and counting. Now, I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? Peppa Pig? And no government in the world – no Whitehall civil servant in the world – could conceivably have come up with Peppa. So my final message to you, as we stand on the brink of this green industrial revolution and we prepare to use our new regulatory freedoms in what I believe will be a very strong post-Covid rebound, we are blessed, we are blessed not just with capital markets and the world’s best universities and incredible pools of liquidity in London and all the … the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, we are also blessed with the amazing inventive power and range of British business. And that, above all, is what fills me with confidence, members of the CBI, for the days ahead. Thank you very much for your kind attention this morning, thank you.”",Boris Johnson; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Business; Politics; UK news; Conservatives,Politics
2020-06-02T05:00:02Z,Gordon Brown urges G20 countries to back $2.5tn coronavirus plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/gordon-brown-urges-g20-countries-to-back-25tn-coronavirus-plan,"Failure by the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations to organise a global Covid-19 recovery plan is a potential death sentence for the world’s poor, the former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Brown, who pushed successfully for coordinated action during the financial crisis of 2008-09, said the lack of G20 action was disgraceful and risked a second wave of infection for rich countries. Writing in the Guardian, the last Labour prime minister said 225 past and present world leaders, academics and heads of civil society groups had written a letter demanding that the next meeting of the G20 be brought forward from late November. “For the first time this century, global poverty is rising and three decades of improving living standards are now in reverse,” Brown said. The “great reversal” would push an additional 420 million people into extreme poverty, he said. Brown was instrumental in giving the G20 more power in 2008-09, but said it had now gone awol – absent without lending – and had no plan to convene for six months. “This is not just an abdication of responsibility; it is, potentially, a death sentence for the world’s poorest people whose healthcare depends on enhanced international aid and on whom the richest countries depend to prevent a second wave of the disease hitting our shores.” In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund estimated that emerging and poorer developing countries would require financial help worth $2.5tn (£1.98tn) to see them through the crisis. The G20 promised a swift response using all available policy tools, but Brown said promises had not been met. “With new Covid-19 cases around the world running above 100,000 a day, and still to peak, the vacuum left by G20 inactivity means that allocations from the IMF and the World Bank to poorer countries will remain a fraction of what they have said is required. “The G20’s failure to meet is all the more disgraceful because the global response to Covid-19 should this month be moving from its first phase, the rescue operation, to its second, a comprehensive recovery plan – and at its heart there should be a globally coordinated fiscal, monetary and central bank stimulus driven forward with an agreed global growth plan.” The letter to the G20 said an immediate summit was needed to: Unlock $80bn of debt relief that would provide poor countries with a breathing space until the end of 2021 Organise global coordination of the development, mass manufacturing and equitable distribution of a universally and freely available Covid-19 vaccine as quickly as possible Provide extra resources from the IMF and the World Bank Agree a global plan based on green investment Brown said: “In the last financial crisis environmental investments formed less than 10% of the stimulus. To make this recovery sustainable the Green New Deal needs to go global, and to help pay for it, a coordinated blitz is required on the $7.4tn estimated to be hidden untaxed in offshore havens.” More than a hundred countries have sought help from the IMF since the crisis began, but the signatories to the letter – including former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major – said the poorest countries needed international aid within days not weeks or months. Helen Clark, New Zealand’s former prime minister, said: “The IMF has said emerging markets and developing countries need $2.5tn to overcome the crisis but only a fraction of that has so far been allocated.” The vaccine alliance Gavi is holding a funding conference in London later this week in which it is seeking pledges from governments so that it can continue to provide vaccines for poor countries. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former vice-president of the World Bank and an ex finance minister in Nigeria, said: “We urge every G20 member to support in full the $7.4bn replenishment of Gavi – which between 2021 and 2025 will immunise 300 million children, saving up to 8 million lives.”",Gordon Brown; G20; Coronavirus; Inequality; Business; UK news; World news; International Monetary Fund (IMF); World Bank,Politics
2020-07-08T15:12:13Z,Rishi Sunak unveils stamp duty holiday and hospitality VAT cut,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/08/rishi-sunak-unveils-stamp-duty-holiday-and-hospitality-vat-cut-furloughed-coronavirus,"Rishi Sunak promised to leave “no one without hope” as he unveiled an unprecedented level of employment support to assist in the economic recovery from coronavirus. In his summer statement on Wednesday, the chancellor pledged £9bn to protect furloughed jobs, kickstart opportunities for young people, slash VAT for the hospitality and tourism sectors, and scrap stamp duty until next year. Businesses will be paid £1,000 per employee to retain furloughed staff amid concerns that companies are about to sack tens of thousands of workers as the original job retention scheme begins to wind down. Companies will be given £2,000 for each apprentice they take on under the age of 25. Yet his most significant addition to the job protection measures is the government’s offer to pay the the wages of any new young employee for six months. Announcing his Plan for Jobs, the chancellor said the government was not going to accept anxiety over job losses and that it would do all it could to “give everyone the opportunity of good and secure work”. He said: “People need to know that although hardship lies ahead, no one will be left without hope.” A cut in VAT from 20% to 5% for hospitality, tourism and accommodation services – including pubs, restaurants, cafes, hotels, zoos and cinemas – until next January would cost the Treasury £4bn, he said. It is effective from next Wednesday and covers food, accommodation and attractions but will not apply to alcohol. A new policy, “Eat out to help out”, which the chancellor described as creative and never tried in the UK before, will give people a 50% discount on eating in restaurants and cafes, from Monday to Wednesday throughout August. Businesses will need to register through a website, open from next Monday. The maximum discount per head under the scheme will be £10. An immediate stamp duty holiday for homes sold for up to £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland until 31 March next year was also announced. Sunak said the move would save jobs in the construction sector and encourage homeowners to move and invest in their homes. The furlough scheme will be coming to an end in October, the chancellor confirmed, saying he did not want to give people false hope that their jobs would continue in their current form. “Leaving the furlough scheme open for ever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before,” he said. “And the longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade, and they will find it harder to get new opportunities. “It is in no one’s long-term interests for the scheme to continue for ever, least of all those trapped in a job that can only exist because of government subsidy.” The fresh spending commitments came as Sunak said the government would be defined by its response to the crisis and he would never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome of the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the government would fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18- to 24-year-olds to prevent young people from bearing the brunt of the economic crisis. Each “kickstarter” job will cover 100% of the national minimum wage for 25 hours a week, allowing employers to provide wage top-ups without any clawback of state funds. People under 25 receive a lower national minimum wage than others, starting at £4.55 an hour for someone under 18, rising to £6.45 an hour for 18- to 20-year-olds and £8.20 an hour for 21- to 24-year-olds. The chancellor said companies could start making applications for the job subsidies within a month and that the first young people would be employed in the autumn. In the first two months of the Covid-19 crisis, the number of 18- to 24-year-olds claiming universal credit rose by a quarter of a million to almost 500,000, while it is estimated that 700,000 school leavers and university graduates will enter a depressed jobs market this summer. The plan revives an idea used by Labour during the global financial crisis that the tax and spending watchdog, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has already assessed as an effective scheme. Alongside the youth scheme, the chancellor announced a £3bn green investment recovery package to decarbonise public buildings and cut emissions from poorly insulated homes. In a further move to generate jobs around the country, Sunak said the plan included £1bn for public buildings – such as schools and hospitals – and a £2bn scheme to retrofit people’s homes. Homeowners will also be able to apply for vouchers of up to £5,000, with up to £10,000 available for some of the poorest families. “We are doubling down on our ambitions to level up,” he said.",Summer statement 2020; Business; Rishi Sunak; UK news; Politics; Economic recovery; Economics; Coronavirus; Stamp duty; Services sector; Food & drink industry; Pubs; Travel & leisure; Eat out to help out; UK job furlough scheme,UK news
2020-06-03T09:00:34Z,Making GDP the focus of a post-coronavirus economy would be a mistake | Carys Roberts,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/post-coronavirus-economy-gdp-growth-green-economy-million-jobs,"The UK lockdown might be easing, but the path ahead for the economy will be long and difficult. Unemployment this quarter is likely to rise twice as fast as it did following the global financial crisis. Almost half of businesses that have taken up one of the government’s bounce-back loans do not expect to be able to pay it back. It’s tempting in a crisis to want to do whatever it takes to get economic activity – measured by GDP – back to where it was before. But an overwhelming and singular focus on increasing GDP would be a mistake. GDP figures do not tell us who is benefitting from growth. GDP does not tell us whether environmental resources – and nature – are being dangerously depleted, and does not reflect the value of caring, much of which is performed by women. Boris Johnson has called for the UK to “build back better”, but to use government resources and capacity most effectively and – more fundamentally – to take the opportunity to build a better kind of economy and society, we need to know what it is we want to rebuild. This is precisely the moment to think beyond a blind pursuit of GDP, about what kind of economic activity to bring back and prioritise, and what we could do without. Any stimulus package must be tailored to create not just any economic activity, but that which will serve society best. As a result, any recovery or spending plan should be scrutinised not just on its size, but what it is spent on. This must be a green recovery. That does not mean adding on a few green job programmes to a larger, fossil-fuelled stimulus: the whole recovery package must accelerate the UK’s path to net-zero carbon and restore our natural environment, which is in crisis. Anything else risks emerging from one disaster only to accelerate headlong into another. As the government turns on the taps to boost the economy, there is a huge opportunity to fill the £30bn per year funding gap for green investment. The recovery must target well-paid, high-quality jobs, spread around the country. These must provide good work for those who have lost it as a result of Covid-19, as well as people previously locked out of the jobs market or at risk of being left behind on the journey to net zero. This is a more profound shift than it appears. Currently, stimulus packages aim to boost GDP, and jobs are a way to get there. But what matters is that ordinary people have access to secure incomes – both for themselves, and because this will ensure spending in the economy (people who need money are more likely to spend it) and a sustainable tax base. An alternative approach, for example, of loosening lending restrictions for mortgages, might boost GDP but would do so by increasing debt and raising house prices, benefitting the already wealthy while hurting people without wealth. The recovery must involve a reconsideration of what is valuable in society. The pandemic has put into stark relief the extraordinary contribution of health and care workers, many of whom are women and migrants, and the essential support of key workers across the economy. The recovery must recognise that contribution in higher pay and better working conditions. So, too, the pandemic has caused conversations up and down the country about unpaid care work and who performs it. But the easing of lockdown has prioritised marketised activity over human relationships, which don’t require cash. You can visit your parents at home, but only if you want to purchase their house or clean it. The recovery should recognise and reflect what is important to people and valuable – not just economic activity. These goals are not in conflict but instead are inextricably linked. Achieving them requires and provides an opportunity to rethink an economy that doesn’t work for so many across the country or for future generations. We estimate that close to a million good jobs could be created in this new, green economy, with many more if we choose to invest in our social care system. Talking about and targeting the “economy” as an abstraction masks the underlying shape and nature of the activity taking place underneath. It means we miss people: who loses out, and who benefits from the status quo being restored. Lockdown has found us in a collective moment of reimagining, but this will not last for ever: we should use it to ask what economic activity we want to rebuild, and what we could do without. • Carys Roberts is executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

2020-06-30T05:00:03Z,Environmental experts dismayed by details of Johnson's 'New Deal',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/environmental-experts-dismayed-by-details-of-johnsons-new-deal,"Boris Johnson is to set out a “new deal” for jobs and infrastructure on Tuesday, painting himself as a “Rooseveltian” prime minister lifting Britain out of the biggest recession in centuries, and a pledge to use the coronavirus crisis to tackle unresolved challenges such as health, education and regional inequalities. “To that end, we will build build build,” he is expected to say. “Build back better, build back greener, build back faster, and to do that at the pace that this moment requires. However, his promise to “build back greener” was greeted with dismay by environmental experts, who were concerned that the climate crisis receives scant attention in what the government is revealing so far of its plans. Most of the spending announcements will focus on the NHS, education and improvements for town centres. There will be £100m for roads and £10m for rail in Manchester, as well as £900m on unspecified “shovel-ready” local growth projects in England. Tree-planting is set for a boost, with Johnson re-affirming plans to plant more than 75,000 acres a year by 2025, with £40m for local conservation projects creating 3,000 jobs and safeguarding 2,000. Ed Matthew, of the Climate Coalition, said: “The only thing Rooseveltian about this plan is that it belongs in the fossil fuel age. There is very little announced today which will do anything to accelerate the transition to a zero carbon economy. The prime minister has to back up his rhetoric on a green recovery with action to prioritise green investment. Future generations will not forgive a government that fails to use this opportunity to build a safer climate for us all.” Tanya Steele, chief executive of conservation group WWF, added: “We are in the midst of a climate and nature crisis, and these lukewarm plans address only part of our nation’s much-needed recovery. The prime minister is out of touch with the scale of the challenges.” Calls for a green recovery have been gathering steam, with economists, businesses, healthcare professionals, creative industries and the government’s own advisers all making the case for one. Johnson is making his speech in the Midlands on Tuesday morning, while thousands of people are expected to gather online for a “mass virtual lobby” of parliament to discuss the potential for a green recovery. “Thousands of people are participating in the first ever virtual lobby of parliament on the day of this speech, calling for a green recovery,” said Matthew. “They will not be impressed.” Missing from the prime minister’s speech were much-trailed plans to boost energy efficiency through a national programme of home insulation, which was a £9.2bn Conservative manifesto pledge. The UK has the most inefficient housing stock in Europe, and renovating draughty homes would reduce people’s energy bills, improve living conditions, and cut carbon emissions. However, a report in the Financial Times suggested Dominic Cummings was against the programme. “If they can’t be trusted to deliver on their biggest climate pledge in their manifesto, what manifesto pledge can they be trusted to deliver?” asked Matthew. “If the government fails to deliver on this pledge, their climate credentials will be in shreds.” Environmental experts are also concerned that without a green recovery strategy in place, and without clear low-carbon directives, the prime minister’s call to “build build build” will result in high-carbon infrastructure being locked in. Steele said: “To avoid catastrophe, we need a low-carbon nature-powered recovery, not one weighed down by tarmac and concrete. This is another missed opportunity – and we don’t have many chances left.” The National Infrastructure Strategy, which is supposed to set out plans on key environmental issues such as energy networks, transport, flood defences and waste, has now been put off to the autumn, having been already delayed in March’s budget. The UK is in the international spotlight as host of the UN climate summit, Cop26, which has been delayed by a year from its original date of this November. Small developing nations in particular are looking to the UK for leadership at the summit, intended to revitalise the Paris agreement of 2015. Businesses have also called for a green recovery, with hundreds joining in events for the London Climate Week this week. David Smith, chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, said: “Jobs, skills and infrastructure are core to the UK’s green recovery. The networks are ready to support this growth with shovel-ready projects across the length and breadth of the country, projects which will themselves provide the backbone to our country’s net zero [carbon emissions] future.” Fatima Ibrahim, co-executive director of the Build Back Better coalition of groups calling for a green recovery, said: “The prime minister is completely right to call for a ‘New Deal’ for the UK, because he knows that Britain wants a change. But, as ever, the proof is in the details and despite the loud and proud rhetoric of a “positively Rooseveltian” economic stimulus, certain aspects of the £5bn stimulus package are just prepackaged proposals that show no concern nor plan for decarbonising the UK economy. This is deeply concerning for the millions of us that want to create a green, fair and strong economy off the back of this crisis.”",Environment; UK news; Politics; Boris Johnson; Climate crisis; Coronavirus,Environment
2020-07-08T04:07:23Z,How Rishi Sunak could kickstart UK's post-lockdown economy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/08/how-rishi-sunak-plans-to-kickstart-uks-post-lockdown-economy,"Rishi Sunak is preparing to announce a wide-ranging package of tax and spending measures to kickstart Britain’s economic recovery from the coronavirus lockdown. Designed to cushion the blow from rising unemployment and to help businesses back to their feet, the summer economic update on Wednesday comes as Britain grapples with the worst recession in living memory. Here are the key announcements to look out for from the chancellor. Job creation scheme The chancellor will use the summer economic update to announce a £2bn temporary job creation scheme for the under 25s. In a three-point plan confirmed ahead of the statement, the government will fund six-month job placements for an estimated 350,000 18- to 24-year-olds, who are viewed as being at most risk of suffering the long-term consequences of unemployment during the crisis. Branded as the “Kickstart” job scheme, the package will include the government covering 100% of the national minimum wage for each young employee, for 25 hours a week. Employers will also be able to provide wage top-ups. Stamp duty A temporary cut in stamp duty – a tax levied on home purchases – could be announced by the chancellor to reboot the housing market after from three months of lockdown. Waiting until the autumn budget to implement the tax cut in England and Northern Ireland – it is devolved in Wales and Scotland – could dent property sales until then, meaning Sunak could announce an immediate cut on Wednesday. Sunak has drawn up plans to increase the threshold at which homebuyers start paying stamp duty from £125,000 to as much as £500,000, according to reports. VAT The rate of value added tax could be cut to boost consumer spending in order to kickstart Britain’s economic recovery, while supporting households that have experienced reductions in income during the crisis. Sunak has come under pressure to announce the change from former chancellors Alistair Darling and Sajid Javid. Targeted cuts for sectors of the economy hit harder than others could be used – with pubs, restaurants and cafes reportedly under consideration. However, a cut across the board from the current level of 20% to 17% would be expensive, costing the exchequer around £21bn in lost income. Employer NICS Business leaders are urging the chancellor to cut employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) to encourage firms to take on new staff. The chancellor is thought to be considering NICs holidays for employers as part of the stimulus package. Reducing employer NICS could be targeted to help companies in sectors hardest hit by the Covid-19 crisis, such as in hospitality, leisure and retail. Jobcentres Faced with a sharp rise in unemployment, Sunak is expected to announce that the government will double the number of work coaches, with more than £800m of funding. The extra spending, however, does come after a decade of cuts to support for unemployed people, with as many as one in 10 Jobcentres closed in the past decade. The new funding settlement will double the number of work coaches to 27,000, with 13,500 new recruits. Traineeships The chancellor will announce £111m of funding for new traineeships. These programmes for young people last up to six months and help teach key job skills, as well as offer work experience. The government will also offer businesses an £1,000 bonus to give work experience placements. Green spending Sunak is set to confirm the launch of a £3bn green investment recovery package to decarbonise public buildings and cut emissions from poorly insulated homes. It includes £1bn for public buildings – such as schools and hospitals – and a £2bn scheme to retrofit people’s homes. Under the plans, homeowners will be able to apply for vouchers of up to £5,000, with up to £10,000 available for some of the poorest families. Heating buildings accounts for almost a fifth of UK greenhouse gas emissions. However, campaigners have said £3bn falls significantly short of requirements to combat global heating. Arts funding Britain’s beleaguered arts, culture and heritage industries will receive a £1.57bn rescue package to help weather the impact of coronavirus. Boris Johnson announced the plans over the weekend, although Sunak is expected to include the funding package in his economic update as evidence of the government stepping in with additional support for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy. The support pot for cultural organisations in England will consist of £270m in loans and £880m in grants. Funds will also be extended to cultural institutions and English Heritage, as well as to devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Funds for capital investment worth £120m will be made available to restart construction on cultural infrastructure and heritage construction projects paused because of the pandemic. Furlough scheme Business leaders, trade union leaders and Labour have urged Sunak to extend the biggest government support scheme launched since the onset of the pandemic. Since March, as many as 9.4m jobs have been furloughed at 1.1m companies, at a cost to the exchequer of £27.4bn so far. It is due to be scaled back from the end of July, and closed entirely by the end of October. Sunak has so far refused to allow an extension for especially hard-hit sectors. Voucher scheme The Treasury has been exploring plans to give all adults £500 and children £250 in vouchers to spend in sectors of the economy worst hit by the Covid-19 crisis. The idea, floated by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was used in China in April, and could be used by Sunak to help reboot Britain’s retail, leisure and hospitality sectors.",Rishi Sunak; Business; Politics; Conservatives; Coronavirus; Economic policy; Economic recovery; UK news; Job losses; Property; Tax and spending; Tax; Economics; Money; Stamp duty; Youth unemployment; Green economy,Politics
2020-11-17T22:41:23Z,The key areas of Boris Johnson's 'green industrial revolution',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/17/the-key-areas-of-boris-johnsons-green-industrial-revolution,"Boris Johnson’s £12bn plan for a “green industrial revolution” spans renewable energy, nuclear power and countryside restoration. However, some of the objectives are likely to be difficult to reach, and the plan has been criticised for a lack of ambition in key areas. Offshore wind Offshore wind has plunged in price in recent years, spurring an increase in windfarm construction even as government incentives have been slashed. However, the UK’s electricity grid has not kept up with the pace of change, and no commitment to offshore wind can be complete without explaining how the grid will be updated. Green groups are also concerned that a rush to new offshore windfarms will harm marine and coastal habitats, unless there is more coordination in their planning. Industry experts are also worried that the boom in offshore wind will fail to benefit UK companies and will be led by those overseas that import components. While the government claims that jobs will be created here, many of them are likely to be low-value “muck-shifting” construction work rather than in high-value manufacturing, unless there is more support for manufacturers. The government promises to produce enough offshore wind to power every home, but the electricity needs of the average family are likely to increase markedly as people switch to electric vehicles and heat pumps instead of gas boilers. Onshore wind is cheaper than offshore wind, but the construction of onshore windfarms in England has all but ground to a halt, owing to planning reforms under David Cameron. Hydrogen Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future for two decades, but despite advances in technology, the prospect of a hydrogen fuelled economy is still some way off. The International Energy Agency says investment in the technology now is a good idea, as part of a green recovery, but green groups are concerned that fossil fuel companies may see in hydrogen fuel an excuse to keep exploring for natural gas. That is because currently the main source of hydrogen is as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. They warn that if hydrogen is to be truly low-carbon, the industry must invest instead in other forms of hydrogen production, such as producing the fuel from water. Nuclear Hinkley Point in Somerset is the UK’s only new nuclear power plant currently under construction, and has been plagued by lengthy delays and rising costs. When the plant finally comes on stream, it is likely to be the most expensive source of power in the UK. Plans for a second new reactor in Wales were finally abandoned in September by the Japanese company Hitachi, and proposals for a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk are under review. If the government wishes to expand nuclear power, it will have to prove that it can be economical. Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank, said: “The only way to build another big nuclear reactor is if the government puts electricity bills up twice to pay for it – first to buy the concrete and steel to build it and then again to buy its electricity at far higher price than renewable generators will be charging. [And] the main problem with small modular reactors is that no one has one for sale – not even Rolls-Royce. They are actually offering to design one but only if the government will guarantee a £32bn order for 16 and pays half the £400m cost of the design. One word for deciding to go ahead on this basis is ‘brave’, a more appropriate word might be ‘foolhardy’.” Electric vehicles The move to bring forward the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles has been widely trailed, and car manufacturers are now accelerating the shift to electric engines. What is so far missing is a plan for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Building such infrastructure could generate tens of thousands of “shovel-ready” jobs, but who will pay for it? Cash-strapped local authorities currently shoulder much of the cost for the limited infrastructure available, but it is a patchwork system with widely varying costs for drivers across the country. There is also no answer yet to the question of how heavy goods vehicles will be shifted away from fossil fuels. Public transport, cycling and walking Lockdown this spring provided a clear demonstration of what environmentalists have been arguing for years: that our towns and cities have been ruled by the motorcar, to the detriment of public health and the climate, but with better planning a healthier way of life is possible. More people would cycle and walk if it was easier and safer to do so, but the strength of the car lobby has been demonstrated by the uproar in many areas over low-traffic neighbourhoods. Covid-19 has also led to people forsaking public transport, and many will be difficult to entice back – though if the shift to home-working becomes permanent, this may be less of a problem. Making streets more accessible to cyclists and pedestrians will inevitably mean discouraging private car use in most of our towns and cities, and that will require muscular intervention by central and local government to face down the motoring lobby. The question is whether this government will have the courage needed to follow through on this commitment. Aviation and greener maritime Aviation and shipping have been left out of the UK’s carbon targets, as they have been left out of international climate agreements. But as carbon dioxide from other sources has been reduced, they represent an increasing share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen fuel, in the form of ammonia, offers hope for shipping – but that prospect is still years off, and the shipping industry has shown little sign of wanting to reform itself in the meantime, despite its many opportunities for reducing emissions. As the Guardian has revealed, the vast majority of emissions from aviation are produced by a minority of flyers. Most people in the UK do not fly in any given year, and when they do it is usually for a single family holiday. A frequent flyer levy would help to discourage people from taking more flights, without penalising the majority of people who fly rarely, but the government appears to have rejected this option – perhaps not wishing to place further burdens on an industry that has all but collapsed during the pandemic. Homes and public buildings The UK has some of the leakiest, draughtiest housing stock in the world – but until the Green Homes Grant was introduced at the end of September, there was no government assistance for homeowners wishing to insulate and upgrade their dwellings. Teething problems with the new scheme have meant a lack of installers signing up, however. If the government wants to encourage installers to sign up to the Green Homes Grant, the message from the construction industry is clear: the £3bn scheme must be extended beyond its current end date of next March. Heat pumps offer a green alternative to gas boilers, but they are expensive and there are few installers with the skills needed. If the government wants people to choose heat pumps – which can cost £10,000 – over gas boilers, some form of compulsion, on the same lines as the phase-out of electric vehicles by 2030, is likely to be needed alongside financial incentives to reduce the costs to householders. Carbon capture Capturing and storing carbon dioxide – in disused oil and gas fields under the North Sea, for instance – is likely to be needed for the UK to meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. Over the last two decades, successive governments have made several attempts to kickstart the industry, but government funding was finally pulled by the then chancellor George Osborne under austerity. The technology has now been proven in pilot projects around the world, but if it is to be deployed at scale the key question is who will pay for it? Some form of carbon tax on high-carbon industries would provide the funds needed, but companies already facing turmoil from Brexit are likely to push back strongly against any such plans. Nature Tree-planting provides a long-term way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but the government has so far failed to meet its own targets on growing new woodlands. Farmers are still waiting for details of the environment land management contracts that will replace their current EU subsidies, which are supposed to reward them for restoring natural features such as bogs and wetlands. Natural England has been demoralised and starved of funds. If ministers want to encourage tree-planting and nature restoration, farmers will need incentives and the government’s own agencies will need a boost. Innovation and finance Public companies are facing new rules on how to report on their exposure to the risks from climate breakdown, and many already do so. Green finance, prioritising low-carbon technologies, is also a growing sector, and investors such as pension funds are increasingly looking to green their portfolios. Tax incentives could help encourage more investors down the same route. The main question is whether the government will put forward public funding – there have been proposals for a publicly funded green infrastructure bank, to invest in the changes needed to decarbonise the UK’s ageing buildings, and transport, communications, water and energy networks. That would require long-term commitment: the original Green Investment Bank, set up with public money under the coalition government, was quickly abandoned a few years later, and produced little tangible return. The original 10-point plan contained a guarantee that the UK would halt government funding for fossil fuels overseas. That commitment appears to have been dropped, though it may resurface if internal government rows are resolved.",Green politics; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nuclear power; Wind power; Energy; Renewable energy; Gas; Construction industry; Trees and forests; Environment; Fossil fuels,Environment
2020-02-25T00:01:34Z,UK lags behind in €124bn European low-carbon investment table,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/uk-lags-behind-in-124bn-european-low-carbon-investment-table,"British companies are lagging far behind their European neighbours in low-carbon investment after contributing only 3% of the continent’s €124bn (£104.2bn) green spending last year. A report has revealed that German-listed companies invested 11 times more in low-carbon investments such as electric vehicles, renewable energy and smart energy grids than UK firms. London-listed companies spent €4bn on green research and technologies compared with €44.4bn from German groups, including the carmaker Volkswagen, which invested more than a third of Europe’s total low-carbon spending in 2019. The report, from the climate disclosure organisation CDP, said Germany, Spain and Italy topped the company league table for low-carbon investment last year while the UK finished sixth, below France and Denmark. The report, which was co-authored by the global management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, reflected well on countries that are home to major manufacturers and utilities that have made heavy investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy projects in the last year. By contrast, UK companies did not fare as well in the investment rankings because much of the country’s green infrastructure spending is outsourced to foreign companies, including Spain’s Iberdrola, the owner of Scottish Power, and the Danish wind power giant Ørsted. The report warned that despite the €124bn investment in green solutions across the continent, low-carbon spending will need to double if Europe hopes to meet its climate targets. On average, companies included in the report dedicated about 12% of their annual spending to low-carbon technologies but this will need to rise to 25% to help create a carbon-neutral Europe. UK and EU leaders have agreed to be climate neutral, or “net zero”, by 2050 in a bid to keep global temperatures from climbing to levels that could lead to catastrophic climate chaos. Steven Tebbe, the managing director of CDP in Europe, said achieving this goal means that Europe’s economy needs to cut its emissions at the rate of nearly 8%, which requires “a fundamental transformation of our economic business model”. He said: “The investment decisions taken by European companies and their owners will make or break whether we are successful – and they need to double down.” The report found that almost 900 listed European companies invested a total of €59bn in new low-carbon capital investments and €65bn in research and development last year. The biggest areas of new investment were in research and development of electric vehicle technologies, which reached €43bn across Europe, and capital investment in renewable energy, which reached €16bn. Investment in energy grid infrastructure and smart energy technology climbed to €15bn and €8bn respectively. “Across many types of investment, the business case for transitioning businesses on to a low-carbon pathway is clear and the opportunities vast,” Tebbe said. The CDP estimates that the potential value of Europe’s new low-carbon business opportunities could reach €1.22tn – more than six times the €192bn of green investment required to realise this financial benefit. “But overall current investment levels are still short of putting European firms on track for net zero emissions,” he said. “For industries where decarbonisation is more challenging, there is a serious need for financial markets and policymakers to create better conditions for low-carbon investment and deliver stronger incentives to drive investment into breakthrough technologies, where capital expenditure is often high and returns long-term.”",Renewable energy; Energy industry; Business; Energy; Environment; UK news; Europe,Environment
2020-07-08T11:46:41Z,Summer statement 2020: the chancellor's key points at a glance,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/08/summer-statement-2020-the-chancellors-key-points-at-a-glance,"Sunak’s opening remarks The chancellor says people are anxious about losing their job and unemployment rising. “We’re not just going to accept this,” he adds. Sunak says he is announcing a “plan for jobs” to protect, create and support employment. He says at the start of the crisis the government provided £160bn to cushion the economic fallout from the Covid-19 crisis and lockdown. Britain is entering the second phase of the government’s economic response, he says. The job of responding to the crisis has “only just begun”, he adds. The chancellor says the government will put the public finances back on a “sustainable footing”, but he suggests this should be in future as Britain rebuilds. Kate Proctor, political correspondent: There is naturally deep concern about the economic recovery from coronavirus but the Conservatives are equally as worried about losing ground on their election-winning “levelling-up” agenda and sticking to their promise not to return to austerity. The thousands of voters in the north and Midlands who Johnson accepted had “lent” him their vote are core to the Conservative party’s continued success which is why the economic offer is, in part, so uniquely expansive. Furlough scheme The furlough scheme will wind down flexibly and gradually until the end of October, Sunak confirms. “Leaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before,” says the chancellor. A jobs retention bonus will help to wind down the scheme: businesses will be paid £1,000 to retain furloughed staff. This would cost the Treasury more than £9bn if every job furloughed is protected, Sunak says. KP: Sunak was extremely firm on having a hard deadline for furlough to be wound down and admits when it does end it will be a “difficult moment”. This was expected but his language was categoric that he cannot be leant on to keep it going. Labour is likely to hit back on this point, suggesting it should be faded out on a sector by sector basis over a longer period of time. Kickstart scheme Sunak announces the “kickstart” job creation scheme for young people. The government will pay the wages of new young employees for six months. There will be an initial £2bn to fund hundreds of thousands of jobs. Sunak says there will be no cap on the number of places available. KP: The younger generation is being described perhaps optimistically as “kickstarters” in an attempt by government to reframe their economic prospects. This is a significant pledge by the chancellor, particularly the offer to pay the wages of young people going into new jobs for six months, though there will be scepticism that these measures are a short-term sticking plaster. There will be questions on whether any of these new jobs exceed the initial six-month period. Training and jobs Jobcentre work coach numbers will be doubled, the chancellor says. Apprenticeships will be supported by bonuses for companies. Firms will get a payment of £2,000 for each apprentice they take on. Companies taking on apprentices aged over 25 will be given £1,500. KP: This is a time-limited offer as the bonus scheme is for employers who apply between August 2020 and January 2021. This policy is again open to criticism of short-termism. Green investment Sunak says the government wants a “green recovery with concern for our environment at its heart”. As previously announced, the government will provide £3bn for decarbonising housing and public buildings. Vouchers worth £5,000 and up to £10,000 for poorer families will be made available out of a £2bn pot to retrofit homes with insulation, helping to cut carbon emissions. £1bn will be allocated to make public buildings greener. KP: These are far-reaching plans for energy efficiency through the country’s housing stock but the government is technically committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. That firm pledge appeared to be missing from the “green recovery” portion of the chancellor’s speech. This won’t go unnoticed as there is concern the government is reducing its emphasis on strict targets. Sunak has stood firm though on the government’s environmental record, replying later in the Commons that the UK has decarbonised faster than almost any other European country. Stamp duty The chancellor announces he will cut stamp duty to reinvigorate the housing market. The threshold for stamp duty will increase from £125,000 to £500,000. The cut will be temporary, running until 31 March 2021, and will take effect immediately. KP: There will be a huge sigh of relief from anyone buying or selling a home as the scheme starts immediately. Earlier reports suggested it would not be introduced until the autumn budget and this rightly caused panic that the housing market would effectively grind to a halt. VAT cut for hospitality Sunak says more than 2 million people work in the hospitality and tourism sectors, which have been hit hard by Covid-19, warranting further support from the government. VAT will be cut from the current rate of 20% to 5% for the next six months on food, accommodation and attractions. The cut lasts from Wednesday 8 July until 12 January 2021. Sunak says the move is a £4bn catalyst, benefiting more than 150,000 businesses and consumers. KP: This is an acknowledgement that some sectors have been particularly hard hit compared with others and it should encourage much higher levels of consumer spending. This will also help UK tourism and fits into the government’s push to get people to enjoy the summer, take days out, holiday in the UK, eat out and spend as usual. Discounts on eating out The chancellor announces an “eat out to help out discount” to encourage consumers to spend at pubs, restaurants and cafes. Meals eaten at any participating businesses, from Mondays to Wednesdays in August, will be 50% off up to a maximum discount of £10 per head for everyone, including children. Businesses will be able to register through a website launching on Monday. Firms can claim money back to have money in their bank accounts within five working days. Sunak says 1.8 million people work in the industry, whose jobs can be supported. “We can all eat out to help out,” he adds. KP: This is an unusual idea, which Sunak explained has never been tried in the UK before, and its novelty wore off in a few short seconds. It comes with many caveats, including eligibility criteria for participating restaurants and a claim-back system. The public can only take up the offer of cheaper meals three days a week. It remains to be seen how effective this will be and it may turn out to be more of a gimmick than some of Sunak’s other solid policy offers.",Summer statement 2020; Business; UK news; Rishi Sunak; Politics; Eat out to help out; UK job furlough scheme,UK news
2019-10-25T12:23:19Z,Prince Charles calls on City finance to fight climate emergency,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/25/prince-charles-calls-on-city-to-help-fight-climate-emergency,"Prince Charles has called on the City of London to help protect the environment by investing trillions of pounds into green investments which help create a sustainable economy. In an interview with the Evening Standard the heir to the British throne said big businesses and City investors must drive a rapid decarbonisation of the economy before the environmental crisis becomes “a total catastrophe”. The prince said green investment has “suddenly taken off” because the returns on sustainable projects are now better than those for fossil fuels. “The money is now at last beginning to become available … because there are trillions of pounds out there, particularly in the private sector [which can now potentially be harnessed to drive real change]. The key is the private sector, which has to lead, then you can create a partnership with the public sector,” he said. He said: “The problem that I’ve found is that after 35 to 40 years of trying my best with corporate, social and environmental responsibility with the private sector, and countless seminars and workshops, trying to get people to recognise the huge challenges we face, we could never actually crack the real problem, which was the lack of the real understanding on the part of the financial services and capital markets sector to understand why there was such a need to invest.” He added it was now “more critical than ever” for the private sector to look for sustainable investments which direct money to the most effective sustainability projects. “Whether it is regeneration, reforestation, sorting out fisheries and ocean issues to make them more sustainable. Or agriculture and how to rebuild soil fertility – which is completely degraded around most of the world – because if you can get the soil fertility back again, you can capture carbon much more quickly,” he said. The prince spoke to the Evening Standard in Tokyo during his visit for the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito. His visit took place less than two weeks after Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan, causing at least 80 deaths and underlining the need for governments to prepare for extreme storms, now more likely because of global heating.",King Charles III; Climate crisis; Evening Standard; Japan; UK news; Business; City of London Investment Trust; Financial sector; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Green economy,UK news
2020-01-24T13:54:34Z,US and Europe clash over climate crisis threat on last Davos day,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/24/us-and-europe-clash-over-climate-crisis-threat-on-last-davos-day,"The US and Europe have clashed over the threat posed by global heating as Donald Trump’s finance minister downplayed the risks of a climate crisis during the final session of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Steve Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, said the debate should be about “environmental issues” rather than climate change, that the costs were being over-estimated and that climate was only one of several concerns that needed to be discussed. He reacted strongly after the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said it was vital to include climate risks into economic forecasts and Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said his country was stepping up its fight to reduce the use of carbon. “We don’t know how to price these risks and so we are over-estimating the costs”, Mnuchin said. “If you want to put taxes on people go ahead and put a carbon tax. That is a tax on hardworking people.” Mnuchin said technology would provide the solution to reducing carbon emissions and that the costs of action would be lower in 10 years time. “Environmental issues have an impact on the economy but it is one of many important issues.” Mnuchin cited the Coronavirus health emergency, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the possibility of oil prices hitting $120 (£92) a barrel, and the need to power development in poor countries as other problems that policy makers needed to be concerned about. “There are way too many people in the developing world who don’t have access to electricity. We need to create an environment where they have better lives,” he said. Mnuchin found himself in a minority of one on a panel that included the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, and the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, as well as Lagarde and Scholz. Georgieva said the investments that would be needed to transform economies could be the “silver bullet” that would lift the world economy from four lows: low productivity, low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. “We need to think of policies that are good for the economy, good for the environment and good for people” she said. Green investment could provide a use for the world’s big pool of unused savings. “Not everything is doom and gloom.” Lagarde said that pricing the cost of making the transition to a low carbon economy coupled with pressure on companies to disclose their exposure to climate crisis risk would persuade companies to move faster. The ECB head said that, according to the marketing industry, there were three things that made people move: sex, fear and greed. “I don’t want to talk about the first but the fear factor is there. Look at the complete disasters that are going on around the world.” Turning to greed, Lagarde said the recent announcement from Larry Fink, the executive director of BlackRock, that the world’s biggest asset manager was moving to sustainable investment was an indication that companies were starting to worry about the impact of the climate emergency on their bottom line. Scholz said Germany’s decision to pay out more than €40bn to coalmining regions and power companies to phase out coal plants was justified by the scale of the threat. “There is climate change and it will hurt us. It will have negative effects on the economy. Britain’s departure from the EU next week had not entirely lifted the threat from Brexit, Lagarde said, noting that the negotiations this year over the new EU-UK trading arrangement had the potential to cause trouble. “Brexit is a little bit less uncertain, but we still have that possible cliff edge in December of 2020. We don’t’ know exactly what the trade relationship will be. And it’s a big partner for the euro area, so that’s certainly a question mark.” Scholz expressed relief that there had not been a “hard Brexit” and predicted that Germany would not take an economic hit from Britain’s departure. “It will be more difficult for the UK because it needs its business model to be reorganised” Scholz said. He added that the City of London would be affected by Brexit. “I think we will find solutions”, Scholz said, while warning the UK that there might not be a “special, competitive advantage of being outside” the EU.",Davos 2020; Business; Davos; Christine Lagarde; World news; UK news; European Union; Europe; US news; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Donald Trump; Environment,Business
2020-02-15T16:00:04Z,The older poor are not so easily convinced to be socialist,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/15/older-poor-not-easily-convinced-to-be-socialist-sanders-labour,"Bernie Sanders is on his way to victory in the race for the Democratic party nomination. There are plenty of trip hazards along the route to challenging Donald Trump in November, and Sanders will need to joust with the billionaire Michael Bloomberg after he finally shows up in the Super Tuesday primary on 3 March, when about a third of all delegates will be allocated from the votes of 14 states. Yet Sanders’s radical programme looks like it will excite enough party members to secure the Democrat nomination in a field of candidates where the more moderate wing, while larger in vote share, is badly split between Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden and Bloomberg, and where his leftist challengers – among them Elizabeth Warren – have fallen away. The Sanders plan to redress economic wrongs perpetrated over decades is extensive. In length and scope, his proposals surpass the manifesto put forward by the Labour party in last year’s general election. Notably, he wants to impose taxes that will halve the wealth of America’s many multimillionaires. More precisely, he will apply a wealth tax on the roughly 300,000 people with a net worth of $32m or above, leaving 99.9% of Americans untouched. The measure should raise an eye-popping $4.35 trillion over 15 years, he estimates. Much of that money will be channelled into low-cost housing. Around 10 million affordable homes will cost $2.5tn, he says. A $200bn green investment fund can be added to writing off $81bn worth of medical debts owed by thousands of households. “Medicare for all” is an uncosted commitment in the manifesto, but bringing 30 million people into any national health scheme is not going to be cheap and will probably eat up whatever remains of the wealth tax he plans to levy. It’s no wonder he describes himself as a socialist. There are economists in the US who say Sanders’s tax plans are modest, justified and just what any social democrat should support. The Nobel laureate Paul Krugman is one. His problem with the Vermont senator is not his leftist ambition, but his simplistic approach to reforms and his misguided determination to call himself a socialist; Krugman fears his opponents will quickly substitute that term for “communist” once battle is joined. Sanders’s punishment is to be omitted altogether from Krugman’s latest book – Arguing with Zombies. Yet the sheer size of Sanders’s aspiration transports him beyond what any social democrat would believe electorally possible, which is why much of the Democratic party is so uncomfortable. Liberal economists who argue for radical leftist policies, and there are a small band in the UK, support financial raids on the top 1%. It stands to reason, they say, that voters would support such a move when it only comes at the expense of someone else’s yacht. Thomas Piketty is a leading light in this cause. He says in his new book, Capital and Ideology, that the broad mass of people can be persuaded to support radical redistributive policies as inequality rises: it just depends on the arguments deployed. His analysis is based on a deep dive into the wealth statistics of a broad range of countries, including Britain and the US. He found that the bottom 50% of the UK’s households own only 5% of the country’s wealth in the form of property, shares and pensions. The US figure is even lower. In this valuable effort he rejects the “misleading” figures offered by the UK’s government data agency, which fails to capture much of the stored wealth held by the super-rich. The Office for National Statistics’ wealth and assets survey for 2016-18 shows the bottom 50% of households owned not 5% but 24% of the UK’s net wealth. There is a sense that this doesn’t matter when almost three-quarters of UK adults over the age of 65 own their homes outright. This staggering figure trumps all others when looking for a reason why so many older UK voters back the Tories. Voting patterns tell us that it doesn’t matter how relatively meagre property wealth is for the baby-boomers of Barnsley or Redruth; it is a stake in society their forebears could only have dreamed of (94% of Britons lived in rented housing in 1901). Piketty pays little attention to intergenerational divides or the attachment low- and middle-income homeowners and pension savers have to their financial assets. He urges the likes of Sanders and the Labour party to stick with their radical agenda. Sadly, a banking collapse is not the same as a war. And averages disguise how unevenly wealth is distributed across the age groups as much as they show class divides. In other words, beware ivory-tower economists fancying themselves as political pundits.",Economics; Business; Bernie Sanders; US news; US elections 2020; Labour,Business
2020-02-03T00:01:02Z,Ofgem sets out nine-point plan to prioritise climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/03/ofgem-sets-out-nine-point-plan-to-prioritise-climate-crisis,"Britain’s energy regulator has said it will change how it governs the industry to help meet the government’s climate targets, after coming under fire for failing to prioritise the climate emergency. The regulator published a wide-ranging climate action plan on Monday, which aims to help get 10m electric vehicles on our roads by 2030 and support a fourfold increase in offshore wind generation, while protecting homes from rising energy bills. The nine-point manifesto also includes plans to support low-carbon home heating, tariffs that encourage homes to help balance the energy system, and a crackdown on “greenwash” energy deals. Ofgem’s incoming chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, set out the regulator’s climate manifesto after critics warned that its outdated statutory duties were not aligned with the government’s climate policies. Ofgem was set up to regulate energy companies and safeguard consumer interests, often against price increases. The regulator admitted that it faces trade-offs between supporting ambitious green investments – paid for through energy bills – and the need to protect homes from rising costs. The Guardian reported last year that Britain’s biggest business group, the CBI, was concerned that the regulator’s existing mandate sent “negative signals” to low-carbon investors. The CBI called for a legal change to the regulator’s statutory duties to directly prioritise tackling the climate crisis. On his first day as the regulator’s new boss, Brearley signalled that Ofgem plans to balance the tension between green investments and energy bills without a legal overhaul. “We are taking an approach that recognises that our role protecting consumers includes achieving net zero,” he said. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Ofgem has set out the right challenges, it now needs to deliver on them. If we don’t get the difficult decisions about the low-carbon transition right, it will ultimately be those who can least afford it who end up hardest hit.” The first point in Ofgem’s new climate manifesto will change how the regulator controls the spending of energy companies, in order to avoid stifling investment in low-carbon technologies with a rigid eight-year spending plan. The regulator came under fire from the National Audit Office last week for allowing energy networks to rake in bigger than expected profits by not being tough enough in the price-control plans. Under Ofgem’s new plan, network companies may have the chance to ask for their spending plans to change during set windows within the eight-year period, so that they can adapt their green investment plans as the sector evolves. The change appears to answer fierce criticism from the boss of Scottish Power, Keith Anderson, who last year accused the regulator of hindering the UK’s electric vehicle rollout due to its “colossal disconnect” with Britain’s climate policies. Scottish Power had hoped to make extra investments in car-charging in anticipation of an electric vehicle boom, but Ofgem said the plan would not offer good value for money if the demand failed to materialise. Brearley said: “As low-carbon renewable energy grows and more transport goes electric, the energy system needs to be more flexible to respond to peaks and troughs in both supply and demand. Our new price controls for network companies will clear the path for this, providing the incentives for investment for the future.” Ofgem will also create a fund specifically to unlock investment in innovation on tackling greenhouse gas emissions, and help find ways to encourage homes to use their car batteries to help balance the energy system and use more renewable energy when it is available. Nicola Shaw, the UK boss of National Grid, said: “It’s critical that the regulator, government and industry are aligned to decarbonise the energy sector in the journey to net zero at the lowest cost to consumers, and we both welcome and share Ofgem’s commitment to achieving this.” Ofgem’s nine-point plan, in brief Make price controls more adaptable to help firms invest in clean energy. Set up a regulatory fund to help invest in climate-change solutions. Explore ways to create a “lowest cost” offshore grid to support wind power. Work with government and industry to decarbonise heating. Make UK energy systems fit for a net-zero future. Create a more flexible electricity system to help move towards net zero. Develop a regulatory strategy to help get 10m electric cars on the road by 2030. Support energy firms to create low-carbon products and services for consumers. Change its regulatory approach and take “big decisions” on decarbonisation faster.",Ofgem; Energy industry; Renewable energy; Energy; Regulators; Climate crisis; Business; Environment; Green economy; Energy bills; Energy efficiency; Consumer affairs; Ethical and green living; Household bills; Money; Climate science; UK news,Business
2019-11-22T13:42:02Z,Plaid Cymru says Wales can be cradle of a global green revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/plaid-cymru-says-wales-can-be-cradle-of-a-global-green-revolution,"The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, struck a defiant note at the launch of his party’s manifesto, claiming that an independent Wales could become the cradle of a global green revolution. Price announced a range of ambitious policies including three power-generating tidal lagoons, a barrage and an offshore wind farm as well as new rail lines and metro networks. Comparing his dreams to those of John F Kennedy at the time of the space race, Price said the plans were audacious but achievable if the people of Wales pulled together and freed themselves from the control of the Westminster government. “We’re little over a month away from the beginning of a new decade,” he told supporters at the launch at a college in south Wales. “Let’s inject some hope back into our politics. Let’s set ourselves an audacious goal, as the Kennedy administration did with the Apollo programme. “Let’s plant our flag not on the moon’s surface but here in our own land, not to escape our planet but to save it. Let’s make the coming decade the decade of hope and change. Let 2030 be the year of three zeros – zero carbon, zero waste, zero poverty. “We have the power, we have the potential to create tens of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as Wales becomes the cradle of the green industrial revolution.” Price said his revolution should be led by Wales for Wales. He said the country should have its own national energy company and its own digital infrastructure company rather than those industries being run by “a distant British behemoth”. Plaid is calling for the UK government to give an extra 1% of GDP to green investment over the next 10 years, which Price said would give Wales a boost worth £15bn. The party wants the Treasury to raise Wales’ borrowing limit to £5bn to reach a £20bn total for its “green revolution”. Price has made it clear that if Jeremy Corbyn wants the support of any of his party’s MPs after the election he will need to back Plaid’s investment programme. The manifesto puts 2030 – or before – as the target date for Welsh independence. Price said: “The answers for Wales won’t come from Islington, they won’t come from Bullingdon. The answers will come from us, from Wales. We can lead the way in a million small ways. This is the moment when we start to believe that our future won’t be written for us in the corridors of Westminster or the streets of Whitehall but by us in the valleys and villages.” During the election campaign, Price has been accused of being deliberately provocative to garner headlines. Ahead of the manifesto launch he promised he would keep his anger in check and channel it into hope. As well as the plans for its green revolution, Plaid promised more doctors, nurses, police officers and social housing. The manifesto says there should be another EU referendum and Plaid would campaign for remain. Despite Wales voting in favour of leaving the EU, Price said: “Europe is core to the future of Wales. This Brexit is not for us. It never was, it never will be.” Price said that Wales wanted to be “at the heart of Europe”, adding: “We must defeat the hope-crushing wrecking ball that is Brexit.”",Plaid Cymru; Politics; UK news; Wales; Green economy; Environment; General election 2019,Politics
2020-03-09T08:00:00Z,What is the European Green Deal and will it really cost €1tn?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn,"What is Europe’s green deal? The European Green Deal aims to transform the 27-country bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy, without reducing prosperity and while improving people’s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world. If that sounds ambitious, it is. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it “Europe’s man on the moon moment”. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic. Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution. Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual. How will it work? The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets – a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core – alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources. All of the EU’s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of “50 actions for 2050” for other sectors. Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. “The European green deal is our new growth strategy – a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,” von der Leyen said. What is the legal basis? All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals. East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK – which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda – will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP. The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill. But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans – charged with delivering the green deal – will throw all of its might behind the effort. “It’s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,” says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. “It will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.” Will the green deal make a difference? It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 – good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that – disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key. On other environmental scores, the EU’s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world. But alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: birds, insects, mammals, fish … few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992. How much will it cost and where will the money come from? At least €1 tn (£852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, €503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further €114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states). The next €279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel projects. On top of this Brussels has promised a €100bn “just transition” mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories. But is it really €1 tn? Even friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels’ figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the €503bn from the EU budget as “green investment”, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to “green” the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU’s auditors highlighted how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out “green” cash with little oversight. Others fear that carbon financiers will game the system, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don’t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four “frugal” net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The €503bn is not even in the bank. Even if the EU realised its €1tn plan, it wouldn’t be enough. Bruegel argues the €1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission’s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from Aragón to Silesia. Why does the green deal matter internationally? This year – coronavirus permitting – will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world’s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible. But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases fell short of what is required to stay below 2C, and since 2015 the world’s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after. But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from Donald Trump’s US, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The key player will be China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a pact between the US and China was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone. “EU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,” says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton’s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. “In the face of Trump’s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world’s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.” What do critics say? The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. “The AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,” he says. “The green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won’t be going carbon-neutral,” says Grant. “This will increase the electoral strength of populists.” Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the “just transition” mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, wrote in the Guardian: “Will there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.” Will the UK be affected? Boris Johnson’s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain various loopholes that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees. The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK’s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot. On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What’s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe’s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift. Who are the green agitators in Europe? The idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word “new’ with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement. Von der Leyen, a German defence minister, was a surprise choice to become European commission president, leapfrogging candidates who had run in the European elections in May. Those elections resulted in a record number of seats for European Greens, as climate change topped the agenda in Germany and the Nordic countries. Von der Leyen’s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office. Beyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet. As one official recounts: “You can imagine a conversation with your own children is much more confrontational than a conversation with a shareholder, or a bad headline in a newspaper.” Who’s in favour, who’s against? It’s a bit like world peace: everyone backs the European Green Deal, in theory. But there is a big hole in the ambition to be net-zero by 2050: Poland, which says it will reach climate neutrality at “its own pace”. And beneath the surface, tensions over Europe’s green ambitions are not hard to find. At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry. What role will the European parliament play in the green deal? EU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament. That gives MEPs a weighty role across a swathe of new laws expected to flow from the European Green Deal: a revision of the EU’s heavily criticised carbon trading scheme, new performance standards for cars and vans, an overhaul of farm policy, changes to EU rules on state subsidies that will phase out support for fossil fuels. Typically, the parliament tends to raise the bar on green action – it last year declared a climate emergency. But MEPs often lose the battle against EU ministers, who usually get the upper hand in EU negotiations.

A nurse who was carrying coronavirus unwittingly infected 16 others during a training session in what was described as a “super-spreading event” that led to Hillingdon hospital closing its A&amp;E unit, an inquiry has found. Nurses did not wear face masks or stay two metres apart. Staff at the London hospital say they are baffled as to why the training session was allowed to go ahead, given that most medical training in the NHS is now done online to avoid people gathering. Coronavirus outbreaks are up to 20 times more likely in large care homes, according to a major study seen by the Guardian, prompting calls to divide them into “bubbles” before any second wave hits. And a new points-based checklist being made available from the British Medical Association website [PDF] could help keep healthcare workers safe by offering a way to calculate their risk of severe illness or death from Covid-19, researchers have said, stressing its usefulness for workers of black, Asian and ethnic minority heritage. Wealthy households could be in line for tax rises to claw back the cost of extra spending during the pandemic, after the government called for a wide-ranging review of capital gains tax.

It was erected at dawn by a team directed by the artist Marc Quinn. Reid said she had been secretly working with Quinn on the idea for weeks – “Being up there, with my fist raised – it was an amazing moment, and this captures it. It gives me goose pimples.” The installation will come as a complete surprise to city authorities, who are yet to announce their plans for the location where Colston’s statue was toppled by Black Lives Matter protesters last month. Quinn called the removal of the Colston statue “an amazing act of poetic justice … Bristol will eventually work out something to put on, or to do with, the plinth. But in the meantime it is this charged space … it seemed to us it was time for direct action.” * * * Huawei shown the highway – Patrick Wintour explains that the government removing Huawei from UK networks and barring it from the 5G rollout is part of a wider struggle encompassing the coronavirus pandemic, trade, the national security law imposed on Hong Kong, human rights in China and maritime security in the South China Sea. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, announced a U-turn on the role of Huawei, earning criticism from China – but praise from the US, where the Trump administration says the company poses a spying threat. There are concerns the decision will mean delays to 5G access for small towns and rural areas, with service providers prioritising more lucrative urban areas. The Global Times, mouthpiece of China’s Communist party government, said there would have to be “painful retaliation” over the ban. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Ghislaine Maxwell has entered not-guilty pleas in a Manhattan court over her alleged involvement in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking of minor girls. Maxwell, 58, has been denied bail with her trial scheduled for 12 July 2021. &gt; Donald Trump has ordered an end to Hong Kong’s special economic status under US law to punish China for “aggressive actions” curbing freedoms. Trump also signed a bill penalising banks that deal with Chinese officials implementing new security laws. China said it would retaliate.

A judge-led inquiry into misconduct by undercover police is due to start hearing evidence in public in November. * * * Green bank comeback – The government is poised to reveal plans for a new state-backed green bank to help finance Britain’s climate ambitions, three years after ministers agreed to sell the UK’s Green Investment Bank in a controversial deal dubbed “deeply regrettable” and “politically dubious” by critics. Meanwhile the government’s plans to make Britain’s draughty homes more energy-efficient will make only a fraction of the progress needed towards the UK’s legally binding climate targets, according to a study by the IPPR thinktank. And a service called Loop is to launch in the UK that delivers food, drink and household essentials from leading brands in reusable packaging. It uses durable, refillable containers that can be collected from the doorstep and cleaned for reuse up to 100 times. Today in Focus: Benjamin Zephaniah and George the Poet Two of Britain’s most successful contemporary poets discuss why, despite being born a generation apart, their work is still exposing racial injustice. Lunchtime read: The power of touch “Lockdown has been cruel on everyone I know, in all kinds of ways,” writes Tim Jonze. “I’ve been shielding because it’s still unclear whether the blood clotting cancer I have interacts badly with Covid-19. That has meant embarking on a perma-childcare shift, one that normally begins at about 5am and stretches ahead like a road in the desert, with no places to refuel along the way. “But lack of human touch is not a trauma I can share. In a world starved of physical contact, I’m a guilty glutton, squirrelled away with my plentiful supply, entangled in a cornucopia of limbs; feet in my ribs; fingers in my nostrils. My kids slip soapily down my body when I shower them, murmur gently when I hug them close, spray hay fever sneezes across my face like the super-spreaders of love that they are. I can’t get enough.” Sport Forever in the shadow of West Indies teams who came before them, Jason Holder’s side know how much a first Test series victory in England since 1988 would mean. If the task was simply to show they are capable of communicating on the pitch, then Chelsea players passed the test in their 1-0 win over Norwich in the Premier League. José Mourinho and Jürgen Klopp have strongly criticised the court of arbitration for sport’s ruling over the Manchester City case, the former describing the outcome as “disgraceful”. Mikel Arteta has warned Arsenal a return to the Champions League will become possible only if the club decides to “go for it” and invest significantly. Newcastle United’s takeover saga has been cast into further uncertainty after the Saudi Arabian government permanently barred beIN Sports from operating in the kingdom. And in rugby, Manu Tuilagi believes Sale will get the best out of him after years of injury problems at Leicester. Business Shares have been mostly higher in Asia, though the Shanghai composite index has slipped. The Bank of Japan is due to issue a policy statement but not expected to make any significant changes in its ultra-easy monetary stance. Investors are awaiting April-June economic growth data for China due later in the week. The pound is worth £1.257 and €1.103 at time of writing, while the FTSE is flagged to open around 60 points higher. The papers The Mail puts itself on first-name terms with Jeffery Epstein’s friend: “Ghislaine’s tears as she’s told: you must stay in jail”. Other papers have the Maxwell story but not as their splash: “U-turn on Huawei puts UK’s 5G rollout plan in jeopardy” says our Guardian front page. “We’ll go our own Huawei”, says the Metro. The FT spins it out to “Huawei’s ban from rollout of 5G network provokes fury in Beijing”. The i says “China crisis looms as UK pulls the plug on Huawei”. The Telegraph leads with “Next stop, masks in offices”, saying the idea is part of a “road map to avoid second wave”. Michael Gove is shown coming out of a Pret with no mask – thought it’s not the law just yet – while Liz Truss emerges from the same shop wearing one. The Mirror tells us to be ready to “shop in masks till next year”. The Times has “Threat of homes tax to pay for pandemic” as the government carries out a review of capital gains tax.

2019-11-17T16:07:26Z,How do the parties propose to tackle the climate crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/17/how-do-the-parties-propose-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-election,"Labour Labour’s “green new deal” – or “green industrial revolution” – puts a radical environmental plan at the heart of the party’s election offer. It proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, which it says would create hundreds of thousands of green jobs. The party says the programme would also transform the way people live – from upgrading the UK’s entire housing stock and revitalising public transport to boosting renewable wind and solar industries and decarbonising the country’s energy supply. Although the initial investment would be large, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits, which experts say would total at least £800bn by 2030. The green new deal aims to tie far-reaching environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. The party, which at its conference backed plans to hit zero emissions by 2030, has also said it would ban fracking and boost electric car infrastructure. Conservatives The Tories say they want to double science and research spending to £18bn in the next parliament, with an unspecified amount going to new green technology. The party says it also wants to increase the number of public electric vehicle charging points so that everyone in England and Wales is within 30 miles of a charging point, with an investment of £500m. The party, which has been criticised over its record on onshore wind and solar power, says it will build more offshore windfarms, increasing the UK’s target capacity from 30GW to 40GW by 2030. It has also announced plans to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. It would create “clusters” of carbon capture and storage expertise around the country for £800m in the next decade, and a cabinet-level committee will oversee the commitment to reach its target of net zero carbon by 2050. It has also announced a review of the HS2 high-speed rail project and a moratorium on fracking. Liberal Democrats The party says it will establish citizens’ assemblies to thrash out new policy measures to tackle the climate emergency. It wants to revive the green investment bank, sold off by George Osborne, and end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. It would support onshore and offshore wind and solar power, with a target of 80% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and says all new homes would be fitted with solar panels. It says it would declare a nature crisis and work towards an international Paris-style agreement on preserving the natural world and biodiversity. It has pledged to plant 60m trees a year and impose a moratorium on airport expansion, including Heathrow. The party would ban fracking and new coalmines and has set a net zero target of 2045. Green party The Greens say they would raise £100bn by borrowing every year for the next 10 years to pay for tackling the climate crisis through upgrading infrastructure, including shifting electricity generation to a low-carbon footing, insulating the UK’s draughty housing stock and expanding public transport. They aim to bring forward the UK’s target for net zero carbon from 2050 to 2030 and would scrap nuclear power and expand renewable energy. They are in favour of ending airport expansion, including Heathrow, scrapping HS2 and halting the current road-building plan, spending the money instead on local transport improvements. They would ban fracking and all fossil fuel expansion. SNP The SNP is aiming for a 75% reduction of all emissions by 2030, net-zero carbon by 2040 and net zero for all emissions by 2045. It is proposing to “phase out the need” for petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, investing in active and sustainable travel by doubling cash for walking and cycling to £80m a year. It is introducing a deposit return scheme for drink containers to increase recycling and reduce littering. And an expert panel is looking at what else can be done to reduce demand for single-use items. It has banned fracking and underground coal gasification and says it is “championing the principle” of climate justice.",General election 2019; Green politics; Climate crisis; Environment; Politics; UK news; Energy,Politics
2019-10-01T10:00:38Z,A successful climate plan must also tackle the housing crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/01/a-successful-climate-plan-must-also-tackle-the-housing-crisis,"For years, when the climate movement called for “connecting the dots,” they meant linking extreme weather to the broader story of human-caused climate breakdown. In the age of the Green New Deal, our job is to connect the dots in a different way: between the climate crisis and the crises of economic and racial inequality that afflict us every day. And we have an opportunity to get concrete – literally – by showing precisely how targeted green investment in racialized and working-class communities can slash carbon emissions. One truly radical and intersectional approach? Tackle the United States’ housing and climate crises at the same time – with a Green New Deal for housing. Of course, the centrist climate wonks hate how expansive the Green New Deal idea is. They think every piece of its social policy is an expensive distraction. But they forgot to follow the carbon beyond their tidy little graphs. In the real world, you can’t separate the carbon causing the climate emergency from our physical and economic systems, any more than you can separate windows, furnaces, and air conditioners from your monthly rent bill. And you can’t separate voters’ – and political organizers’ – desires for a safe and affordable home from their commitment to a stable climate. In aggregate, the United States’ 138m housing units cause over 15% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, more than all commercial buildings combined. Housing inequality is also the biggest driver of the country’s horrifying wealth gap, with the median black family owning just $11,000, compared to the median white family owning over $135,000. And housing costs are destroying Americans’ budgets. Nearly 20m households spend over half their income on rent or mortgage payments. Another 20m pay over a third. While the climate movement flexes its muscles by holding climate strikes and blocking pipelines, housing movements all around the country are racking up wins, with campaigns like the Homes Guarantee putting national rent control on the mainstream political agenda. Anyone hoping to become the Democratic nominee should be able to answer the question: what will your climate plan do for the housing crisis? Or, to flip it around: What can your housing policies do for the climate emergency? Either way, a good answer should be the same: a lot. After all, the stories of inequality and energy converge. Homes’ carbon emissions are a reflection of something more visceral: brutal energy costs. Over a third of US households can’t readily afford their monthly utility bill, with people of color disproportionately burdened. One study found that the single main reason that people take out payday loans is to cover utility bills. The third most common reason? To make rent. So far, Bernie Sanders’ mammoth Green New Deal and Housing for All platforms go furthest in tackling these two crises together. Sanders’ plans call for building nearly 10m units of no-carbon, publicly funded housing. And his plans call for massive investments in green upgrades for existing public housing, and doing a massive energy efficiency retrofit program for other homes and buildings, with a focus on low-income residents who cannot afford their own upgrades. And Sanders’ plan calls for universal rent control and zoning changes to facilitate apartment building in affluent neighborhoods; together, these measures would greatly increase affordable density, the cornerstone of no-carbon urbanism. If you were wondering how a jobs guarantee would find work for everyone, now you know: making every home in the country safer, more comfortable, more affordable, and more climate-friendly. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also spoken about how beautiful, sustainable, and resident-friendly affordable housing complexes, with social services like childcare facilities on the ground floor, exemplify the conjoined social and ecological promise of a Green New Deal. We can push all this ambition forward, and make it even more specific. Here’s where the progressive group People’s Action’s Homes Guarantee campaign comes in. (Full disclosure: I was on the campaign’s policy team.) The Homes Guarantee plan’s headline demand is, to echo Bernie, yuge: 12m new units of social housing, built to emit net zero carbon emissions, include a mix of incomes (with the priority going to very low-income households), and built in a way that pioneers low-carbon and sustainable construction methods. Indeed, Sanders’ more recent housing plan explicitly echoes People’s Action’s proposal, from specifics like its Green New Deal tie-ins to its all-encompassing ambition. Sanders’ plan states outright that “we need a homes guarantee”. Yes, it’s counterintuitive to call for a big homebuilding program when we need to emit less. But here’s the thing. In the decades ahead, upwards of 13 million people living in the US could be displaced by sea level rise. Tens of millions of immigrants could – and should – come live in the US. Tens of millions of people will need new homes in the years ahead. It’s precisely through public regulation and public building that we ensure that new homes are net zero carbon. This will vastly reduce overall energy demand, making it much easier to reach zero carbon in our energy system fast. Projects of new and retrofitted affordable housing in the US and around the world are already pioneering green housing techniques. And it’s through those policies that we will develop the skills to slash the ecological footprint of new construction, through more efficient techniques of homebuilding, and by driving sustainable innovations in building materials, like no-carbon concrete. In this way, a Green New Deal for housing would have benefits that go beyond directly affected residents, by driving down the costs of going green for everyone. At the neighborhood level, Sanders and the Homes Guarantee call for making every social housing complex a resiliency center to keep people safe during disasters and heat waves. Our choice is private inefficiency, waste, and injustice, or equality and sustainability through public action, finally providing everyone with a decent home. The Homes Guarantee platform also calls for national rent control and pro-apartment zoning changes. And it calls for green upgrades to existing public housing, getting rid of natural gas and toxic mold. And the platform calls for massive investment into racialized communities to lift up households of color and tackle environmental injustice, through a vast array of careful policies, from energy retrofits to facilitating community land trusts to increasing access to clean transit to universal rent control to protecting families from displacement. A Green New Deal for Housing would be an effective and efficient lever for decarbonizing the economy, creating good jobs, and increasing social, economic, and racial justice. And its core components are already popular. Over the last year, polling by the think tank Data for Progress, where I’m a senior fellow, found majority support for many of this plan’s most crucial elements long before it was put together. In one poll, majorities of both Democrats and Independents – and an overall majority of 57% of total respondents – said that green investments should be prioritized in frontline communities, namely the working class and racialized neighborhoods that have suffered most from pollution and disinvestment. Majority support holds up even when respondents are told this green investment would require tax raises. This past April, Data for Progress also found majority support for the idea that the government should fund enough non-profit and public housing units to ensure that every American without a home should get one (60% support, 23% opposition, 17% no opinion). They found majority support for a policy creating a $50bn fund to weatherize all low-income homes (58% support, 23% opposition, 19% no opinion). And they found strong support for the idea that there that smaller, low-cost housing should be built in middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods (49% support, 25% opposed, 26% no opinion). Is it really so impractical to link climate policy and housing policy – the climate movement and the housing movement – around solutions that would tackle both crises at once? With the climate emergency, everything is connected. We know why that’s dangerous. It’s time to talk about the benefits of all that intersectionality: we can – indeed must – solve our most pressing crises at the same time. Daniel Aldana Cohen is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2. He’s also a senior fellow at Data for Progress, and a member of the Homes Guarantee policy team",Housing; Society; Environment; Climate crisis; Climate science,Opinion
2020-03-29T07:00:48Z,You know change is in the air when the likes of Ashley and Martin back down,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-ashley-martin-high-street-business-scrutiny,"Strange things happen in a crisis. For one, it can dawn on Mike Ashley that pretending that a sports shop is an essential public service is absurd. Friday’s apology from the Sports Direct founder seemed to be more about communication – “ill-judged and poorly timed” emails to overworked government ministers – than his original ludicrous attempt to keep his shops open, but it was still an uncharacteristic climbdown. Even JD Wetherspoon’s Tim Martin, who has never previously appeared to give a damn what anyone thinks, paused to consider he may have made a mistake. Having announced staff would only be paid until the moment the pubs were shut, he then said they would get their wages at the next payroll date provided the government agreed a reimbursement scheme in time. Can anything be read into these examples? Perhaps not. It is possible that freewheeling entrepreneurs, and British business in general, will revert to pre-crisis ways when the coronavirus emergency passes. There will, after all, be huge pressure from investors to recover lost revenues and restore battered share prices in the recovery phase. But, equally, this period of intense public scrutiny of business behaviour – where companies have been divided into heroes and villains – may produce lasting changes. One can speculate on a few. First, tolerance for corporate tax minimisation tactics will be roughly zero. The government will be facing a towering increase in public debt, plus a demand that more cash be spent on the NHS. It will need money from somewhere and could feel emboldened to chase perceived underpayers and financial engineers. So look out, private equity: a tactic of loading companies with debt to minimise tax payments may no longer be tolerated. Corporate Britain has been running too lightly on its shock absorbers. A tax system that rewards well-capitalised firms that can withstand a crisis would be an obvious improvement. Second, appetite for state interventions will increase. Train operating companies’ franchises have been suspended for six months, but one doubts that rotten system will ever be restored. There is a strong case for seeing what the state can achieve instead. Privatised social care also looks ripe for a state takeover. Third, the balance of power could shift in the eternal battle over pay differentials. Will it still be considered acceptable for a chief executive to collect 100 times what the median worker in a firm is paid? Bosses at some firms have already volunteered for salary cuts during the crisis phase. Pressure to re-set pay arrangements permanently will be intense. Unions in the supermarket sector, for instance, would be well-advised to use the crisis to press for more for their members. Fourth, big companies’ treatment of suppliers may come under the microscope. The crisis has exposed the fragile position of small firms that trade with the giants of their industry. Supermarkets have generally behaved honourably by accelerating payments, but Wetherspoons’ refusal to pay suppliers until pubs reopen was as shocking as its approach to staff. The government now has an opportunity to change the rules of the payments game. Finally, the big unknown is how, or if, consumers’ behaviour will change. Cheap trainers and cheap beer have perennial appeal, so it’s probably fanciful to think that Sports Direct and Wetherspoons will suffer a backlash that causes them real difficulty. All the same, shoppers have had a rapid education in how companies behave when it matters most. Ethical radars have become more finely tuned. Companies that treat their workers and suppliers well should shout about it. They may find they are rewarded. In future, state aid must only go to firms making green commitments The economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus threatens to claim green investment as another casualty. Disruption to the environmental agenda is inevitable; the key question is whether the outbreak will slow the pace of clean energy developers for a few months only, or whether the renewable energy industry – and general progress towards green goals such as the Paris agreement – will be derailed for years. Last year was a record year forBritain’s renewable energy generation in Britain: the UK’s wind turbines, solar panels and bioenergy plants contributed more than a third of the nation’s electricity. But if records are to continue being set in the UK, and across the world, then global leaders will need to make explicitly green policy choices. At the most basic level, the clean energy industry will face the same hurdles as many other sectors in the wake of the pandemic: a reduced workforce; a reliance on vulnerable, concentrated manufacturing hubs; and a greater struggle to access finance. But even as restrictions ease, deeper challenges will remain. The companies that the world relies on to meet our green ambitions will be financially battered by this sudden crash and the collapse of commodity prices. Governments too will be stretched by demands for bailouts to keep economies afloat. The answer must be to incentivise the progress of the clean energy industry by offering government support only to companies which promise to meet green targets. Airlines could commit to emissions reductions, carmakers to accelerating the shift to electric vehicles, and all companies should be sourcing at least some of their electricity from renewable generators. No company should be offered access to taxpayer life-support without proof that they can help find the green shoots in the rubble of the global economy. More US jobs will be lost if employers can’t trust the White House The shocking US unemployment figures reported last week only look like getting worse as March draws to a close. Jobless claims surged to almost 3.3 million in the week ending 21 March. This week, the workers who could not previously contact state agencies to register for unemployment will join those more recently laid off, potentially pushing the increase nearer to 6 million or 7 million. The prospect of several months out of work will leave scars on a country where workers are expected to fund their skills training and education as much as their healthcare and housing. A $2 trillion bailout agreed by Congress that includes $250bn of cash to be paid directly to households is expected to limit the economic impact of Covid-19. It may also restrict the growth in unemployment if companies cut wages in the light of the government handout in order to keep staff on the payroll. What it won’t do is leave workers in a position to simply pick up where they left off whenever the lockdown is lifted. Their employers may no longer exist. Their credit bills might have skyrocketed. That is especially true when businesses are receiving mixed messages from local, state and federal officials. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow says a rebound in the US economy in the second half of the year is possible, once counties with only a few virus victims end their lockdowns. This analysis defies what we know about the virus and how it works. Kudlow seems to believe the virus stops being transmitted when people cross county lines. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, grappling with a major outbreak of Covid-19, would beg to differ. It is a message that must change before too many business owners, increasingly sceptical of the advice from federal government, lay off staff at an even faster rate. If the US fails to stage a solid recovery, the rest of the world will struggle to mend itself.",Retail industry; Coronavirus; US unemployment and employment data; JD Wetherspoon; Food & drink industry; Environment; Mike Ashley; UK news; Frasers Group; Business; World news,Business
2020-02-07T12:19:00Z,The EU’s green deal is a colossal exercise in greenwashing | Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/eu-green-deal-greenwash-ursula-von-der-leyen-climate,"Emergencies tend to reveal our true priorities. When our house is burning down or the storm waters are flooding in, we hold on to what we value most, and leave the rest behind. A decade ago, the leaders of the European Union found themselves facing such a moment. With the French and German banks falling into a black hole, they did whatever it took to save them. Between 2009 and 2013, European governments channelled €1.6tn (£1.36tn) to Europe’s bankers, while imposing stringent austerity upon the European citizens they pledged to serve. When in 2015 they realised that more support was necessary, the European Central Bank printed €2.6tn over just four years. Now, Europe confronts a crisis of far greater severity: a climate emergency. And so, last month, EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen unveiled the European green deal, a €1tn, 10-year plan to reduce the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared with 1990. “This is Europe’s man on the moon moment,” said Von der Leyen. At first, one cannot resist comparing the two sums and the priorities they reveal: more than €4.2tn to save Europe’s financial sector; €1tn to save our world. But things are far worse than that. Whereas the €4.2tn for the financiers was new, actual funding, the €1tn that Von der Leyen has promised across 10 years in her green deal – €100bn annually – is mostly smoke and mirrors. Contrary to Von der Leyen’s pledge to deliver a “green investment wave”, the green deal is largely composed of reshuffled money from existing EU funds and reheated promises to mobilise private-sector capital down the road. In total, the green deal will generate just €7.5bn in new budget commitments, stretched over seven years. By way of comparison, the commission is set to spend €29bn – almost four times more – on “unnecessary” and environmentally destructive gas projects, according to a recent study. So much for a lunar landing. Looking at it dispassionately, Europe’s green deal fails to inspire on all three important criteria: size, composition and scope. Setting aside the fact that the €100bn per annum is so far fictitious, it does not come close to the funding needed to deliver the targets. Don’t take our word for it. The commission itself estimates that Europe needs €260bn annually to achieve its 2030 climate and energy targets – more than double the amount on offer. And that was before the commission upgraded those targets last year. The composition of the green deal is another cause for despair. The so-called sustainable Europe investment plan waxes lyrical in the language of “mobilisation”, pledging to unlock billions of privately held euros in the interests of sustainable investment. Much like the Juncker plan before it, the green deal proposes to encourage private investment by shifting risk from privateers to the EU budget. But this does not reduce risk – it simply shifts it on to the shoulders of the European public, while ensuring that private investors enjoy all of the gains. Without a plan to coordinate energy production and distribution within a proper energy union, the commission’s commitment to private capital promises only to intensify inequalities within and between member states. This brings us to the green deal’s scope. On paper, the plan looks impressively holistic, from a “farm to fork” sustainable food strategy to a “new circular economy action plan”. However, its capacity to transform Europeans’ lives is circumscribed by the commission’s commitment to the austerian straitjacket of the “stability and growth pact”, which has condemned Europe to chronic stagnation. Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner at the helm of the green deal’s investment plan, has said that he is keen to avoid the “divisive debate” of loosening fiscal rules. In short, the Green Deal is a plan for preservation, not transformation. The so-called “just transition mechanism” – the commission’s plan to support communities negatively affected by the shift away from fossil fuels – illustrates this logic of preservation. Von der Leyen has pitched the just transition mechanism as a “pledge of solidarity and fairness”. But to whom? Will there be “justice” for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no. The just transition mechanism will “mobilise” a total of €100bn over 10 years towards coal-producing countries such as Hungary and Poland, which expect to see a “very significant part” of the funding. Support for coal-dependent regions is an essential dimension of the just transition. But it does not take a cynic to see that the deployment of just transition funding in the green deal is a pork-barrel payoff to rightwing governments that supported Von der Leyen’s election and who she fears might throw a spanner into her signature proposal. Entrusting these governments to deliver the just transition – given their extensive track record of corruption and abuse of EU funds – seems unwise. Von der Leyen is fond of speaking about the green deal as a big structural change. “Our goal is to reconcile the economy with our planet,” she has said. But at the same time, the EU has approved and supported the construction of a multibillion-euro pipeline to transport gas between Israel and the EU, passing through the debtor’s prison in which the Greek people continue to languish. Thankfully, hope is alive here in Europe. Together with our organisation, the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, a coalition of European scientists, activists and trade unions has developed the Blueprint for Europe’s Just Transition, a plan to invest 5% of the EU’s GDP in carbon-neutral, just and shared prosperity. Climate activists will not be placated. In Brussels and around the world, the calls for a genuine green new deal continue to grow louder. They will not allow the EU green deal to co-opt their slogans while excluding their substance. Because this is an emergency, and a “greenwashed” status quo is simply not enough. • Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder, and David Adler is the policy coordinator, of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement 2025)",Green deal and energy companies obligation (ECO); European Union; Europe; Ursula von der Leyen; Energy; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; World news,Opinion
2019-09-25T17:00:36Z,"Global recession a serious danger in 2020, UN warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/25/global-recession-a-serious-danger-in-2020-says-un,"Weaker growth in both advanced and developing countries means the possibility of a global recession in 2020 is a clear and present danger, the UN has warned. In a flagship report, the UN’s trade and development body, Unctad, said 2019 will endure the weakest expansion in a decade and there was a risk of the slowdown turning into outright contraction next year. The UN said warning lights were flashing around trade wars, currency gyrations, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and movements in long-term interest rates but there was little sign that policymakers were prepared for the coming storm. The annual trade and development report said finance ministries and central banks should end their “obsession with stock prices, quarterly earnings and investor confidence” and instead focus on job creation, boosting wages and increasing public investment. The Unctad report said: “A spluttering north, a general slowdown in the south and rising levels of debt everywhere are hanging over the global economy: these combined with increased market volatility, a fractured multilateral system and mounting uncertainty, are framing the immediate policy challenge.” It said the global economy remained fragile even though the financial crisis ended a decade ago, and called for a fundamental rethink of a “business as usual” model that had saddled the developing world with record levels of debt. The report also said: “The macro-economic policy stance adopted to date has been lopsided and insufficiently co-ordinated to give a sustained boost to aggregate demand, with adjustments left to the vagaries of the market through a mixture of cost-cutting and liberalisation measures. Ephemeral growth spurts and financial volatility have been the predictable results.” Global growth will fall from 3% in 2018 to 2.3% this year – its weakest since the 1.7% contraction in 2009, according to the report. Several big emerging countries were already in recession and some advanced economies, including Germany and the UK, were dangerously close to one. Central banks , including the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, have recently announced interest cuts in an attempt to stimulate activity but the UN report was pessimistic about the chances of success. “The slowdown in growth in all the major developed economies, including the US, confirms that relying on easy monetary policy and asset price rises to stimulate demand produces, at best, ephemeral growth, while tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals fail to trigger productive investment.” Unconventional monetary measures – such as negative interest rates and creating money through quantitative easing – remained the go-to policies for addressing weaknesses in the global economy even though they have had a weak record since the financial crisis. Trade growth was expected to slow sharply this year as a result of a slump in global demand and the protectionist measures announced by Donald Trump. The UN stressed the need to look beyond the short-term threat of recession to deeper and long-running threats. “Beyond the immediate risks that could stall the global economy are a series of macrostructural challenges that predate the global financial crisis and have gone largely unattended since then,” the report said. It added that four issues stood out due to their high degree of interdependence: the smaller share of the economy’s proceeds going to labour; the erosion of public spending; the weakening of investment; and the unsustainable increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It continued: “Climate protection requires a massive new wave of investment, reinventing energy and other carbon-emitting sectors. New low-carbon technologies must be created, installed and maintained on a global scale.” The report also highlighted increased green investment, which it said would be a significant source of income and jobs. “Recent discussions call this strategy the Green New Deal, recalling the 1930s New Deal, which tackled unemployment and low wages, the predatory nature of finance, infrastructure gaps and regional inequalities, in the context of recovering from the Great Depression.”",Global economy; Unctad; International trade; Business; Economics; United Nations; World news; US news; UK news,Business
2019-12-12T11:10:03Z,EU leaders meet to try to agree on carbon neutrality by 2050,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/eu-leaders-meet-again-to-try-to-agree-carbon-neutrality-by-2050,"European leaders meeting at a summit in Brussels will make a new attempt to set the European Union on course for carbon neutrality by 2050, in a test of the bloc’s credibility on the climate emergency. Hours before EU leaders were due to arrive on Thursday, Greenpeace activists unfurled a banner on the side of the summit venue warning of the climate emergency. Activists in climbing gear scaled the Europa building and set off distress flares and alarms as the group released a statement accusing leaders of “letting [the world] burn”. Some 28 people climbed the building known as the space egg, according to the group. Associated Press reported that 20 people on the ground were detained. Most EU member states support the plan to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050 but Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are refusing to sign up, raising the prospect of a dramatic setback for Europe’s green credentials in the final days of the UN climate conference in Madrid. Failure to agree the EU-wide target a second time, after a previous attempt in June, would be a blow to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who on Wednesday set out her vision for a green deal that would transform every aspect of economic life. The green deal – a sweeping plan to change food production, industry, transport, buildings and energy use – is based on a target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Von der Leyen wants a €100bn (£84bn) fund of public and private money to help countries abandon fossil fuels, in addition to a plan from the European Investment Bank to incentivise €1tn of green investment between 2021 and 2030. But EU member states are stuck over the sequencing of the 2050 target and money. The three central European countries want generous and precise promises of EU funds before they sign up to the target. France, Germany, the Netherlands and other net payers into the EU budget think the climate pledge comes first, as they do not wish to preempt discussions on the EU’s next seven-year budget, due to be concluded in 2020. Poland, which relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, faces a massive bill to wean itself off fossil fuels. Its government is angling for a slice of the €100bn fund to be earmarked for Polish needs alone – a request deemed unacceptable by other member states. While Hungary does not have the same coal dependency as Poland, it is also taking a maximalist position on EU funds. But the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, is seen by some diplomats as the biggest wild card. Babiš is under pressure at home, after an EU audit leaked earlier this month revealed he was in conflict of interest over EU funds received by his Agrofert conglomerate. The Czech prime minister was one of the strongest voices against the 2050 target in June; the latest negative report from Brussels on his business interests is seen as making him an unpredictable player in the debate. Arriving at the summit, Babiš said reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 would cost his country €30-40bn. “We have also the question, how will we force China and Russia and India to decrease emissions?” He is one of several leaders arguing for nuclear energy to be flagged as part of the EU answer to carbon neutrality – a proposal that has upset anti-nuclear governments in Austria and Luxembourg. Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda, who supports the 2050 target, said it would cost his country two thirds of its GDP until 2050. “Otherwise, it will be very difficult to be competitive [to] spend money on green economy if the third countries don’t do this.” Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped all countries could agree on the target: “It would be a strong signal that Europe is really the continent that is climate-neutral in 2050.” French president Emmanuel Macron also voiced hope other countries would back the target and made the case for a tax on foreign imports not meeting EU environmental standards “to avoid penalising our industries”. The target was also supported by Finland’s leader, attending her first EU summit since being sworn in earlier this week. “The new generation are expecting us to act and we have to fulfil the expectations of the people,” said Sanna Marin, who at 34 is the youngest prime minister in the world. Boris Johnson is not taking part in the summit because of the ongoing election and will be represented by Charles Michel, who is chairing his first EU leaders’ summit since becoming European council president this month. Officials have been wrangling over a summit communique to create what one source called “a smart linguistic solution” to get everyone on board. The latest draft summit conclusions seen by the Guardian call for an “enabling framework” to support “a cost-effective, just, as well as socially balanced and fair transition taking into account different national circumstances”. Climate activists argue that a promise on the 2050 target alone is not enough and want the EU to set a more demanding emissions reduction target for 2030. “The world is on fire and our governments are letting it burn,” said Greenpeace’s EU director, Jorgo Riss, in a statement. “It’s not enough for them to commit to a climate neutral EU in 2050. The presidents and prime ministers in Brussels today will be long gone by then. What counts even more is the urgent action they take now, while they are in power.” He said the European green deal was a “starting block” and called for an end to subsidies for oil and gas companies, a move to 100% renewable energy as fast as possible, measures on sustainable transport and energy savings, as well as action to restore the countryside, forests and oceans.",Climate crisis; Europe; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenpeace; Environment; World news; UK news; Ursula von der Leyen; Belgium; Environmental activism; Protest,Environment
2019-10-23T05:00:39Z,Lib Dems unveil plans for environmental 'duty of care' for UK firms,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/liberal-democrats-jo-swinson-plans-for-environmental-duty-of-care-for-uk-firms,"Businesses would be given a legal “duty of care” on environmental and social issues that could be used to prevent them selling goods from deforested areas and to force companies to investigate their overseas supply chains, under plans set out by the Liberal Democrat party. The requirement would mean even if British businesses were operating in line with the law in other countries, they could be found liable for environmental harm they or their suppliers caused overseas if it violated UK-defined guidelines. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is to make the pledge in a speech in London on Wednesday morning, signalling her intent to make the environment, along with Brexit, a key priority for the party’s pitch to voters in a general election. “The Liberal Democrats want to see businesses take greater responsibility for the impact they have on the environment. That is why we want a general duty of care for the environment, to ensure that companies are avoiding behaviour in their operation and supply chains that is damaging to the environment,” she told the Guardian. “[We] have ambitious plans to tackle the climate emergency so that we can look after the planet we have because there is no planet B.” Under the proposed legislation, companies would be required to exercise due diligence with regard to certain commodities – for instance, products such as palm oil, crops or timber that could come from deforested areas – and to certain behaviours, such as modern slavery or child labour. The list of criteria would be set out separately, and could be expanded over time. These rules would be valid even if the companies were acting according to the law in the country where deforestation was occurring. If deforestation were set out in the secondary legislation as being something on which there was a requirement to report, then companies would have to report on it regardless of the legality in the country they were doing it. The proposed legislation would also encourage companies to exercise due diligence with regard to environmental, social and human rights issues in general and would require them to publish reports on the steps they have taken to exercise that due diligence. Swinson will also attack the government’s record on environmental issues, pointing to a lack of clear policy on how to achieve the net zero target that was enshrined in law under Theresa May, and what she said were failings in climate policy, such as support for fracking and airport expansion, scaling back support for renewables such as solar panels, and the privatisation of the Green Investment Bank. “The Conservatives’ record on the climate crisis is appalling. They have declared an emergency but have done nothing about it. That is like setting off the fire alarm and then standing by as you watch the house burn down,” she said. Other political parties are also considering rules to prevent goods being sold in the UK whose production contributes to deforestation, as environmental and trade issues have taken on greater prominence in the light of Brexit and a potential general election. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed the extent to which products such as soy from deforested areas of the Amazon were found in British supermarkets. Molly Scott Cato, MEP for the Green party, told the Guardian: “Primary forests play a vital role as carbon sinks and in preserving biodiversity, so we need mechanisms in place to ensure firm action can be taken against countries that either encourage deforestation to push exports or fail to make efforts to protect their forests. We must take a lead by adopting legislation on mandatory due diligence, as the EU has done already with conflict minerals.” She gave Brazil as an example of where the principles should be applied, in the case of imports. “It is evident that [President] Bolsonaro has given the green light to land clearance for the production of beef and soy exports and has weakened forest protection. Brazil is therefore undermining its Paris Agreement commitments and firm action should follow. The EU and UK must refuse to sign up to trade deals with Brazil until it ends its ecological vandalism and work to regulate specific global supply chains based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement and the [UN’s] sustainable development goals.” Barry Gardiner MP, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for international trade and shadow minister for international climate change, told the Guardian his party would also move to tackle the problem. “We need a global consensus on measures to deal with trade arising from deforested areas.” he said. Gardiner added: “It is outrageous that the government is cosying up to Brazil’s rightwing government, which is actively supporting the widespread destruction of the Amazon through deliberate forest fires. Labour’s trade policy will be used to elevate environmental protections rather than opening up opportunities for big business to profit from significant environmental damage. the next Labour government will pursue trade agreements that meet our global climate obligations.” The government said it was “committed to working with our world-leading businesses to reduce the UK’s impact on deforestation overseas.”",Liberal Democrats; Politics; Environment; Deforestation; UK news; Trees and forests,Politics
2019-12-13T07:51:27Z,"Devoid of agility, charisma and credibility, Corbyn has led Labour into the abyss | Polly Toynbee",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/jeremy-corbyn-labour-manifesto-antisemitism-brexit,"The nightmare has happened. The worst of men is elected prime minister. The hardest of times lie ahead. Unfit in every way for any kind of office, Boris Johnson takes up the reins of absolute power bestowed on any leader with such a majority. This blow has fallen on a country ravaged by a decade of decay in the public realm and a stagnant economy. We have become an embarrassment abroad. Brexit was the wicked weapon Johnson used to dethrone his last two leaders in order to lever himself into their place. Reckless in everything but personal ambition, he has trapped us into the worst Brexit imaginable, withdrawn from the EU next month and out with a disaster of a “deal” next year. Five crucial years will be lost in the fight against the climate crisis. In search of deals, he will bend to every interest, every lobby, every fossil fuel and fracking pusher, hiding behind his empty 2050 zero emissions pledge. The shriveling of every service is cemented into his budget plans: enough to stop outright NHS collapse, not enough to get schools or police back to 2010 levels, and everything else destined for never-ending decline. Expect no sudden change of heartlessness. We Cassandras have wrung our hands and howled out loud warning of rising poverty, homelessness, collapsing legal and social care systems, living standards in reverse. Yet people voted for all this woe. Who is to blame? There are the lies of the extreme Tory press, echoing around all media – but Labour always faces that injustice. It is the rough sea that any leader must try to navigate. Unabashed by the valiant Full Fact and other fact-checking organisations, Johnson found he can repeat a lie a thousand times with utter impunity, no one to stop him except the people – and they have preferred the lie. They are not deceived: they call him untrustworthy. Anyone listening hears his plans for revenge on all who thwarted him: he will dilute the powers of the supreme court for defying him. He threatens Channel 4 and the BBC with malevolent “reviews”. Beware any civil servant or regulator who gets in his way, as he curtails the right to judicial review and threatens to “update” the Human Rights Act. The pound surges as City folk fear paying higher tax more than they fear a bad Brexit crippling the entire economy. Given the worst choice in history, the public preferred him to his opponent. How bad did Labour have to be to let this sociopathic, narcissistic, glutton for power beat them? That’s the soul-searching question every Labour member, office-holder and MP has to ask. Labour was disastrously, catastrophically bad, an agony to behold. A coterie of Corbynites cared more about gripping power within the party than saving the country by winning the election. The national executive committee, a slate of nodding Corbynite place-persons, disgraced the party with its sectarian decisions. Once it was plain in every poll and focus group that Corbynism was electoral arsenic, they should have propelled him out, but electoral victory was secondary. Should we laugh or cry at Corbyn’s announcement that he wouldn’t stand for another election? He should have gone before dawn. Any possible or impossible successor will clear out that Len McCluskey clique – Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Andrew Murray and others who propped up the old fellow to secure their own power base – with results worse than Michael Foot. Watch them try to divert blame onto “Corbyn-disloyalists”, remainers and ”Blairites”. Corbyn is not an amoral man. He can never tell a lie: pretending to watch the Queen’s Christmas message in the morning showed he’s not used to fibbing. He is a man without any qualities required of a leader, mental agility, articulacy, strategy, good humour or charisma. Yet his legacy is of historic importance: he did this country profound, nation-splitting, irreparable harm. Had he led his party and the unions full tilt against Brexit, the narrowly lost referendum could have been won. But he and his cabal refused outright: when beseeched, they said they were too busy with May’s local elections. He wouldn’t share any remain platform. Festering Bennite 1970s ideologies blinded his sect from seeing Brexit was the far right’s weapon of buccaneering destruction. He could have saved us – but he obfuscated. Corbyn came weighted with baggage too heavy for a Hercules to shift: the IRA, the Hamas friends, Venezuela. But antisemitism was accusation he could not shift. I am certain he sees no stain of it in himself, refusing to comprehend it, and so could not apologise. Failure to purge every case left candidates on the doorstep dumbstruck when anyone said “I can’t vote for an antisemite”. And remember that early refusal to sing the national anthem? Voters’ first impression was his deep-seated aversion to expressing patriotism. The campaign was chaotic, all front-bench talent banished for fear of outshining the leader. Toe-curlingly bad performers and insignificants were punted up as loyalists, while serious heavyweights Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry might as well have been shut in Johnson’s freezer. Even John McDonnell, better by far than Corbyn, was largely kept from the cameras. Corbyn’s sectarian grudges prevented any effort to heal the party’s rift, leaving immense talent wasted on the back benches. Here’s the real tragedy. The manifesto was essentially magnificent. The vision was of a country freed from years of darkness with green investment, growth in places that most need it, salving the many wounds of marrow-deep cuts, restoring pride in the public sphere and hope in a future that was absolutely affordable. Why should we not tax and spend the same as similar north European countries? But if socialism is the language of priorities, these were lost in a profusion of never-ending promises too easily mocked. The political landscape was never prepared, soil untilled, last-minute policies falling on stony ground. Where was the simple five-point pledge card? Credibility is everything and Corbyn lacked it like no other. Without credibility all was lost. Think on it, every Labour member. It will be a long, long road up from such a fall. There will be days to consider hope: today is for confronting reality. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Jeremy Corbyn; General election 2019; Politics; Labour; Brexit; UK news; Foreign policy,Opinion
2019-11-28T21:49:40Z,Tories left on ice in TV debate as leaders vie for climate credentials,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/tories-left-on-ice-in-tv-debate-as-leaders-vie-for-climate-credentials,"Opposition leaders attempted to outbid each other on Thursday night with their climate credentials in the first ever election debate focusing on the environmental emergency, in which the absent Boris Johnson was replaced by a melting ice sculpture. In place of the prime minister, Channel 4 placed an ice sculpture, representing, they said, the emergency on planet Earth. A second ice sculpture took the place of Brexit party leader Nigel Farage, who also refused to take part. The Conservatives accused the broadcaster of bias for not allowing Michael Gove to take Johnson’s place, accusing them of “conspiring” with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to block the party from making their case. Gove had turned up to the studios but was turned away by Channel 4 who said the debate was for party leaders only. In a response designed to overshadow the programme, the Conservatives immediately complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom and threatened to review its broadcasting licence. The opposition leaders met as the EU declared a global climate and environmental emergency and urged all EU countries to commit to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Siân Berry from the Green party, Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price participated in the televised debate. Johnson’s officials had told the campaigners behind the debate, We are Possible, when he was first invited that he would not take part because he did not want climate change to be “siloed”. The leaders were challenged on what they would to do reduce carbon emissions from food, transport, domestic heating and the biodiversity crisis. All pushed manifesto commitments to cut carbon emissions to zero by dates from 2030 to 2045, a few years before the Conservatives’ pledge for net zero by 2050. The expansion of Heathrow airport – passed by MPs last year – and the HS2 rail link were all discussed. Siân Berry, the Green party leader said they were the only party who wanted to cancel HS2. She said more than half of Labour MPs voted for Heathrow Expansion while the SNP abstained. She said a minority of people took most flights and should be targeted. “The question now is how we share out the flights that we can take more fairly. It means targeting those 15% of people who took 70% of the flights,” said Berry. Challenged on whether people should stop flying, Sturgeon said: “Do people have to fly less? Yes where we can, half of fall international flights are taken by 10% of population.” “Where flights are necessary we have set a target to decarbonise all flights within Scotland by 2040,” said Sturgeon. The Labour leader said he voted against Heathrow expansion. Rather than stopping people from flying, he said there had to be investment in rail services to reduce number of short-haul flights to Europe and the expansion of railways all over the country, and train travel had to become cheaper. “I think we do it better by offering a sensible alternative which is also about improving bus and rail services all over the country,” he said. More than half of UK emissions are from buildings and domestic homes, reducing this is one of the biggest challenges to meeting any net-zero targets. Corbyn said tackling emissions from domestic heating could be done: “We can and do retrofit homes, we can generate electricity from solar energy and wind, but it does require a determination which is why our manifesto sets out a very large green investment fund.” Hundreds of thousands of people, including Johnson’s father Stanley Johnson and climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern, had signed a petition urging the prime minister to take part. But on Thursday night, Stanley Johnson – who was present at the studio – said Channel 4 should have let Gove debate, saying he “would have made a big, big contribution”. He insisted that Gove’s appearance at the studios had not been a stunt, saying that the Conservatives had been given the impression that he could appear. Johnson showed journalists a text message from the prime minister saying: “Gove on!” On leaving, Gove was confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist, Izzy Warren, about Johnson’s failure to attend and the Tories’ green policies. Speaking to the Guardian, Izzy said: “I asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn’t here today.” He told her that it shouldn’t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. “This is a party that has been in power for 10 years and we haven’t seen climate action,” she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: “I think older men, quite frankly, aren’t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.” The scale of the task facing any new government was made clear this week when scientists warned that the world may have already crossed a series of climate tipping points, resulting in “a state of planetary emergency”. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, analysts say, would need as much as £20bn a year in investment to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Sturgeon was challenged on her failure to support the Green party call for the decommissioning of oil rigs in fossil fuel rich Scotland. “If we were to stop tomorrow in terms of oil production, we would make ourselves more reliant on imports so that transition has got to be done in a way which decreases our emissions,” Sturgeon said. Swinson, who is promising an emergency 10-year programme to reduce energy consumption from all buildings, linked the fight to tackle climate change to Brexit. “Brexit is a climate crime, it is morally wrong to leave our seat at the table and give away our influence to create change,” she said. Price said there was no choice but to cut to net zero by 2030: “We have the technology now to reach carbon neutrality by 2030 what is lacking is the political will.”",General election 2019; Leaders' debates; Channel 4; Labour; Green party; UK news; Politics; Liberal Democrats; Conservatives; Reform UK; Plaid Cymru; Boris Johnson; Jeremy Corbyn; Scottish National party (SNP); Nicola Sturgeon; Jo Swinson,Politics
2019-09-17T13:47:00Z,Jo Swinson urges Lib Dems to fight populists 'for heart and soul of Britain',https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/jo-swinson-urges-lib-dems-to-fight-populists-for-heart-and-soul-of-britain-brexit,"Jo Swinson has closed the Liberal Democrat conference with a message that the next election would be a fight for the “heart and soul of Britain” as she pledged to stop Brexit and counter the rising tide of populism and nationalism. Announcing to rapturous applause that she was appearing before delegates “as your candidate for prime minister” Swinson used her first conference speech as leader to renew attacks on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. She said the country now needed the Lib Dems to give voters a better choice. Her address contained no new policy announcements but instead reiterated pledges made on previous days, notably that a Lib Dem majority government would stop the Brexit process without resorting to a second referendum. Her speech was also noticeably devoid of onerous references to the party’s backing for a second referendum. Instead she focused on the Lib Dems’ plan for a snap election – where in the case of a majority result, they would revoke article 50 – which has been divisive among some members. She also pledged to base future budgets not just on GDP figures but on factors of national wellbeing, inspired by a model used by the the prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. Policies would be developed by gauging their long-term impact on life satisfaction, happiness, anxiety and the feeling of whether something had been worthwhile. A similar proposal was made by Labour in June. There were promises to a set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2045, create a new Green Investment Bank and tackle youth crime with a public health-based approach. Swinson’s supporters said it was a speech intended to give members a broad brush idea of her vision for Britain, the EU and the party, and was not intended to be policy-heavy. At the next general election she said the country deserved “a better choice than an entitled Etonian or a 1970s socialist”, referring to the Conservative and Labour leaders respectively. “Ahead of us we have the fight of our lives for the heart and soul of Britain. The next few weeks are about deciding what kind of country we are, and who we want to be. Whether we tackle our biggest challenges with our closest allies, or on our own; whether we welcome those who want to build a better life in our country, or shut the door on them; whether we ensure every single child can go on and fulfil their dreams.” On Brexit, Swinson pledged to revoke article 50 and thus stop Brexit “on day one” as prime minister, “because there is no Brexit that will be good for our country”. Another standing ovation was received at the finale of the speech when she said: “We can change our politics, stop Brexit and win a brighter future.” She condemned Johnson’s push towards a no-deal departure, saying it would devastate the economy. “This Brexiteer government wants to pay for their ideology with other people’s jobs. The truth is, they won’t be affected, and they won’t be there to help when the redundancy notices are handed out. “They won’t be there when the homes are repossessed or when the marriages break down under the financial stress. Which makes what Boris Johnson is doing quite so sickening – he knows all of this.” She criticised Corbyn, saying: “Nigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature.” “If he had campaigned to remain in 2016 with half of the energy he had put into the 2017 election, we may have seen a different result.” As the first woman to lead the Lib Dems, she received one of the warmest rounds of applause and cheers from members when she lambasted the prime minister’s language. “Boris Johnson’s insults of choice are rather revealing. Big girl’s blouse, girly swot. If he thinks being a woman is somehow a weakness, he’s about to find out: it is not,” she said. She ended her speech with: “At the next general election, voters will choose the kind of country we want to be: insular, closed and selfish; or collaborative, open and generous. “We can defeat nationalism and populism. We can change our politics, stop Brexit and win a brighter future.” She spoke with ease for her debut conference speech, appearing to have memorised most of her 45-minute address and eschewing the traditional lectern. The 1997 Spice Girls track Spice Up Your Life was chosen as the backing track for her walk offstage to meet her husband Duncan Hames – a former Lib Dem MP – and her mother, Annette.",Liberal Democrat conference 2019; Liberal Democrats; Jo Swinson; UK news; Politics; Brexit; Article 50; Boris Johnson; Jeremy Corbyn; European Union,Politics
2019-07-02T05:00:21Z,"Firms must document climate impact on profits, Treasury says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/firms-climate-impact-on-profits-treasury,"Britain’s leading companies, investment funds and pension schemes must show by 2022 how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances, under government plans to boost the UK’s green credentials. Firms must document within the two-and-a-half-year deadline how extreme weather and changes to climate rules, such as a ban on plastic packaging, could hit their profits. The Treasury is also urging City banks to play a bigger role in supporting the UK meeting its legal target to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Under a new government strategy, banks will be pushed to invest in sustainability and come clean about their own exposure to the climate crisis. The Treasury said its green finance strategy would help the City emerge as a green finance capital by funding green investment, an education charter, a green home finance fund and by establishing a new green finance institute. The institute succeeds the green finance taskforce that was launched in 2017 and will encourage investment in sustainable businesses such as renewable energy firms. Financial services firms will also be expected to disclose how climate emergency risk impacts their activities by 2022. John Glen, the City minister, said the green finance strategy would help establish London as “a pre-eminent international centre for green finance”. He said: “The UK has a long history of leading the way in tackling climate change, but we need to do more to protect our planet for future generations.” The Treasury’s flurry of green finance initiatives has emerged as it prepares to face questions from a committee of MPs over its role in supporting the government’s climate targets. The Treasury select committee launched an inquiry last month to scrutinise the role played by Treasury officials, regulators and financial services firms after Theresa May’s announcement that a net-zero carbon emissions target would be enshrined in law. Philip Hammond responded to the policy by saying a net-zero carbon economy would cost £1tn to create. The claim was quickly rebuffed by No 10 in a rare rebuke to the chancellor. John McDonnell recently outlined plans to give the Bank of England powers to help scrutinise the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. The shadow chancellor has promoted the idea of a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a key member. The new body would be supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. McDonnell said: “From the government, this is too little and too late. It’s also totally ineffectual and toothless. “While it’s true that the finance sector will need to play a huge role in securing a sustainable economy for the future, it seems like the government is still stuck in the mindset of fiddling around the edges and hoping the free market will solve the climate emergency.” Climate emergency campaigners have supported the concept of a Green New Deal that mostly involves state support for a switch to low-carbon energy use and greener infrastructure. Hammond said he preferred to encourage the private sector to back green companies through a green finance institute, headed by former Barclays executive Rhian-Mari Thomas. He pointed to the already burgeoning market for green bonds, which act like mortgages for businesses that want to pursue environmentally friendly projects. All the main city regulators said they backed the chancellor’s move, saying a new stewardship code that required investors to check the “environmental, social and governance issues, including climate change” of UK businesses would make them more sustainable.",Business; Climate crisis; Investment funds; Pensions industry; Philip Hammond; Politics; UK news; Extreme weather; Environment; World news,Business
2019-04-26T18:36:42Z,IMF chief urges China to focus on 'belt and road' sustainability,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/belt-and-road-forum-xi-jinping-promises-transparency-to-ease-concerns,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned China against damaging the environment through unsustainable overseas investments as part of its “belt and road” infrastructure initiative. Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, used a speech in Beijing on Friday to urge the Chinese government to focus the initiative, which involves spending billions on overseas infrastructure projects to connect China with the world, on sustainable development. Lagarde also said investment should not build up vast levels of debt that could prove problematic in future. “I have said before that, to be fully successful, the belt and road should only go where it is needed. I would add today that it should only go where it is sustainable, in all aspects,” she said. She was speaking at a gathering of world leaders in the Chinese capital to pitch for investment via the belt androad project. Philip Hammond, the British chancellor, was at the event to promote Britain, although it came during a diplomatic row over UK contracts for the Chinese telecoms company Huawei amid national security concerns. China had said on Thursday it would take greater account of environmental issues in its investment decisions. Global concern is rising over the impact of climate change, illustrated by the Extinction Rebellion protests in Britain and school strikes across Europe sparked by the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Lagarde said: “The launch of the green investment principle at this conference is a further important step forward for the belt and road initiative – and a step forward for green, low-carbon and climate-resilient investment. “Debt sustainability and green sustainability will strengthen belt and road sustainability.” Xi Jinping, China’s president, sought to allay concerns over the initiative, which aims to expand Chinese influence around the world but has generated concerns over its sustainability. Developing countries, where much of the spending has been directed, have broadly welcomed the initiative to expand trade between Asia, Africa and Europe by building roads, ports and other facilities and infrastructure. However, there are fears some countries could fall into debt traps because of the high costs of the projects. China’s debt levels have also surged in recent years, prompting fears over its financial stability. There are also concerns about corruption, and the environmental impact of projects which link China to natural resource-rich economies. Xi said: “Everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption.” Western countries, led by the US under Donald Trump in particular, worry Beijing is trying to build a network that could threaten their traditional economic dominance. Xi is trying to reboot the initiative after the number of new projects fell last year. China had increased the scrutiny of its state-owned banks involved in funding the plans, amid fears over rising debts and after some target countries complained the projects would not do enough for their economies and gave too much power to Beijing. Malaysia and Thailand are among countries that have cancelled or scaled back projects, while Ethiopia has renegotiated its debt repayments. Xi said China was applying debt sustainability criteria recommended by the IMF.",Belt and road initiative; China; Xi Jinping; Asia Pacific; World news; Christine Lagarde; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Business,World news
2019-06-20T10:00:08Z,Oregon's Republican senators flee capitol to delay vote on emissions reduction plan,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/20/oregon-cap-and-trade-carbon-emissions,"Oregon is poised to become the second US state after California to impose a cap and trade program aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions. But ahead of a vote on the legislation Thursday, all 11 Republican state senators fled the capitol in a bid to delay the process. Several claimed to have left the state, beyond the reach of state troopers dispatched by the governor in order to get the legislative session back on track. Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr wrote in a statement that the walk-out was “exactly how we should be doing our job”. In a speech on the Senate floor, a visibly frustrated Senate president Peter Courtney begged his colleagues to return. “This is the saddest day of my legislative life,” he said. If passed into law, the clean energy jobs bill would place a cap on emissions from power, transportation and other industries in the state, and establish a system to auction and trade them. The program would begin in 2021, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 1990 carbon levels by 2035, and 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. Not unlike the principles of the Green New Deal, Oregon’s “cap and invest” program would earmark funds generated by the program for clean energy, climate-related upgrades to infrastructure in order to better retrofit the state for increasing extreme weather events and green jobs training. Supporters say Oregon’s program would be the most progressive of its kind in the country, as funds would be guaranteed for low-income people and communities of color, Native tribes and places hit “first and worst” by the impacts of climate change. “We’ve been fighting like crazy to make sure this is the strongest and most equitable environmental bill,” said Brad Reed of the environmental advocacy coalition Renew Oregon. “The provisions in the bill for equity are some of the strongest in the country.” “Oregon can be the log that breaks the jam nationally” on progressive carbon emissions regulation and green investment, said Governor Kate Brown in a statement. Redirecting the cost of climate change California in 2013 became the first US state to establish its cap and trade program. The biggest share of those revenues so far has gone to high speed rail construction. Oregon’s carbon market would join California’s in the Western Climate Initiative, which also includes Quebec – carbon credits could be auctioned across borders. Carbon pricing essentially redirects the costs of climate change back to industry, by putting a price on carbon emissions and placing climate costs on company balance sheets. The logic behind creating a carbon market assumes that if it costs companies to pollute, companies will not pollute as much. A cap and trade policy is one approach to the scheme, as opposed to creating an actual tax on emissions by the ton. The Union of Concerned Scientists says robust carbon pricing schemes are an integral economic policy tool in reducing emissions in order “to limit some of the worst impacts of climate change”. While cap and trade schemes enjoy broad and in many cases passionate support among Democrats, carbon pricing has critics on the left and the right. Oregon Republicans claim the program is still essentially a tax, and thus would need to pass by a three-fifths majority in both the state house and senate, according to law. Some environmental activists say carbon pricing isn’t just an inadequate tool for addressing climate change, but a potentially destructive one. Cap and trade critics argue a market-based strategy to influence corporate behavior shirks regulatory responsibility and disproportionately impacts low-income communities, by creating pollution hot spots exacerbated by companies buying the right to emit, raising fuel prices that poor rural drivers will struggle to pay. “It’s our position that cap and trade systems don’t work and that they actually harm frontline communities,” said Shawn Fleek of Opal Environmental Justice Oregon. “We’re really witnessing a stark divide in the environmental and environmental justice communities with this process.” If the bill is passed, the entire west coast could soon be capping and trading carbon emissions together. While three attempts at implementing carbon pricing in Washington state have so far failed since 2016, legislators introduced another bill this March to implement a cap and trade program in that state. That bill is currently in committee. • This article was amended on 21 June 2019 to correct the number of Republican senators who fled the building.

2019-05-22T12:00:48Z,Yanis Varoufakis: Green New Deal can unite Europe's progressives,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/22/yanis-varoufakis-green-new-deal-can-unite-europes-progressives,"A radical Green New Deal has the potential to unite progressives across Europe in the same way as nationalist and rightwing movements are mobilising around immigration and xenophobia, according to the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Varoufakis, a co-founder of the Democracy in Europe Movement (DiEM25), which is standing candidates in Germany and Greece in Thursday’s European elections, told the Guardian a radical green agenda could act as the “glue and cement” for an alliance of leftists, greens and liberals. “I think this a very optimistic moment,” said Varoufakis, who is standing for DiEM25 in Germany. “The ultra right, the xenophobic right have a rallying call, they have glue and cement holding them together and that is racism, xenophobia, migration and narratives of gloom about Islamists coming to Europe and taking over.” Progressives, however, have lacked a similar “rallying cry”, according to Varoufakis, who has become one of the leading figures on the European left in the last decade. He argued that a Green New Deal, financed by green investment bonds issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB), could transform the economy, creating sustainable, secure jobs, and help tackle the unfolding environmental crisis while uniting young and old, socialists, Greens and liberals across the continent. “This is a great opportunity for progressives across Europe to unite around a doable, radical but at the same time moderate agenda,” he said. “It can be for progressives what immigration and racism is to the rightists.” The idea of a Green New Deal has gained traction in both the US and Europe in recent months. The European Greens have endorsed a version of it, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, recently set out his vision for a similar programme. DiEM25 said that since the launch of its campaign for a Green New Deal for Europe this month, hundreds of politicians, MEP candidates and civil society leaders – including leading figures in the Labour and Green parties in the UK – had pledged their support. Varoufakis said he had been working closely with the UK Labour party, which has already committed to implementing a transformative “green industrial revolution”. The Labour grassroots groups Momentum and Labour for a Green New Deal are pushing the party to go further and commit to a comprehensive plan for the UK hit zero emissions by 2030 and create hundreds of thousands of well-paid, secure jobs. The growing awareness of a climate crisis is reflected in a surge of support for the Greens across Europe, who are on course for their strongest showing to date in the European elections and could find themselves kingmakers in a newly fragmented EU parliament. Varoufakis said he had been working on his plans since 2003, and the challenge now was to implement a coordinated, pan-European proposal that could be scaled up. “A Green New Deal for Europe will slingshot us out of this morass of under-investment, unemployment, and climate destruction and toward a future of sustainable, shared prosperity,” he said. DiEM25 is urging people across the continent to vote for MEPs who are committed to a radical Green New Deal – especially in light of the threat posed by the resurgent populist right to action on the environment. Under the DiEM25 proposals, 5% of Europe’s GDP would be invested in a green transition, financed via bonds issued by the EIB. Varoufakis said there was currently around €3tn “sloshing around” in the financial sector – held in bank accounts, being used by companies to buy back their own shares and in the insurance and derivatives sectors. He said the plan, which has already won the support of some bureaucrats, could be implemented “tomorrow without changing any of the existing European treaties”. “Think of the GND as a sponge that can soak up the excess liquidity in the financial sector that is currently doing a lot of damage,” he said. The momentum behind a Green New Deal follows protests by Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes movement, which have helped to push the climate crisis higher up the political agenda. Varoufakis said the protests were inspirational and he called on politicians and voters to take their cue from the younger generation. “This election is not a beauty contest. The future of Europe and the future of humanity rest on its outcome,” he said. “We stand with the climate strikers, because when the adults in the room fail to respond to the greatest threat that our species has ever faced, it is time for us to follow the children who have the courage to show the way.”",Yanis Varoufakis; European elections; European parliamentary elections 2019; Green politics; Climate crisis; Greece; European Union; World news,World news
2019-04-28T23:01:37Z,"Brexit will slow UK economy for rest of 2019, forecaster warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/29/brexit-will-slow-uk-economy-for-rest-of-2019-forecaster-warns,"The slow-burn impact of Brexit on the British economy will be a drag on growth for the rest of 2019, blocking the Bank of England from raising interest rates, a leading economics forecaster has warned. Ahead of the first major policy decision from Threadneedle Street since Theresa May agreed to delay Brexit until the end of October, the EY Item Club said uncertainty over the country’s future would cut the UK’s growth rate. The delay to resolving Britain’s position in the EU is widely expected to stop the Bank from raising interest rates on Thursday, when it publishes the decision of its monetary policy committee (MPC) and releases its quarterly inflation report. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, will also deliver the MPC’s latest verdict on the strength of the UK economy – his first update since the government officially kickstarted the hunt for his successor last week. Despite a robust start to the year, the EY Item Club, the only forecasting group to use the Treasury’s model of the economy, said GDP growth had been artificially high due to an unprecedented upswing in stockpiling by firms bracing for a disruptive no-deal Brexit. The forecasting group downgraded its growth projections for the UK to 1.3% for 2019 and 1.5% for 2020, warning the stronger than anticipated performance at the start of 2019 was likely a “false dawn” for Britain. The economy grew by 1.4% in 2018. Companies could choose to run down their stockpiles of raw materials, components and finished goods as the cliff-edge risks over no-deal Brexit dissipate, meaning economic growth could be weaker in future. Howard Archer, the EY Item Club’s chief economic adviser, said: “Delays to Brexit, a difficult domestic economic and political backdrop and slower global economic activity have resulted in a weaker outlook for UK GDP growth this year.” The report said the Bank would probably leave interest rates at 0.75% – where the base rate has been set since August last year – throughout 2019. However, it added that a 25 basis point hike over the summer to 1% could not be ruled out, if the economy continued to show resilience and the labour market strengthened further. Economic growth in Britain remained subdued but more robust than expected as the initial Brexit deadline of 29 March loomed, despite a slowdown in the wider global economy, including in the eurozone and China. GDP grew by 0.2% in February from a month earlier, confounding City economists’ expectations for zero growth. The Bank has forecast growth of about 0.2% in the first quarter. Economists believe Threadneedle Street could, however, upgrade its forecasts in the quarterly inflation report on Thursday. Consumer spending has been unexpectedly strong, while employment is still at the highest levels on record. Inflation has held steady below the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, reducing the impetus to raise interest rates. Wage growth has risen to the strongest levels in more than a decade, while a rising oil price on international markets could prompt inflation to rise. However, fears over the impact of Brexit are likely to continue to weigh on the economy, economists said, which will block the Bank from raising rates. The inflation report also presents Carney with his first major public event since he warned climate change posed an existential threat to the financial system, using an article in the Guardian to call on central banks around the world to tackle the issue. The campaign groups Positive Money and Fossil Free London plan to stage protests outside the Bank on Thursday to demand it takes bolder action. They intend to use banners calling on Carney to “put your money where your mouth is” and to “unleash green investment now”. Despite broadly welcoming Carney’s intervention, campaigners have argued the Bank could take bolder steps, including forcing the mandatory disclosure of carbon-related assets, rather than asking banks to consider doing so. Threadneedle Street could also compel banks to set aside more money to protect from losses on carbon assets, or encourage them to lend to green projects by reducing the amount of money they are required to set aside.",Economic growth (GDP); Brexit; Economics; Interest rates; Bank of England; Mark Carney; Economic policy; Business; UK news,Business
2019-07-07T12:58:12Z,To ensure a green future the UK cannot rely on free markets alone | Richard Partington,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/07/to-ensure-a-green-future-the-uk-needs-to-ditch-free-market-economics,"With just 11 years left to prevent irreversible damage caused by the climate emergency, there are still options to wean the world’s economy off its reliance on fossil fuels. However, anything less than putting Britain on a war footing will not be enough. The government response so far has been timid. Theresa May introduced a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050, but there are reasons why the Conservatives haven’t gone further: her party is hard-wired to fail. Clinging to a belief in the power of free markets, it neglects the fact that to decarbonise the economy greater investment from the state is required. Free-market advocates detest big government. But faced with the scale of the challenge, only government has the weapons powerful enough to tackle the crisis. So far May and her allies have been held back by their unswerving belief in the market economy and the mobilisation of private capital. Political will can be transformative. The government’s independent committee on climate change has a target for spending of 1-2% of GDP by 2050 on greening the UK economy, for both the public and private sector. But faced with the gathering crisis climate activists are starting to push for greater government investment. Doubling the UK’s investment rate – with the bulk coming from the state – in green infrastructure, technologies and industry should create millions of good jobs and build low-carbon wealth. State funding will be required to support people working in industries incompatible with a green future, such as mining, oil and gas, heavy industry and energy-intensive transport. When the state invests, the private sector is encouraged to raise its investment alongside these efforts. Last week, the government launched a half-hearted attempt to encourage more financing of green projects using market-based solutions. It might show that the Tories are moving in the right direction, but their plans came straight from the neoliberal playbook. Ministers announced with aplomb that companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would be forced to disclose their risks from climate change by 2022. If only investors knew the scale of the risks, they would price them accordingly – penalising those with carbon exposure and rewarding those without. It is undoubtedly a positive step. Every little helps. But Tesco shouldn’t need to tell investors it would lose money if the world goes up in smoke. News of melting glaciers, vanishing biodiversity and extreme weather events is telling enough. On the left there is more momentum. John McDonnell has argued for the forcible ejection of companies from the stock exchange that do not have a plan for tackling climate change. Labour would create a sustainable investment board, supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. Climate activists are angling for a mass government mobilisation equivalent to Roosevelt’s New Deal, which lifted America from the morass of the Great Depression. In an attempt to outline a roadmap to a Green New Deal in Britain, the left-leaning thinktank Common Wealth is this week launching a bundle of papers. There will be six policy reports in total over July that will add up to a guide to turbocharging the low-carbon economy, while supporting communities through the transition. Mathew Lawrence, its director, argues that to finance the transition the largest ever peacetime mobilisation of resources will be required. “Tinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency,” he says. Markets on their own cannot drive a society-wide reorganisation of production and consumption at the pace and scale required. “We need a government-led process of economic restructuring,” he said. Among the measures are proposals to retool the financial system. A report will say that the green investment bank – sold off under Tory free-market dogma – should be brought back under state control. The Bank of England could adjust financial stability rules to penalise commercial banks for holding brown assets on their balance sheets, while promoting more green lending. There can be no economic stability in a climate emergency. The foundations of our prosperity came close to tumbling down in the 2008 financial crisis. Brexit threatens our future living standards. But global heating stands to surpass them all. So far the UK is lagging behind. Ministers might talk about a bright new future of electric vehicles, with encouraging news that Jaguar Land Rover plans to build its electric XJ car in Britain. But its target of 2040 for ending petrol and diesel car sales would mean polluting cars still being sold in Britain a full decade after irreversible damage to the planet could be complete. There is evidence that government intervention can work. Despite deriving most of its wealth from fossil fuels, Norway has used spending and tax cuts to drive up the sale of electric vehicles to count for half of all cars sold. And it targets the end of petrol and diesel car sales by 2025. Britain has had some success. The carbon intensity of Britain’s energy production has improved markedly with the rapid increase in wind energy. As coal-burning power stations are phased out, about half of energy production is now from renewables and nuclear. Some Tories are moving in the right direction. Last week, the Conservative Environment Network set out a manifesto that included banning fracking, a sevenfold increase in offshore wind by 2050, an earlier ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans, as well as fertiliser and pesticide taxes. They should be encouraged to go further still. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt broadly welcome the thrust of the debate, but neither leadership contender has endorsed the recommendations. Both have made profligate tax and spending commitments in their campaign, with little reference to the emergency facing the climate. Rather than entering into a bidding war on tax breaks for the rich, the next prime minister should commit more money instead to a real response to the climate crisis.

2018-10-20T11:21:28Z,£7m crowdfunding bid for Orkney tidal energy turbine launches,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/20/7m-crowdfunding-bid-for-orkney-tidal-energy-turbine-launches,"A “green” investment that pays 12% interest and involves putting your money into a major tidal energy project was launched this week. But that high rate indicates this is a great deal riskier than putting your money into a high street savings account, with no compensation if things go wrong. So this is not one for the risk-averse. Launched by ethical investment platform Abundance, the scheme involves a company called Orbital Marine Power that is looking to raise £7m to fund construction of the UK’s first floating tidal stream turbine to go into commercial production. Those who invest would be buying debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. The investment has a 30-month term and offers 12% interest a year before tax, which is rolled up and paid at maturity in June 2021. The minimum investment is £5. The offer document says that if someone invested £1,000, they would at the end of the term receive £338.02 interest, plus their original capital back. But debentures are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service, and the document states that “there is no guarantee you will receive any interest, or that your capital will be returned”.",Wave and tidal power; Green economy; Environment; Renewable energy; Energy; Investments; Money; Scotland; UK news,Environment
2018-08-02T10:47:17Z,Tessa Tennant obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/tessa-tennant-obituary,"Tessa Tennant, who has died of cancer aged 59, was led by her ruling passions into a position of huge influence in the world of green finance. Realising the need to reconcile planetary limits with the power of directing investment, for 30 years she was at the forefront of a movement that has encouraged fund managers to invest money in a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion. Tessa co-founded the UK’s first green investment fund, the Merlin (now Jupiter) Ecology Fund, in 1988. She was later head of responsible investment at NPI (now part of Janus Henderson Investors), where she managed massive amounts of institutional money on socially and environmentally responsible lines – for instance by refusing to take shares in high-polluting companies or those involved in child labour. In 1991 she co-founded the UK Social Investment Forum, which lobbied for the wider adoption of responsible investment in Britain. She was also involved in setting up what is now the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, an alliance of more than 200 financial institutions that seeks to improve understanding of how banks, insurance companies and other major investors can take account of environmental, social and governance factors when deciding where to put their money. In addition Tessa co-founded, in 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project, a successful programme that has encouraged major companies to make annual disclosures of the greenhouse gas emissions they generate, and which works with them to cut those emissions. Now known as CDP, the project has grown dramatically since its inception, and works with more than 6,000 companies across the globe, including most of the biggest corporations. Tessa was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, to John Cormack, a pilot, and Jean Davies, the daughter of a Liberal peer. After leaving Prior’s Field school, in Godalming, she gained an environmental studies degree at King’s College London. Working after her degree at the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, she spotted the power that was latent in fund management, and noted that few investors at the time were routinely weighing up the environmental impacts of their decisions. Fewer still considered that excellent long-term returns could be had by investing in business that respects the natural world. After an internship in the US with the green asset management firm Trillium and its inspiring leader Joan Bavaria, she co-founded Merlin (now Jupiter) Fund Management in London and was its head of social investments. There she helped to build up an investment team that featured many people who fanned out into new responsible investment operations across the world over the next quarter of a century. At NPI she built and led a team that grew sustainable assets under management faster than any other group in the UK, winning large institutional mandates.Seeing the implications of billions of far eastern consumers joining the global economy, in 2000 she relocated to Hong Kong. There she set up the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia, which is now part of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an international network of investors pledged to incorporate social and environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes. After helping to create the Carbon Disclosure Project, she became its first executive chair and then a board member until 2014 – encouraging, sometimes embarrassing, corporations into measuring and reporting their emissions. Through defining and disclosing their climate impacts, companies saw the need to bring them down – reducing demand for fossil fuels and driving finance into low-carbon technologies. Over the last 20 years of her life Tessa developed an impressive portfolio of directorships. These included non-executive directorships at the Green Investment Bank and Solarcentury, a solar electricity company. She was possessed of an exceptional combination of energy, social confidence and free-spirited charm that brought her many admirers – her advice was sought by politicians including Tony Blair. In 1983 she had married Henry Tennant, whose father became Lord Glenconner. Tessa and Henry had a son, Euan, shortly before Henry recognised that he was gay. They separated but remained close; in 1990 Henry died from complications of Aids. Tessa took over his forebears’ mansion in the Scottish borders, the grade A-listed Glen House, with accompanying farmland, cottages, steadings and offices. In 2006 she met Bill Staempfli, a New York architect who was in Oxford on sabbatical studying environmental policy, and they married in 2007. Responsibility for managing the Glen estate without the financial means to run it was a legacy that Tessa occasionally thought she could do without, but in partnership with Bill she brought the farm back in hand by managing it organically, planting new native woods, tackling a backlog of repairs and hiring it out for film and fashion shoots.

2018-09-10T05:00:17Z,"As New York and London mayors, we call on all cities to divest from fossil fuels | Bill de Blasio and Sadiq Khan",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/london-new-york-cities-divest-fossil-fuels-bill-de-blasio-sadiq-khan,"This summer it seemed as if our two cities had changed places. London was hot and dry while New York had days and days of rain. According to leading scientists, the heatwave in Europe over recent months was made twice as likely by climate change resulting from human activity. There is also growing evidence of the link between climate change and the frequency of major floods, as well as the severity of hurricanes. It’s clear that what we think of now as freak weather in our cities is likely to become the new normal, and that climate change poses a huge threat to the futures of our children, and many generations to come. As mayors, we are not only committed to taking bold action to tackle climate change and to improve the lives of those we represent, but also to showing others the way. That’s why, ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit in California, we are calling on other cities to stand with us to divest their assets from fossil fuel companies. Today we are announcing a new global initiative for cities on divestment and sustainable investment. Working through the C40 Climate Leadership Group, London and New York will co-chair the Cities Divest/Invest forum, a global network for cities that will not only enable us to share tools, knowledge and experiences, but also to advocate for action on divestment and green investment. London and New York are two of the world’s most dynamic, innovative and forward-thinking cities, and we are determined to push ahead with the goals of the Paris agreement – stealing a march on many national governments. We know that tackling climate change requires action across the board – from how we run our transport networks to using cleaner energy and making our buildings more energy-efficient. But we must also use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe that ending institutional investment in companies that extract fossil fuels and contribute directly to climate change can help send a very powerful message that renewables and low-carbon options are the future. If we want to fund the scale of transformation the world needs, we must foster sustainable investment and use the power of institutional investors, such as pension funds. That’s why – in both London and New York – we are taking all possible steps to divest our city pension funds from fossil fuels. Already, less than 2% of the London Pension Fund Authority’s investments of £5.5bn ($7.1bn) are in extractive fossil fuels – this year, the authority has rid itself of a further £700,000 of fossil fuel investments, including stakes in Shell and BP, and has plans in place to divest its remaining investments. In New York, divestment is under way, with the goal of total divestment within five years. This will mean removing some $5bn (£3.8bn) in investment from the industry. Both our cities are also investing in a sustainable future. London recently launched the £500m Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund, working with the European Regional Development Fund and private sector investors to help hospitals, museums, offices, libraries, social housing and universities to become greener and more energy efficient. New York City has increased its solar-energy capacity six-fold since 2013 and is investing $2.7bn in energy-efficiency projects that save New Yorkers money and cut emissions. City government now has more than 1,200 electric vehicles and 500 charging stations. Of course, we acknowledge that divestment and accelerating green investment is not always straightforward. The major portfolios held by public entities are typically pension funds, which aren’t generally under the control of mayors. But we can make progress if we work together with a range of partners – including pension funds, local authorities, campaign groups and the private sector. We believe we can demonstrate to the world that divestment is a powerful tool and a prudent use of resources. And that, together, our cities – New York, London and many others around the world – can send a clear message to the fossil fuel industry: change your ways now and join us in tackling climate change. Climate change knows no borders, and taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. • Bill de Blasio is mayor of New York City and Sadiq Khan is mayor of London",Fossil fuel divestment; Environment; Fossil fuels; Cities; Energy; London; New York; Climate crisis; UK news; US news,Opinion
2019-06-23T06:00:41Z,"Just like the 1930s, this trade war has the potential to turn nasty",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/23/trade-wars-roosevelt-realised-truth-trump-eurozone,"A trade war followed by a currency war. Tariffs used as a protectionist weapon followed by attempts to secure a competitive advantage by exchange rate manipulation. That was the story of the 1930s and, the way things are shaping up, it could easily be the story of the 2020s as well. Consider the historical parallels. In 1930, the US Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Act, which raised tariffs on imported goods. The next year, Britain became the first major country to come off the gold standard. Sterling quickly lost 25% of its value against the US dollar, making British exports cheaper on world markets. But the full benefits were short-lived. Soon after being sworn in as president in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt unpegged the dollar from gold, eroding Britain’s advantage. In early 2018, Donald Trump announced that he was putting tariffs on imported aluminium and steel – the opening shot in a trade war that has seen the US and China engage in tit-for-tat action over the past year. Last week, the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, dropped the clearest of hints that fresh stimulus to boost both growth and inflation in the eurozone was on the way. Financial markets had been slow to pick up on the change in the ECB’s thinking, so Draghi reprised his “whatever it takes” speech in 2012 to make sure everybody got the message: interest rates will be cut and quantitative easing will be resumed. Draghi’s comments had two immediate effects: the euro dropped like a stone against the dollar and Trump got extremely upset. The weaker euro, Trump said, would make it “unfairly easier” for the Europeans to compete against the US: “They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.” As with Draghi, Trump’s message could scarcely have been clearer. The US sees the EU as just as big a threat as China, and is prepared to open up a second front in the trade war. Within 36 hours, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, had signalled that it too was planning to cut interest rates and the euro regained much of the ground it had lost after Draghi’s intervention. Make no mistake, this has the potential to turn nasty. Trump was already agitated about the size of Germany’s trade surplus with the US and has argued – correctly – that the eurozone’s biggest economy has been aided in achieving this by a weak euro. Pushing down the value of the single currency still further was bound to rattle the president’s cage. Under the rules that govern the dealings of the G7’s group of central banks, countries are not allowed to deliberately devalue their currencies to secure a competitive advantage. So Draghi was obliged to say that the ECB was acting for purely domestic reasons. But this was casuistry. The eurozone is heavily export-dependent and has been hard hit by the slowdown in the global economy seen over the past year. Loosening monetary policy through lower interest rates and QE has the knock-on effect of making it easier for European exporters to win orders in tough times – and Draghi knows it. But if one currency is depreciating, another currency must be appreciating. The Japanese want a weak yen; the Chinese desire a competitive yuan; the Europeans are eager for the euro to be lower; and Trump is opposed to the idea of a stronger dollar. As was eventually understood in the 1930s, beggar-thy-neighbour currency devaluation is a zero-sum game that is extremely hard to win. Bad taste left by cut-price 737 deal The clear Paris airshow showstopper was news that British Airways’ owner, IAG, would buy 200 of Boeing’s grounded 737 Max planes – a move that infuriated rival Airbus, which had not been invited to tender for the IAG fleet expansion, and lifted Boeing from the doldrums. With the 737 Max yet to be certified safe to fly again, it came at a bargain price for IAG, substantially less than the $24bn the planes should notionally cost. The aircraft is grounded, lest we forget, because 346 passengers and crew lost their lives in two crashes. Investigators in Indonesia had already named one likely cause of the Lion Air disaster: MCAS, an anti-stall system that had been implemented because the aircraft had changed – but not changed enough, Boeing and regulators decided, to require the expensive retraining of pilots. But then came the next 737 Max crash, in Ethiopia. The world of aviation is full of businesses who like to say that safety is their number one priority – a pious pledge that is self-evidently not literally true. What is true is that for an individual airline to be seen to deliberately cut corners is commercially disastrous; even Ryanair, in the years when it revelled in its own negative publicity, would immediately stamp on any hint that its flights were in any way less safe than those of other airlines. But passenger confidence in modern aviation has been knocked, badly, by the latest disasters, and questions remain. British Airways’ planes will be delivered years after the 737 Max returns to the skies, and the Paris deal remains a “letter of intent” rather than a firm order. For all that, there is a whiff of indecency about an arrangement that saves money for IAG at the cost of affirming the 737 Max’s safety before the regulators have done so, and while passengers’ remains still lie in a field in Ethiopia. Will a climate divestment drive wake up the world’s biggest polluters? The UK’s largest money manager is putting £1 trillion where its mouth is. Last week Legal and General Investment Management publicly shamed five of the world’s worst climate villains, in one of the City’s most strident climate divestment drives yet. It will sweep these carbon-intensive companies, including US oil giant ExxonMobil, from 19 ethical funds representing £5bn of environmentally conscientious investment. This is a fraction of L&amp;G’s total financial heft, but the rest of its shareholder clout – it will retain investments in these companies in its other funds – will be used to vote against the boards of climate laggards at each successive AGM. L&amp;G calls this “engagement with consequences”. The money manager expects companies in the world’s most polluting industries – fossil fuels, food retailing, agriculture and finance – to come clean on their carbon emissions and set targets to drive them down. The approach has been welcomed by green investment activists as an important weapon in the complex battle against climate breakdown. ExxonMobil is the first oil super-major to come under fire for failing to meet these basic demands. By contrast, European oil giants Shell and BP have avoided being named and shamed by agreeing to disclose their contribution to the world’s growing carbon emissions, and setting targets to reduce them. So is big oil free to pollute, as long as it confesses its sins and vows to try harder? Not quite. L&amp;G insists these rules of engagement are already yielding powerful results. It plans to escalate its demands in the years ahead too; accepting responsibility for climate emissions is only the start. The fund admits that talk is meaningless without action, and engagement is meaningless without consequences. The question is whether this is enough to rouse the boards of the world’s most polluting companies to urgent action before it is too late.",Global economy; European Union; Eurozone; European Central Bank; European monetary union; US economy; Donald Trump; US news; Chinese economy; Economics; Airline industry; Investing; Business,Business
2019-03-04T08:00:26Z,Parliament must declare a climate emergency – not ignore it | Caroline Lucas,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/04/climate-change-emergency-westminster,"MPs debated climate change in the Commons chamber last week for the first time in two years. It was our first opportunity since September 2016 to talk about the biggest and most urgent crisis humanity has ever faced. Just 40 MPs showed up. This absenteeism speaks volumes. Even as we’ve sweated through a record-breaking February, as wildfires tear through our ancient woodlands, as insect and wildlife populations collapse around us, the words “climate change” are scarcely whispered in the corridors of Whitehall. Since 2010, this government has built a bonfire out of the measures designed to cut emissions. Zero carbon homes targets have been scrapped. Onshore wind has been effectively banned. Solar power has been shafted. The Green Investment Bank has been flogged off. Fracking has been forced on communities who have rejected it. Ministers champion the drop in our domestic carbon dioxide emissions – but they neglect to mention the true scale of our impact. Between 1997 and 2015, our total carbon footprint – taking into account everything we import and consume, as well as what we produce – declined by a pitiful 3.8%. On the opposition benches, while many MPs grasp the severity of this situation, their parties’ policies are littered with impossible inconsistencies. We cannot tackle climate change and build new runways, or prop up North Sea oil and gas, or spend billions on new roads. And we cannot tackle climate change with an economy built on the assumption that precious minerals, fresh air, clean water and rare species can magically regenerate themselves in an instant – that somehow the Earth will expand to meet our voracious appetite for new stuff. The world’s top scientists say we need to cut emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. But during that same period, the global economy is set to nearly triple in size. It would be hard enough to decarbonise existing levels of production and consumption in just a few decades. To do it three times over is nigh on impossible. To pursue never-ending economic growth – or even to keep things ticking along as they are – is to gamble with the fate of humanity. We need nothing short of a transformation of the way we live our lives – and the way we measure progress. In the US, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has reinvigorated the idea of a Green New Deal – an initiative I was proud to have co-founded 10 years ago here in the UK. It takes its inspiration from Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s, which used massive investment in jobs and infrastructure to pull the US out of the Great Depression. In 2019, we face an even bigger challenge. To avoid climate catastrophe, we must go beyond what is considered politically possible. A Green New Deal would mobilise resources on a scale unprecedented in peacetime, to tackle the climate emergency and address spiralling inequality. It would involve huge investment in clean energy, warm homes and affordable public transport – delivering a decent, well-paid job to everyone who wants one. It would rebuild once proud communities that have been hollowed out by deindustrialisation and austerity, allowing them to thrive as part of a collective endeavour to protect the planet. And it would protect and restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks like forests, wild places, soils and oceans. To do this, we must be able to leverage whatever finance is necessary to tackle the crisis. This is not a Trumpian border wall emergency – this is a real emergency. Critics might denounce such a plan as fantasy politics – but I ask them, with just 11 years left to halve global climate emissions, what is your alternative? Young people understand what’s needed to secure their futures. Last month, they went on school strike across the country to protest about government inaction on climate change. In our cities and towns, Green councillors have persuaded more than 25 local authorities to declare a climate emergency – and now schools and universities are doing the same. These are some of the most inspirational and hopeful acts I’ve seen in years. And where the people lead, politicians must follow. Parliament must now declare a climate emergency. It must debate climate change regularly. It must develop the laws necessary to implement a Green New Deal and climate-proof every piece of legislation. And the government must ensure climate change is a priority in all departmental and cabinet decision-making. But government and parliament will only act if we tell them to. So talk about climate breakdown – to your friends, your family, your neighbours and your colleagues. Join the school strikes. Join peaceful direct action initiatives like Extinction Rebellion. Write to your MP. Write to your councillors. Write to your banks. This is an emergency. Let’s treat it like one. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion",Climate crisis; Environment; Climate science; Politics; Carbon footprints; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; Caroline Lucas; Green party; House of Commons; House of Lords,Opinion
2019-03-02T10:11:28Z,"UK weather: February temperature jump was incredible, says climate expert",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/02/uk-temperature-jump-february-incredible-climate-weather-carbon,"This week’s record winter heat in the UK was so far above normal trends that scientists have been forced to reconsider their statistical models, with one expert calling the temperature jump “incredible”. UK temperature records have tumbled in the past 10 days. Last Thursday, Scotland experienced its highest winter warmth of 18.3C in Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire. On Tuesday, Wales set a new UK high for the season for 20.8 in Porthmadog. This was beaten on Wednesday, when Kew registered 21.2C. Even taking into account the underlying 1C of global heating from carbon emissions this was a surprise to some scientists. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate researcher at Royal Netherlands Meteorolgical Institute who has conducted a preliminary study of the trend data from Reading and central England, said the probability of this week’s temperatures was close to zero. “This is an incredible jump in record temperatures. If you asked me a few months ago, I would have said it is ridiculous,” he said. “It’s at least a one-in 200-year event, but it could be more because my statistical tools break down because this was so far outside what we are used to in February.” According to the Met Office, the mean maximum temperature in February was at up to 3.5C above the average between 1981 and 2010. This was due to large areas of high pressure over continental Europe that brought warm air from the Canaries and north Africa. Government meteorologists are now studying exactly how much of this unusual heat can be attributed to man-made climate change. Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office, said: “For a lot of people an opportunity to enjoy a nice day but for many others it was shocking to see values above 20C. Clearly having that warm weather record broken is, we think, largely to do with climate change, amplifying those warm events. That was widely recognised by the public.” Previous Met Office studies show the man-made carbon emissions in the atmosphere made last summer’s heatwave 30 times more likely, and extremes of heat are now being recorded 10 times more often than extremes of cold. The weirding of the weather – which was warmer than Bermuda this week and colder than the Arctic at the same time last year – has prompted mixed reactions. A study of the coverage by CarbonBrief highlights how images of wildfires on Saddleworth Moor and stories about water shortages contrasted with cheery headlines such as “Fabruary” and reports about ice-cream sales. Nick Bridge, the UK’s chief climate envoy, was among many to express frustration with the lack of concern in many reports by the BBC and others: Yet the first climate debate in parliament for two years was sparsely attended by MPs. The disparity between the growing evidence of crisis and the limp response by politicians and most media is expected to galvanise more direct action of the sort seen in recent months with student strikes and acts of civil disobedience by Extinction Rebellion protesters. “Thanks to the students, who made us act,” said Layla Moran‏, a Liberal Democrat MP who proposed the debate with Caroline Lucas of the Green party, and urged legislators to listen to the child activists. “The message that came to us from the young people, who struck the other day, is that we must now take this as an emergency. We cannot wait another two years to debate this in this place.” Lucas said time was running out but the government was going backwards on climate action. “Since 2010 almost every existing sensible climate measure has been torched: zero carbon homes scrapped, onshore wind effectively banned, solar power shafted, the Green Investment Bank flogged off, and fracking forced on local communities.” Claire Perry, the minister of state for energy and clean growth, accepted that current efforts were insufficient. “We can take pride in the UK’s record in tackling climate change, but we know we have to do more, and we will do more. We must keep leading from the front so we can look the next generation in the eye and say for your future we protected Planet A because there is no Planet B.” But the sparse turnout highlighted the low priority this continues to be for most politicians. Extinction Rebellion has shared images of the largely empty chamber on social networks and echoed Lucas’s call for the government to declare a climate emergency. It plans to support a global school strike on 15 March and to stage a week of disruption starting on 15 April. Other environment groups are also stepping up pressure on the government. “We’re living through a climate emergency, so really our politicians should be debating this every week,” said Mel Evans, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK. “It’s time for us all to demand that our government faces up to reality and calls the crisis what it is, a climate emergency.”",UK weather; UK news; Climate crisis; Environment; Climate science; Wales; Scotland; Activism; Science; World news,UK news
2019-02-22T13:41:34Z,Just how ethical is ethical investment?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/22/just-how-ethical-is-ethical-investment,"Supposedly environmental stock market indices used to help investors allocate hundreds of billions of pounds in investments include some of the world’s biggest contributors to fossil fuel pollution. Index providers including FTSE Russell, MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Stoxx all run indices that take into account environmental, social and corporate governance concerns known as ESG. FTSE Russell, owned by the London Stock Exchange, says it has a “hard exclusion” for coal companies from its FTSE4Good ethical indices, after it was decided that the most-polluting major fossil fuel did not fit its criteria for a sustainable future. However, major coal producers including BHP and Anglo American are included because they are listed as “general mining” firms rather than coal companies. FTSE Russell refused to provide the Guardian with a full list of index constituents but publicly available factsheets indicate that 34 oil and gas related companies account for 3.4% of the FTSE4Good developed index by market capitalisation. The inclusion of major oil and coal companies on indices is likely to prompt concerns about the term ESG being used to “greenwash” the reputations of major polluters. The New York-headquartered MSCI claims that investors worldwide have used its ESG indices to direct well over £200bn in investments since 2014. Fund managers such as Blackrock and Vanguard sell investors products such as exchange-traded funds, which track the performance of ESG indices. Savers whose money is invested using these indices may be unaware that they are funding fossil fuel extraction, said Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “In today’s world, many people buying products labelled ‘4 Good’ may expect that a fund created to take into account environmental impact would not include oil or other fossil fuel companies,” he said. “The stark reality is that to achieve the targets of the Paris agreement and avoid huge impacts on billions of people as well as massive biodiversity loss, there will have to be drastic changes to the way we power our societies, move around, grow much of our food and look after the natural world. Including oil companies in funds that are marketed as protecting the environment won’t help that transformation – it will slow it down.” Some index providers argue that ESG indices can be used to give greater weight to those companies which do better than their peers on various sustainability issues. Linda-Eling Lee, global head of ESG research at MSCI, told the Guardian this “competitive logic” can give companies incentives to improve their operations. MSCI’s indices favour those companies that “are actually paying attention to these emerging or latent ESG risks”, she said. All of the index firms provide detailed methodologies for their indices, assigning clearly defined ESG scores to companies. However, the scoring systems used by some indices only count direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions, such as those from company vehicles or offices – ignoring the much larger emissions from burning fossil fuels extracted by energy companies, known as scope 3 emissions. David Harris, the group head of sustainable business at the London Stock Exchange Group, said scope 3 emissions calculations are not suitable for index creation. “Scope 3 is a great concept but if you want to use it for investment purposes there’s very little data,” he said. FTSE Russell’s aim instead was on “raising the standards over time” by engaging with companies on the indices on their environmental practices, with the threat of them being thrown off if they do not improve, he said. He ruled out excluding the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring investor pressure to bear. Spokespeople for MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones and Stoxx also cited engagement with companies as a key reason for retaining polluters on indices. All of the index providers argued that they offer investors choices for how they structure their portfolios and that it was not their responsibility to rule out entire sectors. The index firms do offer sub-indices that exclude fossil fuel producers and they run profitable and growing businesses that can produce bespoke indices for investors. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “It’s daft that these oil, gas, and mining giants are allowed to be labelled as businesses with ‘strong environmental practices’ when their whole business model is predicated on extracting and burning fossil fuels. This speaks to a wider need for regulatory clarification on what constitutes a green investment but in the meantime a little common sense wouldn’t go amiss.” She added: “Investment firms and index providers must take responsibility for the products they market to consumers and implement stricter rules for qualifying for ESG indices. So much is at stake.” Index providers have previously resisted activist pressure to adjust their ESG indices but the activists have also scored some notable successes. Dow Jones Sustainability Indices removed Golden Agri-Resources, a Singapore-listed palm oil company, from ESG benchmarks in December, after Friends of the Earth accused the index of “greenwashing” a company behind deforestation. “There’s a lot of hiding behind opaque metrics of what sustainability investing is,” said Gaurav Madan, senior forests and lands campaigner at FoE in the US. He added that companies “hide behind [the] idea of engagement” with boards to improve practices.",Ethical business; Stock markets; Corporate governance; Investing; Business; UK news; Dow Jones; FTSE; Greenpeace; Environment; US news,Business
2020-05-21T05:00:47Z,'I don't want to be seen as a zealot': what MPs really think about the climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/i-dont-want-to-be-seen-as-a-zealot-what-mps-really-think-about-the-climate-crisis,"One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it’s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament. The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution. She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone – maybe a constituent or the local paper – would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. “I thought I might get a bit of pushback,” she told me. “I’ve had absolutely zero.” This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to strengthen these targets, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition – in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we’re all in favour of climate action, but we haven’t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions. I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we’re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It’s easier to look away. In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything will be different. If, as I’ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away? Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts – and a political strategy that will allow this to happen – has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed. * * * I’ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair’s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law. Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. “I don’t remember it being one of the big issues,” she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, “I remember it going on in the background, but it wasn’t something that had high temperature”. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change – and then carried on as normal. That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn’t understand what it was all about? With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs’ questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians – ministers or frontbenchers – to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party. Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a “penny-drop moment”, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more – and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don’t act. And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives. We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own renewable energy projects. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren’t they doing more? I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs – 23 in all – to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, number of known “climate sceptic” MPs, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change. I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence. All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate “terrified” him. “Where we’re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn’t fancy our chances.” I asked why, if it’s so significant, it wasn’t discussed much in parliament. But he didn’t answer. He couldn’t, or didn’t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him. Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn’t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn’t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate. * * * It’s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: “You might not get into double figures.” She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as tax breaks for oil and gas exploration. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: “I think they’d just think you were a bit ‘niche’, is the way I’d put it – I say ‘niche’ in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.” One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: “I was known as being a freak.” Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a “zealot”. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. “I don’t use climate change as the word because I think it’s just toxic,” he told me. “As is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won’t take people with you politically.” This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine – and politicians are no exception. Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn’t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, having to resort to artificial snow – something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives. Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: “How could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible – simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?” She labelled this phenomenon “socially organised denial”. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn’t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and “with nature”. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged. Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels. As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry “cannot be shut down overnight”. She’s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere – not overnight, but urgently. The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I’ve come to think of as the “feelgood fallacy”. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won’t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas – yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this. If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it’s burned, not where it’s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions. * * * Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, “I’ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters … and I just don’t have conversations about climate change.” Many of these conversations took place before the school climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests began in 2018 – these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK’s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as “almost like being a parent. It’s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.” Exactly how a politician “represents” the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying”: “I am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.” This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate – a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end – it’s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate. They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: “I’m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.” Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, “there would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: ‘Oh, here he goes again.’” Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option. There’s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don’t speak out, people don’t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don’t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move. But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like? * * * In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional environmental benefits of lockdown. It’s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is in no way a model for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls. What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why. Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite – handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy. If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a Green New Deal. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward a plan aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare. Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour’s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate. A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens’ assemblies. Early this year, Climate Assembly UK got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament. Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there’s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats – not least, those arising from climate change. Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can’t govern in a vacuum. We can’t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician’s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn’t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful. Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",Climate crisis; Politics; Climate science,Environment
2019-01-01T12:26:43Z,Time for politicians to make 'stark choices' over climate change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/01/time-for-politicians-to-make-stark-choices-over-climate-change,"Politicians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted, according to the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis. From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to “real, stark choices” in the years ahead. “If you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, biodiversity loss – if you actually want a planet that’s inhabitable – then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,” Lewis said in an interview with the Guardian. Having returned to Labour’s frontbench a year ago, after resigning in protest when Jeremy Corbyn whipped MPs to support the triggering of article 50, Lewis was given the job of examining how a Labour government could champion sustainable economics. He has repeatedly made it clear he regards the issue as a test of political leadership. “I think there’s a crunch point now coming for politics. You often hear there’s no leadership in politics – and this isn’t a leadership pitch, I promise you – but when you talk about leadership, there’s leadership in different forms,” he said. On red meat, for example, Lewis said: “I’m not going to sit here and say, yeah, let’s ban red meat … but you can show leadership by asking, well actually, is it right that we publicly subsidise an industry that is contributing so much to greenhouse gas emissions, and often is a very unsustainable practice?” He said the government’s role should be to “encourage people and show leadership as to how we’re going to shift people’s eating habits on to a more sustainable footing”. On air travel, he said Labour was starting to come up with options, including a tax “escalator”, which would have the biggest impact on frequent fliers, who tend to be the wealthiest. In a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the “fourth industrial revolution” benefits the wider public. While many such policies are at an early stage of development, Lewis said the next Labour manifesto should be significantly different to the previous one. “The 2017 manifesto gave a lot of people a kind of warm, cuddly glow, and it was a great reset of our values and where we are, but it was a base on which to build,” he said. “The next manifesto needs to be a radical manifesto, which builds on the reset, and is 21st-century socialism in action. There’s a hunger for that.” McDonnell has asked the former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake to examine how to rework the Treasury green book – the manual for government spending decisions. Lewis said he hoped environmental sustainability could be incorporated into Whitehall thinking as part of that review. “The Treasury has been the instigator of selling off the green investment bank, of scuppering [the] Swansea tidal [lagoon power plant], of undermining the plastic tax and electric vehicles – because it simply sees things in a very short-term, revenue-generating manner,” he said. “What we want to do is open out how the Treasury looks at spending and revenue, and looks in a longer term, more holistic and sustainable way – and that is radical.” Lewis recently secured £17,500 from individual donors to fund his work on sustainable economics, giving him a measure of independence from the party machine. He argued that developing a more sustainable economic model could allow Britain to take a leadership role in the world after Brexit. “Leadership and punching above your weight doesn’t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries,” he said. Lewis was widely considered a rising star on the left of the party when he arrived in parliament in 2015, and was catapulted on to the frontbench by Corbyn, as many more experienced MPs refused to serve or were sent packing. But the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn’s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech. In late 2017, he apologised after video footage emerged of him using the phrase “get on your knees, bitch” at a party conference fringe event, and was then suspended – and cleared – over accusations that he groped a party member. Most recently, Lewis was criticised after miming putting a gun in his mouth during a debate in the House of Commons as a Conservative MP interrupted his frontbench colleague Anneliese Dodds. Lewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch. “I couldn’t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,” he said. He said he believed countering the human threats to the environment would have to mean junking “the obsession with flat-screen TVs and consumption”. “On their deathbed, do people think: ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my Ferrari’? Or do they say: ‘I wish I’d spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I’d spent more time country walking’? “It’s about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that,” he said. On Brexit, meanwhile, Lewis stuck rigidly to the party line, dismissing questions about what Labour would put in its manifesto if there were to be a snap general election as “hypothetical”.",Clive Lewis; Economic policy; Labour; Climate crisis; Environment; Politics; UK news; Food,Politics
2019-03-15T11:45:09Z,Do UK politicians support the climate strike? Party leaders respond | Jeremy Corbyn and others,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/uk-politicians-climate-change-party-youth-strikers,"Jeremy Corbyn, Labour: It’s past time all of us stopped looking the other way By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard, young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation. They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn’t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis. Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it’s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a “green industrial revolution”. We have the plans to create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs in the renewable energy sector. That will help meet our target of 60% of energy to come from low-carbon sources within 12 years. The next generation will be trained in the skills needed to work in offshore wind, tidal lagoons and solar energy. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in public transport and cycle paths we will reduce our reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles. All new homes built will be zero-carbon too. The UK is home to some of the least populated areas of Europe, and under a green industrial revolution they will be allowed to thrive, not destroyed. Every national and local park in this country has been a victory won by communities through struggle. In the 1930s, working-class people staged a mass protest fighting their way up Kinder Scout in Derbyshire to fight for the “right to roam”, paving the way for the establishment of our national parks years later by a Labour government. And it was Labour’s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee who said that the countryside was not just “a means of producing food, but part of our great national heritage of beauty”. Building on this legacy, a Labour government will ensure that farming conserves and creates safe habitats for birds, insects and other wild animals, and encourages the growth of wildflowers. Labour has a strong record of international leadership on the environment, and action on climate change will be at the heart of our development and trade policies. We have a role not just in protecting and promoting biodiversity in the UK but protecting it in other countries and in the oceans that connect us. It’s past time all of us stopped looking the other way, learn from the passion and wisdom of young people and join them in actively organising for a better future. • Jeremy Corbyn is MP for Islington North and leader of the Labour party Conservative party The Conservative party was invited to participate, but declined. Nicola Sturgeon, SNP: It’s right we are all challenged to see where we can do more Climate change is the most serious issue facing the world and is a truly global challenge. We have a moral responsibility to do what we can to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change for future generations. Scotland has been praised as a world leader for the action we are taking to address the issue. We have introduced a new climate change bill that contains the most ambitious statutory targets of any country in the world for 2020, 2030 and 2040, and will mean Scotland is carbon neutral by 2050. However, the urgency of climate change means it is right that we are all challenged to constantly reassess our approach and to see where we can do more. It is of course extremely important that school pupils attend their lessons, and as first minister, I could not condone repeated absences during term time. But in Scotland our schools teach and encourage our young people to engage in public debate and to learn about the issues that concern them. Lowering the voting age to 16 as we have done since 2014 has only enhanced our political debate and in 2018 we celebrated the Year of Young People. The year gave young people new opportunities for their voices to be heard in all parts of our society and helped foster better understanding, cooperation and respect between generations. On a matter of such importance as climate change, it is inspiring that young people are engaged, interested and ready to take action themselves to hold world leaders and governments to account. Later this month I will be meeting a group of young people from across Scotland who have been active climate change campaigners to discuss the issue and hear their concerns. We must listen to the voice of the next generation and involve them in decision-making and policy development. It is their planet to inherit, and their passion to protect it should inspire us all. • Nicola Sturgeon is first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP Vince Cable, Liberal Democrats: It’s our responsibility to support young people The students who are taking part in this climate strike are right to highlight what is the most serious issue facing any of us. Just as with Brexit, young people will be most acutely affected, and it’s our responsibility to support them. Liberal Democrats invested heavily in a cleaner environment during our period in government, setting up the Green Investment Bank, encouraging homes to cut emissions through the Green Deal, and cutting plastic bag usage by 85% through the 5p levy. Since Liberal Democrats left government the Conservatives have abandoned the positive record of the coalition. They have effectively banned onshore wind turbines, slashed subsidies to solar power, pursued an ideological obsession with fracking, cut incentives for electric vehicles, scrapped zero-carbon homes, cancelled rail electrification projects and approved a new runway at Heathrow. The hostility now levelled at young people who are taking a stand on this issue demonstrates that these strikes are noticed by those in power. It’s now up to Westminster to act responsibly – coming together across parties – to act on the demands of those who care about our planet. The failing Brexit project has crowded out too many important issues over the last three years, and it’s time our political system addressed itself once again to climate change. The Liberal Democrats will continue to be the greenest party in Westminster, and to argue that climate action can best be achieved at a European and international level – working with our neighbours rather than turning our backs. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business Adam Price, Plaid Cymru: Time is running out If I were a school pupil today I would be striking against climate change and would make sure the whole school was striking with me. The reason couldn’t be simpler: time is running out. Time is running out to make the changes to our way of life, how we produce and use energy, how we travel around this Earth, how we build and warm our homes, how we use our natural resources. The threat is bleak: whole states disappearing underwater because of increases in sea level; not just more drought, but more starvation on an international level; widespread disappearance of species and an environment that is far more challenging to life on this Earth. We’re not just on the brink of ecological catastrophe, we’re in the middle of one. But what I’ve seen so clearly by these school strikers so far is that from speaker after speaker, young person after young person there is such an outpouring of eloquence, of vision, of positivity. To stand up and fight for the Earth is the noblest of all causes. Climate change faces humanity as a whole. It should be the main discussion across chambers, but Brexit has sucked the oxygen from our politics. It feels as if we should skip a generation in politics. Young people are demonstrating the vision and determined leadership to make is possible to make significant and swift progress towards a low-carbon existence. To follow their lead means that we can’t wait until Westminster wakes up. We all must be brave. The small town of Machynlleth in mid-Wales has been one of the very few towns in the world to declare a climate emergency, with ambition to make its buildings eco-friendly, encourage renewable energy developments and ensure its pension fund divested from fossil fuels. What got Machynlleth to make the commitment? It was a petition signed by 500 local people; a small community-sized step with a worldwide impact. • Adam Price is leader of Plaid Cymru Siân Berry, Green party: Youth strikers know the planet can’t wait Hope. That was what I felt when I entered Parliament Square last month to be greeted by hundreds of young people at the first Youth Strike 4 Climate in Britain. That day one young person carried a sign that read: “We are missing our lessons to teach you.” The question now is whether Westminster will listen to the wisdom of youth. Last year the UN warned we have a limited window of opportunity until 2030 to take positive action to limit climate catastrophe. Since then, councils across the country have declared a climate emergency with many committing to gold-standard climate action – often prompted by Green councillors. But parliament is still dragging its heels. This week, the chancellor tried to fob off the rising tide of youth activism with token policies that don’t go far enough. He said he plans to make travel companies offset carbon, yet is still building new runways. He talked about biodiversity, but kept quiet about his devastating cuts to Natural England. And his government is doing nothing to break the toxic hold fossil-fuel bosses have on our lawmakers. Youth strikers across the world know the planet can’t wait. I’m proud it’s my colleague in parliament, Caroline Lucas, demanding the government launch a Green New Deal with money ploughed into thousands of new green jobs and transformed local energy and transport networks. If ministers are serious about securing the planet for our children, they will act now. As a Green elected to represent millions of young Londoners, it’s amazing to see them make these demands of me and my political colleagues. It will be a privilege to stand beside our young people again today as they strike for their futures – I implore those in power to listen to their demands. • Siân Berry is co-leader of the Green party",Climate crisis; Environment; Environmental activism; Protest; UK news; Politics; School climate strikes,Opinion
2018-05-16T10:47:03Z,"UK must secure billions in investment to meet climate targets, MPs warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/uk-must-secure-billions-in-investment-to-meet-climate-targets-mps-warn,"Investment in the UK’s low-carbon economy has fallen dramatically, endangering jobs and putting in doubt the government’s commitments on climate change, an influential committee of MPs has warned. Funds going into renewable energy, the mainstay of the low-carbon economy, fell more than 50% in 2017, having dropped by 10% in 2016, bringing annual investment in the sector to its lowest since the financial crisis in 2008. The environmental audit committee (EAC) said on Wednesday that the government would be unable to meet its pledges on carbon emission reductions, if the collapse continued. The MPs also said the government was failing to implement policies to cut emissions from transport, heating and industry, and called on ministers to consider raising a “sovereign green bond”, as other countries have done, in order to stimulate investment. The criticisms come even as the government has boasted of a clean growth strategy, and a 25-year environmental plan that will address climate change along with other green priorities such as pollution and biodiversity. Mary Creagh, chair of the EAC, said: “The clean growth strategy was long on aspiration, short on detail. The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the [billions of pounds of] investment required to meet the UK’s climate change targets, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its strategy.” Cuts to taxpayer-funded support for renewable projects, along with planning obstacles that have effectively ruled out new onshore wind turbines across much of the country, have deterred energy companies and their financial backers. The market for energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, has also seen a sharp decline since the government scrapped its flagship policy, and the Green Investment Bank was sold off. Alex White, senior policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, said: “There are willing investors in the green economy, but not enough projects to invest in. Boosting the pipeline of green infrastructure projects will be critical to meet the UK’s environmental goals and should be the first priority in green finance. Policy detail is key [for investors].” Alongside the EAC report, researchers and NGOs have called for a “greening” of the Bank of England, to meet carbon targets and encourage clean growth. Positive Money, a thinktank, called for the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to have to take the risks of climate change into account in making its decisions, a controversial recommendation that would require wide reviews of how climate change could make an impact on inflation. The report, A Green Bank of England, also suggested that the Bank of England should be given a specific remit on environmental sustainability, which would affect its decisions and advice to government, and should no longer buy bonds issued by fossil fuel companies. Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisors, said linking the Bank of England’s work to climate change was essential, as was linking the performance of other government departments on the issue. “We have compartmentalised our reactions to climate change – we say, we have a minister for this, so the secretary of state for health or the chancellor do not think they have responsibility for it.” He said: “The Bank of England can make a huge difference by using its own direct powers, and by influencing [others].” He was backed up by Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow secretary for international trade, who said: “We have to make it clear to the Bank of England that it is given a specific remit to deal with these issues, not to limit its activity to more conventional banking activity.” The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has repeatedly warned of the risks of climate change to the financial sector, and the need for action by companies, investors, government and regulators to ensure the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy happens beneficially, rather than by shocks to the finance system. Sovereign green bonds, recommended by the EAC, are financial borrowing instruments issued by governments to raise cash for environmental improvement projects, with part of the return on the projects going to market investors. They enable governments to take advantage of the low interest rates on borrowing available to them, while investors are attracted by the relatively low levels of risk. Poland made a bond issue in 2016, with Belgium following suit this year, and countries around the world from Nigeria to Indonesia have also entered the market. The Bank of England would have to take the lead in issuing such bonds in the UK. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it would respond to the EAC proposals in due course. A spokeswoman said: “We’re committed to meeting our climate change targets and will have invested £2.5bn in low-carbon innovations by 2021.”",Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; UK news; Energy; Environment; Energy industry; Business; Green Investment Bank,Environment
2018-05-16T15:58:16Z,Grubby trade deals with strongmen now shape our foreign policy | Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/16/grubby-trade-deals-with-strongmen-now-shape-our-foreign-policy,"There is usually a protest somewhere near Downing Street, and if I really get into the nitty gritty of reading the banners, I always agree with them. I, too, think that pigs should be treated humanely, vivisection should be banned, territorial disputes should be solved without violence and, in the main, when people are demonstrating about someone in prison, that person probably shouldn’t be in prison. The demo against the visit of President Erdoğan, a man who has oppressed Kurds, imprisoned journalists and sent a creepy Big Brother-style voicemail celebrating himself to the mobile numbers of every Turkish citizen, was no different; except it was different. This was no distant atrocity in some corner of the world, this is now how we formulate our foreign policy. Theresa May invites over some grim character from the world stage, authoritarian in their own country, often with some atrocity elsewhere still ongoing, and we dutifully – some more energetically than others – object. May raises human rights by rote at a press conference, and the leaders in question become ever bolder in their repudiation. Those 160 imprisoned journalists, Erdoğan retorted, were all terrorists. It’s best not to dig too deep into his reasoning, for therein lies a whole snakepit of bare assertion and disregard for the rule of law. But look, over there! Some shiny trade deals. We need trade, remember; we’ve got to trade with someone, and we can’t just invite Justin Trudeau over again and again. Don’t look too closely, either, at what we’re actually trading: the prime bidder is Rolls-Royce, and they’re not flogging cars for Turkey’s booming period drama industry. They’re looking to supply parts for Erdoğan’s new TFX fighter jet, but let’s not get over-excited, we don’t know what he’ll use them for. They may just be a deterrent against all those incredibly well-armed journalists. It is not as if we are talking about Saudi Arabia, to whom we supply arms while they are actively engaged in a campaign against Yemen which the Red Cross has described as one of the ugliest in the world. No, that was last month: the same muted jingoism about the bounty of imports and exports; the same shifty yet resolute silence on what is actually going on. The financial services deal that the leaders announced may be big bucks, but is, morally, small fry. This is a relationship in which we rejoice in their purchase of our armaments, then rejoice again at our generosity in giving £50m towards humanitarian aid for the Yemenis we armed them against. It is utter ethical bankruptcy. The arrival of President Trump in July will present a set of different challenges: but nobody walks away from a negotiating table over a bit of pussy-grabbing. The trouble is, he also wants to grab the NHS by the pussy: the high cost of US healthcare is, apparently, down to the “freeloading” of other countries, so obviously the answer is for our health service to pay more for its drugs. This agenda he will deftly prosecute by dangling our trading relationship by its ankles over the precipice of his free-market fundamentalism. Will it work? We can’t afford for it not to work. You’ve got to trade with someone, remember. It’s not the prime minister’s fault that the whole world’s gone strongman bananas at the same time. Except, of course, it is her fault: when you walk away from the largest civilised trading bloc in the world, the entirely predictable consequence is that you end up shackled to the uncivilised. We have a long and shameful history of making friends for trading purposes who represent an insult to our stated values: the difference now is that we can’t afford to unmake them. Red, white and patriotic blues I’m in two minds about the sight of the nation festooned with union flags in advance of a royal wedding. On the one hand, bunting, anything that looks like bunting, anything that’s red, white and blue, any sign that untrammelled joy is a national requirement, heralds disaster. It starts off cute and big-hearted, and then before you know it, you are swelled with nostalgia and British exceptionalism and scones. On the other hand, all British flag-waving comes with a temporary waiver of the yard-arm and the drinking starts at 11am. That, I quite enjoy. The union flag is, for some unknowable reason (no, wait, I do know it – the Scottish, Welsh and Irish are less obnoxious than the English) less combustible than that of St George. Dep chief constable Mark Roberts of the National Police Chief’s Council has warned England fans planning to travel to Russia for the World Cup that their chosen insignia might be considered “imperialistic and antagonistic”, warning them expressly about the opening game in Volgograd. Once known as Stalingrad, the city has a number of historically significant sites that Russians would not appreciate seeing cloaked in red and white. “Don’t mention the war” was his underlying message, even though we were on the same side, if memory serves, and you could argue that any nationalistic signage of ours carried a clarion of solidarity against our shared enemy. You would need pretty good Russian to make that case, though, and you would want to be able to say it quite fast. There’s a very easy answer to all of this: all nationalistic flags should be printed with some peace or love signifier on the other side: a dove; a heart; a rainbow; maybe a cat; a joint; a G-clef. The large-scale emotional confusion would be intoxicating in itself. The Tories’ environmental sabotage is a betrayal of our future Investment in green energy has fallen to its lowest level since 2008, but how? The figure – 56% – is a lot of funding to lose in a single year, 2017, unless you are really trying. Ah, but they are trying: the government has privatised the green investment bank, canned the renewables obligation for onshore wind, reduced feed-in tariffs for small-scale producers, quietly ditched the zero-carbon homes policy and got rid of the £1bn investment in research on carbon capture and storage. It’s not foot-dragging on the 2050 zero emissions target: it is active sabotage. This is, amid unprecedentedly stiff competition, their worst betrayal of our future.",Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; Donald Trump; World news; Royal wedding 2018; World Cup; World Cup 2018; Renewable energy,Opinion
2018-09-14T11:04:01Z,Ten years after the crash: have the lessons of Lehman been learned? | Yanis Varoufakis and others,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/14/the-panel-lehman-brothers-ten-year-anniversary-financial-crash,"Yanis Varoufakis: Risk has not been diminished, just taken out of sight Ten years after its near-death experience, capitalism is back to its old ways. Bailouts for the few and austerity for the many have caused global debt to rise 40% since 2007. Yes, British and European banks have contracted (as US authorities required Barclays, Deutsche Bank etc to shrink their dollar business) and tougher national rules constrain balance sheets. However, this has causedfinancial intermediation to shift from banks to capital markets. By making some banks safer, the risk has been moved to the shadow banking system, which has grown from $28tn in 2010 to $45tn in 2018, and from the west to emerging markets, which have borrowed $3.7tn in the last decade – with the results we now see in Turkey and Argentina. In short, risk has not been diminished, just taken out of sight and dispersed geographically. Moreover, toxic politics has ensured that the two states that saved capitalism in 2008, the US and China, cannot repeat that double act. What should be done? First, we need a global green investment programme to put the global glut of idle savings to useful purpose. A multilateral partnership of public investment banks could issue bonds in a coordinated fashion, which their respective central banks would support in the secondary markets. In this manner, global savings would be energised into major investments in jobs, the regions, health and education projects, and the green technologies that humanity needs. Second, trade agreements must commit governments of poorer countries to minimum living wages for their workers. Third, we need a new Bretton Woods agreement to rebalance trade, re-couple trade and capital flows, put the financial genie back in the bottle, and create an international wealth fund to alleviate poverty and support marginalised communities across the world. • Yanis Varoufakis is the former finance minister of Greece. Ann Pettifor: To prevent another crisis, bring back Keynes The lessons have not been learned. The crisis manifested itself as a way of consolidating the existing global financial order. Business is better than usual for bankers now, largely backed by government guarantees and central bank largesse. There was some tinkering at the margins of the traditional banking system. Banks were told by regulators to hold more capital against their risk-taking. But very little was done to curb risk-taking, or to regulate the newly expansive shadow banking system. Now, backed by the world’s most powerful governments and central banks, globalised private financial institutions are too big to fail and their bosses too big to jail. So, no, the world is not safe. To make the world safe will require democratically elected governments to take responsibility for managing the now globalised financial system, instead of leaving management of that system to invisible, self-regulating and self-interested players in global capital markets. Of greatest importance is the management of cross-border capital flows, the exchange rate, credit creation and the rate of interest applied across the spectrum of loans. Until democratically accountable regulators manage cross-border flows, it will not be possible to tax global corporations that operate beyond the remit of regulatory democracy. Until central banks manage exchange rates, volatility and financial and trade imbalances will continue to plague governments. Until credit creation is managed and directed at productive, not speculative activity – then expect unpayable levels of debt to inflate. Unless central banks take responsibility for management of the rate of interest across the spectrum of lending, expect entrepreneurs to find borrowing for productive, long-term investment unaffordable. Keynes taught these lessons after the Great Depression. To prevent another crisis, bring back the monetary theory and policies of Keynes. • Ann Pettifor is director of Prime: Policy Research in Macroeconomics and a fellow of the New Economics Foundation Mark Littlewood: Regulators are refighting the last war, not planning for the next Politicians and regulators seem to have learned two lessons from the crash: that the cause was an unregulated financial services market; and that we should be trying to make banks safe from as much risk as humanly possible. This seems to drive them towards a worldview that, instead of a vibrant and competitive financial services sector, we should be trying to preserve the current system in aspic. First, the idea that the financial services sector was some sort of unregulated wild west prior to 2008 is derisory. Even during the Thatcher years financial regulation was constantly being toughened, and becoming more complex. Since the crash, this has gotten worse, with an estimated 50,000 new regulations added across the G20, and the EU’s MiFID II regulations alone adding 1.5m paragraphs. The idea that even large firms or regulators can understand every element of these new regulations is laughable. But more than the scale of the regulation is the way that it is targeted. Regulators have been spending most of their time dealing with higher bank capital requirements, but not looking at how the overall financial services sector could be protected from the failure of individual banks. There will never be a time when businesses do not fail. It is the essence of capitalism, and without it a market system cannot operate. In their efforts to create a “safe” banking system, regulators (like generals) are focusing on refighting the last war rather than planning for the next. One day there will be another bank failure. Instead of worrying about how we can make banks safer, policymakers need to be putting in place a regulatory environment that means that when these inevitable bank failures occur, they can fail safely. The shareholders and employees of the bank should feel the consequences. A single bank failure should never be a systemic risk. • Mark Littlewood is director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs David Blanchflower: Central bankers’ credibility is shot Ten years ago Lehman Brothers failed and everything went downhill from there. But the event was a symptom, not the cause. When I was on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC), I started voting for rate cuts in October 2007 when bank rate was 5.75% as the signs of financial collapse were all around. The failure of Lehman wasn’t exactly a surprise given the prior collapses of Bear Stearns, Countrywide and Northern Rock. Banks that depended on wholesale money markets for cash had been in trouble for a while. We now know that the US had been in recession since December 2007 and the UK and most European countries since the spring of 2008. Central bankers were caught flat-footed as they were focused on inflation which was high because of a spike in oil prices. That turned out to be a major error. It remains unclear whether or not economic forecasters will spot the next downturn before the event. Central banks have been forecasting a pickup in wage inflation and productivity every month since 2008, which hasn’t happened. Their belief in reversion to the pre-recession mean has been laughable. Their credibility is shot. By the spring of 2008, US consumer and business confidence had collapsed – as had real consumption and retail. House prices and activity including housing starts and permits to build had tumbled. The UK had seen exactly the same with a lag of a few months. Concerns were expressed in 2008 that there was a wage explosion coming, but there wasn’t. Mark Carney and the current MPC keep telling us that a wage explosion is upon us – but real wages haven’t risen for the last two years. Same old same old. Real wages in the UK are 6% below their September 2008 levels. Banks are in better shape, but policymakers have few weapons to deal with the next crisis. Negative rates and lots of quantitative easing are on the horizon. Fiscal policy may not come to the rescue given the politics. The downside risks to growth seem huge from both Brexit and a possible trade war. In short, not much has been learned in a decade. Oh dear. • David Blanchflower was an external member of the monetary policy committee at the Bank of England from June 2006 to May 2009 Olli Rehn: Debt makes the global economy vulnerable to future shocks The recent dangerous trends of populism and protectionism have their breeding ground in the global financial crisis. This is why we need to identify the right lessons from the crisis, and act accordingly. This work is far from complete. From my experience in the eurozone financial fire brigade, the foremost lesson is just how vital financial stability is for the whole macroeconomy, including growth and employment. This fact was neglected before the crisis. As a result, we Europeans paid a bitter price in the form of a double-dip recession – and a huge number of people have endured years of unemployment. The difficulties were amplified by the two-way doom loop between the creditworthiness of banks and sovereigns. To counter this, the banking union was launched in 2012. Since then, significant progress has been made by creating euro-area bodies for bank supervision and resolution. Euro-area banks are now more resilient as their capital buffers have been doubled from the pre-crisis 8% to today’s 16%. Public finances of the member states have also been much improved. In the euro area, the key priority now should be completing the banking union with common deposit insurance and strengthening the European stability mechanism. At the same time, the US and the UK should protect their regulatory achievements. It would be a big mistake to roll back what was achieved in the post-crisis years. There is much talk about “normalisation”, especially in monetary policy. But the word itself is misleading as it suggests a return to some past state of affairs. I would prefer to talk about a journey towards a new equilibrium, which should be more sustainable, equitable and resilient than the old one. On that journey, a key worry at the global level is the now apparent dependence of growth on the accumulation of even more debt. Debt accumulation makes the global economy and all of its parts increasingly vulnerable to any future shock. This suggests that the rebalancing of the world economy is far from complete, a necessary condition for sustainable growth and better employment, the ultimate goals of economic policy. • Olli Rehn was European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs and the euro from 2009 to 2014 Nicky Morgan: The toxic culture of the banking industry must change Since the financial crisis 10 years ago, the banking sector has become significantly better capitalised, and the largest players are much less dependent on one another for funding. Yet in many ways, this still-concentrated sector looks remarkably similar to the one that threatened to bring the global economy to its knees. One of the roles of the Treasury committee is to look under the bonnet of the financial services sector to shine a light on any of its shortcomings. The committee concluded in 2009 that the bonus culture was partly to blame for the banking crisis. The toxic culture that existed in certain corners of the industry was exposed very vividly by the crisis. Public trust in banking duly waned. The changes introduced in the aftermath of the crisis, including those targeting remuneration and incentives, represent a step in the right direction. The senior managers and certification regime, too, should ensure that those guilty of misconduct are held personally accountable. Ultimately it is for the general public themselves to decide whether the industry and policymakers have done enough to restore trust in financial services, but memories of the recklessness that precipitated the crash will not fade overnight. While reductions in bonuses can be quantified, changes to other aspects of culture are more difficult to measure. In our report on women in the finance industry, the Treasury committee concluded that an alpha-male culture is still prevalent in finance, and that it remains a deterrent for women seeking to progress in the sector. The benefits of greater diversity include better financial performance and reduced groupthink, with the latter flagged by many as a key contributor to the crisis of a decade ago. Policymakers have been busy over the last 10 years: now the industry itself must prove that things have changed. Until the public is confident that the sector’s cultural flaws have been rectified, trust in banking will remain low. • Nicky Morgan is the Conservative MP for Loughborough and chair of the Commons Treasury committee Micah White: The collapse was a social crisis – and unlike the economic crisis, it has never stopped Implicit in the question of whether the world has learned the lesson from the collapse of Lehman Brothers is the sense that the economic crisis of 2008 was punishment for a collective misdeed. The underlying logic is that the crisis was avoidable and, moreover, should have been avoided. That it happened is treated as retribution, evidence of our societal wrongdoing and a global wake-up call to change our behaviour. But 10 years later, when we seek to identify exactly what that wrongdoing was, so that we may judge if we have appropriately changed, there seems to be no clear consensus. Or rather the answers that are given are entirely unsatisfying. The solution to this dangerous ignorance is not as simple as continuing to question economists, policymakers or corporate CEOs. I wish it were. I respect their expertise. This is not a kneejerk rejection of educated elites. Instead, although the collapse of Lehman Brothers was ostensibly part of an economic crisis, I believe that the real cause is elsewhere. Beyond being an economic crisis, the collapse of 2008 was a social crisis. It was a great revealing of the deeply immoral financial arrangement of our societies, the criminal ineptitude of our regulators, the disastrous corruption of our democracies by money. What broke in 2008 wasn’t primarily the economy: it was the people’s faith in the reigning world order. The economy has been fixed somewhat but this faith has not been restored. This social crisis, unlike the economic crisis, never stopped – everything we’re experiencing on the global political stage today, from the rise of social movements beginning with Occupy Wall Street to the clamorous appearance of ethno-nationalist populism, is a symptom of the unresolved social crisis of 2008. What remains to be done is obviously a revolution that transforms global governance. Both left and right increasingly agree about that. So I suppose from that perspective, yes, the world has learned the most important lesson from 2008. • Micah White is co-creator of Occupy Wall Street and author of The End of Protest: A New Playbook for Revolution",Lehman Brothers; Banking; Business; Financial crisis; Financial sector; World news; Economics; Credit crunch; Market turmoil; Global economy; Stock markets; UK news,Opinion
2018-03-14T06:00:04Z,Want to save your job and make more money? Buy out your boss | Aditya Chakrabortty,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/workers-bosses-new-economics-series-employee-ownership,"It had all been going so well. In this smoothest of seductions, John Clark and Alistair Miller hadn’t had to do a thing. There they were, itching to sell their business and get on with retirement. Then one day in the middle of 2015, this American firm – big-time, way out of their league – swung by the factory outside Glasgow and asked: what price do you have in mind? This was followed by an invitation back to the multinational’s European headquarters in the home counties. So off popped Miller. The two sides were inching towards the dotted line when he casually inquired what the Americans would do with their new Scottish premises. This one question sent the needle screeching across the record. As soon as the managing director across the desk started talking about “exploring possibilities” and “transferable technologies”, Miller knew what she meant. Their Scottish operation would run for another six months, a year tops. Then it would be shut – and the order book and the technology shifted down south. And when the factory disappeared, so too would the jobs and the livelihoods of 60-odd workers and their families. Selling up would hand the owners a huge cheque, and leave their staff on a tiny giro. “You’d be sitting back with your piles of cash,” says Clark, “but at some point you’re going to bump into those guys. Some of them have been there longer than me. I know their families.” “Those guys” helped to build this place. Since its launch in 1986, Novograf has gone from printing signs for vans to working with some of the biggest chains in Britain. It has become expert in the branding that envelops you while shopping, eating or holidaying, but which you never take in. Walk around a Co-op supermarket, and the signs guiding you to the wine and beer or fruit and veg aisles will be Novograf’s. Pop into a Pizza Hut and the wood-look flooring will have been made and laid by Novograf employees. Stay at an Ibis Styles hotel and the big fat number on your room door probably comes from their East Kilbride factory. Then there’s Greggs, Iceland, Tesco, Waitrose … Miller and Clark hadn’t poured six decades of their combined lives into this venture only to leave a plump carcass for others to feed on. But the two sixtysomethings had run smack into one of the central problems of British capitalism: how to ensure a company’s owners look after it. Pretty much any spiv with a chequebook can buy a business in the UK and ruin it as they want. Westminster will ask few questions, expect even less accountability, and never learn any lessons. That fanatical British adherence to open markets and property rights leaves the staff, the suppliers and the public counting for little. The publisher of Horny Housewives, Richard Desmond, bought the Express stable in 2000 without New Labour ministers raising an eyebrow. A once-great paper was wrecked and hundreds of journalists lost their jobs, but Desmond pocketed nearly £350m before he sold it to Trinity Mirror this year. In 2005, Manchester United football club was snapped up by the Glazer family, who paid for it by borrowing hundreds of millions that they loaded on to the club’s balance sheet – before shifting its headquarters to the tax haven of the Cayman Islands, a 10,000-mile round trip from the club’s Old Trafford stadium. Philip Green may strip BHS bare; Cadbury can be ravaged by Kraft; Australian investment bank Macquarie can run Thames Water into the ground then, as a reward, get the public’s Green Investment Bank. Each time owners damage a business, employees and often customers get shafted, and local economies suffer – while a handful right at the top cash in. But Miller and Clark can tell you how much depends on the simple fact of ownership. It helps shape the business model, the ethos and culture of a company. However, even as they tried to secure a careful owner for their business, all the plausible options were a no-go. Sell to a rival? Their staff and values would be discarded like used wrapping paper. Cash out to private equity? A green light for a corporate ransacking. Neither man’s children wanted to trudge in their dad’s footsteps, and senior management were not in a position to buy them out. Just then, a postcard flopped on to the doormat. “Thinking of exiting your business?” it asked. When the man from Scottish Enterprise, an agency of the Holyrood government, told them about worker ownership, he got blank faces. The biggest employee-owned firm in the UK, John Lewis, was a Novograf customer, yet all Clark knew about its structure was that once a year the company would be on the news for paying “partners” a tax-free bonus. Which was lovely, Clark and Miller thought, but what did that have to do with them? Employee ownership is as simple as selling a company to its staff. Over 300 British firms have done it, from Arup architects to Waitrose. But it is as radical as giving the people who create a business’s wealth the right to share in it. That wealth is no longer handed over to remote shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. When Clark and Miller “got off our butts” and visited a few of the 95 Scottish firms now owned by their employees, “we learned that their productivity was higher, that they were more resilient in bad times, that they were more inclusive of all their staff”. Giving workers control over their companies doesn’t just make the firms more successful, it also makes the workers a lot better off. Last year, the California-based National Center for Employee Ownership analysed US jobs figures and found that younger workers who are worker-owners enjoy 33% higher wages and 92% higher median household wealth than those who aren’t owners. The British government knows much of this, because it commissioned a report that told it so. The very first line of Graeme Nuttall’s 2012 review reads: “Employee ownership is a great idea.” After lobbying by Liberal Democrat ministers, two years later chancellor George Osborne scrapped capital gains tax for employers who transferred a majority share of their business to workers. This was back when Osborne and David Cameron would hymn “the John Lewis model”. Just like “the march of the makers” and the “big society”, the fad has left little trace. Of the 2,617 full-time equivalent civil servants at the Department for Business, not one is dedicated to promoting worker ownership, as advised by the Nuttall review. The same report also recommends “the appointment of a minister responsible for promoting employee ownership across government”. Yet this department confirmed to me that not even its most junior minister holds any such brief. That silence partly explains why employee ownership remains so exotic. When Clark and Miller announced their idea for selling the company to their staff, they hired a local hotel, put on fancy nibbles and gave a great presentation. “The very first question we got was, ‘Have we still got a job?’” remembers Clark. “Nobody had a clue what it meant,” recalls factory technician David Anderson. “People assumed that everyone was going to have to get a mortgage to buy the company.” Four hundred miles north of Whitehall, the far smaller Scottish Enterprise employs eight full-time staffers to promote and advise on worker ownership and other “inclusive models” of organising companies. The SNP government is full-square behind it, and the Herald, the Record and the Scotsman newspapers trumpet this Isle of Arran holiday resort or that Hebridean jewellers being taken over by its employees. Just two decades ago, newly devolved Holyrood paid through the nose for inward investment and prayed that the multinationals would repay their lavish subsidies with lasting jobs. They rarely did. Hewlett Packard, Chunghwa Picture Tubes and many others pulled the corporate equivalent of a one-night stand. Holyrood can still relapse – such as when it gifted Amazon £2.5m of taxpayers’ money and got back a distribution warehouse in Dunfermline. But Scottish Enterprise’s Sarah Deas talks of fostering a Mittelstand – a German-style dense network of medium-sized businesses that think long term and honour their social obligations. Which is a reminder that British business is not some political monolith – that it can break left as well as right. White-haired Clark is appalled at “the FTSE guys”, the chief executives paid 100 times the average wage of their workers. “What are they doing to deserve that?” Clark is not, he says, “some paternalistic capitalist” or a “crusader”. He’s “hardnosed”, and with Miller got a fair price for Novograf. But they’ve also taken big risks to ensure their workers could afford it. It proved impossible to raise cash upfront for the purchase price. “Not one of the major banks was interested. Not even our own.” So Clark and Miller turned themselves into a bank – handing over the company shares while allowing employees to pay them back over a few years, with interest. And with conditions: as long as the pair retain an interest in the firm it cannot relocate more than 200 miles away, “because that would defeat the entire purpose of the deal”. At the end of 2016, all the shares in the company were transferred from the two original owners into a trust held on behalf of all staff. Just over a year later, the all-new, same-old Novograf still feels eggshelly, as if everyone is trying to gauge what’s changed. Its new managing director, Jennifer Riddell-Dillet, has to tell employees: “Remember you’re an owner.” She both manages and works for her staff, one of whom sat on the panel that interviewed her for the job. Novografers like to tell you that this isn’t “some socialist paradise”, that there are still bosses and workers; but the priorities have changed. Formerly a senior manager for two PLCs, Riddell-Dillet says: “Public companies are only about external shareholders. There, employees are the asset of the business – but they’re a sweatable asset. Here, you think, ‘If I just drive them into the ground it will be less fulfilling, less rewarding and it will be more ruthless.’” Everyone received a decent tax-free bonus last year, and also took part in the first-ever staff survey, which led to sick pay and leave entitlement becoming more generous. Anderson, a Novograf lifer, says: “The people on the factory floor definitely feel more in control than before. Anybody can now say, ‘I don’t see why things have to be done that way’ – and someone’s got to answer.” That power requires some growing into. Production manager Michael Carr has become a director of Novograf, and has struggled to get his head around the accounts. And with no previous experience, Anderson and business development manager Margaret Nelson now make up half the trustee board. The other two trustees will be Miller and Clark, until they’re finally paid off. “It’s obvious that they know what they’re talking about and we don’t,” says Nelson. “Challenging your old boss is an intimidating thing.” But employees will challenge on their expert subject: their daily work. Just last week, an employee showed Carr a cheaper and quicker way of assembling signs. They would never have spoken up before, he says, yet that one simple thing could save “a few thousand pounds in man-hours and material”. In its first full year of employee ownership, Novograf’s sales shot up 20% and the company took on an extra 22 people. That success followed on from a strong performance in 2016, but Riddell-Dillet reckons their direct stake in the outcome did drive employees to put in “the blood, sweat and tears”. Not all the savings are strictly necessary. Not so long ago, now-chairman John Clark, while washing his hands in the gents, reached over to the soap dispenser. He remembers a thin jet of lotion flying out – “Whoosh ... it hit me amidships” – all over his stomach. He charged over to the man responsible for ordering in supplies and told him the new soap was far too thin.
