Flint, who has chaired the recently rebranded fund manager since 2019, said “ridiculously extravagant claims” had been made by some companies, which were driven by a mindset that their job was “not really about investing money: we’re just jolly good people and we’re saving the world”. Flint, who also chaired HSBC between 2010 and 2017, told a City of London net zero conference on Monday that those claims may have been over-egged, in a way that put them at legal risk, particularly in the US. “Our industry then made a kind of huge mistake. It became a marketing thing: let’s tell everyone we’re saving the world, we’re saving the planet,” he said, in comments first reported by the Financial Times. The legal risks have risen in recent months after a severe drop in support for ESG issues in the US. Rightwing activists and politicians have targeted financial companies for supporting climate policies, having been emboldened by policymakers in Trump’s administration, which pushed for a resurgence in oil and gas production. The ESG backlash has spooked some companies, worried that they could be targeted by lawsuits and blacklisting that could harm their US business. Even before Trump took office in November, Texas added NatWest to a growing list of companies accused of boycotting its oil industry, in a move that threatened the UK bank’s business with the US state. For others, the ESG backlash has provided an opportunity to scrap international green initiatives that some bosses claim make their businesses less competitive. High-profile investors including BlackRock and State Street have cancelled membership in voluntary schemes such as the Climate Action 100+ group in recent months. Although US companies have led the charge in dropping ESG commitments, there are growing fears that UK investors could follow suit, meaning there will be less pressure on publicly listed companies, whose shares they hold, to reduce their carbon footprints. That could be compounded by a potential watering down of the Labour party’s manifesto pledge to ensure that FTSE 100 companies – as well the City’s banks, asset managers, insurers and pension funds – adopt “credible” climate transition plans in line with the Paris agreement’s pledge to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. Last week, a consultation on those rules showed the government was exploring less rigorous rules as part of a drive to cut red tape and compliance costs. One of the options being considered would mean the government “will not require an entity to have a discrete transition plan or to set climate targets in line with a particular climate goal”. “The focus remains on the impact of the environment and climate on business profits, not the impact of business on the planet,” Mark Cliffe, a visiting fellow at the Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter, said. “Given the lack of clarity on the government’s own climate plans, let alone the backtracking in the US and elsewhere, this is likely to lead to further backsliding on businesses’ commitments to climate action.” Last week, a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said the government was “committed to making the UK the sustainable finance capital of the world. “The consultation we have launched seeks stakeholder views on a range of approaches to transition plans, including on climate alignment, as part of our commitment to take forward the manifesto commitment in full.”",Financial sector; Corporate governance; Business; Environment; UK news,Business
2025-05-18T06:00:26Z,Revealed: European ‘green’ investments hold billions in fossil fuel majors,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/18/revealed-european-green-investments-hold-billions-in-fossil-fuel-majors,"European “green” funds holding more than $33bn of investments in major oil and gas companies have been revealed by an investigation, despite fossil fuels being the root cause of the climate crisis. Some of these investment funds used branding such as Sustainable Global Stars and Europe Climate Pathway. Over $18bn was invested in the five biggest polluters: TotalEnergies, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP. These topped a 2023 Carbon Majors ranking for oil and gas production among shareholder-owned firms. Other investments by funds following EU sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) included those in US fracking company Devon Energy and Canadian tar sands company Suncor, the investigation by Voxeurop and the Guardian found. Investors claim that holding a stake in a company allows them to influence the firm’s pursuit of climate goals. However, no major oil and gas producer has plans consistent with international climate targets and many companies have weakened their plans in the last year, according to a report from Carbon Tracker in April. The investment firms with the biggest stakes in fossil companies in their green funds were JP Morgan, BlackRock and DWS in Germany. The investment companies have not breached the SFDR rules, which do not explicitly rule out some fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said change was needed to avoid people being misled. “For a fund claiming to be ‘green’, holding investments in major fossil fuel companies should be a red line,” said Giorgia Ranzato, sustainable finance manager at Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E). “Since oil majors are not contributing meaningfully to the energy transition, any investment in such companies by a green fund is essentially greenwashing. To effectively combat this, T&amp;E and other organisations advocate for a meaningful review of the SFDR. “It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies,” said Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute. A BlackRock spokesperson said: “BlackRock’s funds are managed in accordance with their investment objectives, that are clearly disclosed in each fund’s prospectus and on BlackRock’s website. Our sustainable funds are managed in line with applicable regulations governing sustainable investing. For investors that have decarbonisation investment objectives we offer a range of products that provide such exposure.” After being contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for asset manager Robeco said its Sustainable Global Stars fund would remove “sustainable” from its name. A spokesperson said the fund had a 20% better CO2 footprint than the market index and that the firm had “productive and intensive engagement” with TotalEnergies. The investigation analysed the ownership in the last quarter of 2024 of the publicly traded fossil fuel companies listed in the Carbon Majors report, using the London Stock Exchange Group Data &amp; Analytics platform. It found $33.5bn held by green funds in 37 large fossil fuel companies. The fossil fuel investments were in funds regulated under SFDR rules, specifically articles 8 and 9, which respectively deal with the promotion of “environmental or social” goals and “sustainable investments”. More than 480 investment companies had these types of investments, which included stocks in fossil fuel companies. The investigation also found more than $1bn of shares in the five fossil fuel giants in funds using green keywords in their title in March 2025: A Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) fund called Europe Climate Pathway had $88m invested in Shell, BP and TotalEnergies. In total, LGIM held $210m in “green” funds. The Robeco Sustainable Global Stars fund had $40m in TotalEnergies. Overall, Robeco held $207m in these funds. Another fund, a State Street product called World ESG had $43m in combined investment in all five of the oil majors. ESG is a label for funds promoting environmental, social and governance goals. In total, State Street Global Advisors UK held $243m in the “green” funds. The financial institutions with the biggest fossil fuel stakes in their article 8 and 9 funds and those using green keywords were JP Morgan Asset Management and its UK subsidiary with $3.2bn, DWS in Germany with $2.2bn and BlackRock Investment Management UK and BlackRock Advisors UK with a combined $1.7bn. The SFDR regulations were not originally intended to be used in marketing but the classifications have been used to showcase a financial product’s environmental credentials. This has remained the case even after the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) called for sweeping reforms to tackle greenwashing and published tighter guidelines in August 2024 for the use of sustainability and ESG-related terms in fund names. The new guidelines include “transition” funds, where managers should demonstrate the investments are on a “clear and measurable path to social or environmental transition”. The deadline for application of the new guidelines is 21 May. BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management announced in March and April respectively that they would remove words such as sustainable and ESG from some fund names. Campaigners said they could have acted sooner. JP Morgan, DWS, LGIM and State Street all declined requests to comment. The guidelines are not legally binding but from 21 May national financial regulators will be able to require companies to report publicly whether their products comply with the rules and could choose to sanction any guideline breaches. Paul Schreiber at Reclaim Finance said: “We need strict rules that ban investments in companies developing fossil fuels from any fund with an ESG-related description. This is precisely what the SFDR failed to do. In this context, the review of the regulations must include strict fossil fuel exclusions covering all fund categories.” An Esma spokesperson said: “Our focus is on supporting [national authorities] to implement the current guidelines, as they are only becoming applicable to existing funds on 21 May. In the future, if needed, we will evaluate the possibility of changes to the guidelines together with competent authorities, also bearing in mind potential developments in the review of the SFDR.” TotalEnergies has said the company supports the objectives of the Paris Agreement and that its strategy is consistent with a global temperature rise of less than 2C. Shell declined to comment, while other fossil fuel companies did not respond to requests for comment.

2025-06-17T06:00:41Z,"World’s largest banks pledged $869bn to fossil fuel firms in 2024, new report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/17/world-banks-fossil-fuel-finance-2024,"The world’s largest banks boosted the amount of financing given to fossil fuel companies last year, committing $869bn to those involved in coal, oil and gas despite the worsening climate crisis and the banks’ own, fraying, environmental commitments, a new report has found. The report, compiled by a coalition of eight green groups, shows that while the amount loaned by big banks to fossil fuel firms had been declining in 2021, last year saw an abrupt reversal. Two-thirds of the world’s largest 65 banks increased their fossil fuel financing by $162bn from 2023 to 2024. Scientists have been clear that no new fossil fuel project can proceed if disastrous climate impacts are to be avoided, with last year the hottest ever recorded amid a slew of disasters driven by global heating. However, many banks have recently watered down or ditched their own commitments to help reduce planet-heating emissions, amid a changing political dynamic that has seen the US again being led by Donald Trump, who has famously called climate science “a giant hoax” and “bullshit”. In February, the US treasury withdrew from a global banking network that aims to increase green finance and reduce climate risk. Four of the five largest fossil fuel financiers last year were American companies, with JPMorgan Chase lending the most at $53.5bn. Bank of America was second, followed by Citigroup. The Japanese bank Mizuho Financial was fourth, with Wells Fargo in fifth. The largest absolute increases in fossil fuel lending last year came from the top American institutions as well as Barclays, the British bank. In the decade since the world’s political leaders committed, in the landmark Paris climate agreement, to restrain dangerous global heating, the biggest banks have continued to pour lending towards drilling projects, pipelines and other fossil fuel activity. In total, banks have financed fossil fuels by $7.9tn since the Paris deal. “By injecting a staggering $869bn into fossil fuel financing in 2024 alone, the world’s largest banks fund the climate chaos that fossil fuel companies wreak on people and communities worldwide,” said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International and a co-author of the report. “Governments must step in and take urgent action to hold financial institutions accountable for their role in the climate crisis.” While most of the world’s top financial firms have pledged to abide by the Paris deal and help tackle the climate crisis, many of them have ignored or walked back these promises in the past year while predicting catastrophic global temperature rises. Last year, six US senators said that JPMorgan Chase may have misled investors by backtracking on its climate commitments. Then, in January, shortly before the inauguration of Trump as US president, the six largest American banks – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – all withdrew from the net zero banking alliance. The alliance is a United Nations-sponsored initiative to spur banks to align their lending and investment portfolios with the Paris goals. It requires banks to set targets and reduce emissions associated with their investments. “This year, banks have shown their true colors – many have walked away from climate commitments and doubled down on financing fossil fuel expansion, even as global temperatures break records,” said Lucie Pinson, director and founder at Reclaim Finance, and another report co-author. “A few European banks may have inched forward, but for most, the lure of dirty money has proven too strong.” The Guardian contacted all of the top lenders to fossil fuels about the report, which is called Banking on Climate Chaos. A Citi spokesperson said that it supports the “transition to a low-carbon economy and, in 2021, made a commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas financed emissions by 2050. “We work with our clients as they seek to decarbonize their businesses and support clean energy solutions as part of our $1tn sustainable finance goal. Our approach reflects the need to transition while also continuing to meet global needs for energy security, particularly in this time of increasing electricity demand.” A Barclays spokesperson said: “Barclays provides finance to meet consumer and businesses energy needs while financing the scaling of clean energy. Last year, we mobilised nearly $100bn more Sustainable and Transition Finance than in 2023 and continue to invest £500m in climate tech start-ups by 2027. These are significant interventions to support our clients to transition.” ENDS",Business; Banking; JP Morgan; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Fossil fuels; Coal; Gas; Oil and gas companies; Energy; Energy industry,Business
2025-05-21T05:00:18Z,"EU’s ‘chocolate crisis’ worsened by climate breakdown, researchers warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/21/eu-chocolate-climate-breakdown-crisis-report,"Climate breakdown and wildlife loss are deepening the EU’s “chocolate crisis”, a report has argued, with cocoa one of six key commodities to come mostly from countries vulnerable to environmental threats. More than two-thirds of the cocoa, coffee, soy, rice, wheat and maize brought into the EU in 2023 came from countries that are not well prepared for climate change, according to the UK consultants Foresight Transitions. For three of the commodities – cocoa, wheat and maize – two-thirds of imports came from countries whose biodiversity was deemed not to be intact, the analysis found. The researchers said the damage to food production by climate breakdown was made worse by a decline in biodiversity that has left farms less resilient. “These aren’t just abstract threats,” said the lead author of the report, Camilla Hyslop. “They are already playing out in ways that negatively affect businesses and jobs, as well as the availability and price of food for consumers, and they are only getting worse.” The researchers mapped trade data from Eurostat on to two rankings of environmental security to assess the level of exposure for three staple foods and three critical inputs into the EU’s food system. They used a ranking of climate readiness from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which combines a country’s vulnerability to climate damages with its access to financial and institutional support, and a ranking of biodiversity intactness from the UK Natural History Museum, which compares the current abundance of wild species to pre-modern levels. They found the majority of imports came from countries they ranked “low-medium” on the climate scale and “low-medium” or “medium” on the biodiversity scale. Some food products were particularly exposed. The EU imported 90% of its maize from countries with low-medium climate readiness and 67% from countries with medium or lower biodiversity intactness, the report found. For cocoa, a key ingredient in the chocolate industry that Europe does not grow itself, the import exposure was 96.5% for climate preparedness and 77% on the biodiversity scale, the report found. The industry is already struggling with rises in the price of sugar, driven in part by extreme weather events, and supply shortages of cocoa. Most of its cocoa comes from west African countries facing overlapping climate and biodiversity risks. The report, which was commissioned by the European Climate Foundation, argued that large chocolate manufacturers should invest in climate adaptation and biodiversity protection in cocoa-growing countries. “This is not an act of altruism or ESG [sustainable finance], but rather a vital derisking exercise for supply chains,” the authors wrote. “Ensuring farmers are in their supply chains paid a fair price for their produce would allow them to invest in the resilience of their own farms.” Paul Behrens, an environmental researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a textbook on food and sustainability, who was not involved in the research, said the findings painted an “extremely worrying picture” for food resilience. “Policymakers like to think of the EU as food-secure because it produces quite a lot of its own food,” he said. “But what this report shows is that the EU is vulnerable to climate and biodiversity risks in some vital food supply chains.” The report found coffee, rice and soy had fewer risks overall but noted hotspots of concern. Uganda, which provided 10% of the EU’s coffee in 2023, had low climate preparedness and low-medium biodiversity intactness, the report found. Joseph Nkandu, founder of the National Union of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises in Uganda, called for more access to international climate finance to help farmers become more resilient in the face of worsening weather. “The weather in Uganda is no longer predictable,” he said. “Heatwaves, prolonged dry spells and erratic rains are withering our coffee bushes and damaging production.” Marco Springmann, a food researcher at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said a shift to healthier and more sustainable diets would be needed for food systems to withstand climate shocks. “About a third of grains and basically all imported soy is used to feed animals,” he said. “Aiming to make those supply chains more resilient therefore misses the point that this supports the very products that are to a large degree responsible for what is being tried to protect from.”",Climate crisis; Environment; European Union; Chocolate; Europe; World news; Food; Biodiversity; Uganda; Coffee; Africa; Food security,Environment
2024-06-25T06:00:06Z,EU-regulated ‘sustainable’ funds invest £14bn in biggest polluters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/eu-regulated-sustainable-funds-invest-14bn-in-biggest-polluters,"Fast fashion labels, fossil fuel companies and SUV-makers are present in EU-regulated “sustainable” funds that tout their ethical credentials in their names, the Guardian and media partners can reveal, with $18bn (£14bn) of their investments going to the 200 biggest polluters. Investors hold more than $87bn (£68bn) in funds that disclose under environmental and social sections of EU sustainable finance rules while including some of the biggest emitters of planet-heating gas, an analysis of data from the last quarter of 2023 shows. About one-fifth of the $87bn investments come from funds that also market themselves using environmentally-friendly terms. Campaigners have called for tighter rules on labelling, arguing that the current system confuses investors and means ordinary people unwittingly contribute to climate breakdown. “Pension savers and the general public are being misled when it comes to sustainable finance,” said Lara Cuvelier, a sustainable investment campaigner at Reclaim Finance. The investigation, led by Voxeurop in partnership with the Guardian and other media partners, identified the 25 biggest polluters in each of the eight most carbon-intensive sectors and tracked investments from funds that disclose under the EU’s sustainable finance directive. The bulk of investments into the 200 biggest polluters came from funds classified under article 8, which promotes environmental or social goals, with a further $2bn coming from funds classified under article 9, whose main objective is sustainable investment. The regulations were not designed for marketing purposes but the classifications are often used to showcase a financial product’s environmental credentials. This month the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European banking and insurance watchdogs called for sweeping reforms to the system to tackle greenwashing. “Status as ‘article 8’ or ‘article 9’ products have been used since the outset in marketing material as ‘quality labels’ for sustainability, consequently posing greenwashing and mis-selling risks,” the watchdogs said. They called instead for simpler product categories that are clearer to investors. Campaigners have criticised the scale of the misuse. The analysis found that $11.7bn of investments into the biggest polluters came from funds whose name included “ESG” – environmental, social and governance – while $1.1bn came from funds whose names included climate-specific words such as “clean”, “transition”, “net zero” and “Paris”. The latter two terms refer to the Paris climate agreement that world leaders signed in 2015 to try to stop the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels by the end of the century – a task that entails slashing pollution fast to hit net zero emissions by 2050. Despite this, the top 10 recipients of EU-regulated green funds include fossil fuel companies drilling for more oil and carmakers selling ever bigger vehicles, the analysis found. “Europe’s biggest green portfolios are just the same dirty companies, repackaged as sustainable,” said Xavier Sol, the sustainable finance director at the campaign group Transport and Environment. “We need private capital to accelerate the green transition rather than hinder it,” he added. “Only investments earmarked for green activities should be given a sustainable label.” The ESMA adopted an updated set of guidelines last month that prohibits funds with significant fossil fuel investments from marketing themselves as green. The rules, which will come into effect later this year, are not legally binding, and national regulators can choose to ignore them. Cuvelier said regulators had so far only shown investors the carrot, and not the stick. “We’re seeing now that it’s not enough,” she said. The analysis also found one-quarter of the investments into big polluters came from just 10 asset managers. Several of them said they complied with the EU’s regulatory framework and would update policies if they were to change. They challenged the claim that their investments conflicted with climate goals. Amundi said: “The energy transition will only happen if all economic players change. Amundi therefore has a duty to support and encourage the transformation of all companies and sectors.” Intesa Sanpaolo said: “Investments in high-carbon sectors do not conflict with either the SFDR [sustainable finance disclosure regulation] goals of transparency in sustainability investments, or with the Paris agreement, which promotes a transition to a low-carbon economy.” Fidelity said: “As active stewards of capital, we believe that fostering change through a positive engagement approach rather than exclusion (or disinvestment) policy is the most effective way to positively influence corporate behaviour.” Experts are divided on the benefits of excluding big polluters from investment funds. Campaigners have argued that divesting from fossil fuel companies reduces their share prices and makes it harder to get loans for new projects – pressing them to go green faster. Others have cautioned that the financial consequences for the companies are small – particularly for profitable oil and gas firms that do not need to issue new shares to finance their operations – and that divestment campaigns are more useful in challenging their “social licence to operate” rather than hitting their bottom line. “Decarbonisation is such a massive task that establishing a small ‘green niche’ of sustainable investment funds on its own will contribute very little,” said Jan Fichtner, a sustainable finance research fellow at the University of Witten/Herdecke. “EU rules should focus much more on setting credible and binding minimum standards for proxy voting and private engagements – for sustainable funds but also for conventional funds.” This article is part of an investigation coordinated by Voxeurop and European Investigative Collaborations with the support of the Bertha Challenge fellowship.

2025-06-26T04:00:50Z,"EU rollback on environmental policy is gaining momentum, warn campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/26/eu-rollback-on-environmental-policy-deregulation-european-green-deal,"The European Union’s rollback of environment policy is gaining momentum, campaigners have warned, in a deregulation drive that has shocked observers with its scale and speed. EU policymakers have dealt several critical blows to their much-vaunted European Green Deal since the end of 2023, when opinion polls suggested a significant rightward shift before the 2024 parliamentary elections. Environment groups say the pace has picked up under the competition-focused agenda of the new European Commission. The most striking examples are the “omnibus” packages that water down sustainable finance rules, some of which have been put on hold even before they came into force, and which member states proposed diluting further on Monday. The European Commission has promised more simplification measures to “radically lighten the regulatory load” on people and businesses. In the first six months of the new European Commission mandate, the EU also delayed a law to stop deforestation in supply chains by one year, gave carmakers two extra years to meet pollution targets and downgraded the protection status of the wolf. Environmental NGOs have found themselves in the crosshairs of a funding freeze they argue undermines democracy. The political tensions reached a high this week after an anti-greenwashing law was seemingly killed in the final stages of negotiations. The warnings of green backsliding come amid a global slump in efforts to cut pollution. In the UK, the government has faced growing political resistance to its target to hit net zero by 2050. In the US, Donald Trump has begun his second term with a series of attacks on environment agencies and policies as he seeks to promote fossil fuels. “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!” he told the US Department of Energy in a social media post on Monday. “And I mean NOW!!! Green groups say similar – albeit less sensational – shifts are under way in Brussels, which boasts some of the most ambitious rules to clean up a polluting economy. “There has been a radical change in political priorities – and this came before Trump was even close to election in the US,” said Marco Contiero, Greenpeace EU’s agricultural policy director. Bold green policies from the EU’s executive body have typically been watered down as they pass through protracted negotiations with other institutions. Critics say ambition is now being lost at the top while resistance is growing stronger throughout the legislative process. After farmers’ protests swept across Europe last year, lawmakers and member states nearly killed off a nature restoration law that EU institutions had already negotiated. It was the first sign of open revolt against the Green Deal that the centre-right president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, had put forward in 2019 after student climate protests. “The fact that the Green Deal became the poster child of the first von der Leyen Commission was received with surprise by civil society, industry, and lobbies,” said Contiero. “In a very similar manner, so has her decision to radically change her approach.” In mission letters to commissioners in September, von der Leyen set targets to reduce administrative burdens by 25% for all companies and by 35% for small- and medium-sized enterprises, with a “one in, one out” principle to ensure that new rules displaced existing ones. The Commission also promised to fight “gold-plating” measures, in which member states add their own rules that go beyond what the EU requires. The push to cut red tape has been led by the European People’s party (EPP), the largest group in parliament and the political home of 15 of the 27 commissioners, including von der Leyen. Its shift in tone has increasingly led to it siding with far-right forces. The cancellation of the anti-greenwashing law this week came after EPP and far-right lawmakers separately wrote to the European Commission to withdraw the bill. The EPP later celebrated the bill’s withdrawal as “a win for European companies”. Tiemo Wölken, a German MEP from the centre-left S&amp;D grouping who led negotiations of the proposal, said: “The Commission obviously wanted to fulfil the wishes of the right, and this is what is so scandalous. The EPP is again working with the far right to get rid of Green Deal files, but are pretending they are still in the middle and working with pro-European democratic forces.” The Commission has said it is pursuing an agenda of simplification rather than deregulation, and that its focus on competitiveness does not contradict the environmental aims of the Green Deal. It has also put forward plans to green industry, such as the Clean Industrial Deal, which have been celebrated as driving the energy transition in the EU forward. Paul de Clerck, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said the scale of the cuts in the first omnibus proposal in February showed that the simplification argument was “basically bollocks”. The Commission’s plans postpone corporate sustainability reporting requirements by two years and reduce the number of companies in its scope by 80%; delay corporate due diligence rules by one year; remove a requirement to conduct in-depth impact assessments; scrap a civil liability clause that would make it easier to sue companies; and exclude about 90% of businesses from the carbon border adjustment mechanism. Member states on Monday proposed reducing the scope even further. De Clerck said: “This is highly relevant because it’s the first proposal under the simplification agenda that’s been put forward and … it’s not just weakening it a little bit, it’s slashing it. The heart of the proposal has basically been taken out.” Political support for environment rules has dried up in several wealthy economies in the past year, even as the energy transition gains pace and an overwhelming majority of people say they want governments to cut pollution faster. European businesses have long complained of complex rules that hamper innovation and make it harder for them to compete with foreign companies. “The Green Deal often overlooked challenges like high energy costs or lengthy and complex permitting procedures,” said Markus Breyer, the director general of the industry association BusinessEurope. “The current focus on competitiveness reflects a more balanced and pragmatic approach that better aligns climate goals with economic realities.” Critics counter that failing to quickly transition to a clean economy will jeopardise economic prosperity in the medium term, as well as saddling individuals and governments with the cost of climate damages. Contiero said the EU would be “crushed by larger blocs such as the US and China” if it continued to play by 20th-century rules. “Investing in the Green Deal means decoupling economic growth from the use of natural resources – that was the essential element that made an awful lot of sense for the 21st century,” he said. “Abandoning such a critical approach will take away the competitive advantage that Europe could have had.”",Green politics; European Commission; European Union; Green economy; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Europe; World news; Biodiversity; Wildlife; Environment,Environment
2025-02-19T15:01:40Z,"HSBC net zero goal delayed 20 years, as CEO offered 600% bonus",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/19/hsbc-net-zero-goal-delayed-20-years-ceo-bonus,"HSBC has been criticised after it delayed key parts of its climate goals by 20 years, while watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, that could be worth up to 600% of his salary. The London-headquartered lender said it was reviewing its net zero emissions policies and targets – which are split between its own operations and those of the clients it finances – after realising its clients and suppliers had “seen more challenges” in cutting their carbon footprint than expected. HSBC had planned to hit net zero targets for its own operations – arguably a much easier goal than cutting the emissions of its loan portfolio and client base – by 2030. However, those plans, which were set in 2020, are being pushed out by two decades to 2050. “Progress in reducing emissions in the … supply chain component is proving slower than we anticipated,” HSBC’s annual report said. “We currently expect a 40% emissions reduction across our operations, travel and supply chain by 2030 which would mean that we would need to rely heavily on carbon offsets to achieve net zero in our supply chain by 2030. “As such, we have revisited our ambition, taking into account latest best practice on carbon offsets. We are now focused on achieving net zero in our operations, travel and supply chain by 2050.” HSBC is also proposing to water down environmental targets in Elhedery’s new pay package, including a long-term incentive plan (LTI) worth up to £9m, or 600% of the his base salary. It is part of a wider pay proposal that will give Elhedery a chance to earn up to £15m a year, a 43% increase on his current potential pay of up to £10.5m. The environmental portion of the LTI, a bonus that will cover performance from 2025-27, has been reduced to 20% from 25%. HSBC said this would “ensure a greater proportion of the LTI is aligned to value creation while supporting our ESG (environmental, sustainability and governance) ambitions”. Meanwhile, the LTI will only be linked to progress made in cutting the bank’s own emissions – including those that have been delayed – given that tracking progress of its client base was “difficult”. HSBC’s remuneration committee said in its annual report: “At this stage, financed emission targets remain difficult to include given challenges in the methodology, timeliness and frequency of reporting. This was recognised by the investors we spoke to as part of our policy engagement. “We therefore decided to retain metrics on carbon reduction in our own emissions and sustainable finance and investment, given we cannot currently use financed emissions, which is a material metric in supporting our ESG ambitions.” The pay proposals will be put to shareholders at its annual general meeting this spring. HSBC’s climate target delay prompted criticism from a wide range of environmental campaigners. “HSBC is just putting its feet up and watching the world burn, rather than owning its responsibility for the climate crisis,” Joanna Warrington at Fossil Free London said. “HSBC helped get us into this mess by financing the growth of fossil fuels which drive up emissions, so it has no right complaining that now it’s suddenly too hard to bring them down,” she added. Zahra Hdidou, a senior climate and resilience adviser at ActionAid UK, urged HSBC to “abandon this disastrous delay and stop financing the fossil fuels and agribusiness corporations that are destroying the planet. The time for kicking the can down the road is over.” HSBC announced the decision amid a climate backlash in the US, where the president, Donald Trump, has been encouraging a retreat from environmental policies in favour of support for oil and gas production. The shift has already prompted six of the largest banks in the US – Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – to withdraw from the UN-sponsored net-zero banking alliance (NZBA) in recent weeks. Elhedery said the bank remained committed to a wider net zero goal by 2050 but told journalists it was “reasonable that we take stock of where we are on that journey”. When asked whether he was committed to remaining a member of the NZBA, Elhedery confirmed only that HSBC was, indeed, a member. HSBC confirmed the scale of its cost-cutting drive, with plans to cut $1.5bn (£1.2bn) from its annual costs by the end of 2026, including through an unconfirmed number of job losses across its 220,928 international workforce. Pre-tax profits for 2024 rose 6.6% to $32.3bn.",HSBC; Banking; Business; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news; World news,Business
2025-01-15T12:07:19Z,Major banks are abandoning their climate alliance en masse. So much for ‘woke capital’ | Adrienne Buller,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/15/woke-capital-net-zero-banking-alliance,"Last week, as flames began tearing through greater Los Angeles, claiming multiple lives and forcing more than 100,000 people to evacuate, JP Morgan became the sixth major US bank to quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) since the start of December. A smaller story, certainly, but the departure of top US banks from the NZBA in the weeks since Donald Trump’s re-election nonetheless speaks to a seismic political shift prompting major financial institutions to turn away from the climate-related commitments they made in the optimistic years after the Paris agreement. The NZBA is a voluntary network of global banks committed to “align lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050”. It is part of the umbrella Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which counts among its membership dozens of “alliances” covering the various segments of global finance. For its part, the NZBA requires new members to submit science-aligned targets within 18 months of joining, alongside disclosing plans for and status updates on meeting them. At its height, the coalition boasted 40% of global banking assets. And at the time of its launch, its co-founder, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, described the NZBA as the “breakthrough in mainstreaming climate finance the world needs”. So far a breakthrough remains at large. In evaluating the NZBA, the benchmark that ultimately matters is that of curbing global emissions and fossil fuel expansion. On both of these points, it’s not clear that the alliance has had any effect. Banks’ targets have been met with widespread criticism concerning lack of transparency and inconsistent or questionable methodologies, and recent research shows little to no difference between the financing and engagement impact of NZBA members and non-members. A separate study found banks that self-present as eco-conscious lend more to polluting industries than those that don’t. Impressively, there has been an overall uptick in fossil fuel financing since 2021 – after the group was formed. But this raises a critical question: if these alliances were voluntary, non-binding, and seem to have done close to nothing to hinder banks financing fossil fuel expansion, why are banks bothering to quit? The answer is always, in finance, a calculus of risk. At the time of NZBA’s founding, banks faced considerable reputational risk for being seen as climate laggards. The wind was in the sails of governments and institutions touting climate action, and banks acted accordingly. Today, on the back of record fossil fuel profitability, a protracted backlash against “woke capital” and the second coming of Trump, the calculus has changed. The mood music on Wall Street is the threat of litigation for being seen as anti-Big Fossil. Weeks after Trump’s re-election, the “big three” asset managers – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – were sued by a Texas-led coalition ostensibly for using climate strategies to crush coal production in an alleged breach of antitrust law. In a series of publications in 2024, the Republican-led House judiciary committee claimed it had evidence of a “climate cartel” among big financial firms, criticising GFANZ and Climate Action 100+, another voluntary alliance, for encouraging investors to use their position as shareholders to push companies to disclose their emissions and set climate plans – which, according to the committee, amounts to “collusion”. It’s unclear what the conclusions of these reports mean for implicated firms, but the implied – and chilling – threat is one of legal action for breaching antitrust laws. Even without that thread, however, parties hostile to the green finance wave have found avenues for applying pressure: the asset management giant BlackRock, having previously made considerable efforts to pitch itself as a climate leader, left its equivalent alliance to the NZBA, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, last week, after the loss of billions in public pension assets from red states that attacked the firm as too environment and sustainability minded. What, then, should we make of this gradual crumbling of the “sustainable finance” infrastructure? As Daniela Gabor, a professor of economics, has argued, the prominence of the agenda after the Paris agreement might best be read as an effort by the private sector to weaken a groundswell in public demand for climate action by governments, heading off the threat of stricter regulation and ensuring that the “big green state” remains squarely focused on “mobilising” private capital rather than investing directly itself – even if this approach might be more costly and less effective. Optimistically, the faltering of the project could therefore create new openings for more ambitious and effective policy. However, this was always an agenda that was equally attractive to governments. Private sector alliances such as GFANZ reflect a view of climate policy as technocratic exercise – crowding in finance here, de-risking a carbon capture project there. Treating it as such allowed governments to dodge the thornier issues of climate policy, from its direct relationship to economic inequality and outsized corporate power, to confronting the entrenched interests of the fossil fuel industry – whether through unwinding trillions in annual subsidies or directly regulating against fossil fuel expansion. As Hans Stegeman, the chief economist at Triodos Bank, put it to me: “For too long, policymakers have placed excessive hope in private finance to resolve issues they hesitate to address through regulation or public policy.” As the climate crisis accelerates and increasingly far-right politicians make gains around the world – often on platforms that rally against the apparent elitism of climate politics – ignoring these issues is no longer a viable strategy. In a statement published on 31 December, GFANZ announced it would drop its requirements for members to publish firm targets, allowing “any financial institution working to mobilise capital and lower the barriers to financing energy transition to participate” and earlier this month announced it would no longer work as an umbrella organisation, but a stand-alone body working to “mobilise” climate finance. For a project that still retains many prominent European banks within its ranks, the crumbling to pressure and change of direction was remarkably swift. More cynically, it might be read as an admission that all these “targets” and “disclosures” never meant much at all. Adrienne Buller is director of The Break Down and the author of The Value of a Whale: on the illusions of green capitalism This article was amended on 16 January 2025 to reflect the fact that GFANZ will no longer work as an umbrella organisation for other climate finance groups.",Climate crisis; Banking; World news; Environment; Business; UK news,Opinion
2024-08-08T23:13:11Z,Cello-playing climate activist arrested at New York Citibank protest as crackdown escalates,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/08/citibank-climate-protest-new-york,"A 63-year-old climate activist and professional cellist faces up to seven years in prison after being arrested on Thursday while performing a Bach solo outside the headquarters of one of the world’s largest fossil fuel financier Citibank in downtown New York. John Mark Rozendaal, an adjunct music instructor at Princeton university and Alec Connon, director of the climate nonprofit group Stop the Money Pipeline, were arrested for criminal contempt in the public park at the bank’s global headquarters as the crackdown against nonviolent climate protesters escalates. Rozendaal was handcuffed and led away to the police vehicle singing “we are not afraid, we are not afraid, we will sing for liberation because we know why we were made”. The crowd of protesters chanted “let him play” and “ shame on you Citibank”. Thirteen other climate activists, who had linked arms in a circle around Rozendaal to protect him as he played Bach’s suites for cello, were detained for alleged obstruction of governmental administration, a misdemeanor criminal charge. “People are dying … today is my birthday,” said Mike Bucci, 77, teary eyed as the police in riot gear broke up the protest. Since 10 June, climate activists have been peacefully protesting against Citibank’s record financial support for new fossil fuel projects as part of the Summer of Heat on Wall Street campaign. At least 3,700 people have participated in the nonviolent civil disobedience, repeatedly blockading the entrance to its global headquarters. More than 475 people including faith leaders, scientists and elders have been arrested while calling on Citi to stop bankrolling new coal, oil and gas. Citi is the second largest financier of fossil fuels and the largest financier of fossil fuel expansion since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, according to the latest Banking on Climate Chaos report. The latest arrests come as climate advocates accuse Citibank and the NYPD of coordinated and escalating efforts to suppress nonviolent protests in retaliation for drawing attention to the banking giant’s key role in funding fossil projects globally. (Citi declined to comment on the allegation. The NYPD told Inside Climate News that there was no escalation in law enforcement’s response and individuals had not been targeted.) Over the course of five days in July, four high-profile “summer of heat” organizers and activists were arrested on what they say are bogus charges targeting campaign leaders – an escalation condemned by hundreds of celebrities, scientists, lawmakers, students, nonprofits and climate activists. “The window to avert the worst impacts of climate change is rapidly closing … efforts by the fossil fuel industry and its allies to criminalize and suppress protests imperil democratic freedoms and obstruct meaningful climate action,” said Kathy Mulvey from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). In 2021, the International Energy Agency warned that the world must immediately halt investment in new upstream oil and gas development, in order to have any hope of complying with the Paris climate accords and curtailing global heating to 1.5C (35F). Since then, Citibank has provided $60bn to the companies expanding oil, gas and coal operations. Among the leaders facing criminal proceedings are Rozendaal and Connon, who were first arrested on 18 July and charged with assault, they say falsely, against a man, James Flynn, who is working with Citi’s private security team. Flynn was granted temporary restraining orders, reviewed by the Guardian, against Rozendaal and Connon which prohibits the activists from communicating with him or going near his person, home, business or workplace for six months, but does not specify any of these locations. Flynn appears to have previously worked as a NYPD detective, according to publicly available databases, information from his social media and his own comments to protesters. Citi declined to comment on Flynn’s role. The NYPD did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. On Thursday, Rozendaal and Connon returned to the Citibank HQ in violation of the restraining order, which they believe is unconstitutional, and were arrested for criminal contempt, a charge that carries a maximum seven-year sentence. As the detainees were driven away for arraignment, one participant, Felipe, 86, a retired realtor originally from Cuba, said: “This is a moral cause. The police are doing the wrong thing.” Graham Bier, 41, a singer who has performed with Rozendaal, and who traveled from Philadelphia to attend the protest with his four year-old son, said: “We’ve had warnings since the 60s and 70s and I don’t know what it’s gonna take to shift such a massive habit, but it’s it’s getting so desperate.” In a separate incident on 21 July, videographer and summer of heat organizer Teddy Ogborn was arrested and held in a cell for more than eight hours, days after he filmed an alleged Citi employee apparently inciting violence against climate protesters blocking the entrance. “Just punch him in the f–king head! Punch him in the f–king head,” shouted the woman, identified by protesters as the executive assistant to Citi’s co-head of Global Financial Strategy, which Ogborn caught on camera. “Get a machine gun and f–king kill them all,” she added. “These comments are unacceptable,” a Citi spokesperson said. “We are looking into the matter and it will be addressed appropriately.” At an earlier protest, Ogborn also captured Citi’s general counsel apparently shoving a female protester who was among a group blocking the entrance. A Citi spokesperson said the protesters’ claims were false and that an employee was initially hit by a barricade before pushing it out of his way. Ogborn was charged with obstruction of governmental administration, a misdemeanor, for allegedly having placed a hand on a barricade that was being moved by activists a week earlier. The charge was dropped two weeks later. “We have made the bank synonymous with environmental destruction, violence and fossil fuels, and I have been capturing moments that are damaging for Citi,” said Ogborn, cofounder of Planet over Profits. “The escalation against organizers is targeted, and attempts to use bogus charges to harass and intimidate protesters.” Last year, Citibank financed almost twice as much fossil fuel energy as clean energy, less than its competitors JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In order to meet global climate goals, banks must finance four times as much clean energy as fossil fuel energy, according to research by BloombergNEF. The methodology used to calculate fossil fuel financing has been previously disputed by some banks. A spokesperson for Citi said the bank is “transparent” about its “climate-related activities” and its approach reflects the need to transition and meet global energy needs. “We are supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy through our net zero commitments and our $1tn sustainable finance goal.” “The Summer of Heat campaign has mobilized thousands of everyday people and brought financial executives face-to-face with the very communities they are harming through the billions they bankroll in fossil fuels,” said New York City council member Alexa Avilés. “Rather than engage on the merits of their arguments and acknowledge the role they play, Citibank has chosen to unleash a brutal police crackdown on organizers … You cannot incarcerate your way to a livable planet.”",US news; Environment; Citigroup; Fossil fuels; Energy; New York,US news
2024-03-15T16:58:38Z,EU approves watered-down human rights and supply chain law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/15/eu-approves-watered-down-human-rights-and-supply-chain-law,"EU countries have slashed the scope of a law to make companies hunt down human rights abuse and environmental harm in their supply chains. The EU’s corporate sustainability directive, which was agreed in December but nearly scuttled after a minor coalition partner in the German government withdrew its support, was approved by member states on Friday after a month-long search for compromise and further lobbying from France and Italy. Lara Wolters, a Dutch MEP with the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) grouping who led negotiations for the European parliament, said the new law would help “stop businesses from looking away from very real human misery and destruction” but criticised member states who “persistently delayed” the adoption of the agreement. The Belgian government, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, thrashed out a compromise that limits the number of companies expected to comply. The new agreement applies to companies with more than 1,000 employees, up from 500, and a net turnover of €450m (£385m) – triple the amount previously agreed. Environmental groups estimate the changes will exclude 70% of the companies the law was meant to cover. EU governments have “killed two-thirds of the law” and the impact that it could have had, said Uku Lilleväli, a sustainable finance policy officer at WWF. “The EU countries endorsed the much-needed due diligence law, but at what cost? We’re left with bare bones, with an already weak framework that now covers only a fraction of all large companies.” The rules, which must be voted on in the European parliament before they come into force, provide a framework for communities to sue EU companies for human rights abuses and environmental harm in their supply chains. But efforts to water down the rules mean fewer companies will have to set targets to cut pollution and adopt climate transition plans than previously agreed and will have more time to comply. Member states also gutted a provision that would force companies to offer managers financial incentives to hit climate goals. Aurélie Skrobik, a corporate accountability campaigner at Global Witness, said it was an affront by national governments but a relief that there was a law at all. “This law is a shadow of what it should have been – and what negotiators agreed in December.” Opponents of the law argued it would place too big a burden on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), who secured extra support in the final agreement, and would raise the potential for legal challenges. Markus Beyrer, the director general of lobby group BusinessEurope, said the new rules added “unparalleled obligations” and imposed harsh sanctions on companies that would expose them to litigation. “SMEs, even though they are theoretically out of the scope of the directive, will be negatively affected as they make up the largest part of value chains,” he said. The Chinese chamber of commerce to the EU said in a post on X that the law “could be very concerning” and warned of possible trade disruptions and cost increases. “We call for urgent clarification, and the EU should refrain from erecting market barriers that hinder non-EU producers.” Industry groups had found support in the German Free Democrats party, which opposed the law after having previously agreed to it. It sparked a public fight within Germany’s governing coalition of the centre-left Social Democratic party and Greens. “If we break our word after having pledged our support in Brussels, we risk losing the trust placed in us,” said the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, in February. The German government abstained on the vote on Friday, which only secured enough votes after Italy threw in its support. Campaigners decried the 11th-hour horse-trading as undemocratic. Anaïs Berthier, the head of the Brussels office of environmental law campaign group ClientEarth, said corporate pressure and political games had “butchered” an opportunity to revolutionise how business is done in the EU. “This disrespect for the rule of law is an unsettling trend that we are witnessing across several environmental laws still being approved,” she said. “It’s a worrying sign of things to come in the run-up to the EU elections.”",European Union; World news; Corporate social responsibility; Environment; Human rights; Europe,World news
2024-04-26T11:00:38Z,Barclays accused of greenwashing over financing for Italian oil company ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/26/barclays-accused-of-greenwashing-over-financing-for-italian-oil-company,"Barclays is being accused by environmental groups of greenwashing after helping to arrange €4bn (£3.4bn) in financing for the Italian oil company Eni in a way that allows them to qualify towards its $1tn sustainable financing goal. Environmental groups have said the London-based bank is deliberately misleading the public by labelling the financial instruments as “sustainable” at the same time that Eni is in the midst of a multibillion-pound fossil fuel expansion drive designed to increase production. An investigation by the journalism organisation Point Source has revealed that the deals for a revolving credit line were completed last year, months after the Milan-based company announced it intended to increase its spending on the production of oil and gas by at least a third over four years, investing between €24bn and €26bn. In February 2023, Eni said it was aiming to increase its production of oil and gas by between 12.6% and 17% over the four-year period to the end of 2026. Eni’s oil and gas expansion plans include a project to develop the Verus gas field, which could emit 7.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and has been described as a “carbon bomb” by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Owing to its expansion plans, Eni’s production in 2030 is projected to be 35% higher than that required to align with the International Energy Agency’s net zero emissions by 2050 scenario, according to the campaign group Reclaim Finance. Eni says it still aims to achieve net zero by 2050. The financing Barclays helped Eni raise includes a sustainability-linked bond (SLB) worth €1bn and a revolving sustainability-linked loan (SLL) worth €3bn. While there is nothing in the terms of these financial instruments to prevent Eni from using the funds raised to develop oil and gas projects, including the Verus gas field, Barclays says the financing qualifies to be counted towards its 2030 sustainability target because the interest rates have been linked to emissions goals. However, environmental groups and financial experts say the goals in the contracts, which exclude scope 3 emissions, are unambitious and incompatible with the internationally agreed target to limit any rise in global temperature to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Scope 1 emissions come from sources that an organisation owns or controls directly, while scope 2 emissions are caused indirectly and come from where the energy it uses is produced. Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect sources in the value chain of an organisation that are not within scope 1 and 2. The exclusion of scope 3 emissions in the targets has been criticised because the majority of Eni’s emissions, such as those from burning the oil and gas it produces, are considered scope 3. Jo Richardson, the head of research at the non-profit research organisation Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute, said: “There are a lot of sustainability-linked financial products that are not effective – and these are two classic examples. “To see a really effective sustainability structure in the oil and gas sector you would need to see a company with a clear and committed plan to reducing scope 3 emissions.” Lucie Pinson, the founder and director of Reclaim Finance, said: “Issuing an SLL like this is an easy way for Eni to raise money without having to make a significant climate effort or change anything about its business. It also allows banks who have pledged net zero to keep financing the worst climate offenders while pretending to support their transition.” In June last year, the Financial Conduct Authority sent a letter to financial institutions warning of “the possibility of potential risks to market integrity and suspicion of greenwashing in the context of SLLs”. It said it was concerned about “weak incentives, potential conflicts of interest, and suggestions of low ambition and poor design”. In February this year, Barclays announced that it would no longer provide direct funding for new oil and gas projects. However, financing in the form of SLBs and SLLs could continue for companies that are developing new oil and gas fields because the bank does not consider this to be “direct” project financing. Huw Davies, senior finance adviser at the campaign group Make My Money Matter, said: “Not only are the UK’s largest banks [continuing to help] finance companies that are expanding oil and gas production, but this shows they’re doing so under the pretence of so-called ‘sustainable’ finance. “Barclays’ decision to provide billions in corporate finance to Eni – a company which continues to develop new oil and gas – is enabling fossil fuel expansion, and contradicting their claims to be serious about sustainability.” When contacted by the Guardian, Barclays declined to comment. In a statement, Eni said it chose the targets in its sustainability-linked financial instruments “tailored to their maturity range” and because of this “it was not possible to use a scope 3 target”. It added: “Eni has built a business model that puts sustainability at the centre of every business activity, including financial strategy. “The development of the Verus project is consistent with Eni’s objective of achieving scope 1 and 2 carbon neutrality in all its businesses by 2035 … In particular, the development of Verus would include the use of capture and storage of CO2 to supply decarbonised energy in line with Eni’s objectives.” Barclays was a lead arranger in the $3bn sustainability-linked revolving credit facility that was provided to Eni by 26 global financial institutions including Italy-based Mediobanca Group, New York-based Citi, and France’s Natixis. The SLL has a time period of five years and its sustainability targets relate to the installed capacity for the production of electricity from renewable sources as well as emissions goals. Barclays was one of three banks that structured the $1bn SLB for Eni. The other banks involved were Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase.

2023-11-25T19:00:02Z,How the climate credentials of Australia’s big banks stack up,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/26/how-the-climate-credentials-of-australias-big-banks-stack-up,"There is a growing gulf between the climate policies of Australia’s big banks, with some pledging to severely limit future financing for fossil fuel projects, while others have left the door open, according to an analysis of updated lending policies. Part of the discrepancy lies in the banks’ approach to arranging bonds, which are used by companies to access financing along with, and sometimes instead of, a direct loan. When companies issue bonds, they receive money from investors in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the initial capital at a later date. In short, investors become lenders. Updated policies show that Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have restrictions on facilitating bonds for fossil fuel clients in line with their hurdles imposed for direct finance. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Their fossil fuel clients will need credible plans to cut all emissions, including from the end-use of their coal, oil and gas, from different dates in 2025 to have the banks provide loans or be involved in facilitating bonds. The other two major retail banks, NAB and ANZ, have less developed bond policies, according to climate groups. Kyle Robertson, a banks campaigner at the environmental activist group Market Forces, said coal companies had turned to bonds to raise money after direct funding avenues started to dry up. “We’ve seen a pivot towards bonds, and coal companies actually get two-and-a-half times more money from bonds than from traditional lending, so to have no policy on that is just a massive gap,” Robertson said. NAB will not offer traditional lending to fossil fuel companies without credible plans to cut all emissions, in line with the landmark Paris agreement, from late 2025, according to its climate policies. Connie Sokaris, NAB’s executive for corporate finance, said the bank’s climate policies would inform its bond facilitation decisions. “The most significant impact NAB can have on emissions reduction is through the finance we provide,” Sokaris said. “NAB reviews all applications for finance from corporate and institutional customers on a case-by case basis and that includes (for the fossil fuel sector) considering climate-related matters for lending and capital markets activity – including bond facilitation – to ensure the finance we provide or facilitate aligns with our policy commitments.” ANZ is reducing its overall exposure to oil and gas companies, although its climate policies don’t require fossil fuel companies to take into account emissions generated from the use of their coal, oil and gas, according to Market Forces and the Australian Conservation Foundation. Jonathan Moylan, corporate campaigner at the ACF, said ANZ’s policies lag behind its banking peers. “ANZ stands out as the laggard bank because it is ignoring the climate impacts of oil and gas after it is exported and burnt overseas, despite the fact that fossil fuels damage Australia’s climate regardless of where they are burnt,” said Moylan. Some resources and energy companies have shied away from tackling the emissions generated by their customers – known as scope 3 emissions – even though the bulk of emissions are produced when the fossil fuels are used, rather than extracted. An ANZ spokesperson said the bank would reduce exposure or exit relationships with oil and gas customers that don’t meet its climate expectations by the end of 2025, which includes disclosing scope 3 targets and plans. The spokesperson said climate policies were taking into account in bond facilitation decisions. “These type of activities are considered under our general credit approval process, which is rigorous and incorporates consideration of social and environmental issues,” the spokesperson said. The four big banks have all added fossil fuel restrictions to their policies over the past several weeks, as 2023 shapes up to be the hottest year on record. The Reserve Bank has noted that there are economic risks that accompany hotter temperatures and more extreme weather, with business activity disrupted, property damaged and lower productivity growth. Dr Arjuna Dibley, head of the sustainable finance hub at the University of Melbourne, said lenders had been grappling with how the climate crisis might affect their balance sheets. “For example, if a bank provides a loan to a fossil fuel company, that company may not necessarily be profitable into the future with the transition to a low-carbon economy,” he said. Dibley said that climate lawsuits also posed a financial risk to lenders. “All of these risks across banks’ balance sheets add up and are the source of potential financial impact to banks’ profitability into the future.”",Banking ; Australia news; Business; Climate crisis; Banking; Environment; Fossil fuels,Australia news
2023-08-30T06:58:39Z,Australia to acknowledge climate risk to government bonds after world-first court settlement,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/aug/30/australia-to-acknowledge-climate-risk-to-government-bonds-after-world-first-court-settlement,"The Australian government has agreed to settle what has been described as a world-first court case that accused it of misleading investors by failing to disclose the financial risk caused by the climate crisis. In 2020, Melbourne university student Katta O’Donnell launched a class action accusing the then Morrison government of breaching a legal duty and deceiving investors in sovereign bonds by not informing them upfront of the climate risk they faced. Her lawyers said it was a class action representing current and future investors in government bonds, which are considered one of the safest forms of investment. Under settlement terms announced on Wednesday, the Albanese government agreed to publish a statement on a Treasury website acknowledging that climate change was a systemic risk that may affect bond value. O’Donnell dropped a request for a declaration the government had engaged in misleading conduct. Climate risk refers to assessments of the expected impact of the climate crisis on investments, including the likelihood that fossil fuel investments will lose value as the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Australians own bonds through their superannuation funds. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O’Donnell said the settlement was an “important first step in realising the risks of climate change”. “As an investor, I am pleased with the proposed settlement. This is the first time a country with a AAA credit rating has acknowledged climate change is a systemic risk when talking about risks to government bonds,” she said. “The government must now prioritise effective action on climate change to mitigate those risks.” The agreed statement to be published by the Treasury will say climate change “is a systemic risk that presents significant risks and opportunities for Australia’s economy, regions, industries and communities”, and that there is uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of the physical impacts and the global transition to net zero emissions. “As a consequence, there is uncertainty about whether the fiscal impacts of climate change may affect (if at all) the value of [government bonds],” it says. The statement includes some steps the government is taking on the climate crisis, including developing sustainable finance reforms and outlining the fiscal impacts of climate change in the federal budget. A lawyer representing O’Donnell, Clare Schuster from Equity Generation Lawyers, said the budget did not mention climate change or its economic impacts when the case was filed and the government had improved how it incorporated the climate crisis into the budget, legislation and policy. She described the settlement as an important step “as part of a broader contextual shift”, noting the government had committed to “continued engagement with investors and other stakeholders on climate change risks”. The settlement is due to go to the federal court for approval on 11 October.

2023-09-13T22:00:11Z,News Corp gasses up ‘green’ fossil fuels in a series on future energy – but does it pass the sniff test? | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/14/news-corp-gasses-up-green-fossil-fuels-in-a-series-on-future-energy-but-does-it-pass-the-sniff-test,"In a double-page spread in News Corp Australia’s metropolitan newspapers on Monday, readers were told how families loved cooking with gas, how gas had been officially stamped as “green” by the European Union and how coal had a future thanks to carbon capture and storage. The news articles, packed with industry talking points about the future of fossil fuels, were written around a picture of a smiling mum with her two young sons, one of them sitting cross-legged on a kitchen bench next to a gas stove. Nowhere were readers told the articles – part of a series running this week called Future Energy – were sponsored by seven organisations that included a gas retailer, a gas pipeline company and a project of the black coal industry. Only a banner in the top right hand corner of the page with a string of logos – including the South Australian government – suggested there might be something unconventional going on. News Corp confirmed the series was being sponsored but said none of the organisations had any influence over the content, even though many of the sponsors have featured in the stories. The main article promoted the use of gas appliances in homes and the views of various gas industry figures about how important the fuel they sold would be in the future. The concept of “renewable gas” was also explored. But at times, the article badly conflated the use of gas in homes for cooking or heating with the role gas is expected to play in electricity generation. For example, the article said: “Gas will form a critical plank in the road to renewable energy, with most states and the federal government ruling out bans on new home connections despite an assault by Victoria and some councils.” The first part of this sentence is true in the context of electricity generation. There is wide agreement among energy analysts that gas-fired generators will be needed on standby in the future to provide back-up for solar, wind, hydro and batteries. But this is different from burning a fossil fuel in your home to cook or stay warm. The health concerns or the climate impacts were not discussed. Gas is green? The article claimed the European Union had designated gas a “green energy” last year. Is that true? The European Union has issued legal guidelines – known as the “sustainable finance taxonomy” – on what constitutes a sustainable investment. This new taxonomy did not designate “gas a green energy”, but did say that some gas-fired power plants could fall into the category of a sustainable investment – a move not without controversy. The ruling did not relate to burning gas in homes. But the technical requirements for gas-fired power plants to qualify as a sustainable investment are long and highly restrictive. The Australian Sustainable Finance Institute told Temperature Check that it was “incorrect” to say the European Union had designated gas as green. Pointing to the details, the institute said only power plants that emit a maximum of 270g of CO2-equivalent per kilowatt hour of electricity generated, or alternatively an average of 550g of CO2-e/kW of the plant’s capacity over 20 years, could qualify. For gas power plants to be eligible for sustainable investment, a national coal phase-out plan also needs to be in place, the plant has to be a replacement for coal or other high-emitting fuel source and the generators have to commit to switching to low-carbon fuels by 2035 and prove renewable energy could not do the same job. If the emissions standard was applied in Australia, many of the country’s gas-fired power plants would not qualify. That’s all very different from the EU giving gas a green stamp of approval. Coal capture In a separate story under the headline “Capturing carbon gives coal a role” readers were told about carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that could “capture carbon dioxide and store it safely underground, including directly from large emission sources such as coal-fired power plants”. The same article later said there were currently 29 CCS facilities globally “with a total capture capacity of almost 40m tonnes [of CO2] annually”. For context, if those projects did sequester 40m tonnes (and many do not operate close to their capacity) this would be about 0.1% of the 36.6bn tonnes of CO2 released from fossil fuel burning last year. What the article did not say was that most of those 29 operating CCS facilities are capturing CO2 as part of a process called “Enhanced Oil Recovery” where the CO2 is pumped into oil and gas wells to push out more fossil fuels. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And how many of those 29 CCS facilities (actually, there are 30) are attached to a coal-fired power station? Just one, according to the latest annual report from the Global CCS Institute. But that facility – at SaskPower’s Boundary Dam coal plant in Canada – has been dogged by issues. In 2021, the plant captured less than half of its notional 1m tonnes a year capacity. And what happens to most of the CO2 captured at Boundary Dam? It is sold to local oilfields so that more oil can be extracted. Do we need to say what’s released when the oil is burned? Net Zero Australia Discussing CCS technology as a way to reduce emissions from fossil plants, the story pointed to a major modelling report from the universities of Melbourne, Princeton and Queensland. But Net Zero Australia report co-author, associate professor Simon Smart, told Temperature Check the report’s recommendations for CCS did not relate to capturing carbon at fossil fuel electricity generators. He said in all the project’s five modelled scenarios, CCS on coal-fired power stations was never part of the lowest cost energy mix. CCS on gas turbines only played a small role in one scenario, he said, where renewable energy is severely held back. Sponsored content Displayed in the top right hand corner of the articles were the logos of electricity and gas retailer Alinta Energy, the coal industry’s Low Emission Technology Australia (LETA), gas network provider Jemena, energy investor Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, electricity network Transgrid, Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, and the South Australian government. Printed in newspapers in Sydney, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart, there were no words saying why the logos were displayed. News Corp Australia told Temperature Check the organisations were “commercial supporters” of the series that “highlights the importance of Australia’s future energy needs”. The organisations had “no role in determining, influencing or dictating editorial content”, a News Corp Australia statement said. Jemena, Alinta Energy and LETA were all featured in the articles. A statement from the South Australian Department of Energy and Mining said the government was “a sponsor of News Corp Australia’s Future Energy series”. The department refused to say how much it had paid to sponsor the series. The statement said the government had “long been a leader in green energy” and was “pleased to encourage a national conversation around our renewable energy future”. Alinta Energy said it “should be clear” from advertisements it had also taken out in News Corp papers that it was a major partner in the series. A company spokesperson said it had taken inquiries from journalists writing for the series in the same way it would from any other media, and had no influence or control over the stories. Drop the petrol Australia’s powerful lobby group for the oil and gas industry, the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association, has launched a rebrand and dropped the word petroleum from its title. Appea will now be known as Australian Energy Producers. But as the lobby group’s new website says, its members “produce around 95% of Australia’s oil and gas”.",Environment; Energy; Fossil fuels; Energy; Australia news; News Corporation,Environment
2023-07-08T04:40:01Z,Janet Yellen urges China to boost funding to tackle climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/08/janet-yellen-china-climate-crisis-funding,"US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has pressed China to do more to support international climate institutions that are helping finance green initiatives around the world, urging deeper cooperation in addressing the “existential threat” of global heating. “Climate finance should be targeted efficiently and effectively,” Yellen said on Saturday in Beijing during a meeting with Chinese and international sustainable finance experts. “I believe that if China were to support existing multilateral climate institutions like the Green Climate Fund and the Climate Investment Funds alongside us and other donor governments, we could have a greater impact than we do today.” Her comments, during a four-day trip to Beijing that follows secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit, come as the United States seeks to cool tensions and stress areas of collaboration between the world’s two biggest economies. “As the world’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases and the largest investors in renewable energy, we have both a joint responsibility – and ability – to lead the way,” Yellen said, underlining a key area of cooperation despite difficult bilateral relations. “Climate change is at the top of the list of global challenges, and the United States and China must work together to address this existential threat,” she said. China last year briefly said it was suspending talks on the climate after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House of Representatives, visited Taiwan – the self-ruling democracy claimed by Beijing. Highlighting some of those tensions, China’s People’s Liberation Army sent 13 aircraft and six vessels into the airspace and waters around Taiwan in the 24 hours to early Saturday. But there are signs that climate talks might restart soon, with US envoy John Kerry due to travel to China soon to discuss cooperation on climate change, a US official said on Friday. Besides working together on climate, Yellen said in a Friday meeting with Chinese premier Li Qiang it was also key that Washington and Beijing closely communicated on global economic and financial affairs – while making joint efforts on international challenges such as debt distress. On Saturday, in addition to meeting people involved in climate finance, Yellen is also expected to speak to women economists and see Vice-Premier He Lifeng, a key Chinese economic official. And a key question is whether “big-ticket items that are in the category of global challenges”, like debt distress and climate cooperation, get bumped to the top of the agenda, said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Yellen’s talks on Saturday follow meetings with US businesses, which have expressed a host of concerns about China, ranging from fair competition with local businesses, reduced people-to-people exchanges, and an uncertain business climate in the face of a national security crackdown. Any improvement in the US-China relationship will help US companies there, improve investment sentiment and create more opportunity to cooperate, Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told AFP.

2023-09-26T11:40:26Z,"I’m a Tory MP, but I know Rishi Sunak’s claims about the cost of net zero are false | Chris Skidmore",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/26/tory-mp-rishi-sunak-net-zero-economy-chris-skidmore,"Last week’s announcement that the government would delay key net-zero targets came as a surprise to anyone who has followed the policy. The existing targets were fair and well considered, and enjoyed wide political support. It’s strange to cite our world-leading progress in reducing emissions and developing low-carbon technologies, then decide that is a reason for slowing down, especially when doing so risks surrendering that position and those investment opportunities to other countries. Make no mistake, the government cannot stop our collective progress towards net zero. But it can, all too easily, slow progress at a critical time when we should be accelerating our efforts. Businesses and innovators are in a global race to create and deploy the technologies that will help us get there, and with a lack of clear political commitment Britain is lagging in some areas. Up until recently, Britain was the global leader in offshore wind power. It is now China. As my amendments to the energy bill suggested, enshrining the 2035 target in law will guarantee practical policy for the next 12 years, and also provide a new legal mechanism to hold whoever is in government to account for its delivery. This is more essential than ever as we head towards a general election: we cannot afford for net zero to become a political casualty. Integral to hitting net zero by 2050 is electricity decarbonisation by 2035. This is a seminal milestone in Britain’s net-zero journey, and decarbonising grid and infrastructure was identified as the most critical area in the Mission Zero independent review of net zero. It holds the key to forging successful decarbonisation pathways for the trio of essential industries – transport, housing and heating – which have been recently subject to increased uncertainty given the announced policy changes. The UK must now double down on its commitment to achieving a clean grid by 2035 – or risk breaking its net zero by 2050 pledge. Put simply, we cannot view these timelines, informed by expertise from top climate scientists and the Climate Change Committee, as malleable to political whim. They are gradated, clear pathways that must not be tampered with at this stage of innovation and investment as we transform our economy. The rhetoric that the net-zero transition is at odds with the economy is false. There is the obvious fact that it will cost Britain dearly if it fails to attract international investment as a centre for sustainable finance – something I term the “cost of not-zero”. And it was only this time last year that Britain was headed towards a winter in which fuel poverty reached record levels and some households were choosing between heating their homes or putting food on the table. The energy transition would help address this. Volatile international gas markets have fuelled the cost of living crisis in the UK, due to 80% of our home heating being reliant on gas. Clean energy provides not only a key means to Britain achieving net zero within the timeline we’ve committed to, but also offers households a vital financial lifeline through decreasing the price of energy. Domestically produced, cheap, clean energy will not be subject to the same price shocks we saw with gas – making sure the energy crisis was truly a once in a generation occurrence. As we have seen in the past year with grid connection issues, a net-zero electricity system is complex and dependent on systemic upgrades. To truly ensure the end result is fit for purpose, we must consult with the industry bodies that know it best – be it those associated with nuclear, solar, wind or the grid itself, as well as those within their respective supply chains. Which is why, as part of the Mission Zero Coalition I announced in March this year, we will be launching a power generation network to take forward an ambitious programme of recommendations to the government to support the decarbonisation of the UK’s power infrastructure. The purpose of this coalition is to ensure the gaps in public policy are filled to enable Britain to receive the economic rewards from this global race to net zero. We exist to support Britain on its path, most pressingly by contributing ideas that aid the design and delivery of a genuinely secure and sustainable energy mix. It will be my undertaking, beyond my role as an MP, to act as steward. As I set out in the net-zero review, the climate crisis is the greatest challenge of our generation, but it is also the greatest economic opportunity. There is now no future economy without a green economy, and the UK must continue to seize the net-zero opportunity with both hands, not drop our greatest chance for growth this century.

2022-12-11T14:00:35Z,Albanese government looking at laws to force big business to disclose climate efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/12/albanese-government-looking-at-laws-to-force-big-business-to-disclose-climate-efforts,"Banks and other big businesses will be forced to come clean with the public about what they are doing to cut emissions under plans put forward by the Albanese government. The government is also looking for ways to crack down on “greenwashing” – or when businesses try to win over consumers by overhyping their environmental practices. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will say in a speech in Sydney on Monday that Australian firms “need to make credible disclosures to remain competitive in global capital markets”. “There’s now broad acceptance that proper disclosure of these financial risks and impacts isn’t a nice-to-have extra,” he will say, according to speech notes distributed by his office in advance. “This information is need-to-know – essential to mobilising the weight of our financial system behind the net zero transition.” Treasury will release a consultation paper on Monday on the development of an Australian climate risk disclosure system. The government argues business and investors need clarity and certainty to manage climate risks and invest in new opportunities. It wants large business and financial institutions to provide “more information and greater transparency on how they are responding to climate change and supporting the transition to net zero”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government says the reporting requirements are expected to be mandatory for large entities and phased in over time. It also plans to apply “appropriately tailored requirements to comparable commonwealth public sector corporate entities and investment funds”. The director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change, Erwin Jackson, welcomed Australia “catching up” on climate-related disclosures. He said this could “support the unlocking of the billions of dollars of investment that are going to be needed on the transition to net zero”. Jackson said climate disclosure arrangements in Australia were a “dog’s breakfast”. “We have very large number of companies voluntarily disclosing at the moment but one company discloses one thing and another company discloses another thing and it’s really impossible for investors to get clear information to compare companies,” he said. “The sooner investors have clarity on the robustness of companies’ plans, the sooner they’ll be able to back those companies and industries on delivering the new industries and the new jobs that are going to be created as we address climate change.” The government has also asked Treasury to develop a comprehensive strategy to deepen Australia’s green finance markets and seize opportunities presented by surging global momentum in sustainable finance. Chalmers will say global investors increasingly see “a new harmony between profit and planet”. Australia should respond “by making our country a world leader in sustainable finance, taking a larger slice of the growing green investment pie”, he will tell the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute. Chalmers says the government is focused on “confronting and cracking down on greenwashing – ensuring the credibility of sustainability-related financial targets, products and investments – because credibility is everything”. He flagged the need to “develop coordinated strategies to prevent greenwashing in the corporate sector and financial markets” in a letter to the Council of Financial Regulators. The newly released letter to the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, in his capacity as chair of the CFR also seeks support for “standardised, internationally-aligned climate-related financial disclosure requirements for large businesses and financial institutions”. Treasury has asked for public submissions by 17 February.",Australian politics; Jim Chalmers; Climate crisis; Environment; Australia news; Business; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions,Australia news
2023-08-29T04:00:09Z,Young climate activist tells Greenpeace to drop ‘old-fashioned’ anti-nuclear stance,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/29/young-climate-activist-tells-greenpeace-to-drop-old-fashioned-anti-nuclear-stance,"An 18-year-old climate activist has called for Greenpeace to drop its “old-fashioned and unscientific” campaign against nuclear power in the EU. In April, the environmental campaign group announced it would appeal against the EU Commission’s decision to include nuclear power in its classification system for sustainable finance. This “taxonomy” is designed as a guide for private investors wanting to fund green projects, aiming to boost environmental investment. Ia Aanstoot, from Sweden, who for three years took part in the Friday school strikes movement started by Greta Thunberg, said Greenpeace’s legal challenge served fossil fuel interests instead of climate action. With campaigners from five other EU countries, Aanstoot has launched the Dear Greenpeace campaign, asking the NGO to “drop your old-fashioned and unscientific opposition to nuclear power, and join us in the fight against fossil fuels instead”. This week, Aanstoot submitted papers to the EU court of justice asking to become an “interested party” in the upcoming legal battle between the European Commission and Greenpeace. If the court approves the request, she and other pro-nuclear campaigners will be able to provide testimony in favour of nuclear power. Greenpeace has argued that the EU classification system is “greenwashing” that allows nuclear power plants to receive money that otherwise would have gone to renewables. Lawyers acting for the NGO have said nuclear energy causes “significant harm to the environment” so should not be included in the taxonomy. Aanstoot said: “Over a third of the clean energy in the EU is nuclear power, so Greenpeace’s motion to get rid of it is really harmful, I think. And I would definitely prefer to be working together with Greenpeace to get rid of fossil fuels. But when they are actively fighting such a large and useful tool like nuclear power, I don’t feel like I can work with them. “Greenpeace is stuck in the past fighting clean, carbon-free nuclear energy while the world is literally burning. We need to be using all the tools available to address climate change and nuclear is one of them. I’m tired of having to fight my fellow environmentalists about this when we should be fighting fossil fuels together.” She has joined with other young campaigners from Poland, Sweden, France, Finland and the Netherlands. One of these, Julia Galosh, a 22-year-old biologist, said: “I’ve protested opposite Greenpeace in horror as they campaigned to stop Germany’s nuclear reactors – something which led to much more demand for coal. Now they want to stop my home country of Poland from transitioning from coal to nuclear. Enough is enough.” Aanstoot thinks this is a generational issue, with younger environmentalists more keen on nuclear than those from older generations. She said: “I feel like a lot of the arguments [that] are used from Greenpeace and other older environmentalist … are very identity-based. It nearly feels like being anti-nuclear is a question of identity for these older environmentalists. These old issues are ones that nuclear has mostly moved past, and also the global situation has changed. In the 60s and 70s during the anti-nuclear protests, the climate crisis was not as much of a concern as it is today. “I feel like it’s just a matter of moving on with the times and the scientists have moved on – the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] now says that nuclear is a really important tool.” A Greenpeace EU spokesperson said: “We have the greatest respect for folks who are worried about the climate crisis and want to throw everything we have at the problem, but building new nuclear plants just isn’t a viable solution. The top priority is to cut carbon emissions as fast and, ideally, as cheaply as possible, and nuclear fails on both scores. The new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until today’s newborns turn teenagers. And the industry has no long-term solution for safely storing the radioactive waste that will remain dangerous for thousands of years. “The good news is that we don’t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut emissions, and with modern storage tech, 100 percent renewable systems are perfectly possible. Encouraging investments into nuclear energy by including it in the EU taxonomy risks diverting funding away from renewables, home insulation and support for people hit by extreme weather. We don’t have the luxury of endless time and resources so we should focus them on the solutions with the best chance of delivering.”",Greenpeace; Nuclear power; Environmental activism; Energy; Environment; Climate crisis; UK news,Environment
2023-02-01T09:15:30Z,"Business sector has driven shift to ‘values-based capitalism’, Jim Chalmers says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/01/business-sector-has-driven-shift-to-values-based-capitalism-jim-chalmers-says,"Jim Chalmers says Australia’s business and investment community has driven a shift to values-based capitalism, hitting back at a volley of criticism in some news outlets after the publication of the treasurer’s 6,000-word essay championing co-investment and economic inclusion. Chalmers made the observation on Wednesday while leading a round of consultation with the investment community about a new framework for disclosing climate-related risk. The treasurer participated in a round table convened by the Australian arm of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment initiative. In his new essay published by the Monthly on Monday, the treasurer signalled he wanted to expand the opportunity for “impact investing” while pressing ahead with regulatory reforms, including a “new taxonomy” to help investors “align their choices” with the government’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The treasurer said a renovation of institutions and regulatory frameworks was essential to allow capital to be deployed for private profit and “public value in the for-purpose economy”. He advocated a form of “values-based capitalism” predicated on partnership between the public and private sectors rather than antagonism. Chalmers said in the essay the private sector was “key and central to sustainable growth, and there’s a genuine appetite among so many forward-looking businesspeople and investors for something more aligned with their values and our national goals”. While Chalmers’ views are not hostile to the fundamentals of capitalism and align with mainstream analysis by regulators and sections of the business community, the essay has triggered a barrage of hostile commentary in Australia’s two national newspapers, the Australian and the Australian Financial Review. Chalmers addressed the controversy during Wednesday’s meeting with investors. He noted: “The investors represented here, and the broader investment and business community, don’t just support values-based capitalism – you’ve driven it. “This is not some leftwing fringe idea. It’s about better designed and better informed markets and more cooperation between investors and governments to modernise our economy and deepen and broaden our industrial base, powered by cleaner and cheaper energy. “Your enthusiasm and determination to drive Australia towards an appropriately ambitious sustainable finance agenda is one important example of this but not the only one.” Chalmers said the reforms the government was pursuing in climate-related risk disclosure and financial market transparency aligned with what investors and lenders had been championing for “years”. He said the reforms were intended to provide guardrails and policy stability to ensure markets were well informed and capital could be unlocked for productive investments. Chalmers noted while a “minority” of market participants were intent on clinging to “some sort of outdated ideology”, the government would pursue “a forward-looking, internationally aligned, sustainable finance agenda born out of economic opportunity and contemporary necessity”. Appearing separately at the National Press Club, Labor frontbencher Tony Burke was asked by a reporter whether he could define values-based capitalism “in your own words”. Burke said the arguments Chalmers had made in the new essay were consistent with the values “in the mission statements of major companies”, including members of the Business Council of Australia. Burke said there had been a “rush” in commentary to castigate the treasurer’s analysis, but he advised some of the critics to “look at what a whole lot of major companies put in black and white as the principles that they espouse as mattering”. “It’s a lot more than bottom line and for government to be backing those concepts is right and proper and I’m really glad that Jim’s written the essay.”",Australian economy; Australian politics; Australia news; Jim Chalmers; Business,Business
2023-07-14T12:39:37Z,UN agency pushes for debt repayment breaks as poverty rates rocket,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/14/un-agency-calls-for-debt-repayment-break-as-poverty-rates-rocket,"An additional 165 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty in the world’s poorest countries after a succession of economic shocks since the Covid pandemic, according to the United Nations. In a report highlighting the “human cost of inaction”, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said low-income countries urgently needed breaks from their debt repayments to cushion the blow from soaring borrowing costs. The sharp increase in borrowing costs means more than 20% of the world’s population – 1.6 billion people – now live on less than $3.65 (£2.78) a day and are struggling to put food on the table. Calling on western governments to take action, the UNDP said a “debt-poverty pause” was required to redirect repayments towards critical social expenditures, adding that a failure to do so would add to the worsening poverty crisis. Many low-income countries have borrowed heavily to help cope with the pandemic and soaring costs for food and fuel, exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hitting agricultural commodity supplies and pushing energy prices close to record levels. Meanwhile, debt servicing costs are rising sharply as the world’s most powerful central banks drive up interest rates in response to soaring inflation. The UNDP, which is based in New York, said debt service payments have steadily been consuming a larger and larger share of public revenue and expenditure in developing economies, limiting the headroom for spending on vital services. Compared with the average high-income country, the latest data suggests the average low-income country devotes between double and triple the share of government revenue or expenditure on servicing interest payments. The UNDP estimates 25 low-income countries spent more than 20% of their revenues on debt servicing last year – the highest number over that threshold since the turn of the century – and said this could rise further if global interest rates continued to accelerate. Achim Steiner, the UNDP administrator, said 46 countries paid more than 10% of their general government revenue on debt interest. “Debt servicing is making it increasingly harder for countries to support their populations through investments in health, education and social protection,” he said. “Countries that could invest in safety nets over the last three years have prevented a significant number of people from falling into poverty. In highly indebted countries, there is a correlation between high levels of debt, insufficient social spending and an alarming increase in poverty rates. “There is a human cost of inaction in not restructuring developing countries’ sovereign debt. We need new mechanisms to anticipate and absorb shocks and make the financial architecture work for the most vulnerable.” Next week, finance ministers from the G20 group of countries will meet in India, with the focus being on global health, sustainable finance and tackling poverty. A report this week showed almost 30% of the $92tn of government debt in the world is owed by developing countries. Escalating borrowing costs and a stronger US dollar are making loan repayments and finance raising significantly more expensive for dozens of developing countries. Late last month the World Bank proposed that poor countries should be able to pause their debt repayments if hit by climate disaster. The UNDP said a pause in repayments, in the short run, would allow countries weighed down by debt to mitigate some of the social effects from economic shocks by using resources that otherwise would have to be used for debt servicing. George Gray Molina, the chief economist at the UNDP, said such a measure could help countries to stabilise their financial position and help prevent a “freefall” into poverty. “This is the beginning of a new adaptive social protection architecture to prepare for a future prone to shocks,” he added.",Debt relief; United Nations; Global economy; Business; Global development; Society; World news; Economics,World news
2023-10-31T05:00:33Z,Banks pumped more than $150bn in to companies running ‘carbon bomb’ projects in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/31/banks-pumped-more-than-150bn-in-to-companies-running-carbon-bomb-projects-in-2022,"Banks pumped more than $150bn last year into companies whose giant “carbon bomb” projects could destroy the last chance of stopping the planet heating to dangerous levels, the Guardian can reveal. The carbon bombs – 425 extraction projects that can each pump more than one gigaton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – cumulatively hold enough coal, oil and gas to burn through the rapidly dwindling carbon budget four times over. Between 2016 and 2022, banks mainly in the US, China and Europe gave $1.8tn in financing to the companies running them, new research shows. The climate rhetoric did not match up with what was happening on the books, said Shruti Shukla, an energy campaigner at the National Resources Defense Council, which was not involved in the investigation. “We need to rapidly decline our production of fossil fuels and support for fossil fuels, whether that’s regulatory or financial.” The carbon bombs, which were first identified in an academic database by the Guardian and partners last year, are the single biggest sources of fuels that release planet-heating gas when burned. Data for Good and Éclaircies, two French non-profits, and several European media outlets have now used publicly available data to map out the companies that operate the carbon bombs and the banks that finance them. For some projects, the datasets did not match up, were out of date or had an unclear operation status. But the researchers are confident that at least 20 of the 425 have started running since 2020, most of which are coalmines in China, while three projects have been stopped. In total, the researchers estimate that there are now as many as 294 projects running and at least 128 that are yet to start. Between 2016 and 2022, the research shows, banks in the US alone were responsible for more than half a trillion dollars of finance to companies planning or operating carbon bombs. The single biggest financier was JPMorgan Chase, providing more than $141bn, followed by Citi, with $119bn, and Bank of America, with $92bn. Wells Fargo was the seventh-biggest financier, with $62bn. Also in the top 10 were three Chinese banks – ICBC, Bank of China and Industrial Bank (China) – and three European ones – BNP Paribas, HSBC and Barclays. The bulk of the money they provided was general corporate financing to operators, rather than direct loans for projects to dig up fossil fuels. In 2022, direct and indirect financing of carbon bombs came to an estimated $161bn. Bringing planned carbon bombs into action would run counter to increasingly stark warnings from doctors, energy experts and climate scientists about the urgent need to swap to cleaner sources of energy. In 2021 the International Energy Agency found no room for continued expansion of fossil fuel extraction projects in its net zero emissions scenario. A recent Nature study reassessed the amount of fossil fuels that could be burned if realistic levels of carbon dioxide removal are assumed. It found that between 2020 and 2050, the supply of coal must fall by 99%, oil by 70%, and gas by 84% to keep the planet from heating by 1.5C above preindustrial levels. If those targets are not met, extreme weather will continue to grow increasingly violent, experts have warned. If they are met, experts said many carbon bombs will become stranded assets that need to be written off, which some fear will shock the financial system. “If that happens rapidly, we could have another financial crisis,” said Jan Fichtner, a sustainable finance research fellow at the University of Witten-Herdecke, who was not involved in the research. To avoid this, the profitability of oil and gas must be tackled, he added. “In a capitalist system, profitability is the most important current. You can try to swim against the current, it’s possible, but it’s very, very difficult.” In response to the findings, a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson said: “We provide financing all across the energy sector: supporting energy security, helping clients accelerate their low-carbon transitions and increasing clean energy financing with a target of $1tn for green initiatives by 2030. We are taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 emission intensity reduction targets in the six sectors that account for the majority of global emissions, while helping the world meet its energy needs securely and affordably.” A spokesperson for HSBC said: “Supporting the transition to net zero and engaging with clients to help them diversify and decarbonise is a key priority for us. We are working to align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050.” Barclays said it had set 2030 targets to reduce the emissions it finances in five high-emitting sectors, including energy, where it has achieved a 32% reduction since 2020. “Aligned to our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we believe we can make the greatest difference by working with our clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model, reducing their carbon-intensive activity while scaling low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and capacity,” a spokesperson said. BNP Paribas said that in 2021 it “strongly reinforced” its withdrawal trajectory from fossil fuels and aims to further shift its energy-based financing to 80% for low-carbon sources by 2030. A spokesperson said: “BNP Paribas is turning the page on fossil fuels and is focused on mobilising its resources to low-carbon energies. Analyses covering the period between 2016 and 2022 do not reflect the dynamic of BNP Paribas in terms of financing the energy sector. Indeed, BNP Paribas updated in 2023 its oil and gas policy with this engagement: BNP Paribas will no longer provide any financing (loans and bonds) dedicated to the development of new oil and gas fields regardless of the financing methods.” Wells Fargo, ICBC, Bank of America and Citi declined to comment. Bank of China and Industrial Bank (China) did not respond to a request for comment. When the Guardian revealed the carbon bombs last year, scientists thought the remaining carbon budget to give a half chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C was about 500 gigatons of carbon dioxide. But on Monday, leading climate scientists published an update that put the figure at just 250 gigatons. The carbon bombs could release more than 1,000 gigatons over their lifetime.",Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; European banks; Europe; Banking; Commodities; Financial sector; Chinese economy; US economy; UK news; China; Energy; World news,Environment
2023-10-31T11:16:19Z,"France is Europe’s biggest supporter of ‘carbon bomb’ projects, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/31/france-carbon-bomb-projects-banks-fossil-fuels-climate,"France is Europe’s biggest supporter of “carbon bomb” extraction projects that hold enough fossil fuels to pump out more than a gigaton of CO2 each, the Guardian can reveal. Since world leaders gathered in the French capital to sign the Paris agreement in 2015 – where they promised to try to stop the planet heating by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – French banks have financed companies planning or operating carbon bombs amounting to $154bn. The carbon bombs are the 425 biggest fossil fuel extraction projects in the world. Beneath them, there is enough coal, oil and gas to burn through humanity’s carbon budget to stay within 1.5C four times over, experts say. “Fossil fuel companies and banks have implemented a cynical strategy,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a climate scientist at CEA Paris-Saclay who co-chaired the physical science section of the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Despite an aim to become carbon neutral by 2050, she said, they were “acting now to increase the use of fossil fuels and thus emissions – deliberately ignoring one of the strongest scientific findings relating cumulative CO2 emissions with global warming levels”. Research by the French NGOs Data for Good and Éclaircies, together with European media outlets including the Guardian and Le Monde, found that French banks poured more money into the companies operating these projects than those of any other country in Europe, behind only those of China and the US. The four French banks – BNP Paribas, BPCE Group, Crédite Agricole and Société Générale – together invested $17.8bn in 2022 in companies planning or operating carbon bombs, the research found. Over the six-year period from 2016, the recipients ranged from oil and gas companies in the US to state-owned energy companies in countries from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to China. The original database of carbon bomb projects came from a research paper that counted 425 coalmines, oilfields and gasfields with potential lifetime emissions greater than 1 gigaton of CO2. French researchers then matched them up with data on operators from Global Energy Monitor and data on financiers from Banking on Climate Chaos, an NGO report covering the 60 biggest banks. For some projects, the information did not match up with the data used to identify the companies and banks. Some others were out of date or had an unclear operation status. Lou Welgryn, the co-president of Data for Good, which led the research, said: “There is very little public and reliable data available to identify fossil projects worldwide, their total reserves, associated greenhouse gas emissions, and the actors involved. “This opacity, in some cases, leads us to underestimate the number of projects associated with a company or the financial flows between a bank and companies operating carbon bombs.” The French energy company TotalEnergies is involved in at least two dozen carbon bomb projects around the world, the research showed. A separate report from Greenpeace last week counted 33 carbon bombs in which TotalEnergies was involved, calculated using a less conservative methodology that counted upstream emissions. The report also found TotalEnergies was implicated in the acquisition of new exploration licences for 84 projects since 2015. Eleven of these were after 2021, when the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that all new oil and gas exploration was incompatible with with its net zero emissions scenario. Edina Ifticene, a fossil fuel campaigner with Greenpeace France, said TotalEnergies presented itself as providing a service to the public by meeting demand for fossil fuels. “But it is by developing new oil and gas projects that the fossil fuel industry artificially creates this demand – so they can reap outrageous profits and lock us into decades more of dependence on fossil fuels.” A spokesperson for TotalEnergies said: “The IEA forecasts growth in oil and gas production between now and 2028. In this context, we continue to invest in new oil projects to meet the still growing global demand, particularly in developing countries. And, in anticipation of the natural decline of our current fields (4% per year), to continue to guarantee our customers access to energy available at an affordable cost.” The spokesperson also pointed to TotalEnergies’ plans to increase its renewable capacity fivefold by 2030, adding that the company would invest nearly €5bn in renewable and low-carbon energies in 2023 – the first time its investments into low-carbon energies would be greater than its investments into new fossil fuel projects. “TotalEnergies is therefore implementing its ambition in a concrete way while continuing to meet the energy needs of growing global populations,” the spokesperson added. A spokesperson for BNP Paribas said it had stopped lending to some of the companies on the list, adding that one of the underlying databases contained errors that artificially inflated its figures. BNP Paribas updated its policies this year, the spokesperson said, and would no longer finance new oilfields and gasfields, regardless of the financing method, and that it aimed to further shift its energy-based financing to 80% for low-carbon sources by 2030. They said: “BNP Paribas has taken a proactive approach to reduce financing for highly emitting sectors.” A spokesperson for Crédit Agricole also disputed the figures in the report, saying it included double counting, and that most of the projects in the list had been in operation for many years. They said: “We have made a commitment to no longer finance any new coalmining projects or companies developing such projects. We have also made a commitment not to finance any new oil exploration-production projects.” The spokesperson confirmed the promise referred only to project financing, not corporate financing, but said the company was committed to reducing its credit exposure to upstream oil 25% from 2020-25, in line with the IEA’s net-zero scenario. A spokesperson for BPCE Group said it supported all its customers, including big energy companies, in their energy transition and decarbonisation strategies. “This partnership approach is essential and is more beneficial than an abrupt halt to the financing provided to customers. BPCE Group is convinced that these players, because of their technical and financial capacities, have the necessary levers to accelerate the energy transition by developing renewable and low-carbon energies.” A spokesperson for Société Générale said it had set “some of the most ambitious targets in our industry” in September. These included reducing its exposure to oil and gas production 80% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, ending support from 2024 for new oilfields and gasfields for which a final investment decision was taken after 2021, and stopping offers of financial products and services to any private company that derives almost all of its revenues from upstream oil and gas activities. Big energy companies often have enough money to finance their own exploration projects. But campaigners say banks could still defuse carbon bombs by refusing to finance their operators. “Just by virtue of their scale, the biggest banks in the world can offer better interest rates,” said Joe Thwaites, a sustainable finance campaigner at Natural Resources Defense Council. “If you have major financiers refusing to finance fossil fuels, it’s not to say that the extraction companies won’t be able to find other sources, but they may have to pay a premium. It’s the equivalent of if you’re unable to go to a high street bank and you’re forced to go to a loan shark.” Banks often argue that if they do not finance fossil fuel projects, somebody else will, he added. “That’s the drug dealer’s defence.”",Fossil fuels; Environment; Energy; Fossil fuel divestment; Banking; France; World news; Europe; Business; BNP Paribas; Crédit Agricole; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Greenhouse gas emissions; Paris climate agreement,Environment
2023-07-29T02:42:31Z,Pacific pulling power: western leaders rush to region in effort to counter China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/29/pacific-pulling-power-western-leaders-rush-to-region-in-effort-to-counter-china,"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, took off his suit jacket and tie on Friday and wandered through more than a mile of the wild forests of Papua New Guinea, accompanied by the country’s prime minister, James Marape. The leaders’ walk through the lush Varirata national park was underlined by the signing of a new environmental initiative – backed by French and EU financing – that will reward countries that preserve their rainforests. At the final stop on their forest walk, they both came to a panorama of partially forested hills stretching into the distance, newly named in the VIP visitor’s honour: “Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frederic Macron Lookout”. Macron’s Papua New Guinea tour capped off a wave of diplomatic manoeuvres across the Pacific this week that included trips by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin. The flurry of high-level visits comes amid a growing battle between the US and China for influence in the South Pacific. Beijing has sought to establish influence through aid and financing projects and last year it struck a security agreement with Solomon Islands. In response, Washington and its allies have stepped up diplomatic efforts and expanded military cooperation in an effort to reinforce links with Pacific governments and provide a counter to China. Green diplomacy Macron began his trip in New Caledonia, followed by Vanuatu and then Papua New Guinea. The presidential palace said the purpose of Macron’s trip was as much to “re-engage” France in the Pacific as “offer an alternative” to the growing influence of China in the region. France assumes sovereignty for three territories in the Pacific: New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna. Macron used the visit to tell to Pacific leaders that France understands the threat they face from a warming Earth, from rising seas swamping low-lying islands to a loss of wildlife, wilder weather and the financial costs they impose. It is a message he emphasised on the eroded coastline of New Caledonia and in the sea-threatened archipelago of Vanuatu, where he joined a call for the phasing out of fossil fuels. Macron’s environmental push in the South Pacific is not unique: others including the United States, China, Australia and New Zealand finance significant climate change aid in Pacific island states. However, the so-called Forest, Climate, Biodiversity project, signed on Friday with Papua New Guinea and to be managed by the French development agency, was the key plank of Macron’s visit to Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea sees renewed focus The visit by Macron – as well as from Austin earlier in the week – mark an increasing strategic focus on Papua New Guinea. This year the country in the south-west Pacific has received visits from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. The US president, Joe Biden, cancelled a planned trip due to the then unresolved US debt ceiling crisis. While in Port Moresby, Austin discussed the next steps following the recent signing of a defence cooperation deal that would expand the Pacific island nation’s capabilities and make it easier for the US military to train with its forces. The defence secretary, however, stressed the US was “not seeking a permanent base” in Papua New Guinea. “We have a longstanding relationship with Papua New Guinea and we share that vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific and we both really respect the rules-based and value the rules-based international order,” Austin said. Marape said Papua New Guinea’s military “stands to benefit, but more importantly … with our military, the economy and the country-to-country relationships will be strengthened going forward.” After the surprise security agreement between China and Solomon Islands was announced last year, Washington sought to present itself as a counter to Beijing’s expanding influence in the region. The United States – the dominant military force in the South Pacific since the second world war – responded by announcing new aid, opening embassies in the region and signing pacts, like the one with Papua New Guinea. China’s ‘problematic behaviour’ Blinken began his trip in to the region on Wednesday by officially opening a new US embassy in Tonga. While there, he called out what he saw as “problematic behaviour” by Beijing. During a press conference with the Tongan prime minister, Siaosi Sovaleni, Blinken stated that the US had no objection to China’s engagement with the region but there were concerns that its investments needed to be transparent and undertaken with sustainable finance. Blinken and Sovaleni later discussed the bilateral relationship, as well as regional and global issues, according to state department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Miller said the US was “following through” on commitments made by Biden to “elevate our diplomatic and development presence and engagement in the region”. He said the visit also highlighted US efforts to tackle the climate crisis in the Pacific. Blinken then travelled to New Zealand and has ended his trip with Austin for a meeting with their counterparts in Australia. While there, Austin sought to highlight what he labelled China’s “bullying behaviour”. China has imposed a series of official and unofficial trade barriers against Australian exports in recent years, including coal, wine, barley, beef, seafood and wood. Since a change in Australia’s government last year, the relationship between Canberra and Beijing has been seen to be thawing.

2023-04-25T15:02:42Z,Climate protesters call out US banks for funding fossil fuel projects,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/25/climate-protest-citibank-banks-fossil-fuel-funding,"As they exited their office in Tribeca on Monday afternoon, Citibank employees were confronted with a boisterous crowd chanting and dancing along to the music of a mariachi band. It was a funny sight: New York banking professionals in black and gray business attire coming face to face with a loud, colorful group on a mission to engage in a conversation about the climate crisis. One woman dressed as a sunflower attempted to approach a Citibank employee, but her efforts were in vain. Some waved off invitations to take a flyer or walked past the protesters, ignoring them altogether. Climate activists swarmed parts of New York and San Francisco on Monday afternoon, demanding that banks enact actionable climate resolutions on the eve of their annual shareholders meetings – when crucial decisions about fossil fuel funding are made. Standing outside Citi’s New York headquarters was Siuli Gowilt, who belongs to Third Act, a group of protesters over the age 60 using their leverage with financial companies. “As retirees, we have a lot of money in places like Citibank, Fidelity, Vanguard, Chase and Wells Fargo, and they’re using our money to fund new fossil fuel projects. We’re asking them to stop it.” Earlier on Monday in a linked action, activists protested outside a Wells Fargo in San Francisco. The latest report last week from Banking on Climate Chaos, an organization that tracks bank financing for companies in the fossil fuel industry, found that US banks had loaned over $4.6tn to the fossil fuel industry since 2016, the year the Paris climate agreement was struck. The report says Citi, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are the worst offenders, contributing a combined $1.3tn to fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobile, Shell, Chevron or ConocoPhillips by financing their projects. Scrutiny of ongoing financing of fossil fuel projects comes after promises made by many of these banks to cut back on fossil fuel funding. Wells Fargo’s website says: “Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. Wells Fargo is committed to aligning our activities to support the goals of the Paris Agreement and helping transition to a net-zero carbon economy.” Citi has taken pains to establish its image as a climate-conscious financial organization. A Citi representative told the Guardian: “Citi recognizes the importance of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. That’s why we’re investing in clean energy solutions through our net zero commitments and our $1tn commitment to sustainable finance, while working with all our clients, including our fossil fuel clients, to support their efforts to decarbonize their businesses. Our approach reflects the need to transition while also continuing to meet global energy needs.” A 2022 Citibank “Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures” report said: “Citi has committed to achieving net zero emissions associated with our financing activities by 2050, and net zero emissions for our operations by 2030.” In a public letter published in January 2022, Citi Bank’s CEO, Jane Fraser, wrote: “We know it is not enough to say Citi is committed to tackling climate change. That’s the easy part. As the world’s most global bank, we can help drive the transition to a net zero economy and make good on the promise of the Paris agreement.” But activists, like those outside Citibank’s headquarters in New York, say these banks are engaging in “greenwashing”, or marketing themselves as pro-climate when their actions say otherwise. Citibank is the world’s second biggest fossil fuel funder – JPMorgan Chase leads the way – according to the Banking on Climate Chaos report, pumping $333bn into the sector since the Paris climate agreement. Members of Extinction Rebellion were arrested in New York on Monday afternoon for spray-painting phrases such as “Climate Criminals” on the windows of Citibank’s office. Mark Graham, an Extinction Rebellion member since 2019, is a former Citigroup employee, where he worked as a managing director for 15 years. Now, he finds himself on the outside of the towering building. Graham said: “It is the financial companies which are at the intersection of funding climate chaos. It is the pressure point that we can work. We’re hoping to get the employees to realize they have power. “The question is: are you doing enough? The answer is no. We have to change radically.”",Fossil fuel divestment; US news; Banking; New York; San Francisco; Business; Climate crisis; Environment,Environment
2023-04-21T15:00:45Z,Labor promises to ‘grab this opportunity’ to become renewable energy superpower,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/22/labor-promises-to-grab-this-opportunity-to-become-renewable-energy-superpower,"The Albanese government has promised to “grab this opportunity” to become a renewable energy superpower after holding a high-level roundtable with major banks, financiers and investment managers. The Friday roundtable in Brisbane comes after the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said on Monday that next month’s federal budget would see major investments in “cleaner and cheaper” energy. Chalmers joined more than 30 figures from clean energy and climate, including representatives of investors and superannuation funds with more than $2tn under management. But investors at the Brisbane roundtable warned the US government’s multi-billion dollar package to attract and build clean energy projects risked making it harder to attract finance for projects in Australia. The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act is creating a huge clean energy momentum that will drive down costs, but Australia will need to act quickly to take advantage of the shift, investors said. Chalmers said: “the most important part of our strategy to grow the Australian economy is grabbing these opportunities for cleaner and cheaper energy. “The government and the investment community understand that our prospects in this defining decade will be determined by how we manage and maximise this clean energy transformation.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads He again signalled a theme of next month’s budget would be clean energy and investments in industry “so Australia can be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the net zero transformation and not the victim of that transformation”. Investors and clean energy groups welcomed the roundtable – which included the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen – saying it signalled the government’s intent to put a clean energy transition at the front of its economic agenda. After the roundtable, the government said it would create a “sovereign green bonds” program to be rolled out mid-2024 to raise finance for public projects that support Australia’s net zero transformation. Bonds give investors regular interest payments with a promise to return the principal at the end of a fixed term. The government would also co-fund a development phase of an “Australian Sustainable Finance Taxonomy” – a project to help investors more easily target their funds towards particular kinds of sustainability projects. The government also announced it would expand and upgrade a national energy rating scheme for existing homes “which means people will be able to seek a star rating of their home’s energy performance”, a statement said. An extra $4.3m would go to corporate watchdog Asic to allow it to expand “surveillance and enforcement functions” on businesses making green claims. Concerns were raised during the roundtable that the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act – a US$369bn package of climate measures and incentives passed last year – was making it harder to attract capital to Australia. Anna Freeman, policy director at the Clean Energy Council who attended the roundtable, said: “The IR Act means we are facing some real risks and challenges that we will need to respond to, and the government is alert to that.” Freeman said the roundtable came against a backdrop of rising costs for clean energy projects related to post-Covid supply chain bumps, inflation and the knock-on effects of rising energy costs. But she said there was “a very strong message” the government was “focused on putting the clean energy transition at the centre” of its economic agenda. Simon Corbell, chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, said: “it was a very clear message that the IR Act is having an enormous impact on investment decisions globally. “The challenge for Australia,” he said, was to “make sure it’s got the right policy settings in place so we can benefit from the very significant decreases in technology costs that the IR Act will drive.” Rebecca Mikula-Wright, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said the IR Act “is both good for the planet and will drive down the costs for everyone else globally” but said Australia “can’t and should not attempt to match the scale of clean subsidies emerging globally”. “Instead we can be a fast-follower, acting quickly to deploy our resources and make the most of the opportunities provided to us. This enables us to focus on our value add and competitive advantage onshore. “For example leveraging our abundant renewable energy potential to manufacture green steel in Australia, further boosting industries and jobs.” John Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, said: “so many of us have been trying to blow the horn for so long to say this is a massive opportunity for the economy. “To see this at the heart of government planning is an overwhelming relief. When governments consult well, plan well and listen, we get better policy outcomes. It’s clear they want to get it right.”",Renewable energy; Energy; Australia news; Energy; Australian politics; Anthony Albanese; Labor party; Environment; Jim Chalmers,Environment
2023-03-07T08:00:30Z,Coalition and Greens team up to force Labor to release emissions modelling,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/coalition-and-greens-team-up-to-force-labor-to-release-emissions-modelling,"Jim Chalmers has accused opponents of Labor’s renewable energy policies of spinning wheels in “ideological cul-de-sacs”, as the Coalition and Greens team up to force the government to release emissions modelling. On Tuesday the Senate rejected the Albanese government’s public interest immunity claim, meaning it will be forced to release forecasts of how big industrial emitters would use carbon credits to meet obligations created by the proposed safeguard mechanism. The motion, by Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, passed without a vote after the Greens said they had secured opposition support for the ambush. The government now has until 4pm on Thursday to produce the modelling, a key input into negotiations between the Greens and Labor over the safeguards mechanism bill, which requires big emitters to reduce emissions intensity by 4.9% a year. The two progressive parties remain deadlocked, with the Greens calling for a ban on new coal and gas projects while Labor insists it has a mandate for the safeguards mechanism without a condition that would reduce supply of gas as a transition fuel. Chalmers, the treasurer, told the Australian Financial Review business summit on Tuesday that Australia had “immense potential when it comes to the climate and energy transition”. “Cheap, clean renewable energy, new industries up and along the supply chains of the net zero economy, and new ways to maximise traditional strengths,” he said. But in order to attract billions of dollars of clean energy capital by 2050, Australia must give “investors and companies clearer guardrails, and the clarity and confidence they need to invest”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It means moving up the value chain – a key focus of the national reconstruction fund. “Thanks to the work you’ve done with us – on the safeguard mechanism, on climate risk disclosure, on sustainable finance – we’re well placed to make important strides here.” The treasurer’s reference to two bills that the Greens are yet to commit to pass – the reconstruction fund and the safeguard mechanism – adds pressure to negotiations currently stuck on the question of limits on new coal and gas. Chalmers warned that “we won’t build the modern economy we need by wasting time spinning our wheels in the cul-de-sacs at either end of the ideological spectrum”. “We’re here to make a difference – not for a dose of comfortable complacency or for the performance and fakery and puffery of politics.” In a dissenting report in the Senate inquiry into the safeguards bill, the Greens warned that the safeguard mechanism will fail unless the Albanese government agrees to changes, despite having described the fossil fuel ban as an “offer, not an ultimatum”. Hanson-Young told ABC TV that evidence to the inquiry suggested “if new coal and gas entrants are allowed into the system that will see pollution overall go up not down”. “Our door is still open. The government’s door is still open. We are still talking … but [we’re] being very clear that this package needs to reduce pollution not make climate change worse.” “This is why we are saying the legislation as it is and the draft regulations, if they remain in their current form we cannot support them.” The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, told Radio National that the safeguards bill allowed parliament “either to seize the opportunity to reduce emissions by 205 million tonnes or to squander it”. “Of course, when you’re doing a big complicated reform … the Liberals will say this is a disaster, the Greens will say it doesn’t go far enough.” Bowen argued carbon credits were needed to provide firms “flexibility” with whether they reduce their own emissions or achieve a reduction in “net” terms. He said no new coal and gas “is, frankly, a slogan, not a policy”, and gas would be required until it was replaced by green hydrogen.",Australian politics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon offsetting; Fossil fuels; Labor party; Australian Greens; Coalition; Jim Chalmers; Chris Bowen; Climate crisis; Emissions trading,Australia news
2023-02-05T05:46:36Z,Jim Chalmers says it’s absurd to expect him to copy Paul Keating as critics lash values-based capitalism essay,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/05/jim-chalmers-says-its-absurd-to-expect-him-to-copy-paul-keating-as-critics-lash-values-based-capitalism-essay,"Jim Chalmers has declared it is “absurd” to think the Albanese government in 2023 will be a photocopy of the Hawke and Keating governments in the wake of a sustained backlash against his new essay championing values-based capitalism. The treasurer says the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his summer think piece, published by the Monthly last month, is out of step with sentiment in the investor community and also reveals a disconnect between some opinion leaders in Australia and cutting-edge economic policy analysis overseas. Chalmers used a speech to a Labor-aligned thinktank on Sunday to outline his policy agenda for the opening of the new parliamentary year, confirming he would release a tax expenditure statement later in the month, a review of the Reserve Bank of Australia in March, and an intergenerational report and a wellbeing framework later in the year. With parliament to sit on Monday in the first session after the summer recess, Chalmers said he was pursuing “important steps” on sustainable finance, a “new focus” for the Productivity Commission, work on regulating crypto and payments, while pursuing a housing accord with the housing minister, Julie Collins. He said high inflation would be the government’s main economic focus, and his priorities in the May budget would be providing cost-of-living relief, growing the economy in a more inclusive and more sustainable way, and repairing the budget to enable more generous social policy spending, including on Medicare and aged care. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Chalmers also addressed the sustained controversy around the summer essay. The treasurer signalled in the 6,000-word piece he wanted to expand the opportunity for “impact investing” while pressing ahead with regulatory reforms, including a “new taxonomy” to help investors “align their choices” with the government’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. On Sunday, Chalmers characterised the backlash on the opinion pages of national newspapers as, largely, “hyperventilating from the usual suspects – some with such intensity it seemed they might spontaneously combust” – although he joked the attention was likely better than “being ignored”. During a question and answer session on Sunday at the Chifley Research Centre conference, the treasurer said “there’s a contrast between some of that coverage and what you pick up in investor circles”. “People get into habits. I think people get into a habit of what their views are, and some habits were formed some time ago. That is not the case in the investor community and the international community, so I think there is a bit of a disconnect there.” Some of the criticism portrayed Chalmers’s support for values-based capitalism as a departure from Labor’s policy approach in the 1980s and 1990s. But the treasurer said the Albanese government would not be a facsimile of past Labor governments because the current government had to rise to meet contemporary challenges rather than mimic the shibboleths of the past. “My view about the changes of the last 40 years is there is much to commend, particularly in the Australian context, particularly when it comes to the Hawke-Keating legacy,” Chalmers said on Sunday. “But our job now is to make our own way in the 2020s, in this defining decade.” He said the “same things that worked for Paul in 1983 are not going to be the same things I reach for in 2023”. Chalmers said people expecting he would be a carbon copy of Keating as treasurer was “as absurd as someone saying to Paul when he fronted up to the Treasury for the first time 40 years ago and saying what we need to do is a photocopy of Ben Chifley’s policies as treasurer 40 years earlier. “You can believe in markets, you can believe in the important role of the private sector as I do … but what we need to do is a much better job of working out how do we better design and define and inform our markets so that we get the right kind of economic outcomes but also, ideally, outcomes that align with our values and our society.”",Jim Chalmers; Australia news; Australian politics; Australian economy; Labor party,Australia news
2022-08-24T04:07:31Z,RBA urges business to act now on climate threats or face potential legal action,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/24/rba-urges-business-to-act-now-on-climate-threats-or-face-potential-legal-action,"The Reserve Bank has warned banks, insurers and other businesses to act now to manage the financial threats from global warming, with directors and trustees likely to face litigation risks if they don’t take “appropriate actions”. In a broad-ranging speech on Wednesday, the central bank’s head of domestic markets, Jonathan Kearns, said the climate crisis was a “significant issue” for the economy and society. Effects would be “more severe” if actions were delayed. For financial markets, the RBA’s main focus, the challenges range from immediate and chronic risks from the intensification of extreme weather, to the legal liabilities for those in charge of companies. Kearns said the appetite for Australia’s fossil fuel exports was also likely to diminish, a so-called “transition risk” the RBA is now taking into account for potential future economic fallout. The RBA was concerned asset prices would probably become more volatile, affecting their value as security for loans. That, in turn, would require banks to reassess their books. Households and businesses may also have their ability to repay debt reduced. The RBA and other members of the Council of Financial Regulators – Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Treasury – have been working on updated disclosure rules since 2017. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While noting uncertainties remain about the scale and location of climate perils, Kearns said business, directors or trustees were increasingly exposed to liability risk “if they do not sufficiently respond to climate change”. “This risk exists not only when they choose not to take appropriate actions but also if they are not informed to take appropriate actions,” he said. Apra has already been working with the country’s five biggest banks to develop climate vulnerability assessments to account for “anticipated physical and transition risks through to 2050”. These assessments are based on two scenarios developed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening of the Financial System that has been advising up to 100 central banks and similar agencies around the world. One is for a delayed and then rapid reduction in emissions, and the other the continuation of current global policies that are insufficient to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets. The regulators were also working to develop disclosures by companies that would be both “high quality” and comparable with other nations to help investors understand the risks at play. The International Sustainability Standards Board was aiming to finish “key decisions” by the end of 2022, Kearns said. The third area of work was to provide “scientifically based definitions for what could be considered as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’” finance. Asic on Tuesday listed as a priority a crackdown on “greenwashing” by companies that exaggerated their emission cuts or other environmental efforts. Without a taxonomy of consistent definitions, Australia could find it harder to attract investment, Kearns said. “For example, the EU taxonomy may label LNG as not being a green investment unless it meets stringent requirements that are not applied in Australia,” he said. “[H]owever, in the near-term, increased use of LNG in Australia may assist a transition away from coal while renewables infrastructure is developed.” Head of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, Andy Pitman, also a member of the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute’s taxonomy project, said it was “valuable” that the RBA was addressing climate risks. “There needs to be active dialogue between groups like the RBA and those who develop the [climate] models that provide the information around future risks,” Pitman said. The Australian Banking Association said banks recognised climate change represented “a first-order risk to the Australian economy, the financial system and investors”. “Banks support the Paris Agreement and its objective to take into account the needs of a just transition while achieving a net zero emissions economy and resilient Australia,” a spokesperson said. “As part of this work, banks have worked with APRA over the last 18 months to assess climate vulnerability across their lending banks, including their mortgage portfolio. We look forward APRA publishing the outcome of this work later this year.”",Reserve Bank of Australia; Climate crisis; Banking ; Australia news; Environment; Australian economy; Banking; Business,Australia news
2022-12-05T00:01:27Z,"Sunak’s government ‘going backwards’ on green economy, says CBI",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/sunak-government-going-backwards-on-green-economy-says-cbi,"Rishi Sunak’s government is “going backwards” on building a greener economy and lacks a growth plan to soften the blow from recession, the head of the UK’s leading business lobby group has said. Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the prime minister’s lack of ambition for the low-carbon economy was leaving business bosses “confused and disappointed” after the progress made under Boris Johnson. Arguing that the government lost its “biggest champion” in cabinet for green economic growth when Johnson left No 10, Danker said: “In crude terms, most of business thinks the government is going backwards on green, having gone forwards over the past five years.” He said this was leading to “genuine and widespread concern” in company boardrooms across the country, because bosses believe the low-carbon economy of the future is one area wherer Britain could become a world leader. Warning that a “competitive prize” was being put at risk, Danker said firms wanted more action from the government on carbon capture, sustainable finance in the City of London, onshore wind and investment in renewables. “The government is strangely silent and reticent for all the levers for green growth.” Danker said failure to encourage business to invest in green projects and other productivity-enhancing schemes was weighing on the prospects for the British economy. Publishing a downbeat assessment in its latest economic forecasts, the CBI said Britain in 2023 would remain beset by high inflation, weak economic growth, low business investment and chronic worker shortages. Reflecting higher taxes, a squeeze on household incomes and a weaker growth outlook, it said business investment at the end of 2024 was on track to remain 9% below the level in December 2019, before the Covid pandemic struck. Danker said: “The country does not have a plan for growth. There are lots of ominous signs about recession and headwinds. What we’re lacking is any sense of reason to believe in investment confidence, or a market framework for growth, coming from government.” Jeremy Hunt used his autumn statement speech last month to argue that Britain could take advantage of “Brexit freedoms” to cut regulations in five key growth industries: digital technology, life sciences, green industries, financial services and advanced manufacturing. However, the chancellor also confirmed that the headline rate of corporation tax would rise by six percentage points, from 19% to 25% from April, and that the government’s “super deduction” investment relief programme would end. Aiming to restore investor confidence in the government after Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget, Hunt suggested that higher taxes should form part of the plan to show Britain can pay its way, while prioritising financial stability and bringing down inflation as preconditions for economic growth. The head of the CBI said company bosses understood the government’s aims but he warned there was a danger that firms would pull back from investing in Britain without a more robust plan for growth from the government. “We shouldn’t be trying the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng formula for growth, ie let’s cut everyone’s taxes and boost consumption. But we should be trying to boost business investment.” The CBI said chronic shortages of workers required a more flexible immigration system, as well as more investment in education and training. It called for the de facto ban on onshore wind to be scrapped, and for the government to offer companies tax relief on productivity-boosting investments. It comes with the economy expected to have already fallen into a recession in the third quarter of this year, when GDP shrank by 0.2%. The business group said it expected the recession to last until the end of 2023, with high levels of inflation, alongside falling business investment from the middle of the year and a year-long decline in consumer spending. Danker said: “It’s important that Britain finally grapples with business investment. I think Rishi Sunak gets that. Business recognise that. And yet we don’t have a strategy for it.”",Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Economic growth (GDP); Business; Rishi Sunak; Economic policy; Green economy; Environment; Politics; UK news; Economics; Boris Johnson,Business
2022-07-26T15:25:48Z,What’s really behind the failure of green capitalism? | Adrienne Buller,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/failure-green-capitalism,"Last week, temperatures crested at 40C (104F) in England, bringing the climate crisis to the fore and spurring a fresh wave of dismay. How is it, despite a steady drumbeat of extreme weather events, a rising tide of public outcry, and growing consensus across the political spectrum, that the world remains so profoundly far from the outer limits of the climate targets considered “safe”? The answer is increasingly located not in climate denial, but in a proliferation of non-solutions advocated by policymakers and business interests with varying degrees of earnestness and good intention, under the umbrella of “green capitalism”. These are proposals sold as urgent, pragmatic tools for cutting emissions or reversing ecosystem loss, but which in fact deliver neither. Take sustainable finance. By some estimates, assets invested with some sort of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria now top $35tn, prompting enthusiastic proclamations that private investors, driven by rational self-interest, are delivering a greener future. For many, it seems one really can “do well by doing good”. Unfortunately, this sense of triumph is based on little foundation. To begin with, criticisms of “greenwashing”, in which corporations and financial firms mislead customers and clients on the ecological or social credentials of their products, abound. But the problem cuts much more deeply than a few bad actors who bend the (typically voluntary) rules. Instead, the underlying motivation of ESG investing is not necessarily to achieve the “real world” positive outcomes. Rather the goal is to minimise exposure to risks – whether climate regulation or labour disputes – that could eat into financial returns. For this reason, many ESG funds hardly differ from “mainstream” funds and indices like the S&amp;P 500 (the basket of the 500 largest US corporations). Vanguard’s flagship US ESG fund, for example, has its top holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Tesla edges in at number six, followed by two different share classes of Alphabet (Google’s parent company). It would be hard to argue that many of these would be the companies springing to mind when imagining investment in a decarbonised and ecologically thriving future. Nor do some of them have particularly sterling records when it comes to the “social” pillar of the ESG acronym, whether accusations of human rights abuses and forced labour in supply chains or allegedly illegal surveillance of workers. Moreover, while many might reasonably expect a major ESG fund to be investing in the urgent transition to renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure, instead, more than 40% of the Vanguard fund is allocated to tech and financials. Energy and utilities, occupied by many of the firms we might imagine are at the heart of decarbonisation, together make up less than 1%. Importantly, this appears to be the rule, not the exception. While some specialist firms use their shareholding position to earnestly pressure companies to change their business models or allocate capital to upstart clean energy firms, much of the industry is interested not in directly financing a sustainable future but in ensuring their portfolios are aligned with one. In this sense, ESG can be much better understood as a means of betting on the likelihood of a greener, more sustainable future, rather than helping to build it. Indeed, in one particularly striking study, researchers found the strongest trait differentiating social-themed funds from their mainstream counterparts was investment in companies with relative lack of employees. From the perspective of minimising risks to private investors, this is perfectly logical: no labourers, no labour issues. From the perspective of driving positive social outcomes, it’s hardly cause for celebration. The logic underlying sustainable finance is a problem for the argument that markets are advancing a greener, kinder capitalism. Indeed, the trouble for green capitalism is that its proposed solutions strain to force the complexity of the climate and ecological crises into the narrow frame of “the market”, irrespective of whether the market is a viable arena for confronting them. As a result, these “solutions” are increasingly proving to be anything but. The imprint of green capitalism can be seen in everything from a fixation on carbon markets to the proliferation of ideas like “ecosystem services” and “natural capital”, which seek to divide ecosystems into discrete “stocks” that provide services to the economy. By this logic, a whale is valuable insofar as it captures carbon and impresses tourists. To many, the idea might seem absurd, but with $40bn in ecosystem service trading in 2018 alone, these concepts are increasingly mainstream. Claims of the scale of finance committed to net zero are not curtailing the trillions funnelled every year to the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, despite some 23% of emissions falling under carbon pricing schemes, the impact of such schemes on overall emissions falls woefully short of IPCC targets. And despite glossy images of oil majors’ “nature-based solutions” and tens of billions in annual trading in ecosystem services, biodiversity continues to decline at staggering rates. We live in a society structured and defined by market relations, and the idea that market-based solutions are the best, most pragmatic, and often only path to resolving most problems is powerfully ingrained common sense. It is, admittedly, difficult to imagine an alternative. It is also urgent and necessary. The siren song of easy win-win solutions to unprecedentedly complex and systemic crises is powerful, but must be resisted. • Adrienne is the author The Value of a Whale: on the illusions of green capitalism, and incoming Director of Research at Common Wealth",Global economy; Business; Economics; Green economy; Environment; Green politics; Apple; Microsoft; Amazon,Opinion
2022-10-11T16:30:09Z,Businesses lobby for carbon tariffs as Labor says Australia is ‘back in the game’ on climate,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/12/businesses-lobby-for-carbon-tariffs-as-labor-says-australia-is-back-in-the-game-on-climate,"The Albanese government has left open the possibility that Australia could introduce carbon tariffs as part of a suite of climate policies to help the global shift to net zero emissions by 2050. The former Morrison government railed against Europe’s proposal for a carbon border adjustment scheme, calling it “just a new form of protectionism that will undermine global free trade and impact Australian exporters and jobs”. But Labor’s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, says business groups are now lobbying for Australia to adopt its own version. Australia is poised to join the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, which has been exploring proposals for border carbon adjustment schemes and their potential impacts. The group is also sharing views on carbon pricing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. Carbon tariffs penalise companies and countries trying to evade responsibility for cutting emissions. Penalising imports from countries that don’t have serious climate policies helps preserve the relative competitiveness of domestic heavy industry by preventing so-called carbon leakage. The Business Council of Australia and Ai Group have both used submissions to the government’s review of the safeguard mechanism – one of the domestic policies that will aim to drive down industrial emissions – to argue an Australian border adjustment mechanism is worthy of consideration. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will attend his first meeting of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action during his visit to Washington DC this week. Until now, Australia had been the only advanced economy in the G20 that had opted not to sign up as a member. Bowen said the issue of border adjustments “has come up in submissions to the safeguard mechanism consultation” and, at this point, nothing was being ruled out. “The government is currently considering submissions and will respond in full over the coming months,” he told Guardian Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A border adjustment mechanism proposed by the European Union is expected to be operational by 2026. The prospect of deploying trade measures to drive countries to adopt forms of carbon pricing has helped galvanise global climate action over the past couple of years. In its submission to the safeguard review, the Ai Group notes “trade-related climate measures are becoming tangible internationally and relevant to Australia”. It says a border adjustment mechanism would “level the international playing field for Australian producers of products with a risk of carbon leakage”. The BCA says in its submission the deployment of a border adjustment mechanism “to address trade exposure is worthy of consideration as part of a broader international trade policy discussion in an increasingly decarbonised global context”. Chalmers, ahead of his departure to Washington, said joining the coalition meant Australia was “back in the game for climate action”. In a message to other members, the minister said he was “so thrilled to join this coalition of like-minded countries” and Australia was “ready to do its part”. “Australia, with its new government, is back in the game for climate action, because we know that ambitious climate action is a generational and economic imperative,” he said. Chalmers said getting the transition right was “critical to the future of all our economies – for creating new jobs in new industries, leveraging traditional economic strengths, providing certainty for investors, and promoting global stability”. He said recent disruptions in global energy markets highlighted “the urgency of this work”. He argued businesses, investors and financial institutions need to mobilise investment towards cleaner energy and manage and disclose climate risks. “As Australia’s treasurer, I have begun the task of developing clear, credible, and globally comparable climate-reporting requirements for large businesses and financial institutions – and a framework for future growth in sustainable finance,” Chalmers said. He said Australia would be “a dependable and diligent nation on climate action”. He acknowledged the particular importance of the issue to Pacific island countries, saying the climate crisis poses an existential threat “to our closest neighbours”. Fiji, the Marshall Islands and Tonga are among the 75 members of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, which also includes all G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.",Climate crisis; Australian politics; Environment; Australia news; Chris Bowen; Jim Chalmers; Carbon footprints,Environment
2023-06-08T12:00:30Z,Alarm at rightwing push to reverse clean-energy success in Texas and beyond,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/rightwing-backlash-reverse-clean-energy-success-texas,"In the scramble before the end of Texas’s legislative session last week, a must-pass bill was amended to impose new costs upon renewable energy. This came amid a barrage of anti-solar and wind power measures pushed forward by Republicans to reshape a state that has become the US’s powerhouse of clean energy. But the conservative lawmakers had help. Sections of the bill that impose new burdens upon clean energy providers were directly crafted and edited by the Texas Public Policy Foundation (or TPPF), a conservative group that has led the backlash to renewables and to make what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, according to a copy of the draft language seen by the Guardian. Several dozen edits were made to the bill’s amendments by Brent Bennett, a TPPF policy staffer, the document shows, and Texas lawmakers subsequently passed parts of this language along with the key TPPF desires – to impose new transmission costs on renewables and require them to source fossil fuel “backup” power when the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing. The passage of the bill, which funds the ongoing operation of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, was the flagship victory for TPPF even as a raft of other Republican bills that would have “shut down the renewable energy industry in Texas”, as energy analyst Doug Lewin put it, faltered. The burgeoning influence of TPPF, an organization substantially funded by fossil fuel interests and publicly lauded by Greg Abbott, Texas’s Republican governor, is the catalyst to a rightwing attempt to crimp the stunning progress of renewable energy in the state, which now produces more than a quarter of all wind-powered electricity in the US. The group’s agenda is now extending far beyond Texas, bankrolling efforts to halt offshore wind turbines in Massachusetts and to prop up coal power on native American land in Arizona while spearheading efforts to crack down on sustainable finance in energy-producing states like West Virginia. “We are very influential, we are meeting with policymakers to share recommendations and we’re having success around the country,” said Jason Isaac, a former state representative and now director of TPPF’s energy initiatives. Isaac said that TPFF regularly helped craft “certain aspects” of bills in Texas related to the state’s electricity grid or environmental, social, and corporate governance (or ESG) issues. “I think conservatives are slowly but surely moving away from variable generation and towards reliable generation,” he said of the group’s quest against renewables. Isaac claimed renewables have been unfairly propped up by a “cult-like fascination” among politicians who have pursued what he called a “dangerous and deadly” agenda to reduce planet-heating emissions. The aggressive push against renewables in Texas has alarmed environmentalists who fret it will undermine the state’s nation-leading wind industry and threaten the revenues solar and wind generates for local communities and farmers. More broadly, the template used by TPPF in Texas could hobble efforts by Joe Biden’s administration to tackle the climate crisis. “We are seeing a rush of these bills attempting to wind the clock back on renewables and TPPF really are at the point of the spear on this,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “They are transparent advocates for the fossil fuel industry and I think they pose an incredible threat to renewables. TPPF have gained incredible traction, they really are shifting the narrative in Texas. “They’ve won over the top politicians in the state, which is very dangerous. Texas is going to be critical if the US going to get to net zero emissions, so we should take this threat seriously.” TPPF’s impact can now be found thousands of miles from its base in Austin, Texas, with the group filing a lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of six east coast fishing businesses – collectively called Nantucket Residents Against Turbines – targeting a major windfarm currently under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. Slated to come online by the end of the year, Vineyard Wind will be the first major offshore wind project to be built off the US east coast. The lawsuit claimed federal agencies did not sufficiently analyze how the project, which is set to deliver enough electricity to power 400,000 homes, would affect wildlife – specifically the endangered North Atlantic right whale – and thereby violated the Endangered Species Act and slew of other environmental policies. Meghan Lapp, a seafood dealer and longtime offshore wind critic who was a plaintiff in the suit, told Reuters in 2021 that TPPF got involved in the suit at her request. As it announced its involvement in the case, the thinktank also took the unusual step of releasing a trailer called “A Heavy Wind”. The case was ultimately unsuccessful after a federal judge dismissed it last month, but the idea that wind turbines kill whales has been seized upon by conservatives, especially since December, when dozens of whales began washing up on the Atlantic coast in what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) calls an “unusual mortality event”. Noaa has said there is no evidence that offshore wind power is killing off whales, with fishing practices, boat strikes and the climate crisis among the primary dangers to marine mammals, but congressional Republicans have called on the White House to pause offshore wind development, while Tucker Carlson, then of Fox News, aired a critical series of segments called “The Biden Whale Extinction”. The assault on renewables by TPPF and its Republican allies has stunned conservatives who remain supportive of the longstanding bipartisan enthusiasm for clean energy. The reversal has been particularly stark for Texas which, blessed with the capacious, flat terrain and amenable climate for abundant wind and solar energy, was championed as a bastion for renewables by previous Republican governors George W Bush and Rick Perry, even as they embraced the ubiquitous oil industry. More than 40% of Texas’s electricity came from carbon-free sources last year, with the state now producing more wind and solar than the next three states – California, Iowa and Oklahoma – combined. This imperious status now seems uncertain. “I don’t recognize the state sometimes any more from our elected leaders. It’s like we are in a twilight zone where up is down and day is night,” said Matt Welch, state director of Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation. “I fear we’re losing our lead in the nation and the world as the source for clean energy advancement. It’s just amazing we’ve rolled up the welcome mat and told wind and solar operators they’re just not welcome here any more.” The Texas Public Policy Foundation was founded in 1989 by James R Leininger, a San Antonio-based physician who made his fortune selling hospital beds, and initially focused on the issue of charter schools before branching out into other topics such as energy. The thinktank is a member of the State Policy Network, a network of far-right non-profits across the country that fight climate-focused legislation. In 2021, the most recent year for which records are available, donations for the thinktank totaled $25.6m. Publicly available data shows that – like many State Policy Network affiliates – its largest known funder is Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist who made his fortune from fossil fuels. Entities tied to Koch have contributed at least $8.8m to the group since 2012, according to an analysis by researcher Connor Gibson. Tax filings show that the group has received donations from fossil fuel companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, but, as a non-profit, the full extent of TPPF’s fossil fuel funding is unknown. Issac said, however, it has been “many years” since large oil firms such as Exxon have donated to TPPF as these companies now ostensibly support decarbonization and environmentally responsible corporate governance, which conflicts with the foundation. He insisted that the foundation is committed to “free enterprise and individual liberty” and the eradication of “market distorting” subsidies, not just for renewables but also fossil fuels. But Welch said that Republican lawmakers, backed by TPPF, have ditched any ideological consistency by heaping onerous restrictions on renewable energy development on private property, in some cases attempting to impose requirements absent from oil and gas drilling, and trying to slash subsidies for the industry at the same time as offering state support for the buildout of new gas plants. One proposed bill that didn’t get sufficient backing in the latest Texas legislative session would have placed stringent new rules for wind and solar projects, including written permissions from neighboring property owners and setbacks of up to half a mile from the edge of a property for wind turbines. Another would have cut all subsidies for renewable energy. “On a Tuesday these lawmakers will be adamantly for private property rights, but on a Thursday they will want to stop the growth of renewable energy even though it’s on somebody’s private land,” Welch said, adding that TPPF was once full of “mini Milton Friedmans for years until recently, and now all of a sudden they throw that out the window. “It’s been a shocker. It’s so hypocritical,” he said. “I used to be an acolyte of TPPF but they are now driven by oil and gas billionaires who want to stop alternative forms of energy to benefit their own bottom line. They’ve sold their soul to the almighty dollar.” Renewable energy remains broadly popular with the Texas public for delivering cheap, clean power along with an injection of cash for entities such as school districts, but affection has somewhat curdled among some of the state’s Republican leadership. A devastating winter storm in 2021, which left millions of Texans without power and led to several hundred deaths, was a major accelerant of this trend. In the days following the crippling event, known as winter storm Uri, Abbott and other leading Republicans pushed the blame for the power blackouts upon renewable energy, with misleading pictures of frozen wind turbines from Europe quickly circulating social media as the supposed cause of the grid’s breakdown. Subsequent studies have made clear the primary cause of the blackouts were frozen gas pipelines and a lack of infrastructure resiliency to extreme weather, rather than renewables per se, but the perception of faulty wind and solar has stuck, eagerly fanned by TPPF. “I still believe [renewables] deserve a lot of the blame,” said Isaac. “The storm was helpful in educating people who just assumed when they flip a switch the lights come on that there are issues with grid reliability, that solar panels covered in snow don’t produce electricity.” Isaac said the foundation accepts that the climate is changing but disputes that this is harmful to people, claiming that the benefits of burning of fossil fuels “far outweighs” any negatives, including deadly air pollution, which he asserts isn’t an issue for the US and its “near natural” air quality. Scientists have, in fact, found that the climate crisis poses huge and growing risks to humanity, with airborne pollutants from burning coal, oil and gas linked to an array of different health problems. While the most severe of the anti-renewables bills pushed forward in Texas didn’t pass the legislature this year, Isaac said that TPPF remains undaunted and will continue to agitate against what he called “the false panacea of variable power”. Supporters of clean energy said they expect further battles ahead to prevent Texas’s progress in solar and wind from being unwound. “With the growth trajectory of renewable energy, TPPF can either get on the train or lay down in front of the tracks,” said Welch. “I suspect they won’t rest on their laurels. They’re going to come for renewables again and again and again.”",US news; US politics; Republicans; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment,US news
2022-10-25T23:01:45Z,Businesses call for nature impact disclosures to be mandatory by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/26/mandatory-disclosure-impact-nature-2030-cop15-aoe,"More than 300 businesses, including H&amp;M, Sainsbury’s and Nestlé, have urged world leaders to make it mandatory for companies to assess and reveal their impact on nature by 2030. Businesses and financial institutions in 56 countries – including the UK, Canada and China – are pushing for governments to agree to the disclosures at Cop15, the UN biodiversity conference being held in Montreal this December. In an open letter to heads of state, business leaders said the business and financial status quo was “economically shortsighted and will destroy value over the long term”. If agreed, the pledge would apply to all large companies across the 196 countries signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the global agreement on protecting nature. It follows increases in the number of companies making pledges to reduce emissions, with climate disclosures now mandatory in the UK, France and New Zealand, and pressure mounting for other countries to take action. The firms, which have combined revenues of more than $1.5tn (£1.3tn) and also include BNP Paribas, Aviva Investors, Salesforce, Tata Steel and Unilever, have agreed to assess their impacts on nature, disclose that information and publicly commit to reducing their negative effects. If parties don’t agree to make these disclosures mandatory, they will be voluntary. Various tools are being developed to measure companies’ impacts on nature but the methodologies must be standardised and supported by science, the group says. The open letter was released alongside a report published by Business for Nature, the Capitals Coalition, and CDP, a non-profit specialising in environmental disclosure systems. “They know there can be no business on a dead planet,” the report says. “They stand ready to transform their businesses and are calling on governments to set the rules of the game through legislation that will create fair competition for business.” Scientists say the biodiversity crisis is as serious as the climate crisis, with an estimated 1 million species at risk of extinction, yet there is less information about how businesses affect biodiversity because this data is not being disclosed. More than 18,600 companies worldwide disclosed data about their impact on climate via CDP in 2022, yet just over 1,000 firms disclosed data on forests – and 4,000 on water security – according to the report. A landmark review published last year by the Cambridge University economist Prof Partha Dasgupta found that the world was being put at “extreme risk” by the failure of economics to take into account the true value of the natural world. The new report argues that making disclosure mandatory would create fairer competition for businesses, increase accountability and encourage more responsible sourcing of materials. Eva Zabey, the executive director of Business for Nature, said: “This is an essential first step. Without this information, we are flying blind into extinction. Frameworks being developed now will support this transition, and companies stand ready to transform their businesses.” Leyla Ertur, the head of sustainability at H&amp;M, said: “We are looking into opportunities to change the materials we use towards 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials, which are less resource-intensive – basically, less land use, water, pesticides and chemicals.” Ertur said this would include focusing on using more organic cotton and increasing existing services such as repair, rental and use of secondhand products. When asked whether the company would encourage consumers to buy fewer clothes, she said the focus was about the quality of products, not the quantity. Katie Kedward, a sustainable finance economist at University College London, who was not involved in the report, said it was good to see the push for mandatory disclosures. “However, mandatory disclosures will only be effective in addressing biodiversity declines if they rapidly translate into transforming nature-depleting business models, and there are good reasons why it may not deliver the pace of change needed in time,” she added. Disclosing impacts on nature is much more complicated than reporting climate impacts, which have one set of metrics – greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiversity is based on a number of different metrics and data sources, which not even ecologists can agree on. Kedward said: “It is far cheaper for these companies to spend the next eight years developing nature disclosures than it is for them to forgo their current business activities linked to nature destruction. Mandatory disclosures are an important solution, but an eight-year implementation time horizon is akin to a giant box-ticking exercise that kicks the can of real action down the road.” Dr Sophus zu Ermgassen, an ecological economist at the University of Oxford, said disclosure cannot be a substitute for strong state action to stop investing in environmentally damaging activities. He said: “Making nature disclosure mandatory would be a positive step, but we should recognise that providing investors information about firms’ exposure to nature-related risks and hoping that this will change the way they invest relies on some very risky and questionable theories of change.” • This article was amended on 26 October 2022 after Business for Nature informed us that they had inadvertently listed a number of countries twice in their total of those being pushed for change by businesses and institutions.

2022-09-11T17:30:37Z,Reasons for (cautious) optimism: the good news on the climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2022/sep/12/reasons-for-cautious-optimism-the-good-news-on-the-climate-crisis,"There is no shortage of things to say about what’s going wrong. The extent of damage caused at 1.2C of global heating since pre-industrial times is living up to what climate scientists have long forecast. As discussed last week, the disastrous toll of the historic flooding in Pakistan and heatwaves and droughts across the northern hemisphere summer appear signs of escalation. A peer-reviewed study found several disastrous climate tipping points, including the collapse of Greenland’s ice cap and Gulf Stream currents in the Atlantic Ocean, may now be unavoidable. But there is also evidence that action to combat the climate crisis is belatedly accelerating. Acknowledging that every fraction of a degree of global heating avoided makes a difference, here are some things to be positive about. Falling emissions in China While Australia’s emissions increased in the most recent data, China – the world’s biggest annual carbon polluter – recorded an 8% fall in the June quarter and a 3% cut year-on-year. As reported by analyst Lauri Myllyvirta in Carbon Brief, the drop compared with the same period in 2021 was 230m tonnes – equivalent to nearly half Australia’s annual emissions, and the largest cut in Chinese carbon pollution in at least a decade. It was driven by both short and long-term trends: a real-estate slump, Covid-related restrictions, weak growth in electricity use and continued renewable energy expansion. It is too early to say whether this is a permanent decline – a recently announced stimulus package may encourage construction and both clean and dirty energy use – but it is the fourth straight quarter in which pollution has fallen. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For all the talk that China is continuing to build coal-fired power plants, electricity generation from burning the dirty fuel was down by 4% in the first six months of the year. As with most types of infrastructure, the country is building more coal capacity than it needs. This could yet be reversed, at least temporarily – coal-fired power has rebounded in recent weeks as hydro capacity slumped due to extreme drought and heat, and China’s commitment to the UN is that its emissions will peak before 2030. Renewable energy – particularly solar – is happening A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found more people are now employed in clean energy (which it defined as including renewable energy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency measures and nuclear power) than the fossil fuel industry. One small problem: clean energy jobs are not as well paid, in part because they are less likely to be unionised. But the argument that there are no jobs in clean energy has dissipated. Clean energy investment has grown by 12% a year since 2020, in part due to the rise of public and private support for sustainable finance, especially in wealthy countries. Renewable energy, new grids and energy storage account for more than 80% of total power sector investment. The IEA estimates spending on solar, batteries and EVs is now growing at a rate consistent with reaching global net zero emissions by 2050. In Europe, where Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upturned the energy supply, there has been a significant swing towards renewable energy even while countries offer short-term support for fossil fuels to keep lights and heating on. The British thinktank Ember found a record northern summer of solar generation meant the continent was able to avoid spending €29bn($A43bn) on gas. Across the EU’s 27 countries, renewable energy provided 35% of electricity, compared to 16% from coal. According to an analysis by Bloomberg NEF, manufacturing of solar polysilicon – the semiconductor used in photovoltaic panels – is happening so rapidly that the entire supply chain needed to bring emissions to a halt is already under construction. It’s nearly all in China – just one of many potential complications outlined by Bloomberg’s David Fickling – but it says something about what is achievable. The rich are finally starting to step up (in some ways) There has been no agreement at UN climate talks on the rich paying up to help the developing world deal with the unavoidable loss and damage caused by global emissions, but the wealthy are finally moving to drive a clean energy transition in some of the countries that will matter. The goal is pretty simple – to give major rising emitters the financial and other support needed so their economic expansion steers away from fossil fuels. A template deal was announced at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, when South Africa signed a partnership Germany, the UK, the US, and the EU that promises $US8.5bn of global capital over the next three-to-five years as the country restructures its coal-dependent energy system. In June, the G7 confirmed a larger goal – to access up to $US600bn in public and private finance over five years for clean energy infrastructure in countries including Indonesia, India, Senegal and Vietnam. Along with other steps, such as G20 countries promising to stop financing new coal power overseas and the Asian Development Bank’s energy transition mechanism, it could re-draw what is possible. Ensuring local communities are not exploited or left behind in the process will be vital for its success. The US landed its white whale This is arguably the greatest reason for optimism this year. After years of trying and failing, the US – the biggest historic emitter – has passed major climate change legislation through its Congress. Analysis has found the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could propel the country to a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels – a big leap from where it was otherwise headed. If its political system holds together it should put the national target of a 50% cut this decade, and bigger cuts beyond, within reach. One key point to note: the US law underlines that penalising fossil fuel industries by pricing carbon is, while not dead, out of fashion. The IRA is mostly about investment – $US370bn of it – to help clean solutions usurp the old, dirty model. Much of it will be available only to goods manufactured in the US. Experts say in addition to cutting local pollution, this could also increase competition and lower costs on international markets. Australia is no longer a complete laggard Compared with the US, the passing of Australia’s first climate change legislation in a decade is minor news – it is a smaller country and a more modest bill – but it is still unarguably one of the positives stories of the moment. After years of Australia being bracketed with Russia and Saudi Arabia as a global laggard, the Albanese government will win praise for its new 2030 emissions reduction target (a 43% cut compared with 2005) at the next major UN climate summit in Egypt in November. But the Labor government can also expect questions. The most pertinent is likely to be the same one it is getting at home: will it really undermine its new commitment, and the global effort, by continuing to expand fossil fuel exports? It might need to develop a better answer.

2022-02-11T06:00:41Z,The UK’s net zero goal is backed by nearly all MPs | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/uk-net-zero-goal-is-backed-by-nearly-all-mps,"Following your report about the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of MPs (Tories fighting net zero plans are dragging climate into new culture war, experts say, 8 February), we hope this letter, supported by all-party parliamentary groups, will reassure your readers and the public that parliamentarians who are not fully behind net zero are a small minority. Our groups are supported by hundreds of parliamentarians, from all major parties, representing the full geography of the UK. We recognise that all our 2019 election manifestos committed to net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. We recognise the environment is now a top concern of the British public. And we recognise the spiralling climate crisis and the urgent need to transition to a more sustainable economy. There are different approaches to reach net zero, but we all support the goal. Delaying action will cost the country more, as the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility have made clear. In the national interest, we will continue to support and promote ambitious environmental leadership in parliament. Anthony Browne MP Environment APPG, Caroline Lucas MP Climate change APPG, Sir Ed Davey MP Sustainable finance APPG, Peter Aldous MP Intelligent energy APPG, Alex Sobel MP Net zero APPG, Geraint Davies MP Clean air APPG, Ben Lake MP Fuel poverty and energy efficiency APPG, Helene Hayman Co-chair, Peers for the Planet • Business Green’s editor, James Murray, is correct that to undermine the claims of the pro-fossil fuel Net Zero Scrutiny Group, it is vital to explain how the enormous upfront costs of the transition to net zero can be met, but not at the expense of the poor (‘It’s all a bit cynical’: the politicians behind the Tory attack on net zero agenda, 8 February). The fact is that a just transition to net zero is easily affordable, and poorer people and the increasingly squeezed middle class won’t have to suffer in the process. Of course, a windfall tax on Shell’s and BP’s present licence to print money is a key first step, but the question is, where will the bulk of the many tens of billions that are required come from? The key to answering this is to realise that the entire cost of tackling the Covid crisis was funded by a £450bn expansion of the quantitative easing programme. This money creation programme now needs to be expanded again to fund a post-Covid recovery that tackles not just the climate emergency, but also the cost-of-living crisis and the inequality of social provision. Also crucial will be the use of government incentivised savings, such as pensions and ISAs, and a fairer taxation system to help achieve these goals. Colin Hines Convener, UK Green New Deal Group • How depressing, but not surprising, to read your articles on the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. I am 80 years old; I have studied many short courses with the Open University and Future Learn on various environmental subjects, especially those examining the causes and effects of manmade climate change. All these courses emphasise that mitigation to reduce the amount of global heating will be financially much cheaper than adapting to it. I have been on many protests against the climate crisis. I try to live as green a life as possible. I and many others feel betrayed by politicians and scientists such as Steve Koonin, who say “there is no climate crisis”. I hope Prof Koonin does not have grandchildren who will look back in 30 years’ time and say: “Grandpa knew what to do, but he didn’t do it.” Rose Harvie Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2022-02-11T06:00:42Z,"Tory group fighting net zero ‘a small minority’, say parliamentarians",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/tory-group-fighting-net-zero-a-small-minority-say-parliamentarians,"MPs not fully behind net zero are “a small minority” and the government should stay committed to its goal, a cross-party group of parliamentarians has said. Chairs of eight all-party parliamentary groups, including on climate change, net zero, clean air and fuel poverty, have written a letter to the Guardian , vowing they will “continue to support and promote ambitious environmental leadership in parliament”. This week, the Guardian reported that the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of 19 Conservatives was accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost-of-living crisis and leading to fears of a “culture war” campaign around net zero. The signatories to the letter, which include the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire, Anthony Browne, chair of the Environment APPG; the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, chair of the Sustainable Finance APPG; and the crossbench peer Lady Hayman, co-chair of Peers for the Planet, write that they hope to “reassure your readers and the public that parliamentarians who are not fully behind net zero are a small minority”. “We recognise the environment is now a top concern of the British public. And we recognise the spiralling climate crisis and the urgent need to transition to a more sustainable economy. “There are different approaches to reach net zero, but we all support the goal. Delaying action will cost the country more,” they write. The NZSG group, which has gained widespread media coverage in the past month despite being small in number, says it does not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise. It has called for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production to address the energy crisis. Two leading members have links to an organisation often described as “climate-sceptic”, and the group’s chair has been accused by a leading climate institute of using misleading and inaccurate information. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said he believed the NZSG was “ignoring reality” and that a weak and divided government was unlikely to fight climate change to the best of its ability. He told the Guardian: “The best way to avoid continued exposure to fossil fuel price crises like the one we are currently facing is to go further and faster in the green transition. “Yet a section of the Conservative party questions this reality and the danger is a weak and divided government doesn’t take the action we need. “The problem is that we already have a government of climate delay, which by failing to take the necessary action on everything from energy efficiency to the deployment of onshore wind has left us more vulnerable as a country. “Now it refuses to support a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies who are making record profits during the energy crisis, whilst the British people face rocketing energy bills.” The Green party MP and chair of the Climate Change APPG, Caroline Lucas, cautioned that the NZSG could have undue influence on No 10, especially as Boris Johnson is weakened by scandals. Lucas, who also signed the letter, told the Guardian: “Johnson will do whatever he thinks is necessary to stay in office, including dumping climate pledges if it will buy him support from rightwing Tory MPs. He’s not only sacrificing the climate and the UK’s reputation, he’s also ditching the best way of keeping people warm and getting bills down.” James Murray, an environmental commentator and editor at Business Green, said: “If the Net Zero Scrutiny Group and its supporters are really concerned about climate change the onus is on them to set out a credible alternative plan for tackling it. “The challenge for supporters of the net zero transition is to highlight how decarbonisation is essential for tackling the climate crisis, while also addressing the specific and legitimate concerns around some of the short-term costs associated with transition that its opponents seek to exploit. It’s vital to show, for example, the huge financial and health benefits that come from energy efficiency upgrades and low-cost clean technologies and renewables. Done right, net zero can make MPs’ constituents richer and warmer.”",Green politics; Politics; Conservatives; Environment; Climate crisis,Environment
2022-01-03T12:18:54Z,Fury as EU moves ahead with plans to label gas and nuclear as ‘green’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/fury-eu-moves-ahead-plans-label-gas-nuclear-green,"The European Commission is facing a furious backlash over plans to allow gas and nuclear to be labelled as “green” investments, as Germany’s economy minister led the charge against “greenwashing”. The EU executive was accused of trying to bury the proposals by releasing long-delayed technical rules on its green investment guidebook to diplomats on New Year’s Eve, hours before a deadline expired. The draft proposals seen by the Guardian would allow gas and nuclear to be included in the EU “taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities”, subject to certain conditions. The taxonomy is a classification system intended to direct billions to clean-energy projects to meet the EU goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Habeck, who became the economy and climate action minister last month as part of a traffic-light coalition of Social Democrats, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, said the plans “water down the good label for sustainability”. Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”. Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”. She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.” She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation. However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans. France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said. He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power. Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date. Nuclear power could only be included if a project demonstrated it had a plan to deal with radioactive waste. NGOs accused the commission of seeking to evade scrutiny. WWF, a member of an official expert group on the taxonomy, said the commission had allowed just eight working days – until 12 January – to provide a formal response “to this highly complex and controversial file”, whereas most Brussels consultations last four weeks. “The European Commission couldn’t have tried harder to bury this proposal,” said the WWF spokesperson on sustainable finance, Henry Eviston. “For fossil gas and nuclear, we get a document written behind closed doors and published on New Year’s Eve. If the EU is confident in this proposal, it must hold a public consultation.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through “delegated acts” – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The plans have already attracted the ire of Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, who say this “fake climate action” contradicts the EU’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

2021-04-19T05:01:22Z,Coal financing costs surge as investors opt for renewable energy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/coal-financing-costs-surge-as-investors-opt-for-renewable-energy,"Coal financing costs have surged over the last decade as investors demand returns four times as high as the payoff required from renewable energy projects to justify the risk of investing in fossil fuels, as the world moves towards cleaner energy sources. A University of Oxford study found that over the same period the cost of investing in renewable energy sources, such as windfarms and solar arrays, has tumbled as the clean energy technologies prove they can be cost-effective and lucrative investments. The research analysed the cost of financing energy projects by tracking the “loan spreads” offered by lenders which determine how high they expect their returns to be to cover the risk of investing. Investors typically require wind and solar energy projects to make returns of at least 10% to 11% to account for the low risk of the investment. But for investments in coal, returns need to rocket to 40% to justify the rising risk that a high-polluting project might be left stranded as governments ramp up their climate action ambitions. Dr Ben Caldecott, the director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and a co-author of the report, said lower loan spreads for renewable energy projects means they could become “even cheaper for ratepayers and taxpayers”, which is a “good thing for rapidly decarbonising the energy sector”. The report collated financing costs for renewable energy over a five-year period from 2010 to 2014 compared with loan costs between 2015 and 2020. It found that the cost of financing solar farms has fallen by 20%, while the cost of financing onshore and offshore windfarms has fallen by 15% and 33%, respectively. While Europe led the way in falling costs for offshore windfarms, Australia took the lead in driving down financing costs for onshore wind, and solar financing costs fell fastest in North America. But investors are demanding higher returns from coal projects, which has caused their financing costs to climb. Loan spreads for power stations and coalmines have increased sharply, at 38% and 54%, respectively. Caldecott added that the steep hike in costs for coalmines and coal-fired power plants proves that the risk of investing in fossil fuels during the transition to cleaner energy sources, which are “sometimes viewed as distant, long-term risks”, was already “priced in today”. “The challenge is that this isn’t happening evenly and certainly isn’t occurring at the pace required to tackle climate change. In particular, financing costs will need to rise for oil and gas projects,” he said. The financial constraints which have tightened around the coal industry since the shift towards cleaner energy began have not materialised to the same extent for the oil and gas industry, according to the research. The report found that the cost of financing gas-fired power plants climbed 7% over the last decade, but for coal plants costs have surged by 38% over a similar period. While the financing costs linked to coal mining have climbed by 58%, the cost of financing oil and gas production has climbed by only 3% over the last decade. In the case of offshore oil production, costs have fallen by over 40%. Dr Xiaoyan Zhou, also from the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and the lead author of the report, said that the trend toward climate-conscious investing could see the cost of capital for oil and gas “go the way of coal”, which could have “very significant implications for the economics of oil and gas projects around the world”. “This could result in stranded assets and introduce substantial refinancing risks,” she said.",Coal; Fossil fuels; Environment; Energy; Energy industry; Renewable energy; Business; Wind power; Solar power; UK news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis,Environment
2022-02-02T15:41:37Z,EU includes gas and nuclear in guidebook for ‘green’ investments,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/eu-guidebook-taxonomy-green-investments-gas-nuclear-included,"The European Commission has been accused of undermining its climate goals after it defied critics by pushing ahead with plans to include gas and nuclear in an EU guidebook for “green” investments. Gas and nuclear were deemed bridge technologies to meet the EU’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, in long-awaited proposals on the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”, which were published on Wednesday. “The reason we are including gas and nuclear in the way we are doing it is because we firmly believe that this recognises the need for these energy sources in transition,” the EU commissioner for financial services, Mairead McGuinness, told reporters. Critics said including gas and nuclear in a guide intended to prevent greenwashing jeopardised the EU’s climate goals and hopes of keeping global heating below 1.5C. “The European Commission is significantly undermining the EU’s credibility as a climate actor,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “At the UN climate summit in Glasgow, small steps were taken towards phasing out fossil fuels. Yet, unfortunately, the commission is already turning back the clock and leaving the door open to the gas industry.” Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, said: “The EU taxonomy was envisioned as a vital tool to align financial flows with the Paris agreement. Instead, Europe is undermining its climate leadership and lowering standards in the EU and beyond. When a gold standard does emerge elsewhere, this taxonomy will be left behind.” Since the proposals leaked on New Year’s Eve 2021 – fuelling bitter accusations of a lack of transparency – the commission has made minor tweaks that make it easier for gas projects to get in the green guidebook. Gas plants can get the stamp of approval if they switch to low-carbon gases or renewables by 2035. A previous requirement to phase-in low-carbon fuels by 2026 has been dropped. The taxonomy – intended to channel billions of private money into climate-friendly investments – is fast becoming one of the biggest controversies of Ursula von der Leyen’s tenure as European Commission president. Last month Greta Thunberg and climate activists slammed the plans as “fake climate action” that flout scientific advice. In a further sign of anger, campaign group Avaaz staged a mock burial of the taxonomy on a roundabout outside the commission headquarters, with activists wearing face masks of Von der Leyen, Germany’s Olaf Scholz and France’s Emmanuel Macron. France pressured Von der Leyen to grant the stamp of approval for nuclear power, while Germany had lobbied for the inclusion of gas, although Scholz’s coalition government is split on the issue. “Europe is witnessing our biggest setback yet in our moonshot mission,” said Patricia Martín Díaz of Avaaz. “Labelling fossil gas and nuclear as green is incompatible with the EU’s 2050 climate targets and our hope of keeping 1.5C alive.” The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 375 funds holding €51tn assets under management, also urged the commission to drop gas, citing International Energy Agency studies that show Europe’s existing gas plants will have to close by 2035. “Put simply, there is no remaining carbon budget for new investments in natural gas,” the group said. Other critics include an expert panel convened by the commission, which said the plans were “not in line” with the original regulation, agreed in July 2020. In its stinging rebuke, the EU platform on sustainable finance – a group that includes industry, NGO and finance experts from EU institutions – said they had doubts about the criteria for gas and nuclear, while “many are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts that may result”. The group said only gas plants emitting less than 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour over their lifecycle should be allowed, a criteria that excludes conventional gas. In contrast, the commission would allow gas plants emitting 270g CO2e/kWh to be classed as “sustainable” until 2030. A second alternative would allow gas plants that emit an average of 550g CO2 e/kWh over a twenty-year lifespan. Critics describe this as loophole that allows new gas plants to be built on a promise of carbon capture technology that is yet to take off. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Critics have accused the commission of abusing the process, by smuggling in the controversial issues of nuclear and gas into the latest delegated act, rather than drafting a separate law. Only a supermajority of 20 out of 27 EU member states, or a majority of the European parliament’s 705 MEPs can now defeat the plans during a scrutiny period of four to six months that began on Wednesday. Commission officials played down the threat of a legal challenge from Austria and Luxembourg, describing it as “a very theoretical discussion”. Both countries oppose nuclear power, while Green ministers in the German coalition government have dismissed the plans as greenwashing. Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands had urged the commission not to label gas as green, while Germany declared its opposition to nuclear. Yet France, backed by central and eastern European member states, lobbied Von der Leyen to include gas and nuclear, which they consider as a bridge to the EU’s net zero future. The largest group in the European parliament, the European People’s party has come out in favour of gas, underscoring the difficulties of defeating the plans. “Flexibility is needed in the way we decarbonise. If, for example, Poland would like to replace a coal plant with several small gas plants, this should be possible if it helps achieve climate neutrality”, Esther de Lange, a Dutch Christian Democrat, said. Lisa Fischer, who leads the E3G thinktank’s work on climate neutral energy systems, said gas and nuclear had no place in the taxonomy. “Gas investments are not only harmful to the climate they are also increasingly financially risky. Nuclear makes the EU’s energy transition more costly than it needs to be.” In a sign of the intense arguments, McGuinness revealed that had been no unanimity among the commission’s top 27 officials; she said an “overwhelming majority” of EU commissioners had backed the plans. “We were legally obliged to do this,” she said referring back to the initial July 2020 law. Opponents in national capitals, however, say the commission had no obligation to include gas or nuclear.",Energy; European Commission; Climate crisis; Environment; Gas; Nuclear power; European Union; Europe; Fossil fuels; World news; Business; Fossil fuel divestment,Environment
2021-12-02T06:00:18Z,Farmers in England to be paid for looking after soil health from next year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/02/farmers-in-england-to-be-paid-for-looking-after-soil-health-from-next-year,"Farmers will be paid for looking after England’s soils for the first time from next year, when the first stage of the government’s new support payments begins. Environmental groups criticised the measures as puny and accused ministers of failing in their promises to use the UK’s departure from the EU to strengthen environmental protections and reduce the damaging impacts of farming. Farmers will be paid between £20 and £58 per hectare in England for basic measures to protect and nurture their soils, and nearly all farmers are likely to be eligible to apply for the payments, which will cover arable soils for crop cultivation as well as grassland, moorland and other soils. The payments, along with others to come in future for further conservation measures, are set to reach £900m a year by the end of 2024, to meet the government’s pledge to phase out the old taxpayer subsidies based on the amount of land farmed – under the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP) – and replace them with payments of “public money for public goods”. Soil protection has been chosen as the first such payment after repeated government promises to prioritise the UK’s soils, which are a vital store of carbon. Some of the measures farmers will be required to undertake in return for the payments would be routine for many farmers anyway, such as planting cover crops on bare soil over winter. Bare soils are prey to erosion and runoff, so ensuring fields are covered in a crop that can return nutrients to the soil is key to its preservation. George Eustice, the environment secretary, will announce the measures at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) rural business conference in London on Thursday. Mark Tufnell, the president of the CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, said: “UK soil contains 10bn tonnes of carbon. There is no path towards net zero without better soil management … [These payments] are a good start, and show clear intent to support and reward farmers in their environmental delivery.” But the leaders of three of the UK’s biggest green and conservation groups: the Wildlife Trusts, the RSPB and the National Trust jointly accused the government of failing to take seriously the urgent need for nature-friendly farming. They pointed to the sharp declines of native wildlife over the past three decades and said the government’s plans would do little to remedy that. Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, said: “Nearly four years has passed since the government set out its vision for the future of food, farming and the environment … But the future of wildlife and climate now looks uncertain as today’s announcement falls short of the ambitious reforms promised. Farmers need a clear path to a future where nature is at the heart of sustainable and secure food production, not the short diversion this new scheme creates.” Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, added: “There’s so much that farmers could be rewarded for doing, such as restoring peatlands and employing ambitious measures to prevent soil and pollutants from washing into rivers – to help wildlife and store carbon. It’s an absolute scandal that the government has failed to seize this unique and important opportunity to improve farming.” Under the old CAP, farmers received between £2bn and £3bn a year. Subsidies were at first maintained at £2.4bn a year after Brexit but will be reduced to £900m by the end of this parliament. Basic payments allotted on the amount of land farmed will be phased out altogether by 2027, but in the meantime farmers who received most under the old scheme face the steepest cuts – 25% of their old subsidies – while smaller farmers will have their basic payments cut by 5% next year. The shift will eventually lead to farmers signing environmental land management contracts, committing them to take measures to protect air and water quality and provide habitats for wildlife, in return for payments yet to be set out in detail. In the interim, the sustainable finance initiative – of which the soils scheme is the first part – will provide payments for basic environmental measures. Farmers are facing an uncertain future due to the impacts of the Covid pandemic combined with Brexit, which is leading to sharp declines in farm exports amid reams of new red tape, the end of the old subsidy regime and the government’s new trade deals, which some fear could unleash a flood of cheap imported food produced at lower standards than are allowed in the UK. Farming groups cautiously welcomed the new measures – which the government said had been designed to be flexible, to allow tenant farmers to apply easily, and to avoid “punitive” conditions in case of accidental breaches – but some are concerned they will not go far enough. Lynette Steel, farm policy adviser at the Tenant Farmers Association, said the payments offered were “attractive enough” when combined with other government incentives, such as the stewardship scheme which rewards farmers for meeting basic environmental conditions. But she added that current high prices for food would discourage farmers from applying: “Given today’s commodity markets, many farmers will take the view that it is more financially beneficial to farm for [food] production rather than for soil protection, under the cost structure announced.”",Farming; Soil; Environment; England; Conservation; Brexit; Climate crisis; Wildlife; UK news,Environment
2022-01-05T07:00:35Z,Fossil fuel firms among biggest spenders on Google ads that look like search results,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/fossil-fuel-firms-among-biggest-spenders-on-google-ads-that-look-like-search-results,"Fossil fuel companies and firms that work closely with them are among the biggest spenders on ads designed to look like Google search results, in what campaigners say is an example of “endemic greenwashing”. The Guardian analysed ads served on Google search results for 78 climate-related terms, in collaboration with InfluenceMap, a thinktank that tracks the lobbying efforts of polluting industries. The results show that over one in five ads seen in the study – more than 1,600 in total – were placed by companies with significant interests in fossil fuels. Advertisers pay for their ads to appear on the search engine when a user queries certain terms. The ads are appealing to businesses because they are very similar in appearance to search results: more than half of users in a 2020 survey reported they could not tell the difference between a paid-for listing and a normal Google result. ExxonMobil, Shell, Aramco, McKinsey, and Goldman Sachs were among the top-20 advertisers on the search terms, while a number of other fossil fuel producers and their financiers also placed ads. Jake Carbone, senior data analyst at InfluenceMap, said: “Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves. “The oil and gas sector has moved away from contesting the science of climate change and now instead seeks to influence public discussions about decarbonisation in its favour.” Oil major Shell’s ads – 153 were counted in total – appeared on 86% of searches for “net zero”. Many promoted its pledge to become a net zero company by 2050 and align itself with a 1.5C warming target. However, Shell’s net-zero strategy relies heavily on carbon capture and offsetting, according to a Carbon Brief analysis, which says: “Despite its ‘highly ambitious’ framing … Shell’s vision of a continued role for oil, gas and coal until the end of the century remains essentially the same.” A spokesperson for Shell said: “Shell’s target is to become a net zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. Our short, medium and long-term intensity and absolute targets are consistent with the more ambitious 1.5C goal of the Paris agreement.” Goldman Sachs, which facilitated nearly $19bn of lending to the fossil fuel industry in 2020, had the third highest number of ads. The bank’s ads appeared on almost six in 10 searches for “renewable energy”, with many emphasising its “continued commitment to sustainable finance”. Consulting firm McKinsey’s ads appeared on more than eight in 10 searches for “energy transition” and four in 10 searches for “climate hazards”. Its ads stated: “McKinsey works with clients on innovation &amp; growth that advances sustainability.” Alongside its work on sustainable investing, the company receives significant income from fossil fuel clients. In recent years McKinsey has advised 43 out of the world’s 100 most polluting companies, according to the New York Times. A spokesperson for McKinsey pointed to an op-ed written by a managing partner at the company, which states: “There is no way to deliver emissions reductions without working with these industries to rapidly transition.” Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company, which is the world’s largest oil exporter, had 114 ads on the keywords “carbon storage”, “carbon capture” and “energy transition”. A number of their ads claimed the company “promoted biodiversity” and “protected the planet”. Melissa Aronczyk, an associate professor at Rutgers University, said: “Since at least the 1980s in the US, there has been a very concerted effort by public relations agents to help polluting companies develop strategies to ‘go green’ while maintaining business as usual. “Many of the initiatives companies are taking are very piecemeal and will not amount to any kind of long-term or systemic change.” Johnny White, a lawyer at environmental charity ClientEarth, called for stronger regulation of adverts placed by polluting industries. “Fossil fuel companies spend millions on incredibly sophisticated advertising campaigns, so sorting fact from fiction can be really tricky for the public. “Damaging greenwashing has become endemic – to stamp it out we need to legislate bans on all fossil fuel advertisements, just like what happened with tobacco.” The analysis also looked at “snippets”, which are not paid-for but are chosen by Google’s algorithm as the most relevant result. The Guardian found the snippet chosen for “fracking” linked to the website of an oil and gas lobby group, the Independent Petroleum Association of America. In answer to the question: “Is fracking a threat to public health?”, the IPAA page states: “No. In fact, there is ample evidence that increased natural gas use … has improved public health by dramatically improving air quality in recent years.” A years-long piece of research by the US Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 2016 that in some cases fracking had harmed drinking water supplies. Unlike Facebook, Google does not have a publicly accessible ad library, meaning it is difficult to analyse advertising on the platform. In the EU and UK, Google only provides comprehensive data on ads which directly mention politicians or a political party, or those which feature a referendum question. A spokesperson for Google said: “We recently launched a new policy that will explicitly prohibit ads promoting climate change denial. This policy applies to all advertisers, including energy companies and financial institutions, and we will block or remove any ads that contain violating content. “When search ads do appear, they have the word “Ad” clearly labeled in bold black text in the current design. We rely on extensive user testing both on mobile and desktop to ensure ad labels meet our high standards for being prominent and distinguishable from unpaid results.” A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “ExxonMobil has contributed to the development of climate science for decades and has made its work publicly available. And as the scientific community’s understanding of climate change developed, ExxonMobil responded accordingly.” Aramco and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment. • This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to add a response from Google relating to search ads that was received after publication.",Google; Climate crisis; Fossil fuels; ExxonMobil; Shell; Aramco; Goldman Sachs,Technology
2021-03-21T16:30:39Z,Australia's miners urge Europe to define nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture as 'sustainable',https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/21/australias-miners-urge-europe-to-define-nuclear-power-and-fossil-fuels-with-carbon-capture-as-sustainable,"The Minerals Council of Australia has weighed into a European Commission climate policy debate, urging it to back fossil fuels with carbon capture use and storage (CCS) and nuclear power on a list of environmentally friendly developments. In a written submission to the commission, the minerals council (MCA) said a proposed EU taxonomy for sustainable activities intended to shape investment under a European green deal was inconsistent in how it dealt with clean technologies because it favoured solar, wind and biofuels over nuclear and CCS. The mining lobby group said it was concerned this approach would have a flow-on effect on the types of energy investments backed by EU-based companies across the globe and “increase the cost of reducing CO2 emissions”. It called for an overhaul. InfluenceMap, a London-based thinktank that tracks corporate climate lobbying, said the MCA’s submission suggested it wanted to export its “negative approach to climate policy” by pushing for changes in other parts of the world that would allow continued use of coal and gas. The MCA submission argued there was “no valid basis” for treating CCS and nuclear differently given EU countries currently used coal, gas and nuclear. It quoted the International Energy Agency in saying emissions from existing energy fleets needed to be significantly reduced by 2030 if countries were to achieve the widely held goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The minerals council said this would require technologies such as CCS. “Underpinning the MCA’s concern is the broad-ranging investment impacts the taxonomy will have, not just within the European Union but anywhere European Union-based firms invest,” the submission said. But InfluenceMap’s program manager, Rebecca Vaughan, said the MCA appeared concerned a science-led approach to dealing with the climate crisis would hurt the industries it represented. “While the MCA says it wants the EU to take a technology neutral position, its submission appears to advocate for the continued use of coal and gas with carbon capture utilisation and storage, which is clearly at odds with the commission’s science-based policy,” Vaughan said. The MCA has long been accused of hindering action to tackle the climate crisis in Australia, and campaigned aggressively against Labor’s two attempts to introduce a carbon pricing scheme. In recent years it has come under pressure to change its anti-climate stance from its biggest members, BHP and Rio Tinto. It followed the big mining companies facing repeated calls from their investors to abandon the MCA over its commitment to coal. It resulted in the MCA releasing a climate plan that said it was committed to the Paris agreement and reaching net zero emissions, but did not include a timeframe in which that target should be reached. The EU taxonomy is intended to help it meet a target of at least a 55% cut in its emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 on the way to net zero by 2050. It considers a development sustainable if it makes a substantial contribution to one of six environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of the other five and complies with minimum business safeguards. The environmental objectives are: climate change mitigation, climate adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The commission said it expected the taxonomy would “create security for investors, protect private investors from greenwashing, help companies to plan the transition, mitigate market fragmentation and eventually help shift investments where they are most needed”. Tania Constable, the MCA’s chief executive, said “the technology-led transformation required” could not happen without Australia’s minerals and raw materials. She said InfluenceMap had got it wrong. “[It] clearly opposes a lowest-cost, faster-paced approach to global decarbonisation,” she said. “The MCA and all of its members are taking serious action on climate change and are committed to the Paris agreement and its goal of net zero emissions. The MCA advocates the inclusion of all low and zero emissions energy sources in the EU’s sustainable finance taxonomy because unequal treatment of nuclear and CCUS in particular undermines the EU’s own objectives.” The final version of the EU’s sustainable finance rules was due in January but a decision was delayed until April after 10 countries objected to the initial proposal because they wanted gas to be deemed a sustainable energy source. Nuclear energy plays a significant role in some EU countries, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported its future was uncertain in wealthy nations as ageing plants were expected to close due to cost and regulatory decisions. It said this trend could affect climate goals. The forecast decline of nuclear has coincided with generation from cheaper renewable energy growing significantly from a low base. CCS, which most commonly involves capturing emissions and pumping them underground, remains at a relatively early stage of development despite pledges of billions of dollars in funding. It is used in some industrial processes, but has sometimes been financially viable only when employed to increase oil extraction from an underground reservoir. It is yet to be proved viable as a means of reducing emissions from fossil fuel power generation. One of the world’s most prominent CCS projects, the Petra Nova power generation facility in Texas, was mothballed last year because of its poor financial performance. The Morrison government has backed CCS as one of five priorities to receive support under its low-emissions technology roadmap, and opened a $50m fund for applications earlier this month. Several observers noted it was a relatively little funding if the government was serious about developing the long-stalled technology. Some of is expected to be will be dedicated to exploring the “use” of captured CO2 to turn it into products such as building materials. Nuclear energy remains banned in Australia. Some Coalition MPs and industry leaders want the prohibition lifted. • This article was amended on 23 March 2021 to include the EU’s criteria for a sustainable activity and the IEA’s assessment of nuclear generation",Energy; Australia news; Energy; Environment; World news,Australia news
2021-06-10T15:00:52Z,Prince Charles urges businesses to help lead way on climate,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/10/prince-charles-urges-businesses-to-help-lead-way-on-climate,"Prince Charles has said businesses must lead the way alongside governments in tackling the climate emergency. Before the start of the G7 summit in Cornwall on Friday, he told a gathering of political and business leaders that private-sector cash and knowhow was essential, and businesses needed strong policy signals from government. He said: “We have a potentially gamechanging opportunity to drive forward the partnerships between government, business and private-sector finance that are absolutely vital if we are to win the battle to combat climate change and biodiversity loss … unless we can actually unlock the private sector’s resources and innovation, with the public sector setting the framework of incentives and regulation, we just don’t stand a chance of solving this existential crisis that we have been engineering over the years.” The prince met John Kerry, the US climate envoy, in London on Thursday, and also convened a group of international business leaders, who will be invited to speak to the G7 leaders about the climate crisis – an unusual departure for the G7 meeting, which is normally confined to the heads of government of the US, the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany, France and Italy, plus EU representatives. Boris Johnson said: “Halting climate change and reversing biodiversity loss will require every part of our society and economy to pull together, from shipping to aeronautics and banking. The private sector has a vital role to play in accelerating the shift to clean, green technology and creating the jobs of the future, and I’m delighted to see so many major companies coming together under the Prince of Wales’ initiative to support that endeavour. “I will be putting the climate crisis front and centre of the G7 summit in Cornwall this weekend as we work together to build back better and greener from the pandemic.” Charles has set up forums for businesses in 10 key sectors to work together on cutting carbon emissions. The sectors include energy, road transport, aviation and shipping, fashion and textiles, waste management, plastic and chemicals, technology and “natural capital”, which includes farming. The business leaders called for the G7 governments to set out clear policies to show how they would meet their long-term goals of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and cutting emissions sharply by 2030. While all the G7 nations have long-term goals and 2030 targets, few have the comprehensive and detailed policies required to meet them. Brian Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, said: “Only the private sector can mobilise the trillions of dollars of capital needed to drive the transition toward a low-carbon sustainable future and meet net zero targets. The Terra Carta transition coalitions are an important next step to help drive sustainable finance. As CEOs, we welcome the leadership of the G7 to help overcome barriers and develop the right incentives to accelerate those outcomes.” Some of the industries involved will face great challenges in reducing emissions. John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, said: “Aviation is a global industry and requires collaboration through initiatives such as the Terra Carta to reach a global agreement. We are calling for a commitment from the global aviation industry to get to net zero by 2050 and for governments to set a mandate for at least 10% sustainable aviation fuels use by 2030 and at least 50% by 2050 to give the signal needed for industry to scale up supply, and price incentives to stimulate demand and foster investment.” Prince Charles has long taken a close interest in green issues, having made his first speech on the environment more than 50 years ago. He set up a forum for businesses to work on environmental sustainability, called the Sustainable Markets Initiative, and has called for a Terra Carta, a roadmap for tackling the climate and biodiversity crises. Last month he wrote in the Guardian urging small farmers to band together in cooperatives to adopt sustainable and environmentally sound farming methods. Among the topics the business leaders will raise at the G7 are ways to spur greater investment in clean technologies and projects. The heads of government are not expected to come up with detailed plans or policies on cutting emissions, but will affirm long-term goals. They are under pressure to come up with more funding to help poor nations cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, as well as providing access to Covid vaccines.",Climate crisis; King Charles III; G7; Greenhouse gas emissions; Business; Environment; UK news,Environment
2021-01-10T13:43:18Z,Shareholders push HSBC to cut exposure to fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/10/shareholders-push-hsbc-to-cut-exposure-to-fossil-fuels,"HSBC could be forced to slash its exposure to fossil fuels – starting with coal – from next year, after an influential group of investors filed a shareholder vote urging the bank to ramp up its climate commitments. Fifteen pension and investment funds are pushing HSBC to reduce the loans and underwriting services offered to clients which rely heavily on fossil fuels within a timeline consistent with Paris climate goals. The resolution – which has been coordinated by campaign group ShareAction and is also backed by 117 individual shareholders – is the second climate vote filed at a major UK bank, following a similar resolution tabled at Barclays’ AGM last year. It will be put to shareholders at HSBC’s AGM in April, and will becoming binding if 75% vote in its favour. HSBC is Europe’s second-largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays, according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). It says the bank has provided at least $87bn (£64bn) to some of the world’s largest fossil fuel firms since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016. In October, HSBC pledged to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050 at the latest, and committed up to $1tn in green financing to clients transitioning to more environmentally friendly operations. However, the bank’s climate plan does not involve turning away clients or cancelling contracts based on their fossil fuel exposure. HSBC has also stopped short of introducing a blanket ban on financing coal power. “Net zero ambitions by top fossil fuel financiers are simply not credible if they fail to be backed up by fossil fuel phase out plans,” said ShareAction’s senior campaign manager, Jeanne Martin. “Five years after the Paris agreement was signed, HSBC continues to pour billions into the coal sector, a behaviour that is at odds with limiting global warming to 1.5C. If HSBC is serious about its net zero ambition, it will support this resolution.” The resolution has been filed by firms including Rathbone Investment Management, Man Group, Sarasin &amp; Partners, and Europe’s largest asset manager, Amundi. ShareAction will not disclosed the co-filers’ combined stake in the bank. But the campaign group is approaching other institutional investors. HSBC has not confirmed whether it will support or oppose the resolution. In a statement, it said it was “strongly committed” to addressing climate change: “We are a leader in sustainable finance and expect to provide between $750bn and $1tn in finance by 2030 to support our customers in all sectors to progressively decarbonise. As we work to set out the detail of our roadmap to net zero, we continue to positively engage with our customers, shareholders and ShareAction.”",Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; HSBC; Corporate governance; Banking; Business; Energy; Environment; UK news; Paris climate agreement; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis,Environment
2021-01-11T11:03:47Z,Prince Charles urges businesses to sign Terra Carta pledge to put planet first,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/11/prince-charles-businesses-terra-carta-pledge-planet-first-nature-age-of-extinction,"Prince Charles is urging businesses to invest in the health of the planet and people at the launch of a sustainable finance charter backed by several international institutions. Evoking the history of Magna Carta, the Prince of Wales is launching the Terra Carta – the Earth charter – that will ask signatories to agree to almost 100 actions to become more sustainable by 2030. In the Terra Carta’s statement of intent, the voluntary commitments include supporting international agreements on the climate, biodiversity and desertification, backing efforts to protect half of the planet by 2050, and make investment and financial flows consistent with a future of low greenhouse gas emissions. The charter, launched on Monday before the One Planet summit in Paris, aims to raise more finance to invest in nature, citing the example of the Natural Capital Investment Alliance, which is looking to raise $10bn (£7bn) by 2022. “I am making an urgent appeal to leaders, from all sectors and from around the world, to give their support to this Terra Carta, to bring prosperity into harmony with nature, people and planet over the coming decade,” Charles will tell the conference on Monday. “I can only encourage, in particular, those in industry and finance to provide practical leadership to this common project, as only they are able to mobilise the innovation, scale and resources that are required to transform our global economy.” Companies supporting the launch of the Terra Carta include BlackRock, Bank of America and HSBC. While some signatories are big investors or financiers for the fossil fuel industry and sectors linked to biodiversity loss, the commitments signal an intention to transition to a low-carbon future that also backs biodiversity restoration. In the foreword for the launch, Charles has written about the importance of mainstreaming sustainability into all aspects of the global economy. “If we consider the legacy of our generation, more than 800 years ago, Magna Carta inspired a belief in the fundamental rights and liberties of people. As we strive to imagine the next 800 years of human progress, the fundamental rights and value of nature must represent a step-change in our ‘future of industry’ and ‘future of economy’ approach,” he states. “With this in mind, nature, of which we are an integral part, lies at the heart of the Terra Carta. I am calling on CEOs from around the world to engage and play their part in leading the global transition.” Later on Monday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Chinese vice premier, Han Zheng, will address the One Planet summit.",Environment; King Charles III; Monarchy; Conservation; UK news; Business; Green economy; Magna Carta; Fossil fuels; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis,Environment
2021-06-04T09:00:36Z,Private finance won’t decarbonise our economies – but the ‘big green state’ can | Daniela Gabor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/04/private-finance-decarbonise-economies-green-state,"The pandemic, we often hear, is forcing a rethink in economics. We are leaving behind one model: the austerity-obsessed small state that outsources the job of macroeconomic stability to unelected central banks. Central banks, in turn, worked to target inflation under a regime of benign neglect for unemployment; it was assumed, meanwhile, that the bond market should and would discipline governments into fiscal rectitude. Now, the Biden administration’s “once in a generation” spending plans suggest a paradigm shift is under way. It puts governments, through fiscal policy (taxing and spending), back in the driving seat. In this sense, macroeconomics has the potential to become more democratic. But are we celebrating too soon? The big test of the paradigm shift, possibly the fundamental test, is how we go about decarbonising our economies. There are two ways to organise the low-carbon transition: through the state itself or through the financial sector. What might be termed the “big green state” approach involves massive public investments in green infrastructure and industries. When private finance recently lamented Biden’s infrastructure plans, it was objecting to a big-state route to decarbonisation that rejects the rhetoric of public-private partnerships. Indeed, the “big finance” approach wants the state – through its fiscal and central bank arms – to simply guide the private sector by changing price signals. In this scenario, the state plays a smaller role, making carbon expensive by forcing companies to pay for polluting. For instance, Germany recently introduced a €25 (£21) tax per tonne of carbon emissions on petrol, diesel, heating oil and gas. Higher carbon prices, the wisdom goes, will incentivise producers and consumers to transition to green energy. Private finance is there to lend the money that this transition requires. The numbers behind private green investment seem to add up: there is now $30tn (£21tn) in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) assets. The green “rush” is expected to accelerate as central banks move to decarbonise their operations and reduce subsidies to carbon-intensive activities. Take the Bank of England’s plans: under its new environmental mandate, it argues that the transition to net zero must be largely financed by private finance (as opposed to the state), in an orderly fashion that requires central banks to subsidise green and only “escalate” to penalising carbon financiers if, over time, companies fail to meet commitments towards decarbonisation. The strategy of cuddling carbon financiers is at the heart of the Cop26 conference that takes place this year in Glasgow. The hot new private sector gig for high-level public employees is green finance. But the world of “green finance” has injustice and inequality built in. It reduces democratic government action to higher carbon taxes, which often place the burden of decarbonisation on the poor. Government spending is to be directed to “derisking” private infrastructure, to cover the gap between the fees paid by users of essential public services and the commercial rates of return expected by private investors. Yet having privatised public services while hiking carbon taxes on ordinary people threatens a political backlash, which will reduce politicians’ appetite for meaningful decarbonisation measures. It will also reinforce the pressures to trust global asset managers to set the pace of green investment, even though the financiers’ “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) rush is rife with greenwashing: PR exercises that stick green labels on high-carbon activities. This greenwashing is a feature, not a bug, of big finance-led decarbonisation. It allows private finance to both enjoy the green subsidies promised by central banks and to protect profits from democratic forces that may, one day, transition from cuddling to penalising carbon financiers. The big finance approach owes its political appeal to fiscal fundamentalists who point to Covid-19-related surges in public debt to argue that the state simply cannot afford to green the economy. Instead, financiers dangle trillions of ESG investments in front of politicians, seducing them into believing the market will take care of the climate crisis. This validates unambitious carbon politics, as we see all too clearly in the EU’s sustainable finance initiative, which created a green public standards system. Four years after it was launched, this classification system for “sustainable” activity is now under serious threat of greenwashing from member states that want to include natural gas and other dirty activities within its scope. In turn, European commitments to develop in parallel a system that works towards penalising dirty lending have evaporated. Surrendering to vested carbon interests is easier when politicians cannot rely on a plausible green macroeconomic paradigm; instead they are still confronted, on a daily basis, with threats that inflation-concerned central banks will withdraw their protective hand from government bond markets. Indeed, central banks worried about the inflationary pressures triggered by economies reopening are now furiously debating how quickly to allow borrowing costs to rise. Climate activists should be prepared to fight the battle against fiscal fundamentalists with a simple message: the government is not a household. It has central banks on its side, and if there is a macroeconomic lesson the pandemic has taught us, it is that central banks can do a lot. In high-income countries, central banks have bought almost all debt issued by governments in 2020. They can and should continue to work closely with governments to accelerate decarbonisation. We cannot rely on private finance to lead us out of a climate crisis it has systematically contributed to. We have to disempower carbon financiers, and we do that by making the democratic state – not investors – lead the way forward.

2021-03-02T22:30:00Z,Sunak to reform stock market to shore up City of London's position,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/02/sunak-to-reform-stock-market-to-shore-up-city-of-londons-position,"Rishi Sunak will pave the way for sweeping reforms of the stock market to attract more fast-growing companies to list in the UK, amid the growing risk to London’s status as a leading financial centre after Brexit. In a development to coincide with the budget on Wednesday, the chancellor will publish the findings of a landmark review into UK listings rules to boost Britain’s attractiveness as a place for firms to grow and be taken public. Led by the former EU financial services commissioner, Lord Jonathan Hill, the overhaul could introduce the most significant reforms in the City of London in decades. It comes amid concern at the heart of government that Britain risks losing out to international rivals such as Amsterdam, New York and Hong Kong when it comes to hosting stock market debuts for fast-growing technology firms, and as the chancellor and prime minister attempt to frame the country as a destination for global business after Brexit. Commissioned by the chancellor last year to further enhance the UK’s position as an international destination for share listings, the report proposes more than a dozen reforms that are designed to make it easier for innovative firms to list in the UK. At present the most significant companies listed in London are either financial or more representative of the old economy of mining, energy and natural resources. The US technology giant Apple was worth more at one point last summer than the combined value of every company in the FTSE 100. Amsterdam overtook London as Europe’s largest share trading centre earlier this year, and as experts say the symbolic blow could be followed by the City losing jobs as well as more business owing to Brexit. Lord Hill told the Guardian he believed the strength and depth of London’s financial service industry meant it would be difficult for competing European cities to topple its status as the continent’s leading hub for global finance. However, he said rule changes were still needed to maintain and increase competitiveness after Brexit. “The worst thing for London to do is to sit here waiting to see what happens and hoping that Europe will give us equivalence and everything will come out all right in the wash. “I’m not a Singapore-on-Thames man, but the opportunity to set rules and regulations more speedily, flexibly and proportionately in areas like sustainable finance and technology, I do think there is an opportunity there,” he said. The review calls for a shake-up of listings rules to allow dual class share structures on the London Stock Exchange’s premium segment, which would give directors and company founders enhanced voting rights. The changes would enable such listings to be eligible for inclusion in the blue-chip FTSE indices, which attract a wider pool of investors than the standard segment of the London exchange. Other measures include cutting the amount of shares a company must sell to the public from 25% to 15%. Steps are also recommended to liberalise rules regarding special purpose acquisition companies, known as Spacs, which are “blank cheque” shell companies launched to raise money from investors first and then hunt for a business to buy later. Such stock market listings have become one of the most prominent trends in global finance in the past year, with a host of Spacs floating in New York and London. The rule changes are intended to persuade firms such as Cazoo, the UK-based online car platform, to consider a London listing. The firm, which could be valued as high as £5bn when it goes public, has been reportedly eying a merger with a New-York listed Spac as an alternative. Faced with increasing competition from abroad, Hill also recommended that the chancellor produce an annual report to parliament each year on the competitive position of the City. However, the plan to reform the listings rules could prompt concern that Britain is downgrading standards of corporate governance in favour of chasing high-profile trophy listings – echoing the debate over the mooted $2tn listing of the petrol group Saudi Aramco. Hill said he had recommended safeguards to maintain investor protections, while arguing that it made no sense to have a theoretically perfect listing regime if, in practice, users increasingly choose other venues. “The recommendations in this report are not about opening a gap between us and other global centres by proposing radical new departures to try to seize a competitive advantage. They are about closing a gap which has already opened up. All the recommendations are consistent with existing practices in other well-regulated financial centres in the USA, Asia and Europe,” he said. Sunak said the report had delivered bold ideas to help enhance the UK’s reputation after Brexit. “The review has more than delivered and I’m keen we move quickly to consult on its recommendations, cementing the UK’s reputation at the front of global financial services,” he said.",Business; UK news; Stock markets; Financial sector; London; Spring budget 2021; Budget; Rishi Sunak,Business
2020-11-25T09:00:23Z,EU 'did not properly consider conflicts of interest' over BlackRock contract,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/25/eu-did-not-properly-consider-conflicts-of-interest-over-blackrock-contract,"The EU did not properly consider conflicts of interest when it hired the US investment manager BlackRock to advise on environmental regulation for banks, an influential watchdog has said. The European ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, said the European commission, the EU’s executive arm, should strengthen its conflict of interest rules in light of the findings, in a judgment published on Wednesday. BlackRock, the world’s largest investor, had $7.8tn (£5.8tn) in assets under management at the end of September. In March, it won a tender from the EU to advise on how to integrate ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues into banking regulation. BlackRock has already carried out much of the work required under the contract. The contract prompted heavy criticism from campaigners over a potential conflict of interest, given BlackRock’s status as the world’s largest manager of shares in fossil fuel extractors, as well as being a major investor in most of the world’s biggest banks. The ombudsman said “there is a clear risk that those interests may influence the outcome of its work in its own favour”. BlackRock, which has recently acted to improve its reputation on environmental issues, was the only large investment manager out of nine bidders. Members of the European parliament wrote to the commission expressing their concerns and the EU ombudsman announced it would launch an investigation in July after a complaint by two MEPs and Change Finance, a network of non-governmental institutions. The bid from BlackRock “should have resulted in significantly more critical scrutiny”, O’Reilly said. Her report cleared the commission of maladministration but O’Reilly said this was only because the EU’s conflict of interest rules were too vague to be of use. “The risk of conflicts of interest when it comes to awarding contracts related to EU policy needs to be considered much more robustly both in EU law and among officials who take these decisions,” O’Reilly said. The campaigners who brought the complaint said the commission must withdraw the contract. Kenneth Haar, a campaigner at the Corporate Europe Observatory, a member of Change Finance, said: “Looking at this case, it is hard to come by more glaring conflicts of interest in one go. By choosing BlackRock, the commission basically handed big finance the steering wheel for the implementation phase of its action plan on sustainable finance.” The ombudsman drew particular attention to an “exceptionally low financial offer” from BlackRock. The investment manager offered €280,000 (£249,000) for the work, although the European commission’s suggested fee was €550,000. The ombudsman said the low price “could be perceived as an attempt to assert influence over an investment area of relevance to its clients”, although she did not make a judgment as to whether that was the case. The rebuke by the ombudsman is a blow to Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission’s powerful executive vice-president, who wrote that the award to BlackRock “followed scrupulously the rules of the Financial Regulation” after concerns were raised. Rasmus Andresen, a German MEP in the Greens/European Free Alliance, said the commission’s answers on the conflict of interest concerns had not been satisfactory. “The commission must update its public procurement guidelines and carefully choose its contractors,” he said. “BlackRock was an abnormally low bidder because it wanted to weasel its way into European law-making. For me, this is unacceptable.” A BlackRock spokesman said: “The European commission has already publicly stated that the technical quality of [BlackRock]’s proposal was the basis for their decision in awarding the mandate. [BlackRock] has taken a wide-ranging and inclusive approach, including academia, civil society, banks, supervisors and market practitioners, and looks forward to completing its work and delivering its final report to the commission.” A European commission spokesman welcomed the finding that there was no maladministration, saying it showed “we applied the rules fully and fairly”. The spokesman said the “commission is committed to transparency” and that it would respond to the ombudsman’s suggestions and publish BlackRock’s work.",Banking; Business; European Union; Environment; Europe; European Commission; Fossil fuels; Energy; World news,Business

The High Ambition Coalition (HAC) for Nature and People, which includes the UK and countries from six continents, made the pledge to protect at least 30% of the planet’s land and oceans before the One Planet summit in Paris on Monday, hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Scientists have said human activities are driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, and agricultural production, mining and pollution are threatening the healthy functioning of life-sustaining ecosystems crucial to human civilisation. In the announcement, the HAC said protecting at least 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade was crucial to preventing mass extinctions of plants and animals, and ensuring the natural production of clean air and water. The commitment is likely to be the headline target of the “Paris agreement for nature” that will be negotiated at Cop15 in Kunming, China later this year. The HAC said it hoped early commitments from countries such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Nigeria, Pakistan, Japan and Canada would ensure it formed the basis of the UN agreement. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, welcomed the pledge but cautioned: “It is one thing to commit, but quite different to deliver. But when we have committed, we must deliver. And with concerted efforts, we can collectively deliver.” The announcement at the One Planet summit, which also saw pledges to invest billions of pounds in the Great Green Wall in Africa and the launch of a new sustainable finance charter called the Terra Carta by Prince Charles, was met with scepticism from some campaigners. Greta Thunberg tweeted: “LIVE from #OnePlanetSummit in Paris: Bla bla nature Bla bla important Bla bla ambitious Bla bla green investments…” As part of the HAC announcement, the UK environment minister Zac Goldsmith said: “We know there is no pathway to tackling climate change that does not involve a massive increase in our efforts to protect and restore nature. So as co-host of the next Climate Cop, the UK is absolutely committed to leading the global fight against biodiversity loss and we are proud to act as co-chair of the High Ambition Coalition. “We have an enormous opportunity at this year’s biodiversity conference in China to forge an agreement to protect at least 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030. I am hopeful our joint ambition will curb the global decline of the natural environment, so vital to the survival of our planet.” However, despite support for the target from several countries, many indigenous activists have said that increasing protected areas for nature could result in land grabs and human rights violations. The announcement may also concern some developing countries who are keen for ambitious commitments on finance and sustainable development as part of the Kunming agreement, not just conservation. Unlike its climate equivalent, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity covers three issues: the sustainable use of nature, sharing benefits from genetic resources, and conservation. The three pillars of the treaty can clash with each other and richer, developed countries have been accused of focusing too much on conservation while ignoring difficult choices on agriculture and providing finance for poorer nations to meet targets. The HAC, currently co-chaired by France, Costa Rica and the UK, was formed in 2019 following the success of a similar climate body that spurred ambitious international action before the Paris agreement. By promoting action on biodiversity loss, it is hoped early commitments from the HAC will ensure a successful agreement for nature. Over the last decade, the world has failed to meet a single target to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. On Monday, leaders from around the world met in person and virtually at the One Planet summit in Paris to discuss the biodiversity crisis, promoting agroecology and the relationship between human health and nature. Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau addressed the event, which also included statements from UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng . The UK government has also committed £3bn of UK international climate finance to supporting nature and biodiversity over the next five years. Johnson told the event: “We are destroying species and habitat at an absolutely unconscionable rate. Of all the mammals in the world, I think I am right in saying that 96% of mammals are now human being or livestock that human beings rely upon. “That is, in my view, a disaster. That’s why the UK has pledged to protect 30% of our land surface and marine surface. Of the 11.6bn that we’ve consecrated to climate finance initiatives, we are putting £3bn to protecting nature.” The funding was welcomed by conservation and environmental organisations, including the RSPB and Greenpeace, but there were questions about the scale of the funding and whether it came at the cost of international aid. “Increasing funds to protect and enhance nature is critical to help secure success at the global biodiversity conference in China this year. Siphoning off cash from funds already committed to tackling the climate crisis simply isn’t enough,” said Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom. “This announcement raises concerns that the UK’s shrinking aid budget is being repurposed to pay for nature and biodiversity. As important as these are, the first priority of overseas aid should be the alleviation of poverty,” said Oxfam’s senior policy adviser on Climate Change, Tracy Carty. • This article was amended on 12 January 2021 to better reflect that the High Ambition Coalition (formed 2011) and the High Ambition Coalition for People and Nature (formed 2019) are separate organisations.",Conservation; Wildlife; Environment; Biodiversity; Climate crisis; World news,Environment
2020-10-19T15:56:27Z,Green jobs for graduates: what should you study and how can you reskill?,https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/green-jobs-for-graduates-what-should-you-study-and-how-can-you-reskill,"Leah Bennett has always wanted to make a difference. The 23-year-old graduate from Preston has volunteered to clean up beaches, investigated the politics behind the Amazon forest fires, researched alternatives to plastic packaging and given up her time to edit a digital magazine for the environmental organisation Louder Than The Storm. Jobs with purpose wanted Bennett isn’t alone in looking for graduate opportunities in the environmental sector. A 2018 survey from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy found that almost two-thirds (60%) of 18-24 year olds were interested in pursuing a career in the green economy. Even in other industries, this generation of young jobseekers wants to work for organisations that takes sustainability seriously. The graduate recruitment app Debut found that 89% of female and 80% of male students and graduates say they want to work for an organisation with a strong environmental policy. Increasingly, those credentials are being highlighted in job ads, even if the role itself would not be considered “green”. “It’s becoming a real differentiator for companies,” Kim Connor Streich, marketing director at Debut, says. “And there are an awful lot of opportunities outside of the traditional ‘green’ companies, or on graduate schemes, where you get an all-round understanding of what companies are doing, with the chance to specialise later.” The green boom The good news is that the green jobs market is growing fast. Renewable energy, electric vehicles (EV) and smart technologies are at the heart of the UK’s plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Worldwide, the Global Commission on the Future of Work expects 24m new jobs to be created by the green economy over the next 10 years. Graduates from Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects will be key in helping the UK achieve net-zero carbon emissions, says Jacqui Murray from Innovate UK, who leads the Faraday battery challenge for EVs. But part of her mission is also to encourage young people to appreciate the range of skills that will be needed in a green future. “Stem is always a labour of the heart,” she says. “It’s problem solving and it’s teamwork. It’s something everybody can contribute to. You may not be a world-leading scientist, but you may be someone who can fit the pieces together in a facility in Southampton. “The real power is in the cross-discipline nature of what we do. Stem skills are absolutely going to be at the heart of the green economy, but the ability to communicate and translate those ideas is really important [as well].” The benefit of a fresh pair of eyes Irfan Lohiya, the founder of Green Recruitment Solutions, says he’s seen an increase in demand for graduates in sectors such as waste recycling, water, renewable energy and green investment since he launched his business in 2013. “Organisations have realised that they need to source talent,” he says. “There is an ageing workforce right now in the sector.” A lot of the roles are technical, he adds, and engineering degrees are highly sought after. “Process engineering comes up a lot. Chemical engineering is good because it can be applied to water, waste management and energy process industries.” In the energy and sustainability consulting sector, Inspired Energy launched its first graduate scheme last September, hiring six candidates from a variety of academic backgrounds to spend two years across its different departments. It’s been so successful that the programme is being extended to 20 graduates this year. “[Graduates] are hungry and ready to get started. And we’ve enjoyed having fresh pairs of eyes,” says Matt Jones, commercial director for optimisation at the firm. “Seeing the enthusiasm light up in them when they latch on to this subject is brilliant.” Getting the right job for you Part of the challenge in finding the right role in the green economy is how broad the sector is, says Shannon Houde, a career and executive coach for the impact sector and author of Good Work: How to Build a Career that Makes a Difference in the World. “I break it down into five key categories: corporate responsibility and sustainability; social impact and international trade and development; sustainable finance and responsible investment; environmental (for example, renewable energy); and smart cities and food.” As well as looking to big brands, such as Unilever, Patagonia and Nike, there are opportunities in the public sector, non-governmental organisations, industry associations and consulting. “There are lots of SMEs worth looking at too, from sustainable fashion to vegan food companies,” she says. Future-proofing your career Graduates should emphasise skills such as building relationships, communication, project management, research, analysis and reporting, Houde says. It also pays to focus your attention on one or two impact issues, which you can talk about in an interview. That approach has worked for Bennett, who has secured three paid, part-time internships by highlighting the skills she does have. At the Centre for Global Eco-Innovation at Lancaster University, she’s now working as an environmental and sustainability researcher. “I told them: ‘I’m good at research, I can communicate information and I can make it accessible.’ These skills come in handy in so many ways.” In a challenging post-pandemic jobs market, aligning yourself with the green economy could be a shrewd move, Houde adds. “There’s going to be more and more growth in this space. It is definitely a way to future-proof [your career] way beyond your own personal values.” To search for all the latest green jobs visit Guardian Jobs",,Guardian green jobs
2020-04-12T13:50:12Z,BlackRock to advise EU on environmental rules for banks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/blackrock-eu-environmental-rules-for-banks,"BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investors in banks and fossil fuel companies, has been hired by the EU to work on potential new environmental rules for banks. Campaigners raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given BlackRock’s widespread financial interests in sectors that could be directly impacted by new environmental rules. The European commission, the EU’s executive arm, said this week that BlackRock had beaten eight other bidders on a contract to study how the EU could best integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its banking supervision. BlackRock is the world’s largest investment manager, with $7.43tn (£5.97tn) in assets under management on 31 December, before the coronavirus pandemic caused a global market rout. The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world’s biggest companies. Analysis by InfluenceMap for the Guardian found that BlackRock in October controlled shares in fossil fuel companies worth $87.3bn that held 3.27bn barrels of fossil fuel reserves. BlackRock is a top-three investor in all eight of the world’s largest oil companies, and a top-10 investor in the 12 most systemically important banks in the world. Katrin Ganswindt, a climate and energy campaigner at Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said: “Appointing BlackRock as advisor to the European commission on environmental, social and governance factors seems a bit like letting the fox guard the henhouse. On top of being the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels, they are also among the leading global financiers of the weapons industry. “We are baffled as to why the European commission didn’t think there would be a massive conflict of interest with this choice.” The commission will pay BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) arm €280,000 (£244,000) for the study, according to a contract award notice published on the commission’s website – equating to only 1.3% of the $24m pay given to the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, in 2018, or 0.007% of the company’s $4.5bn operating profits in 2019. However, decisions made by European banking regulators on ESG issues could have significant financial effects on the companies whose shares BlackRock holds. For instance, looser restrictions on bank lending to companies fuelling the climate crisis could profit both oil companies and lenders. BlackRock itself has been strongly criticised for blocking progress on environmental issues. Guardian analysis of data from ProxyInsight found that BlackRock opposed or abstained on 82% of climate-related shareholder resolutions at the companies whose shares it managed between 2015 and 2019, far lower than many rivals. However, in 2020 the company has taken significant steps to make environmental sustainability a core part of its business. In January it said it would divest from companies that made 25% or more of their revenues from coal, as well as pledging to start using its voting power to force companies to disclose climate risks. A European commission spokesman said contract was awarded “in full and strict compliance with the applicable EU procurement rules, including those on the eligibility of tenderers and the prevention of any potential conflict of interest”. BlackRock’s tender was better than competitors, and it will form only one input in the EU’s policymaking, the spokesman added. A spokesman for BlackRock said its FMA arm functioned separately to the investment management unit. He said: “We are honoured that BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory has been selected to perform an analysis to inform the European commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, deploying our expertise and capabilities in advising public-sector clients on structural trends, including the transition to a low-carbon future.” • This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the European commission’s suggested fee of €550,000. In fact, the fee paid to BlackRock will be €280,000.",Banking; Investing; Climate crisis; Business; Environment; Financial sector; European Commission; European Union; Europe; World news; US news; UK news; Fossil fuels; Energy; Coal,Business
2020-10-30T19:00:30Z,Net zero: what if Australia misses the moment on climate action?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/31/net-zero-what-if-australia-misses-the-moment-on-climate-action,"For a national leader who had just been told up to $80bn in fossil fuel export industries were on the chopping block, Scott Morrison seemed remarkably sanguine. “I am not concerned about our future exports,” the prime minister said at a press conference on Wednesday. “I’m very aware of the many views that are held around the world but I tell you what – our policies will be set here in Australia.” Morrison’s dismissive response was to a question about what observers say is the biggest shift in international climate politics since the signing of the Paris agreement five years ago. In the space of five weeks, three of Australia’s biggest trading partners – first China and then over the past week Japan and South Korea – promised to go “carbon-neutral” by 2050 or shortly after. Long-time observers of climate change diplomacy said the scale of what is happening should not be underestimated. “It’s really significant. It shows there is potential for hope – that we can really achieve what the Paris agreement is aiming for and limit warming to 1.5C,” says Ursula Fuentes, a former head of the German government unit responsible for climate policy and strategy. “It’s hard to achieve, but it shows if we have leadership in some countries how fast others can come on board. It also shows Australia needs to start talking about an economic transformation, and introducing policies that will support that transformation, or it will be left behind.” ‘The tide is turning’ While the three countries are yet to spell out in detail how they will reach their targets, the economic ramifications for Australia are vast. Together, the trio buys 75% of Australia’s shipped thermal coal used in power generation, 50% of the coking coal used in steel production, and 87% of its liquefied natural gas (LNG). Analysts say it raises at least two significant questions for the Morrison government. Will it become a pariah on climate change, increasingly diplomatically isolated and seen as unwilling to pull its weight? Perhaps even more importantly, will it plan for an inevitable economic transition before fossil fuel industries, and the national economy, are mugged by reality? The Morrison government’s position until now has been that climate change is a serious global problem that needs a global solution and that – despite significant evidence to the contrary – Australia was playing its part. But rather than applaud it, its response to the news that some of the world’s biggest emitters were promising to do more was to assert its sovereignty: it would not bow to pressure to live up to the commitments it made in Paris. The pushback was both public and private. In a call on Tuesday night, Morrison turned down his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, when asked to sign up to a 2050 net zero commitment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in 2018, in a report commissioned as part of the Paris agreement, that reaching net zero emissions by about this date was a necessary part of responding to the climate emergency. But Morrison told Johnson Australia would not agree to that goal for itself. Sources familiar with the call said he instead asked the British leader to back Australia’s approach of setting goals to lower the cost for clean technology, which is tied to neither a timeframe or an emissions reduction plan. Johnson said he would consider it, but the press release his office issued after the meeting emphasised the importance of setting ambitious emissions targets and reaching net zero. In the Senate estimates hearings that have dominated parliament over the past fortnight, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, repeatedly declined to say Australia welcomed Japan and South Korea signing up to net zero despite ostensibly wanting the world to reach that goal. Like many of the government’s claims on climate, the inconsistency went unexplained. The gap between Australia and its major trading partners was emphasised in a report by a centre-right thinktank, the Blueprint Institute, linked to former Liberal ministers Robert Hill and Christopher Pyne, which warned not committing to net zero emissions by 2050 would hurt the country’s international standing and economic competitiveness. It said if ambition on climate was not increased soon “the decision may be forced upon us”. “For a time, we’ve been able to trail behind our peers with little consequence for us or global temperatures,” the report said. “But the tide is turning.” Britain has been urging countries to ramp up commitments since it was announced it would host the next major climate conference in Glasgow, now delayed until late next year. It has been pushing countries on two issues – a mid-century net zero target and to stop financing coal plants in the developing world. Along with the UN, France, Chile and Italy, it will host an online climate summit in December to mark the fifth anniversary celebration of the Paris deal and push for greater action. Only countries that come armed with increased commitments will be invited to speak. That is expected to include China, which officials hope will use it to flesh out the ambitious short-term goals scientists advise are needed, but not Australia. Economic opportunity beckons The announcement by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the UN general assembly in September that the country’s carbon dioxide emissions would peak before 2030 and it would reach carbon neutrality before 2060 took many by surprise. China is by far the world’s biggest annual emitter – responsible for about half global coal use – and turning around its economy will be a massive task. But it has been working up to this moment, having modelled what a plan to limit warming to 1.5C would like last year. Observers believe it is a serious show of intent from Xi, motivated in part by a desire to move ahead of a possible Joe Biden US presidency, rather than risk pressure from a joint US-Europe push on climate in 2021. Just as important a driver, though, is the economic opportunity presented by the inevitable low-emissions transition. Ben Caldecott, the director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and a leading voice in the British push for greater global action, says it is “completely in China’s interest to go down this path”. He points out that the International Energy Agency, often criticised for its conservatism in forecasting the development of renewable energy, recently described solar power as the cheapest form of electricity in history. China is expected to include a climate focus, possibly including targets to cap coal use and lifting renewables, in its five-year economic plan due before the end of the year. “These countries are all vying to shape their own and the world’s economic future,” Caldecott says. “The technology is becoming cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, and change is happening and not going to stop. The question is just: ‘what’s the plan?’” The announcement by Japan, the world’s fifth biggest emitter, was just as surprising, and heavily influenced by the Chinese commitment. The new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, used his first parliamentary policy speech since taking office to declare the climate crisis was no longer a constraint on economic growth, but an opportunity to be seized. Japan is heavily reliant on energy imports – it is Australia’s biggest market for both thermal coal and LNG – and under Suga’s predecessor, Shinzo Abe, was seen as a recalcitrant player on climate. It continued to support new coal power as other developed countries stopped. But the country is also investing heavily in large offshore wind farms and trialling the use of green ammonia, created with renewable energy, as a replacement fuel in a coal plant. Llewelyn Hughes, an associate dean at the Australian National University’s College of Asia and the Pacific and an expert on Japan, says the 2050 goal is significant as it sets the direction for government agencies and businesses as they consider future policies and viable investments. Already, a number of planned coal plants in Japan have been cancelled, and it will become much harder for others to win finance. It is expected a new three-yearly energy plan, to be released in the middle of next year, will back a greater share of renewables compared with coal and gas. Both Japan and South Korea, which this week confirmed it would take steps to end its coal dependence and back a multibillion-dollar green new deal, are eyeing a future that includes green hydrogen – an industry the Morrison government hopes to develop, though it is also potentially backing hydrogen made with fossil fuels, a step some countries are bypassing. The rush of major Asian powers to sign up to net zero follows similar commitments from other countries and particularly the EU, which is weighing a target of up to a 60% cut by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, and will consider a proposal on carbon border tariffs – which would add a cost at the border to carbon-intensive goods – next year. The sense of momentum will kick into overdrive if Biden, who has promised to sign up to net zero, invest $2tn in clean solutions over four years and take an active role in global climate leadership, defeats Donald Trump in the US presidential election. One diplomatic source said Australia would “be supremely isolated” on climate and come under significant pressure to change its stance if Biden wins. Bill Hare, a longtime advisor to developing countries on climate and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, agrees – that if Australia continues on its current path it risks being left sitting with nations that openly refuse to act, such as Brazil and Saudi Arabia. But he says the country should be particularly concerned about the economic fallout. “The reality is the transition away from coal and then gas is going to happen much faster than Scott Morrison or the Labor party thinks, and it’s going to be extremely disruptive,” he says. “The workforce will be stranded. That’s why what is going on in Australia is so irresponsible.”",Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy; Climate crisis; Environment; Australia news,Environment
2019-12-14T19:00:31Z,'How do you transform an entire economy?' The firm taking on the climate funding problem,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/15/how-do-you-transform-an-entire-economy-the-firm-taking-on-the-climate-funding-problem,"A growing number of governments, including of every Australian state, Britain and the European Union, have set targets of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Few have mapped how to get there. It is a similar story in the corporate sector. Businesses are under increasing pressure from investors and shareholders to back up claims they are committed to the goals of the Paris agreement. Take BHP, one of the world’s 20 big emitters: it has set a mid-century net-zero emissions target but is yet to explain how it will reach it, and plans to invest more in oil and gas than climate solutions. Martijn Wilder, long-time head of Baker &amp; McKenzie’s global climate law and sustainable-finance practice and a founding board member of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, has seen up close the divide between the decision-making that goes into setting targets and establishing rules at United Nations climate talks and that drives spending decisions. Having moved in both diplomatic and investment circles, he found people in each who wanted to tackle the climate crisis but had little comprehension of how the other worked. The gap prompted him to leave a guaranteed stable future at the law firm, where he spent two decades, to set up Pollination, an ambitious – and, he and fellow founder Tony O’Sullivan say, unique – global climate advisory and investment firm. They say they will work across five areas: infrastructure investment, merchant banking, venture capital, non-profit work and an advisory arm. Two months after starting operation, the client list of their advisory business includes BHP, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, New Zealand’s a2 Milk Company and the NSW government. Wilder says the firm’s goals are to bring together experts who can break down barriers to the transition to a clean future, and redirect capital that has been committed but not to climate solutions. “Climate change is the central issue of our generation, but we’ve got this funding problem,” he says. “Families don’t know where to go [with their money], big investment funds can only write cheques of $1bn – what do you do with that? – and governments either don’t want to invest or it takes a lot of time, and are often restricted by legal barriers.” Beyond infrastructure, they say they want to back investments that protect natural capital and water security. Wilder says creating markets for climate adaptation and resilience will require coming up with financial solutions that could, for example, protect a reef or a mangrove, support a new technology that improves soil fertility or better manage water use. He says an increasing number of corporate players are talking about the climate emergency, but not moving quickly enough. Referring to the work of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD), a global body that aims to highlight companies’ exposure to risks related to the climate crisis, Wilder says many companies are attempting what he describes as “TCFD light” – acknowledging the issue, not yet matching it with action. But he believes the movement is in the right direction and picking up pace. “Any board anywhere in the world that thinks in 2019 that it should not be assessing climate risk will put its directors at significant exposure,” he says. “It is just no longer tenable for a board not to do that.” O’Sullivan, a former Australian head of investment banking at Lazard, says there is evidence investors, businesses and governments are increasingly turning their mind to what net-zero emissions means, pointing to a warning by the governor of the Bank of England that major corporations have two years to agree to rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators make them compulsory. He says the solution has to be more than “just building another solar farm”. “If you come out, as a lot of governments have done, with a deadline that says, ‘I’ve got 30 years to turn around an economy which has been based on fossil fuels for the last 200 years’, how do you transform an entire economy in that period?” O’Sullivan says from his base in London. “We really feel the advice we’re giving is going to transform governments and corporates.” Pollination’s management team includes Patrick Suckling, who until recently was Australia’s environment ambassador, and Rob Jesudason, the former chief financial officer of the Commonwealth Bank. Senior advisors include Sam Mostyn, chairwoman of Citi Australia, James Cameron, the founder of green merchant bank Climate Capital, and Christof Kutscher, the global chairman of AXA Investment Managers. The firm has offices in Sydney, London, New York, Chicago and Paris. Wilder says they want to extend into Singapore, Tokyo, Mumbai and, eventually, China.",Climate crisis; Renewable energy; Business; Energy; Environment; Australia news,Environment
2019-12-11T15:30:41Z,"European Green Deal will change economy to solve climate crisis, says EU",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/european-green-deal-will-change-economy-to-solve-climate-crisis-says-eu,"Nearly every major aspect of the European economy is to be re-evaluated in light of the imperatives of the climate and ecological emergency, according to sweeping new plans set out by the European commission on Wednesday. The comprehensive nature of the European Green Deal – which encompasses the air we breathe to how food is grown, from how we travel to the buildings we inhabit – was set out in a flurry of documents as Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president, made her appeal to member states and parliamentarians in Brussels to back the proposals, which would represent the biggest overhaul of policy since the foundation of the modern EU. Von der Leyen said the package was aimed at economic growth and increasing prosperity. “[This] is our new growth strategy, for a growth that gives back more than it takes away,” she said. “It shows how to transform our way of living and working, of producing and consuming, so that we live healthier [lives] and make our businesses innovate. We will help our economy to be a global leader by moving first and moving fast.” As well as bidding to lead the world on climate action with a proposed target of net-zero carbon by 2050 and halving emissions by 2030, the EU will delve far more deeply into the root problems that contribute to carbon emissions and pollution. For instance, in manufacturing: in previous decades, the EU was content to set targets for recycling rates; under the European Green Deal, regulators would set specific standards on the manufacturing of goods to create a circular economy and phase out unnecessary plastic and other waste before it is created. From 2021, at least 40% of the budget for the common agricultural policy and 30% of fisheries subsidies would be devoted to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, instead of contributing to higher emissions and environmental degradation, as many of these subsidies do at present. Toxic air and its health impacts would be tackled through tougher air quality requirements, and energy targets would be raised to generate more energy from renewable sources, up to 100% by 2050. More freight would be transported by rail and water, and greenhouse gas emissions from air travel would be reduced. The emissions reduction target for 2030 was proposed at a level of 50-55%, with a new law enshrining the commitment to net zero carbon for 2050. As an inducement to the member states reluctant to sign up to the 2030 and 2050 targets – Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary – Von der Leyen promised€100bn (£84bn) to help finance the transition to a low-carbon economy, along with the potential for a carbon border tax to be levied on imports to the EU from countries without sufficiently stringent carbon targets of their own. Leaders will discuss the emissions goals when they meet in Brussels at a summit on Thursday, but agreement still appears some way off. Failure to agree a second time, following a previous attempt in June, would be a blow to the EU’s standing at the UN climate talks, now reaching their final days in Madrid. One senior EU official said: “One of the elements that the heads of state and government will have to take into account is the pressure outside the room on this. This is climate week, right. So there might be a deal, there might not be a deal.” The commission will also face a difficult task in gaining full backing for the rest of the package among all member states. As well as those concerned about the carbon targets, there are the powerful agricultural and fishing lobbies in several states with concerns over reforms to the subsidy regime, and industries such as car manufacturing and chemicals that will face new regulations In one indication of the troubles yet to come, the UK on Wednesday joined the Czech Republic and France in blocking a deal on a set of rules governing which financial products can be labelled “green” and “sustainable”. France was concerned that its nuclear industry would lose out from the “taxonomy for sustainable finance”. Negotiations among member states and the European parliament on the green financing proposals are expected to resume on Monday. Green campaigners welcomed the aims of the European Green Deal but called for more detail and higher ambition, including a strengthening of the emissions target to a 65% cut by 2030. Franziska Achterberg, EU spokesperson for Greenpeace, said: “The climate targets [the commission is] proposing would be too little too late. On protecting nature, much is aspirational and needs to be fleshed out. The detailed measures that will follow must tackle the production and consumption patterns that have brought us to the brink.” Some campaigners at the UN climate talks in Madrid also called for the EU to bring forward its international proposals faster, to give more momentum to the push for tougher carbon targets under the Paris agreement. Under the commission’s proposals, the plans could not be formally adopted until next summer, giving only a few months before the crunch 2020 climate conference in Glasgow. Wendel Trio of the Climate Action Network said: “Timing is everything. Now EU member states have a big responsibility to agree on a much higher 2030 climate target at the European Council in June 2020.” “The proposed package is comprehensive, identifying the right areas for action – from biodiversity and nature restoration to climate change and stopping deforestation,” said Ester Asin, director of the European policy office at WWF. “However, by emphasising continued economic growth as a key objective, the commission has missed an opportunity to challenge the traditional growth paradigm in favour of an approach that would respect planetary boundaries.”",Climate crisis; European Commission; European Union; Europe; World news; Ursula von der Leyen; Climate science; Environment; Science; Greenhouse gas emissions,Environment
2019-10-11T03:42:08Z,Josh Frydenberg rejects IMF report that Australia will fail to meet Paris target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/australia-will-fail-to-meet-paris-target-even-with-carbon-price-of-us75-a-ton-imf-says,"Josh Frydenberg has rejected the International Monetary Fund’s warning that Australia will fail to meet its Paris agreement emissions reduction target even with a carbon price of US$75 a ton. The IMF made the observation in a report on mitigating climate change which concluded that a carbon tax is still a more cost-effective solution than “feebate” models, which impose fees on activities with above-average emissions and subsidise those with below-average emissions. Frydenberg, the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader, told reporters in Canberra on Friday the government is “confident we will meet and beat our targets and as you know at the election we laid out our $3.5bn climate solutions package with a range of methods”. Angus Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction, said the IMF report “does not take into account” the government’s emissions reduction fund, which pays polluters to cut greenhouse gases by 328mt by 2030. The fund has been criticised for rapidly diminishing returns and widespread exemptions to limits on emissions elsewhere in the economy. Despite the Morrison government claiming that Australia will meet its Paris target of 26% to 28% emissions reduction by 2030 “in a canter”, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen for five years since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. In a separate report the IMF warned that companies cannot afford to ignore environmental and social goals because they have a “material impact on corporate performance”, in part because of investor pressure and potential “large losses from climate change”. The paper implicitly rejects the view expressed by senior Coalition figures that business should not speak up on social issues, interpreted as an attack on one of Australia’s biggest resources companies, BHP, for its efforts to reduce emissions. The first IMF paper found that if G20 countries imposed uniform carbon prices of $25, $50, and $75 a ton emissions would fall by 19%, 29%, and 35% respectively for the group. Although a $25 price would be “more than enough” for some countries – such as China, India and Russia – to meet their targets, even with a $75 a ton price Australia and Canada would fail owing to differences in the stringency of targets and the price responsiveness of emissions. Retail energy prices in Australia would rise by 75% with a carbon price of $75 a ton owing to its heavy reliance on coal-fired power generation, it said. The report suggests a combination of regulation and “feebate” policies in Australia would only cut emissions by two-thirds the amount a $50 carbon price would, and would add 50% to mitigation costs. The report suggests in Australia a $50 carbon price would raise about 1% of GDP in revenue and suggests returning revenue to taxpayers. “To make carbon taxes politically feasible and economically efficient, governments need to choose how to use the new revenue,” it said. “Options include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, increasing investment in green energy, or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.” Taylor said the “point of a carbon tax is to raise the price of energy so people consume less”. “Labor’s carbon tax did exactly that, and that’s why we abolished it.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australia Institute’s climate director, Richie Merzian, said the IMF report showed “carbon prices work” and would have little impact on the economy. “In just two years under the Clean Energy Future carbon price, Australia reduced emissions by 2%, grew the economy by 5% and added 200,000 jobs,” he said. “If there is one clear message for the Australian government, it is get your act together. Australia’s emissions are increasing, not falling, because there is no credible climate and energy policy.” In its sustainable finance report, the IMF argued that integrating environmental, social and governance factors into firms’ business models will “help mitigate risks” such as financial stability risks via exposure of banks and insurers and large losses from climate change. It identified both “physical risks” from damage to property, land and infrastructure from catastrophic weather-related events and broader climate trends, and “transition risks” from changes in the price of stranded assets and broader economic disruption because of evolving climate policy, technology, and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower-carbon economy. “Environmental, social, and governance issues can have a material impact on firms’ performance and on the stability of the financial system more broadly,” it said. In September the heads of Australia’s two major airlines – Alan Joyce of Qantas and Virgin Australia’s Paul Scurrah – rejected government calls to stay out of social and environmental issues, citing the strong business case to attract employees and customers with a social conscience.",Paris climate agreement; Climate crisis; Australia news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Australian politics; Coalition; Scott Morrison,Environment
2019-05-12T12:31:51Z,"If Labour is so committed on climate, it should recognise how the EU can help | Molly Scott Cato
",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/labour-climate-support-green-party-carbon-eu,"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has pledged to use “every lever of government possible” to tackle climate change. And his latest idea is to go after the big players on the London Stock Exchange, warning that UK companies failing to act to reduce carbon emissions will be delisted. As a green economist, radical steps to address the economic drivers of our various environmental crises have been my bread and butter for years. So I welcome Labour’s newfound commitment to get serious on climate change, though its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 can hardly be seen as treating the problem as an emergency. Greens believe we must reach net zero carbon by 2030 and that such a target is achievable. And let’s face it, Labour’s gear change is going to be anything but smooth given the inconsistencies in its policies. For instance, listed in the FTSE 100 – the largest UK companies on the London Stock Exchange – is easyJet. The climate impact of airlines, and especially short-haul airlines encouraging weekend breaks, is devastating. So presumably such companies would be a target for McDonnell’s delisting. Except Labour is also supporting airport expansion, thereby encouraging companies such as easyJet to increase their flights, and their carbon emissions. Airlines might justifiably challenge a government that is on the one hand encouraging their growth and on the other penalising them for doing so. Perhaps given Labour’s fence-sitting on Europe, McDonnell has failed to notice the far more effective moves taking place in the EU, in particular the evolving sustainable finance agenda. This is something I have led on personally in the European parliament. It aims to use various levers to direct financial investments away from fossil industries and dirty businesses towards clean, green industries. Not just those listed on the London Stock Exchange but businesses throughout the EU. Since the Paris agreement on climate change in 2015, 33 global banks have poured $1.9tn into financing fossil fuel projects worldwide. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum says that in 2018 coal use inched up and progress on energy efficiency slowed, while the World Economic Forum has concluded that growth in renewables is too slow to meet Paris goals. The result is that energy-related greenhouse gas emissions jumped by almost 2% last year. This demonstrates how vital it is that the financial sector play its part by throwing its full weight behind the fight against climate change. The European commission’s pioneering legislative proposals will push the sector to do just this. For example, from now on, finance players will have to inform their clients about how their investments – including pensions and insurance – are impacting on the planet. I was proud to be part of the negotiating team for this world-first mandatory discourse regime, agreed a few months ago. I’ve also pushed hard for carbon stress tests for banks, so that they can identify and then eliminate assets that will become stranded as we tackle climate change, beginning with fossil fuel assets. Greens in the European parliament took charge of the negotiations over a “taxonomy” for sustainable investments – a classification system of economic activities identifying which investments are and aren’t sustainable as a first step towards introducing significant financial incentives. Due to our work – and in the face of significant political opposition – we have eliminated “clean coal”, nuclear energy and gas infrastructure from this sustainability taxonomy. Unfortunately, Labour seems to think setting up new coal mines is compatible with addressing a climate emergency. It’s clear that the EU is leading on the design of financial levers to encourage a sustainability transition for the finance sector and thus for all companies. Rather than picking off the London Stock Exchange, Labour needs to embrace our continued membership of the EU. When it comes to tackling serious global issues such as climate change, and transitioning towards a green economy, we will achieve so much more working together cooperatively with our European neighbours. • Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar, and Green party finance and Brexit speaker",Green party; Politics; European parliamentary elections 2019; European Union; Europe; European Commission; UK news; Labour,Opinion
2019-04-10T05:30:41Z,Climate crisis: today’s children face lives with tiny carbon footprints,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/10/climate-crisis-todays-children-face-lives-with-tiny-carbon-footprints,"Children born today will have to live their lives with drastically smaller carbon footprints than their grandparents if climate change is to be controlled. Fast, deep cuts in global emissions from energy, transport and food are needed to keep temperature rises in check and an analysis has shown this means the new generation will have lifetime carbon budgets almost 90% lower than someone born in 1950. The data dramatically highlighted the burden inherited by today’s children, an issue at the heart of the global school strikes for climate. Another major strike will take place in more than 70 nations on Friday. “Those in positions of power – from politicians to business leaders – that have benefited from a much higher lifetime carbon budget have a duty to act to ensure a liveable planet for current and future generations,” said Jake Woodier at the UK Student Climate Network, which is supporting the strikes. “Without appropriate action, those in power are sacrificing our tomorrow for their today.” The new analysis by the climate analysts Carbon Brief combines data on emissions and population changes with climate models. It then calculates how much the average citizen on Earth can emit over their lifetime to keep temperature rises below 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the world’s nations to avoid climate catastrophe. Previous and existing generations have emitted nearly all the carbon dioxide needed to take the world to 1.5C or 2C, meaning future generations will have to severely cut the emissions from flying, meat consumption and other activities in their lifetimes. The children and young people taking part in the youth strikes (born 1997-2012) will have carbon budgets just one sixth those of their baby boomer grandparents (1946-1964). “As protests by school children increase each week around the world, our analysis starkly highlights the intergenerational injustice of climate change,” said Leo Hickman, editor of Carbon Brief. “If warming is to be limited to safe levels, today’s children are going to have to greatly curtail their own lifetime emissions compared to older generations.” The idea for the analysis came from Ben Caldecott, at the University of Oxford’s Sustainable Finance Programme. He said it is the first systematic use of emissions data to inform the debate about intergenerational responsibility for climate change and had produced some “uncomfortable numbers”. “The purpose is not to fan the flames of rising intergenerational angst, but rather to provide some objective analysis to support dialogue between generations within countries and across them so we can tackle climate change,” he said. “The results will feed into intergenerational equity debates, for example in terms of access to housing, the availability of pensions, rising university tuition fees, changing retirement ages.” There is a currently a wide gap between the average annual emissions of a US citizen (16.9 tonnes) and an Indian citizen (1.9 tonnes). The analysis showing that children born now would have a lifetime carbon budget 90% lower than their grandparents assumes the relative gap would remain. But in a second analysis, Carbon Brief posited a future carbon budget that would be the same for every citizen on the planet. This would mean that the budget for a child born today in the US is even lower, 97% lower than that of that of their grandparents. For someone born today in Europe, their budget would be 94% lower. “That those born today only have a carbon budget a fraction of the size of those from previous generations exemplifies the need for a transformative approach that puts social and economic justice at the heart of plans to tackle the climate crisis,” said Woodier. “We need massive investment in people and planet to transform our economies, and we need it urgently.”",Carbon footprints; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Young people; Children; Ethical and green living; World news; School climate strikes,Environment
2019-03-21T13:12:53Z,Climate change could make insurance too expensive for most people – report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/21/climate-change-could-make-insurance-too-expensive-for-ordinary-people-report,"Insurers have warned that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable after the world’s largest reinsurance firm blamed global warming for $24bn (£18bn) of losses in the Californian wildfires. Ernst Rauch, Munich Re’s chief climatologist, told the Guardian that the costs could soon be widely felt, with premium rises already under discussion with clients holding asset concentrations in vulnerable parts of the state. “If the risk from wildfires, flooding, storms or hail is increasing then the only sustainable option we have is to adjust our risk prices accordingly. In the long run it might become a social issue,” he said after Munich Re published a report into climate change’s impact on wildfires. “Affordability is so critical [because] some people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance.” The lion’s share of California’s 20 worst forest blazes since the 1930s have occurred this millennium, in years characterised by abnormally high summer temperatures and “exceptional dryness” between May and October, according to a new analysis by Munich Re. Wetter and more humid winters spurred new forest growth which became tinder dry in heatwave conditions that preceded the wildfires, the report’s authors said. After comparing observational data spanning several decades with climate models, the report concluded that the wildfires, which killed 85 people, were “broadly consistent with climate change”. Nicolas Jeanmart, the head of personal insurance, general insurance and macroeconomics at Insurance Europe, which speaks for 34 national insurance associations, said the knock-on effects from rising premiums could pose a threat to social order. “The sector is concerned that continuing global increases in temperature could make it increasingly difficult to offer the affordable financial protection that people deserve, and that modern society requires to function properly,” he said. Munich Re’s insurance cover in hurricane-prone regions such as Florida is already higher than in northern Europe, by an order of magnitude. Premiums are also being adjusted in regions facing an increased threat from severe convective storms which hold an energy and severity primed by global warming. These include parts of Germany, Austria, France, south-west Italy and the US midwest. Increases in the intensity and frequency of California’s wildfire season are predicted by climate models, and the Munich Re analysis combines monthly meteorological data with financial losses to graph the trend’s rise since 2001. Average annual wildfire losses trailed well below $5bn even within this millennium, until 2017 and 2018, when they leapt to more than $20bn. Munich Re believes that global warming made a “significant contribution” to this. No insurer has linked wildfires to climate change before, although a Lloyds report into Superstorm Sandy in 2014 found that global warming-linked sea level rises had increased surge losses around Manhattan by 30%. Climate scientists say that linking extreme weather events to climate change is akin to attributing the performance of a steroid-taking sportsman to drug use – the connections are clearer in patterns than in individual disasters. Paul Fisher, the Bank of England’s former coordinator on climate change, and a fellow at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said: “In general, one can’t prove that a single event is the result of climate change but it is likely to cause more such events of greater severity.” “It is very interesting if insurers conclude that climate change was a significant contributory factor to the event and will make the insurance companies think carefully about the pricing and availability of similar insurance policies.” It may also influence several court cases testing the liability of fossil fuel companies for the effects of global warming. Dr Ben Caldecott, the director of Oxford University’s sustainable finance programme, said: “Company directors and fiduciaries will ultimately be held responsible for avoidable climate-related damages and losses and urgently need to up their game to avoid litigation and liability.” Munich Re has divested its large thermal coal holdings. However, it maintains some gas and oil investments.",Climate crisis; Insurance industry; Wildfires; Extreme weather; Natural disasters and extreme weather; Environment; Business; World news,Environment
2019-08-11T13:52:20Z,How a big French bank helped London tenants get back to work,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/11/lq-and-bnp-paribas-partner-up-to-get-tenants-back-into-work,"For a couple of years Nontando Mpofu, known to her friends as Lucy, struggled to find permanent work and often found herself reliant on the generosity of her church and food bank. “Life was a real struggle, and it was very hard for me to juggle everything – paying the rent and looking after my daughter as a single parent,” Mpofu, 40, says in the airy kitchen of her flat in Leytonstone, east London. “I got into quite a bit of debt and rent arrears.” Mpofu’s life changed last November when an unlikely alliance between France’s biggest bank and her social housing landlord helped get her back into permanent work with a job at Marks &amp; Spencer, and get her bank account into the black. “I was just scrolling through Facebook one day, and I saw a post from someone in the community saying: ‘If you’ve been unemployed for six months – get in touch, we can help’.” The message had been posted by a support officer employed by her landlord London &amp; Quadrant (L&amp;Q) , one of the UK’s largest housing associations which rents out close to 100,000 homes in London and the south-east. L&amp;Q employs more than a dozen people dedicated to getting its long-term unemployed residents such as Mpofu into permanent jobs. The team of support workers helped Mpofu perfect her CV, coached her through mock interviews, and helped her identify jobs suitable to her skills and circumstances. The L&amp;Q team also helps unemployed residents with buying clothes to wear to interviews and paying for travel. Matthew Corbett, the director of the L&amp;Q foundation, said the housing association was committed to helping its tenants into work because “it makes our communities happy and healthier” but also because L&amp;Q is contractually obliged to by its bank, BNP Paribas. France’s biggest bank loaned L&amp;Q £100m at a discount rate on the condition that the housing association helped at least 600 of its residents into work. BNP Paribas and L&amp;Q were unable to state how big the discount is, but Corbett said it was significant and would free up more money for the housing association to invest in its foundation. L&amp;Q, which was founded by a Church of England priest in 1963, smashed the target of getting 600 residents into work, and the loan will be extended for four years with L&amp;Q required to increase its job search effort by an additional 25 people each year. Accountants at PwC will audit L&amp;Q to verify that the housing association really achieved the target, which built upon its existing efforts to get residents into work. Social housing residents are twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the UK population on average, according to research by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Those who are in work are likely to be low-paid and in part-time jobs. The average weekly pay for housing association tenants is £250, compared to £232 for local authority tenants, £348 for private renters and £454 for owner-occupiers. Waqar Ahmed, L&amp;Q’s finance director, said: “Everything that L&amp;Q does begins with social purpose, and we believe that no one should be denied the opportunity to achieve their potential because of where they live. “BNP Paribas is exactly the sort of partner we are looking for, and we are delighted to have completed this ground-breaking deal with them. The team at BNP Paribas share our sense of social purpose, and our combined vision is going to help hundreds more people into employment every year.” BNP Paribas said the idea to offer the discount “sustainability-linked” loan came about after the bank’s change to its corporate social responsibility policy to do more to “create a positive impact in society”. Simon Gates, a senior banker at BNP Paribas UK, said the deal was the first to tie the terms of a loan to efforts to reduce unemployment. “It is the result of close collaboration to conceptualise and structure what represents a landmark deal for sustainable finance in the UK: to our knowledge, this is the first ever UK housing association loan that incorporates a concrete, positive impact metric. “L&amp;Q will be assessed on the actual impact realised in the community in terms of helping residents back to work. We think this is a watershed moment and we are honoured to support L&amp;Q as it continues its essential work of building affordable, high-quality homes.” After the success of the deal with L&amp;Q, BNP Paribas signed a similar deal this week with Optivo, another housing association which owns 47,000 homes occupied by close to 100,000 people. Gates said the Optivo loan was “about getting people back into work, which is good for individuals, families, the economy and society”. David Reynolds, the BNP Paribas banker who agreed the deal, said the French bank saw it as part of its “responsibility to align financing to reward worthy causes”. “From the top down, we are really focused on the positive impact banking can have,” he said. “It’s important for us to show that we support these sort of causes that are doing good for society.” Reynolds said the bank was putting aside a pool of money to support other social housing projects as well as other schemes aimed at improving the environment and cutting down on waste water. Greg Beales, the campaigns director of the housing charity Shelter, said it was important that banks such as BNP Paribas were making it easier for housing associations to build more homes particularly at a time of severe government cuts. “This shows the private sector stepping in to provide finance when the public finances have been incredible stretched,” he said. “Homes can help do so much more social good than just simply providing housing: they act as a platform from which people can improve their whole lives.” The terms of the Optivo loan have not been disclosed due to commercial sensitivity, but it is understood that the target will call on the housing association to significantly build on the approximately 1,000 residents a year it currently helps into work. On the frontlines helping Optivo residents find work are 17 Give Us a Chance employment specialists including Whitney Henry. Henry, who got her job through the same programme, said the most important aspect of her work was to give other residents “the confidence to believe in themselves”. “Some people have been out of work for a long time, and they have lost some of that confidence and belief in themselves,” said Henry, who works with residents on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, one of the most deprived parts of the UK. Her personal target is to get 50 people a year into work. Last year she found jobs for 126, including every member of a family of four. The father secured a job as a school caretaker, the mother got part-time cleaning work in the school, the daughter took an IT course before getting a job at PC World, and her brother is studying the same course while working at Greggs. “It is so rewarding when they get into jobs,” Henry said. “It’s probably the best feeling in the world that you have helped them achieve, and you feel like you have achieved with them. I am so proud of all them.”",Social housing; Unemployment; Housing; BNP Paribas; PwC; UK news; Communities; Society; Banking; Business; European banks; Financial sector,Society
2018-12-12T15:22:03Z,"Neil Young's made a start, but the arts must do more to oppose dirty money | Molly Scott Cato",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/12/fossil-fuel-sponsorship-arts-climate-change,"Those attending the COP24 climate negotiations in Katowice, Poland, this week have been greeted by a bizarre sight: an artistic celebration of one of the main fuels responsible for destroying the global climate. Katowice is the centre of Poland’s coal industry, and despite hosting a conference that represents the last chance saloon when it comes to taking meaningful action on climate change, local politicians pride themselves on the black stuff. Perhaps we could have expected no different when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change decided on such an inappropriate venue and to allow coal companies to sponsor the talks. If we do make it through climate change with some form of civilisation intact, we will look back at some of the things we are doing now with the moral repugnance we feel towards slavery. There are legitimate parallels here. Climate change will most hurt those yet to be born. Our failure to make the dramatic changes needed to our economy and society means we are behaving as if we own the lives of future generations and have a right to steal their lives from them. Art plays a key role in recording contemporary life, but because it is exploratory and imaginative it also invites us to challenge the assumptions we live by. In Katowice there is a counter-exhibition on coal by art students, drawing attention to the “dark side of coal”. Meanwhile the campaign movement Art Not Oil, which has been pushing for an end to oil sponsorship of the arts, ran a parallel protest exhibition alongside the British Museum’s I Object show in opposition to financial backing from BP – a company that proudly boasts it is one of the most significant corporate investors in UK arts and culture. Performers acted as “rebel curators”, presenting objects to the public that represent BP’s complicity in climate breakdown. Just as in Bristol, where the Green lord mayor, Cleo Lake, has banished paintings related to the slave trade from her office, so galleries should shun BP funding. Musicians are also challenging corporate sponsorship. Neil Young is due to play a large concert in Hyde Park next summer. Recently he criticised the event’s sponsor, Barclays, declaring the bank a “fossil-fuel-funding entity”. Young said such sponsorship was incompatible with his beliefs about the climate, and that he was seeking to rectify the situation. Yesterday he claimed victory, saying the concert was now proceeding without Barclays as a sponsor. Others need to follow his lead. And perhaps Young and other musicians concerned about climate change will also need to think carefully about the carbon footprint of performing concerts around the globe. There’s also a strong case against continued fossil fuel sponsorship from an economic perspective. The financial sector is rapidly divesting from fossil fuels, realising the smart money is in renewables and the green economy. Since the Paris agreement was adopted in November 2015, the sustainable finance agenda has moved rapidly. In the European parliament I’ve worked on legislation that requires all financial market players to give full information about how customers’ money is invested. Since the EU has committed to phasing out fossil fuels by 2050, any pensions for people aged under 40 that contain assets based on fossil fuels could be claimed to have been mis-sold. So decisions not to throw money at fossil fuels are increasingly looking hard-headed and rational rather than purely moral. There’s also a growing divestment movement, and universities and colleges have been at the forefront. Almost half of UK universities have made divestment commitments. Students and academics of the arts can play a vital role in pushing this agenda, again using their talents to do this in creative ways. No matter how much they are struggling for cash, galleries and arts promoters should be made to feel too ashamed to take money from the industries that are leading us to climate breakdown. In the same way we now look back on the slave trade, those who took the filthy fossil fuel lucre will be condemned by future historians. But the arts sector must go further than simply seeking clean sources of funding. Artistic creation invites us to imagine alternative worlds and to subvert the power of the old. Envisioning a future where fossil fuels have no place in our economy or society could provide a rich creative vein for artists and musicians, allowing them to play a vital role in generating ideas about how we are to live in the post-fossil fuel era. • Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England",Climate crisis; Fossil fuels; Environment; Arts funding; Culture; Music; Neil Young; Barclays; BP,Opinion
2018-10-31T11:07:28Z,Why I’m turning from law-maker to law-breaker to try to save the planet | Molly Scott Cato,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/31/law-breaker-save-planet-direct-action-civil-disobedience,"On Wednesday I will join hundreds of others in Parliament Square to assert that we will not stand idly by in the face of climate breakdown and ecological crisis. We will affirm a commitment to engage in non-violent but illegal activities to try and force urgent action. Collectively we have signed a declaration to this effect; an Extinction Rebellion against the British government for criminal inaction. Over decades we have all operated in our different spheres of life – whether as journalists, academics, politicians, campaigners and educators – to ring the alarm about the way planetary life support systems are being destroyed. But a powerful alliance of wealthy individuals and multinational corporations, backed by complicit politicians, has subverted the political process and blocked action. This is why, whoever we are and whatever we do, we are coming together now to say we are prepared to engage in civil disobedience to force urgent climate action. We are prepared to halt lorries entering fracking sites; to stand in the way of bulldozers building roads and block traffic along heavily congested and polluted streets. Direct actions like these have a long and proud history; it’s time to carry them through in a systematic way to protect the climate, and to be willing to be arrested for doing so. So how have we have reached a situation where a law maker like me feels there is no alternative but to become a law breaker? Here my Quaker heritage is helpful. Our thin pamphlet of theological guidance ncludes the useful advice: “Respect the laws of the state but let your first loyalty be to God’s purposes.” As a Quaker, I don’t believe that spiritual wisdom resides in books or rituals but in the still, small voice that tells you when something must change. When the inward light, that I believe we all have within us, prompts you to stand up to a fascist bully or to engage in civil disobedience to halt climate breakdown, you have no choice but to follow. I represent some 5 million people in the European parliament. But who represents the generations as yet unborn that will have no chance of a decent and civilised life unless we act on climate change? Who represents the thousands of species that are becoming extinct during the modern era? A mass extinction that is entirely the result of human actions, and which we are living through almost without noticing? I am proud of the way 50 Green MEPs, of 750 elected across Europe, have achieved policy breakthroughs. Just last week we won a vote on banning plastics and limiting the use of antibiotics on farms. And my work on sustainable finance has a real chance of creating financial incentives to shift investment away from fossil fuels and towards projects that will protect wild habitats. But it isn’t enough. Green voters in the UK are grossly underrepresented because of our unfair electoral system. So British policy on energy and transport is stuck in the past, while other European countries with a strong green contingent in their parliaments are far more advanced in the transition towards a green economy. A spur towards direct action against this government and in defence of our planet conveniently appeared this week. As finance speaker for the Green party, I had called for an emergency budget for the climate, and the party issued a challenge: if the budget offers a single pound to climate-wrecking projects it will have failed. Well, the chancellor didn’t mention climate change once in his statement, and, rather than action to avert climate breakdown, we saw the chancellor accelerate it. He threw £30bn at road building while freezing fuel duty for the ninth year running, meaning this now amounts to a £9bn tax giveaway a year. There was also a sneaky £3bn tax break for oil and gas companies in the North Sea, through the removal of “tax barriers” to investment. This was just the enticement we needed to take the government on. The latest IPCC report and Tuesday’s Living Planet report by WWF, which reveals that wildlife populations have declined by more than half in less than 50 years, show how urgently change is needed. It is no exaggeration to say that our survival as a species is at risk. Enough. Enough of words; of hypocrisy and broken promises. It’s time to act. • Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England",Climate crisis; Protest; Environment; Activism; Green party; Politics; European Union; Conservation; WWF; UK news,Opinion
2018-12-13T22:33:01Z,Australia is uniquely up to the task of solving 'wicked' problems around inequality | Mariana Mazzucato,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/australia-is-uniquely-up-to-the-task-of-solving-wicked-problems-around-inequality,"Visitors to Australia are drawn to this country’s iconic coastline. After landing in Sydney early in the morning I went straight to Bondi’s famous Icebergs ocean pool to do a few laps. It was spectacular. A gorgeous pool in the depths of the sea, a symbol that it’s not just infrastructure, but well-designed infrastructure that makes a difference: public value that public and private actors can create when they get the mix right. Icebergs is one of around 100 ocean baths in the state of New South Wales. Some are licenced to swimming clubs or private operators, many are maintained by local government. If Icebergs is any indication, they are all a unique public realm – long-lived investments that provide access to the natural environment, a base for local business, and a place for communities to come together. As any good swimmer knows, for all the activity above the waterline, the difference between success and failure happens under the surface. This is true of entire economies, too. As the Chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, quipped last week, Australia’s 27 years of consecutive economic growth “feels like forever” by global standards. Australians are rightly proud of that performance. Thanks to an effective fiscal stimulus package, and a well-timed mining boom, Australia’s economy managed to grow during the global financial crisis that plunged most of the advanced economies into severe recession. But recently cracks have started to appear. Inequality is rising. Concerns over housing affordability have skyrocketed. The Banking Royal Commission has highlighted deep problems in the financial sector. The longer-term challenge of building a more diversified, innovative economy is unresolved. And environmental and sustainability risks, led by climate change, are starting to hit home on public and private balance sheets and in the public consciousness. Twenty seven years of growth is a fine achievement. But what if Australia – like many other countries – has been too focused on the rate of economic growth, and not on its direction? All the activity is great, but where is it getting the land down under? Understanding how to move the Australian economy in a smart, green direction requires the same bold thinking about design, infrastructure, and public realm that the Icebergs pool brings to mind. I am meeting Australian policymakers, business people, civil society groups and academics this week to discuss how to build a smarter, more equitable and sustainable economy. My key message at Tuesday’s John Menadue Oration at Carriageworks in Sydney was that this requires freeing policymakers from the straightjacket of thinking that the best they can do is pick up the mess created by unfettered markets. The narrow training public choice theory provides often means civil servants think government failures are worse than market failures. The tool kit that emerges from that thinking is not fit-for-purpose for 21st century challenges. As I argued in The Entrepreneurial State, the defining leaps forward in our living memories – whether in medicine, computers, energy or nanotechnology – were often made possible by the state acting as an investor of first resort, investing in the high-risk capital-intensive areas that allowed business to see new opportunities. Indeed, most of the tech in your pocket, those things that make your smart phones smart – the internet, touch screens, GPS, Siri – were originally the product of government research and innovation, much of it stemming back to government-led Cold War “missions” in space travel or defence. Australia’s scientific research organisation, the CSIRO, made its own contribution here through its work on the Wifi technology that millions of these devices use. In each case the technology emerged as a solution to a problem. But rather than military problems, we should be asking how today’s “wicked” problems around inequality, climate and health can provide urgency to find new solutions, spurring cross-sectoral investments and bottom-up solutions. My work with the European Union and policymakers around the world argues for a “mission-oriented” approach where states lead ambitious responses to these major challenges and opportunities. Missions are about collaboration – while public policy sets the direction, they create frameworks for different actors, sectors and disciplines to work towards socially-oriented goals – and better directions for economic growth. Think affordable, sustainable energy for Australian households, or making Australia a net renewable energy exporter, or halting Australia’s extinction crisis, or leading a global sustainable finance agenda. These are ambitious, but achievable, targets. Mobilising activity towards each of them would have major positive economic, scientific and social spillovers. And they would all help make Australia a country that has even more to be proud of apart from its steadily-increasing GDP. Delivering on missions requires major investment, including in the capability of the public sector to set a clear direction. This means new licence to make direct investments and take risks, new ways of evaluating policy proposals, new forms of partnerships with other actors—including the ability to listen and harness the demands coming from social movements. Indeed, finding a way for different stakeholders to come together in a trusted setting to co-create missions can potentially bring back trust in the political process to deliver real value to people’s lives. As I argue in The Value of Everything, we should also consider how to reform the financial sector, which needs to find a clearer relationship with the real economy, to fuel capital investment and innovation rather than be a speculative sector obsessed with itself. We should not underestimate the new tools required, including those that the Treasury uses to evaluate public investments, which are too often encumbered by static cost benefit analysis that would have killed any mission from the start. Also needed is a new sense of confidence in the state’s ability to deliver, and commensurate investment in skills, capabilities, and people in the public sector. Learning organisations, able to explore and experiment require internal investments—less outsourcing to think tanks and consultants. This is not easy, but one thing my visit has reinforced is that Australians don’t shy away from a challenge. In fact, as research by my hosts the Centre for Policy Development shows, Australians might be uniquely up for the task of rebuilding the effectiveness of their democracy. Already, you have major institutions making a big difference. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, now the largest state green bank in the world, is one leading example of a public institution playing a critical role in Australia’s clean energy innovation system and emissions reduction. Australia’s public servants also played a pivotal role in drafting and shaping the global Sustainable Development Goals, from which a whole set of Australian “moonshots” could be chosen. The stakes are high, but so is the appetite for change. As an election year looms, it is time Australians think more about where they want their economy to take them, and demand that their next government has the courage to lead the way.

2018-08-13T15:00:37Z,Tax havens shielding companies responsible for deforestation and overfishing,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/13/tax-havens-shielding-companies-deforestation-overfishing,"Money channelled through secretive tax havens has been used to fuel deforestation in the Amazon and illegal fishing around the world, racking up a heavy environmental toll but leaving few ways for businesses to be held to account. Billions of pounds worth of finance has travelled through countries internationally recognised as tax havens, and has been traced by researchers to activities that contribute to environmental destruction, such as growing soy and beef in deforested areas of the Amazon, and expanding a network of largely unregulated fishing vessels operating under “flags of convenience”. The amounts traced are likely to be just a fraction of the total amount channelled through tax havens that ends up funding environmentally destructive behaviour, according to Beatrice Crona, co-author of a report published today in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. Victor Galaz, of the Stockholm Resilence Centre at Stockholm University and lead author of the study, added: “The use of tax havens is not only a sociopolitical and economic challenge, but also an environmental one. While the use of tax haven jurisdictions is not illegal, financial secrecy hampers the ability to analyse how financial flows affect economic activities on the ground, and their environmental impacts.” The study found that more than two thirds of foreign capital directed to Brazil’s soy and beef sectors between 2000 and 2011, as recorded by the Central Bank of Brazil, was channelled through tax havens. Soy and beef farming have been associated with deforestation in the Amazon. During the period studied, almost $27bn of foreign capital was transferred to key companies within these sectors, and of this about $18.4bn came through tax havens, with the Cayman Islands most commonly used. Crona, executive director of the Global Economic Dynamics and the Biosphere programme at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the availability of the data from Brazil’s central bank for the period in question was unusual, and shone a brief light into what is likely to be a much greater global business. Green campaigners called on governments to make finance flows more transparent. “This is dirty money, used for fuelling illegal activities that are driving the global environmental crisis,” said Elaine Gilligan, international campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Aggressive tax evasion deprives communities of funds needed for a range of measures, among them environmental protections that play a part in fighting climate chaos.” Action was overdue, she said. “It’s clear the UK government can do a lot to fix this. For a start they should support international efforts to end tax havens and follow through their commitment to greater transparency in British overseas territories.” Andrea Marandino, sustainable finance manager at WWF, added that companies could also play a role. “Nature is facing unprecedented threats as we continue to take more resources from the world’s richest natural areas. Tax havens make it very difficult to track international flows of capital and that means there is no accountability,” she said. “If we are to secure a future for areas like the Amazon, we need to see greater corporate transparency and traceability of flows of capital around the world that fund the destruction of nature.” On the oceans, about 70% of vessels that have been implicated in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing were registered in tax havens, according to the study’s findings. The ownership of fishing vessels has long been of interest to campaigners, because of the vast differences that exist in the monitoring and regulation of fishing in various jurisdictions. Complex webs of ownership allow catches to be traded, landed and in some cases disposed of outside the regulations that are supposed to prevent overfishing. Tony Long, chief executive of Global Fishing Watch, said: “[The paper] adds to the growing evidence illustrating the criminal and shady practices providing cover for illegal, unreported and unregulated [IUU] fishing. An international focus on flags of convenience and their insufficient diligence in monitoring their flagged vessels is long overdue.” Vessel owners can use “flags of convenience” to disguise their activities or make them harder to track, by registering their vessel under a jurisdiction that has lax regulation on shipping. The massive overlap between vessels known to be operating in IUU fishing and flying flags of convenience from acknowledged tax havens shows the extent of the problem, the authors of the Nature study said. Long called for transparency in vessel movements, licensing, catch documentation and the disclosure of the true owners of all fishing vessels. “Without this, these unscrupulous operators will extract everything they can from our ocean, to line their own pockets with money at the expense of sustainable ocean resources,” he said. The secrecy that companies enjoy from their business in tax havens is used primarily for reducing their tax payments, by transferring money among jurisdictions to take advantage of low tax rates. Some of the methods used and companies involved have been highlighted in recent years by revelations in the so-called Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, covered extensively by the Guardian. But the lack of transparency also enables those wishing to do so to hide their environmentally destructive activities, said the researchers in the Nature study. They called for the UN to examine how such money funds environmental harm. Opening up tax havens to scrutiny by regulators and the public would be unpopular with the thousands of companies, many of them household names, that take advantage of their existence and lax regulation. Many companies pride themselves on their high environmental standards, but still channel funds through tax havens to reduce their tax payments, which is estimated to cost governments $200bn a year in lost tax revenues. Once money has passed into tax havens, there is little way of finding out how and where it has been used. The Nature paper does not name individual companies, though some were questioned as part of the research.",Deforestation; Fishing; Tax havens; Environment; World news; Trees and forests,Environment
2018-06-01T09:40:03Z,"Antibiotic apocalypse: EU scraps plans to tackle drug pollution, despite fears of rising resistance",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/01/antibiotic-apocalypse-eu-scraps-plans-to-tackle-drug-pollution-despite-fears-of-rising-resistance,"The EU has scrapped plans for a clampdown on pharmaceutical pollution that contributes to the spread of deadly superbugs. Plans to monitor farm and pharmaceutical companies, to add environmental standards to EU medical product rules and to oblige environmental risk assessments for drugs used by humans have all been discarded, leaked documents seen by the Guardian reveal. An estimated 700,000 people die every year from antimicrobial resistance, partly due to drug-resistant bacteria created by the overuse, misuse and dumping of antibiotics. The UK’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has warned that failing to act could lead to a post-antibiotic apocalypse, spelling “the end of modern medicine” as routine infections defy effective treatment. Some studies predict that antimicrobial resistance could cost $100tn (£75tn) between now and 2050, with the annual death toll reaching 10 million over that period. An EU strategy for pharmaceuticals in the environment was supposed to propose ways to avert the threat, but leaked material shows that a raft of ideas contained in an early draft have since been diluted or deleted. Proposals that have fallen by the wayside include an EU push to have environmental criteria for antibiotic use included in international agreements as “good manufacturing practice requirements”. This would have allowed EU inspectors to visit factories in Asia or Africa, sanctioning them were evidence of pharmaceutical pollution found. In turn, this could have impacted trade negotiations between the EU and India, where waterway pollution more than doubled in the first half of this decade, partly due to industrial effluent. India is an outsourced hub for global drug manufacturing and a study published last year in the science journal Infection said “excessively high” levels of pollution from antibiotics were found in waterways around Hyderabad. Nusa Urbancic, a spokeswoman for the Changing Markets Foundation, said: “We are shocked that the European commission seems willing to get rid of the option to include environmental criteria … so early on in the process, given the overwhelming evidence presented about how pharmaceutical pollution contributes to the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria.” A replacement passage in the new draft suggesting “the possibility of using procurement policy to encourage greener pharmaceutical design” was described as “completely lame” and “entirely toothless” by Nina Renshaw, secretary general of the European Public Health Alliance. “This approach will not work as worst offenders will still have the option to continue dumping antibiotics into their local environment,” said Renshaw. Another dropped proposal would have ensured that pharmaceutical firms collect, monitor and share data on the discharge of their microbials into effluent from global hotspots, often caused by intensive livestock farms. Scientists have noted a worrying lack of global research into such links, and the information shortfall may have commercial and public health repercussions. Sasja Beslik, the head of sustainable finance at Nordea Bank AB, which holds €300bn (£263bn) in assets, said that revealing the data would “increase transparency and make investors more informed about risks. For us, timely and adequate information is key to assess materiality of risks.” The inclusion of environmental criteria in good manufacturing practices would be “crucial” for drug makers, he added. The drift of the commission’s strategy has been in the opposite direction, however. An initial objective to “reduce the nonessential use of pharmaceuticals” has been replaced with a more corporate-friendly goal, to “promote the prudent use of pharmaceuticals”. One EU source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “That is not the wording we would have chosen, or that we drafted for this. There has been some rewording and toning down of the level of commitment – because we can’t make those commitments without investigating further – and so they’ve become more vague.” Urbancic, though, was unconvinced. “The commission’s strategy has already been delayed for three years,” she said. “The weakening of this draft has the fingerprints of pharmaceutical industry all over it.” The European commission refuses to comment on leaked documents but sources said that there had been “no particular pressure” on officials who compiled the earlier draft. The pharmaceutical industry spent nearly €40m on lobbying EU institutions in 2015, according to voluntary declarations, and enjoys infamously easy access to officials. Public records show that the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations had more than 50 meetings with the Juncker commission in its first four and a half months of office. In the same period, GlaxoSmithKline had 15 meetings with the commission, Novartis had eight engagements, Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson had six sessions apiece, while Pfizer and Eli Lilly both met with EU officials five times each. Other scrapped measures in the EU strategy would have obliged pharmaceutical companies to complete environmental risk assessments for human medicinal products before they could be authorised. Most pharmaceuticals currently lack details about their ecotoxicological properties. The final version of the EU’s strategy on pharmaceuticals in the environment is expected to be published later this summer.",Antibiotics; European Union; European Commission; Pharmaceuticals industry; Environment; Business,Environment
