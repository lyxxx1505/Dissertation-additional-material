2023-08-26T06:00:31Z,Ethical savings: NS&I raises rate on green bond to 5.7%,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/26/ethical-savings-nsi-raises-rate-on-green-bond-to-57,"Savers who want to make a difference with their cash no longer have to sacrifice a decent return after National Savings and Investments raised the rate on its green bond to 5.7%. The UK government-backed provider is offering the deal over a three-year term and savers will not be able to access their money in that period. Money invested in the green savings bond helps finance projects chosen by the government, which include offshore windfarms and flood defences, and tree-planting and sustainable farming schemes. So far more than £915m has been put into the accounts, which were announced in the spring budget of 2021. The rate is a marked improvement on the previous 4.2% and, according to industry experts, means sacrificing only a small amount when compared with market-leading accounts. Laura Suter, the head of personal finance at the advice firm AJ Bell, said the three-year bond “is just shy of the market-leading rate for a three-year account, which stands at 6.05%. On £10,000 of savings that means savers are sacrificing about £35 of interest a year to go green.” However, Suter added that the rate put it just ahead of Gatehouse Bank’s three-year Woodland Saver, which paid 5.5% and planted a tree for every account opened. The fixed-rate savings market has been competitive in recent months as challenger banks have fought older providers for business. The rising Bank of England base rate has allowed them to offer ever better returns, and the best-buy tables have changed frequently as new accounts have been offered. NS&amp;I is offering a 30-day cooling-off period to savers who want to switch accounts but after that they must wait the full three years to withdraw money. For anyone who recently opened the NS&amp;I bond at the lower rate, Suter suggested they check if they were still within the cooling-off period. She said the pace of change in the market made it hard for savers to know if they had locked in at the right time. “While we’re not expecting huge increases in the base rate this year, it is expected to climb further from here, so savers need to think about whether fixed rates will improve after they have locked in,” she said. “Three years is also a long time to lock away money with no chance of early exit, so savers need to be certain they won’t want to access the money in that time.” Dax Harkins, the NS&amp;I chief executive, said the rate rise provided “a great opportunity for savers who want to see a guaranteed return on their investment while also making a difference with their savings by helping to make the world greener, cleaner and more sustainable”. Mark Hicks, the head of savings at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while not market-leading, “it may well be enough for those savers looking to get a good deal for their money while contributing to green projects”. To open an account you must pay in £100 to £100,000 and be aged 16 or older.

2022-05-02T10:12:29Z,Sunak urged to issue green bonds with higher returns if climate goals missed,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/sunak-green-bonds-higher-returns-climate-goals,"Rishi Sunak is being urged to issue a new generation of green bonds that would offer higher returns to investors if the UK government fails to hit its climate change targets. The Social Market Foundation (SMF) said its plan for sustainability-linked bonds would provide ministers with a greater incentive to meet carbon-reduction goals and would help boost the UK’s prospects of being a global financial hub for green finance. A report to be published on Tuesday by the thinktank calls on the chancellor to follow the example of Chile, the first country to peg the borrowing costs on its government debt to tackling global heating. Scott Corfe, the research director at the SMF, said: “Financial services will be key for delivering on net zero, and green finance could be one of Britain’s great economic success stories in the 2020s. Already, 200,000 financial services workers are in green jobs – a number that will undoubtedly grow over the coming years. “Government needs to work in partnership with the financial services industry to make Britain the leading hub of sustainability-linked finance. Leading by example, the chancellor should issue a new generation of sustainability-linked government bonds which would tie interest payments to the country’s net zero targets. Not only would this support green financial services but the prospect of financial penalties for missing net zero targets would strengthen the government’s commitment to decarbonisation.” Corfe said Sunak should start small in order to test investor interest but added the Chilean example suggested demand would be high. In March, Chile issued a $2bn (£1.6bn) sustainability-linked bond, which was four times oversubscribed. Returns to investors depend on the country adhering to its climate change pledges, including that it emits no more than 95 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent by 2030, and renewables account for 60% of electricity production by 2032. If Chile misses a target, it incurs a financial penalty. Sunak is keen for London to be a centre for green finance and last year announced a programme under which the proceeds from green bonds would be used for environmental projects. The Treasury says two bond issues had already raised £16bn but it would need to be confident new forms of funding would result in strong, sustained demand and represent value for money to taxpayers. “The UK is a world leader in green finance and the chancellor set out a clear pathway at Cop26 for the UK to become the world’s first net zero-aligned financial centre,” a Treasury spokesman said. The SMF said issuing a sustainability-linked bond would show the government was “fully committed” to decarbonisation. The threat of financial penalties for overpromising and underdelivering could prove “a powerful way of holding government true to its word on net zero”. The interest rate, or coupon, on a standard government bond is set when it is auctioned to investors, with the interest rates on index-linked bonds adjusting in line with inflation.",Rishi Sunak; Business; Climate crisis; Green economy; Environment; Politics; UK news; Chile; Government borrowing,Politics
2023-11-18T07:00:14Z,UK savers urged to act quickly for best returns as rates drop ,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/18/uk-savers-urged-to-act-quickly-for-best-returns-as-rates-drop,"Savers have been urged to act quickly if they want to get the best returns on their money after a flurry of interest rate cuts on top-paying accounts. This week NS&amp;I reduced the rate it offers on its three-year green bonds from 5.7% to 3.95%, while Shawbrook, Tandem and Ford Money were among other providers making cuts. One standout account has bucked this trend. Last week, Metro Bank increased the rate on its Instant Access Savings account to 5.22%, including a 3.46% bonus for the first 12 months. The account can be opened online or in a branch, and to get the bonus you must pay in at least £500 within 28 days. Falling inflation means that savers can now achieve an interest rate that outstrips rising prices. It is, however, no longer possible to find a fixed-rate savings account paying above 6%, and experts said that the best deals may be quickly fully subscribed. “Savers will no longer find a bond that pays more than 6% but it is worth noting that challenger banks are still holding the top spots despite shuffling positions,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk. “These institutions can launch enticing offers to attract deposits for their future lending but they also act quickly to pull offers when they become fully subscribed. Consumers will need to act quickly to grab the top deals on offer and consider the more unfamiliar brands when comparing deals.”",Savings rates; Savings; Money; Banks and building societies; UK news; Interest rates; Business; Banking,Money
2024-06-12T17:00:02Z,How will new EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles work?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/12/how-will-new-eu-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles-work,"The EU has told Beijing that it plans to impose new tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles into the trading bloc, potentially triggering a trade war. So what are the details, how will it affect the industry and will the price of cars on the dealership forecourt be affected? What are the tariffs? The tariffs are aimed at countering the alleged state support handed to China’s car manufacturing industry, which has allowed exported vehicles to be sold at cheaper prices than those of global rivals. It follows a nine-month investigation into alleged unfair state subsidies into Chinese battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and the level of the tariffs differ depending on the brand. The MG owner, SAIC, faces the top tariff. Geely, which owns a stake in Volvo, faces a tariff of 20%. A 17.4% duty will be applied to BYD brands, which include the Dolphin and Seal cars launched in the EU last year. EV manufacturers that cooperated with EU investigators will face a tariff of 21%, while those that did not face the top tier of 38.1%. A 17.1% tariff will push the cost of an entry level €30,000 car up by €5,250. A 38.1% tariff will translate to a €11,450 increase in price. The charges come on top of the existing 10% levy on cars imported into the EU, meaning Chinese-made EVs face total tariffs of up to 48%. When will they kick in? In theory, 4 July. But Chinese companies have until then to provide evidence to challenge the EU’s findings. The rates could then be adjusted. The European Commission has held out the prospect of resolving the dispute through talks before the tariffs provisionally come into force on 4 July. If a consumer ordered a car before this date and the price is already locked in they should avoid the price hikebut they should check their contract. The EU believes that conglomerates like BYD can absorb the level of subsidy and still compete with European rivals by not completely passing tariffs on to the consumer. What is the extent of the Chinese state support the EU alleges? The EU contends that every stage of the EV manufacturing process, from the mine that produces lithium used in batteries to the shipping of cars to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge are subsidised in China by the state at national, regional and local level. Its investigation also found cheap or free land given over to car factories. It found there were case-specific subsidies with alleged provision of lithium and batteries below market price, with battery suppliers acting as public bodies implementing national industrial policy. It also found there were tax exemptions for the battery sector. The investigation discovered a suite of financing advantages including green bonds issued at a lower rate than available in international markets and preferential refinancing rates for funds dispersed in support of the sector. Xi Jinping hopes to achieve global domination in the green tech sector, which also includes solar panels, heat pumps and wind turbines. What is the impact on the European industry? The EU claims that the state support not only enables Chinese car suppliers to directly undercut European rivals, but is causing the slowdown of the EU’s transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to BEVs. The EU plans to end the sale of new ICE cars by 2035. According to the EU, China-made cars accounted for 25% of the EU market in 2023, up from 3.9%. The EU argues that the brutal trade wars in China that have forced prices down at home are now being played out in Europe, with China effectively forcing EU manufacturers to suppress their own prices and in turn hurting their profits and future potential investment. What have the Chinese said? A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said the EU’s investigation was a “typical case of protectionism” and tariffs would damage China-EU economic cooperation and the stability of production and supply chains of vehicles globally. He said Beijing would take all necessary measures to “firmly safeguard” its rights and interests. What has the German government said? It is not happy. Not only are its carmakers facing competition at home but an impending trade war will be a blow to its exports to China. “The European Commission’s punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products,” said the German transport minister, Volker Wissing. China is an important market for Germany’s carmakers – in particular Volkswagen, Europe’s largest auto manufacturer, which has a joint venture with SAIC. Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, has noted that half of EVs imported from China were produced by western manufacturers. What have German car makers said? After the EU announcement, Volkswagen said it rejected the imposition of the duties. “The negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,” a Volkswagen spokesperson said. Germany’s VDA auto industry association said it was in favour of “free and fair trade”. The Mercedes-Benz chief executive, Ola Källenius, added his voice to the concerns, saying that “what we do not need, as an exporting nation, is rising trade barriers”. And what about other manufacturers? Sweden’s Volvo has said it is “analysing” developments in the investigation, Vauxhall owner Stellantis said it “does not support measures that contribute to the world fragmentation” and Chinese EV maker Nio said that “this approach hinders rather than promotes global environmental protection, emission reduction, and sustainable development”.",Automotive industry; China; Chinese economy; European Union; Asia Pacific; Business; Europe; World news; Germany; Global economy; Tariffs,Business
2024-01-27T17:00:42Z,"To get to net zero, we may have to sell off the UK’s future",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/27/to-get-to-net-zero-we-may-have-to-sell-off-the-uks-future,"If Labour forms the next government, as polls suggest, it must provide the private sector with the kind of incentives that will lift investment in Britain’s economy, making it more productive and environmentally friendly. Joe Biden has done it for the US. Why not Keir Starmer in the UK? Transforming the economy will come at an outsize cost. Worse, it’s an escalating cost that is way beyond the public finances of Britain and possibly even the EU. There is money on offer from the private sector: the world is swimming in cash looking for a home. It’s the demand for super returns that makes a much-needed upgrade of UK infrastructure – from hospitals to the electricity grid – look unaffordable. Biden is finding this out. His Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is the US’s main vehicle for spurring a move to lower-carbon energy consumption, works alongside, and overlaps with, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips and Science Act, which boosts the US semiconductor industry, at a cost over 10 years of about $2tn (£1.57tn). IRA subsidies and tax breaks on their own, which were originally estimated to cost $385bn, are, according to some analysts, on track to hit $3tn if the US reaches one of the legislation’s main targets – reducing the electricity industry’s emissions to 25% of its 2022 total. To rival the US effort, the EU has put together the £600bn NextGenerationEU fund to finance the green and digital transitions. It sounds large but is stretched over 27 countries and will need to be supplemented by private funds to achieve its aims. The UK, meanwhile, is taking a piecemeal approach with one-off subsidies that amount to a few billion pounds. Labour’s £28bn green investment fund is larger – if it is not scaled down any further before the election – and based on a more coherent industrial strategy, yet still looks puny in a global context. That leaves the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, like all her counterparts in the industrialised world, needing huge amounts of private capital to get investment moving. The subsidies demanded by the owner of British Steel, China’s Jingye Group, and the Port Talbot steelworks owner Tata to switch from coal to electric furnaces have been eye-watering, and give a taste of what is to come. Green bonds and infrastructure bonds, which generate money for projects that aim to reduce emissions, are seen as a significant funding source, but have proved to be very expensive and the price is likely to stay high, limiting their attraction. Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, has flagged a solution that is likely to become increasingly popular in government circles: offering credits in return for green commitments from the private sector. That’s what the London climate resilience review, authored by former Environment Agency boss Emma Howard Boyd, suggests can be used to generate investment in the capital. In an interim report last week, she suggested offering credits to buyers such as private landlords, local authorities, or utilities companies such as Thames Water, if they undertake work at their own cost to produce “a measurable reduction” in the area of impermeable surfaces that exacerbate flooding. These credits could last decades and be used to offset the bad behaviour of the buyer – say, the carbon-generating aspects of the business – as it seeks to achieve net zero. Carbon credits have been around for some time and are not uncontroversial. The credits are based on markets that critics say price them too cheaply, meaning large industrial firms can afford to buy them and carry on much as before. Howard Boyd says there are ways to make sure credits connected to infrastructure projects in London would not be abused. She also recommends further research into “financial models that create markets for investment in nature-based solutions”. In the 1980s, the UK paid its way by selling – at a huge discount – dozens of state-owned assets, from North Sea oil and gas rights to British Telecom, BP and British Airways. In the 1990s came the privatisation of the rail network and National Grid. The Blair government, realising much of the past wealth had been sold, turned to the future, selling licences (to mobile phone companies) and long-term contracts, such as the ill-fated private finance initiative. There is even less state cash to play with these days if we accept that entrenched political interests prevent reform of the tax system and that state borrowing has limits. It leads politicians of all colours to consider innovative ways to raise finance. Infrastructure credits might work, but they can’t disguise the huge effort needed – expended today or tomorrow – to reach net zero.",Economics; Green economy; Privatisation; Demutualisation; Business; Economic policy; Environment; Politics; Tax and spending,Business
2024-02-15T09:00:03Z,"Why is Labour still using the self-defeating, discredited ‘maxed out credit card’ analogy? | Yanis Varoufakis",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/15/labour-credit-card-analogy-mendacious-tory,"Rarely has a lacklustre policy been abandoned for a reason so bad that it threatens to inflict long-term damage on a society. Independently of whether the £28bn green investment programme was the right policy for the next Labour government to commit to, Rachel Reeves’s reasons for ditching it were an undeserved gift to the Tories and a partial vindication of their disgraceful flirtations with an austerian, anti-green political narrative. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today shortly after her U-turn on Labour’s headline £28bn green transition programme, the shadow chancellor explained her decision by claiming that, under Jeremy Hunt, the Treasury is “planning on maxing out the credit card”, adding for good effect that the Tories are “maxing out the headroom ahead of the next general election” thus limiting “what an incoming Labour government will be able to achieve”. By comparing the state’s coffers to an overladen credit card, Reeves endorsed an insidious fallacy. If we owe George Osborne anything, it is irrefutable empirical evidence that using the analogy of a credit card for a nation’s budget (along with inane “belt tightening” and “fixing the roof when it is sunny” metaphors) is a terrible basis for prudent fiscal policy. It is true that the Tories will leave scorched earth behind for the next government, with a budget dripping in red ink and a pitiful level of investment in the technologies and services the UK needs to escape a long-term slump. But this is precisely the reason why Labour must reject the austerian urges that, inevitably, spring from the credit card analogy. When your credit card is “maxed out”, you do indeed need immediately to tighten your belt. The reason why parsimony works for you, and helps limit your debt, is that you are blessed with an income that is independent of what you decide to spend money on. In other words, if you don’t buy the shoes or new phone you covet, your income will not diminish, and so your deficit will shrink reliably. But the state’s budget is nothing like a credit card. As chancellor of the exchequer, your (tax) income is highly dependent on your (public) spending. Limit your spending and you have limited your income too. This is why the more Osborne slashed public spending in the 2010s, the more money he needed to borrow. By adopting the “maxed credit card” narrative, Reeves endorsed Osborne’s flawed logic and, indirectly, absolved the Tories for the wanton damage they have inflicted on a generation of Britons. Austerity, and the credit card analogy that provides its thin veneer of logic, is not just bad for workers and people in desperate need of state support during tough times; it also depresses investment. By hastening the stagnation of a society’s aggregate income, it signals to businesses that they would be mad to put money into building up the capacity to produce the output that society is too impecunious to buy. That’s how austerity undermined investment in Britain and that’s how it will annul Labour’s ambition to draw in private green investments, now that Reeves has ditched her modest green public investment plan, replacing it with wishful thinking that the private sector will, magically, make up the difference. But none of this means that the ditched £28bn policy was optimal or, indeed, that an incoming chancellor can safely commit the Treasury to borrow and spend unlimited amounts. The difficulty that any British government faces today is that, since President Biden inaugurated his expansive green transition spending spree (improbably labelled the Inflation Reduction Act), the UK is caught up in a subsidy war between the US, China and, to some extent, Germany and France. This is a multitrillion-dollar subsidy contest that the UK cannot win and, thus, should not enter. In this context, were it to be spent as planned (ie, as Inflation Reduction Act-like subsidies for private business), Labour’s £28bn would be a mere drop in the ocean, incapable of diverting the torrent of capital rushing into the US and China. If subsidies are a fool’s wager when competing with the US, whose central bank mints the world’s reserve currency, what should Britain do? Having dropped the fantasy that subsidies can attract battery manufacturers and microchip producers to the UK in numbers consistent with a British green industrial revolution, a Labour government should do two things. Set aside a modest sum (say, £6bn) to subsidise energy conservation and, critically, found a public investment bank to inject green investments into green tech enterprises directly (private or public) to the tune of up to 3% of national income annually. These large sums can be raised, not through Treasury bonds that need to be repaid by taxpayers, but by bonds issued by a new public investment bank – to be repaid from the proceeds of the green enterprises they fund. The Bank of England could also help with an announcement: if the price of these green bonds were to fall below a certain point, it would buy them second-hand – even while selling off its stock of Treasury bonds. This mere announcement would ensure it would not need actually to buy them because investors would rush in to snap them up, thus leaving Britain’s public debt servicing costs unaffected. In 1942, John Maynard Keynes proclaimed: “Let us not submit to the vile doctrine of the 19th century that every enterprise must justify itself in pounds, shillings and pence of cash income … Assuredly we can afford this and so much more. Anything we can actually do, we can afford.” Britain’s conundrum, today, is that the next government, whose job will be to fix the Tories’ mess, is led by politicians who share neither Keynes’s aims nor his innovative approach to public finance. Judging by Reeves’s recent performance, they seem to care more about the fiscal hawks in their midst and in the Tory press. So much so that, to prove their mettle as bona fide austerians, they adopt the most pernicious allegory to have disgraced economic thinking.

2023-07-26T14:37:07Z,How can UK political parties win support for a bold green agenda?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/26/how-can-uk-political-parties-win-support-for-a-bold-green-agenda,"Mikaela Loach, youth climate justice activist, author of It’s Not That Radical: Climate Action to Transform Our World The most important thing is to make clear that action on climate change will materially improve people’s lives. Insulation can mean warmer homes in winter, cooler homes in summer. Better air quality, greener cities – these are good for people’s health. It’s a deep shame that this government are not framing policy in this way, and instead making this a culture war issue – there’s no need for that. And if we don’t subsidise oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, we can have more money to spend elsewhere. As a medical student, I have experienced the decimation of the NHS. It is wrong to hand billions to fossil fuel companies. Tom Burke, co-founder and chair, E3G thinktank, and veteran adviser to governments The Tories are clearly split on the climate, and Keir Starmer had a wonderful opportunity to drive a wedge through them on this issue – and he missed that chance. People need to be told what the consequences of inaction on the climate are. Look at Florida and parts of California, where people can’t get home insurance because of the fire risk. Earlier this year, the price of vegetables in the shops went up rapidly, because of extreme weather in Spain. These are what some of the consequences of political failure on the climate look like, and they only get far worse. Helen Clarkson, chief executive, the Climate Group Australia has done this – the last election was fought on the climate. There was a huge gap opening up between what people could see with their own eyes and what they were being told by the previous government on the climate. We are getting that cognitive dissonance in the UK now too: newspaper front pages saying renege on net zero, alongside pictures of the fires in Greece. People can see what’s going on, and businesses are worried too – they want policy consistency, and endless flip-flopping is really damaging. Oil and gas businesses would like us to row back on climate policy, but big companies in other sectors don’t. Bob Ward, policy director, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics Here’s what a green strategy could look like: Sovereign green bonds can raise the money for investments in accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels. Ban new oil and gas development. New planning rules that allow communities to share benefits for hosting solar and wind farms. A national programme to electrify heating, carried out street by street. Every new building from 2030 to meet energy performance certificate A standard, and a clear timetable to retrofit every existing home and business to the same standard by 2040. A massive recruitment and training programme, including apprenticeships, to create the workforce for building our smart and clean buildings and transport system. Shaun Spiers, executive director, Green Alliance thinktank [In the US] Joe Biden is already doing this – the Inflation Reduction Act is popular and is the future of the US economy, taking advantage of opportunities. I can’t really see a future for British jobs and economic growth, except by doubling down on going green. What is the alternative? That’s what anyone who wants to row back on green policies has to show us. There is a panic among the UK’s blue-chip businesses, who see the economic importance of the green agenda, and are alarmed that they’re being cast adrift. Paul Bledsoe, strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, and former White House climate adviser under President Bill Clinton The US under Joe Biden has made the politically wise decision to subsidise clean energy technologies to cut emissions, rather than imposing a tax on fossil fuels which American voters despise. This approach already has attracted tens of billions of dollars in new clean energy investments, with the promise of trillions more over the next decades creating millions of new jobs and reducing consumer energy costs while cutting US emissions deeply.",Green politics; UK news; Environment; Climate crisis; Politics,Environment
2023-09-30T06:00:08Z,Savings experts say UK rates could soon fall. Here’s where to invest while you can,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/sep/30/savings-experts-say-uk-rates-could-soon-fall-heres-where-to-invest-while-you-can,"It could be “grab them before they’re gone” time when it comes to some of the top-paying savings accounts, assuming that UK interest rates are now at or near their peak. There are accounts on offer paying more than 6% but some savings experts said this week that those thinking of signing up may want to get a move on, as the very best deals may not be around for much longer. This may already be starting to happen: during the last few days, some fixed-rate savings bonds have had their rates trimmed. “With the base rate potentially having peaked sooner and lower than anticipated, we could start to see [fixed-rate] bonds being withdrawn once the tranches have been filled,” says Anna Bowes, a co-founder of the Savings Champion website. She adds: “If you see something … now is the time to act.” While we are not generally seeing further increases to fixed-rate bond interest rates after the decision by the Bank of England on 21 September to hold the base rate at 5.25%, Bowes says we are “still seeing a little bit of upward movement” on some easy-access account rates. Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, says that if you have been waiting to grab a top fixed savings rate, “it’s worth getting your skates on”, although she adds: “While we may see some of the most competitive rates retreat, we’re not expecting dramatic drops in the immediate future.” Here, we round up some of the top-paying accounts that may be worth grabbing now if you have money you can afford to put into savings. The account paying 8% interest Called Flex Regular Saver, this is available exclusively to Nationwide’s current account customers, and it tops the table for regular savings accounts. If you are not with Nationwide, the building society is attempting to attract new current account customers by offering a £200 payment to anyone who moves to it using the bank industry’s switching service. The 8% interest rate lasts for a year, and customers can save up to £200 a month in the online-managed account, which permits up to three withdrawals within the 12 months. If four or more withdrawals are made, the rate on the account will drop to 2.15%. If you put the maximum £200 into the Flex Regular Saver on the first day of each month, after the 12 months you would have earned £104 interest. Fixed-rate bonds paying 6.2% At the time of writing, National Savings and Investments’ (NS&amp;I) one-year fixed-rate guaranteed growth and income bonds paying 6.2% still had the top spot in the best-buy table for one-year fixed-rate savings bonds – but it is far from clear how long they will be around for. They were launched at the end of August and are likely to have proved hugely popular, so if you want to benefit from that rate, it is probably best to apply sooner rather than later. You can invest from £500 to £1m, and you can’t take your money out until after the 12 months are up. Once you have bought one of these bonds, you can’t add any more money to it. You can buy more bonds, though, assuming they are still on sale. (Each bond is a separate investment with its own maturity date.) Fixed-rate savings bonds paying 6% or more Ford Money and Ikano Bank are two of the slightly better-known providers offering bonds paying 6.05%. Ford Money – a division of Ford Motor Company – is paying that rate to people who tie up their money for one year, 18 months or two years. To get 6.05% at Ikano Bank – originally part of Ikea and still owned by the family that founded the retailer – you need to put your money away for two years. If you go for a one-year account, the rate is 6%. The Ford Money accounts have a minimum opening deposit of £500, while at Ikano Bank, it is £1,000. Other providers who were at the time of writing offering fixed-rate bonds paying above 6% included Sainsbury’s Bank, which has a one-year bond paying 6.01%. The highest-paying savings bonds where the rate is fixed for five years are paying a little less than 6% – about 5.75% to 5.8% was the best you could get this week, according to the data provider Moneyfacts – but if interest rates end up falling back quite a bit from where they are now over the next couple of years or so, taking out one of those could look like a canny move. However, some people will not want to tie up their cash for that long. Bonds paying 5.7% Savers who want to make a difference with their cash are still able to stash money in NS&amp;I’s Green Savings online-only bonds which are fixed for three years. There are three-year savings bonds available that pay slightly more than 5.7% – for example, Ikano Bank offers one that pays 5.95%. However, NS&amp;I has the backing of the Treasury, which guarantees 100% of everything you invest. Also, money invested in the green bonds helps finance projects chosen by the government, ranging from offshore windfarms and flood defences to tree-planting and sustainable farming schemes. To open one of the NS&amp;I accounts, you must pay in between £100 and £100,000, and savers will not be able to access their money during the three years.",Savings; Savings rates; Money; Banks and building societies; Interest rates; Banking; Business; UK news; Nationwide,Money
2023-04-21T15:00:45Z,Labor promises to ‘grab this opportunity’ to become renewable energy superpower,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/22/labor-promises-to-grab-this-opportunity-to-become-renewable-energy-superpower,"The Albanese government has promised to “grab this opportunity” to become a renewable energy superpower after holding a high-level roundtable with major banks, financiers and investment managers. The Friday roundtable in Brisbane comes after the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said on Monday that next month’s federal budget would see major investments in “cleaner and cheaper” energy. Chalmers joined more than 30 figures from clean energy and climate, including representatives of investors and superannuation funds with more than $2tn under management. But investors at the Brisbane roundtable warned the US government’s multi-billion dollar package to attract and build clean energy projects risked making it harder to attract finance for projects in Australia. The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act is creating a huge clean energy momentum that will drive down costs, but Australia will need to act quickly to take advantage of the shift, investors said. Chalmers said: “the most important part of our strategy to grow the Australian economy is grabbing these opportunities for cleaner and cheaper energy. “The government and the investment community understand that our prospects in this defining decade will be determined by how we manage and maximise this clean energy transformation.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads He again signalled a theme of next month’s budget would be clean energy and investments in industry “so Australia can be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the net zero transformation and not the victim of that transformation”. Investors and clean energy groups welcomed the roundtable – which included the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen – saying it signalled the government’s intent to put a clean energy transition at the front of its economic agenda. After the roundtable, the government said it would create a “sovereign green bonds” program to be rolled out mid-2024 to raise finance for public projects that support Australia’s net zero transformation. Bonds give investors regular interest payments with a promise to return the principal at the end of a fixed term. The government would also co-fund a development phase of an “Australian Sustainable Finance Taxonomy” – a project to help investors more easily target their funds towards particular kinds of sustainability projects. The government also announced it would expand and upgrade a national energy rating scheme for existing homes “which means people will be able to seek a star rating of their home’s energy performance”, a statement said. An extra $4.3m would go to corporate watchdog Asic to allow it to expand “surveillance and enforcement functions” on businesses making green claims. Concerns were raised during the roundtable that the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act – a US$369bn package of climate measures and incentives passed last year – was making it harder to attract capital to Australia. Anna Freeman, policy director at the Clean Energy Council who attended the roundtable, said: “The IR Act means we are facing some real risks and challenges that we will need to respond to, and the government is alert to that.” Freeman said the roundtable came against a backdrop of rising costs for clean energy projects related to post-Covid supply chain bumps, inflation and the knock-on effects of rising energy costs. But she said there was “a very strong message” the government was “focused on putting the clean energy transition at the centre” of its economic agenda. Simon Corbell, chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, said: “it was a very clear message that the IR Act is having an enormous impact on investment decisions globally. “The challenge for Australia,” he said, was to “make sure it’s got the right policy settings in place so we can benefit from the very significant decreases in technology costs that the IR Act will drive.” Rebecca Mikula-Wright, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said the IR Act “is both good for the planet and will drive down the costs for everyone else globally” but said Australia “can’t and should not attempt to match the scale of clean subsidies emerging globally”. “Instead we can be a fast-follower, acting quickly to deploy our resources and make the most of the opportunities provided to us. This enables us to focus on our value add and competitive advantage onshore. “For example leveraging our abundant renewable energy potential to manufacture green steel in Australia, further boosting industries and jobs.” John Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, said: “so many of us have been trying to blow the horn for so long to say this is a massive opportunity for the economy. “To see this at the heart of government planning is an overwhelming relief. When governments consult well, plan well and listen, we get better policy outcomes. It’s clear they want to get it right.”",Renewable energy; Energy; Australia news; Energy; Australian politics; Anthony Albanese; Labor party; Environment; Jim Chalmers,Environment
2023-03-30T21:07:07Z,Brazilian meat firm’s A- sustainability rating has campaigners up in arms,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/brazilian-meatpackers-a--sustainability-rating-raises-grade-inflation-concerns,"The award of an A-minus sustainability grade to the world’s biggest meat company has raised eyebrows and kicked off a debate about the rating system for environmental and social governance. Brazilian meat company JBS has previously been linked to deforestation in the Amazon, where its slaughterhouses process beef from ranches carved out of the Amazon, Cerrado and other biomes. But in the latest Climate Change Report by the influential rating organisation CDP, the multinational got a grade of A- for its efforts to tackle climate change – up from B in the previous assessment – and was given a “leadership” status award. The high score, which was based on self-reporting by JBS, has provoked incredulity. Twenty civil society groups are now calling on the London-based CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) to strip JBS of its A-minus score amid accusations of greenwashing and misleading investors, supermarkets and consumers. In a letter to CDP, the signatories, which also included Environmental Investigation Agency, Sustain, Ecologistas en Acción and Friends of the Earth, argued it was “wrong, misleading and damaging” to reward JBS with leadership status. “This could not be further from the truth,” the letter claimed, which argued that JBS had a record of deforestation and continued to underreport its supersized climate emissions. Glenn Hurowitz, the founder of the US-based Mighty Earth, which organised the campaign, said: “We want everyone who has dealings with JBS to know the truth about their climate impacts. This is grade inflation of the most egregious variety.” JBS originated in Brazil and grew globally with the support of the national development bank. Almost half of its revenue now comes from the United States, where it sells household brands including Pilgrim’s Pride, Moy Park, Seara and Primo. It also has a significant presence in Australia and strong sales in Europe and China. The company website boasts: “We feed the world with the best.” The company has a fast-growing carbon footprint that is now almost the size of the UK’s. Last year, a study by the Institute of Agriculture and Trade Policy advocacy group estimated the São Paulo-based company had processed 26.8 million cattle, 46.7 million pigs and 4.9 billion chickens, leading to a more than 50% surge in emissions over the previous five years to 421.6m metric tonnes. This calculation was based on a model developed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization that included so-called scope 3 emissions, which include animals in the company’s global supply chain. JBS criticised this assessment as inaccurate but the company has not published its own assessment of its scope three emissions. This was not a requirement for the CDP ranking, which relies more on voluntary disclosures of information and bases its scores on company plans and strategies – such as JBS’s pledge to reduce emissions to net zero by 2040 and to achieve zero deforestation across its global supply chain by 2035 – rather than independently verified data. The improved grade was celebrated by JBS, which posted the news on the front of the company website, under the headline: “The largest and most respected global platform for environmental information raised JBS’s Climate Change 2022 score to A-, above the industry average.” The story below noted that an A- score means “the company is implementing the best market practices in the area assessed” and observed that the average in the food and beverage industry is C. This will have an influence on the company’s bottom line and its social licence. CDP is considered the gold standard for environmental ranking. Its assessments are used by financial institutions, governments and supermarket chains. On its website, CDP boasts that it “supports thousands of companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their risks and opportunities on climate change, water security and deforestation. We do so at the request of their investors, purchasers and city stakeholders”. The result it said was a “system that has resulted in unparalleled engagement on environmental issues worldwide. CDP has also been recognized externally as the best organization for evaluating companies’ environmental and social governance”. Márcio Astrini of the Climate Observatory said the high grade was “curious and contradictory”. JBS has said that it aims to eradicate illegal deforestation from its supply chain by 2025 and achieve zero deforestation by 2035. “Can this deserve such a good score?” Astrini said. Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher with the independent Amazon monitoring institute Imazon, said he was surprised JBS was awarded such an impressive grade given it recently declined to participate in a new “Radar Verde” tracker. When the Guardian asked CDP why it had given JBS such a positive evaluation, a spokesperson said the ratings group was now carrying out an internal review of the JBS score and the impact on its methodology. The transparency charity is also considering changes so there is more reliance on public evidence and less reliance on voluntary disclosure. “We recognise that A- is too high a score for a non-public response, so we will change our classification criteria to reflect this in future.” JBS said deforestation was not included in its last report because guidance on calculating targets for land-use change was only released by the Science Based Targets initiative last year but would be incorporated in the future. It said all emissions calculations were independently verified according to accounting standards set by the greenhouse gas protocol. Despite its high emissions, reluctance to provide scope 3 data and dealings with illegal deforesters, the company promised it would improve in the future: “Our CDP disclosure is a mark of our commitment to transparency as we continue to advance sustainability actions on our journey to net zero by 2040. This includes leading industry efforts to zero deforestation in the Amazon by 2025.” The company will continue to face questions over the sincerity of its commitment. Mighty Earth has accused JBS of greenwashing in a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that alleges $3.2bn worth of “green bonds” issued by the meat company were fraudulent and based on misleading information to investors. The A– score may well prove an element in that case. Hurowitz said CDP wasn’t set up for greenwashing “but that is the danger it faces if this stands”. “There is a risk that gullible financiers may be misled by this,” he said. “As we all learned at our mother’s knee, self-praise is no praise at all.”",Meat industry; Sustainable development; World news; Food; Brazil; Environment; Amazon rainforest; Americas; Deforestation; Food & drink industry,Environment
2022-12-12T09:00:01Z,US banks named as being among least ethical UK operators,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/12/us-banks-named-as-being-among-least-ethical-uk-operators,"Two US banking giants which launched accounts in the UK have been ranked among the “worst” providers by researchers because of their policies on issues such as the climate crisis and weapons. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase both scored poorly due to their records on the environment, human rights and paying tax, according to a new study by Ethical Consumer magazine. Both of the banks were downgraded by the ethical organisation largely because of their investment in fossil fuels in the latest study, which scrutinises financial institutions’ practices against a range of criteria. Triodos Bank, which describes itself as “one of the world’s most sustainable banks”, has been awarded a “best buy” for current and savings accounts in the survey, which is undertaken every two years. It was awarded the highest ranking among 31 current accounts with a green, or good, “Ethiscore” based on its transparency and investment strategy. Meanwhile, the Chase current account, JPMorgan’s consumer brand in the UK, was the fourth-worst ranked current account with a red – or poor – rating and a recommendation that this was a “brand to avoid”. Ethical Consumer is an independent, not-for-profit co-operative founded in 1989 and based in Manchester. It aims to make businesses more sustainable through consumer pressure. In the study, banks were scored against ratings on climate and the environment as well as on financial issues such as director pay and tax avoidance. It also looked at the activities that are funded by the banks and the ethical policies in place to prevent financing of harmful practices. Triodos was applauded for publishing information about every organisation that it lends to. Customers are able to review every organisation in their portfolios, which is not possible with other banks, according to Ethical Consumer. The determination of how ethical a bank is was largely determined by where their money is invested, according to the co-operative, including how transparent they are and whether there are robust policies to stop them funding harmful practices. If a bank was found to have invested in mining, for example, it would lose marks under sections on human and workers’ rights as well as pollution. Only Triodos, Co-op, Nationwide and Cumberland building society did not lend to problematic areas, according to the study. If a bank held shares in, as well as lending to, companies which had unethical practices, they were also deducted marks. Ruairidh Fraser, one of the authors of the report, says banks have a huge impact through their loans and investments. “That’s why it’s so important for customers to know what banks are doing with their money and what policies, if any, guide their choices. But our survey of the banking sector showed that this information is still very hard to find,” he says. Triodos’ current account dropped slightly in its score since the last survey due to what was claimed to be “excessive” executive pay, but remained a leading product as a result of its transparency and positive investment strategy. Goldman Sachs’s Marcus savings account, which has attracted significant interest from UK consumers on the back of attractive rates, also emerged with a poor Ethiscore. Of the savings accounts that were rated, it was one of 22 which received the middle or worst ranking for the likely use of tax avoidance strategies. “The biggest banks all fail miserably on tax,” claims the report. Three financial institutions – Charity Bank, Ecology building society and Triodos – were awarded best buy status in this category. Most of the providers got the worst rating around their carbon management and reporting, as they did not discuss the carbon impacts of their investments and were found to have funded sectors which were deemed to be climate destructive. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, both relatively recent entrants to the UK banking market, were singled out for criticism in the report. Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for JPMorgan defended the banks’ green credentials. “In 2021, JPMorgan Chase facilitated more than $100 billion for green activities like renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation, doubled our green investment banking activity and were the largest underwriter of green bonds,” said the spokesman. “These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1 trillion for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet. We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 emission intensity reduction targets in oil and gas, electric power and automotive manufacturing, while helping the world meet its energy needs securely and affordably.” Bevis Watts, the chief executive of Triodos Bank UK, called on other banks to adopt similar levels of transparency and accountability. “If the financial industry is truly going to be play a part in tackling the combined threats of the environmental and social issues that we are facing, we need each and every bank to reflect these values and make real commitments to investing only in areas that contribute to a sustainable future for everyone.”",Money; Banks and building societies; Goldman Sachs; JP Morgan; Ethical business; Banking; Business,Money
2021-11-14T09:00:29Z,Treasury’s green savings bond offers ‘paltry’ incentive for helping planet,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/nov/14/treasurys-green-savings-bond-offers-paltry-incentive-for-helping-planet,"The government’s green bond promises savers they will be able to “make the world greener, cleaner and more sustainable”. But what they won’t make is a return on their investment that beats other options on the market. When it was launched last month, the bond, from National Savings &amp; Investments (NS&amp;I), was described as a world first – people can invest money that is 100% secure and will be used for government spending on sustainable projects, such as cleaner transport and renewable energy. However, the return on your investment is just 0.65%, fixed for three years – a figure dubbed as “paltry” by the opposition and analysts. “This suggests to savers that green investments are less rewarding financially, when many studies have shown that this is not the case,” says Molly Scott Cato, the Green party’s economic spokesperson and former MEP. “People shouldn’t be offered a lower return for doing the right thing.” The green savings bond was announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak in the spring budget and went on sale at the end of October. Savers can invest from £100 and up to £100,000. The money cannot be withdrawn for three years. It is guaranteed by the Treasury, which means all of the investment is protected. Under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), customers of financial services firms are protected for up to £85,000 is the firm goes bust. The fixed 0.65% rate means that someone who invests £10,000 will earn £65 a year in interest. The amount paid in will contribute towards government spending on green projects in six areas – cleaner transport, such as zero-emission buses; renewable energy, such as wind power and hydrogen research; preventing pollution; making buildings more energy efficient; protecting areas of natural beauty, and countering environmental threats by the installation of projects like flood defences. Figures on how much has been raised will be released at the end of the financial year, according to the Treasury. It says the money invested will be allocated to green projects within two years, and details will be published with the environmental benefits. The rate on the bond is well below that offered on comparable accounts from competitors. In some cases, savers can earn almost three times more. Both UBL UK and United Trust Bank offered 1.82% for a three-year bond – so the same £10,000 would earn £182 a year. JN Bank, meanwhile, offers 1.81%, according to financial information site Moneyfacts. On green bonds, the Gatehouse Bank has a three-year fix Woodland Saver account which pays 1.78%. For every account opened, a tree is planted in a UK woodland. Another option is the Oxbury Forest Saver, a one-year fixed-term bond, which offers 0.7%, The interest earned is not given back to the saver, but instead used to plant trees to mitigate carbon emissions. Green savers also have the option of putting the money into the stock market, but this carries more risk. Jason Hollands, of financial advisers Bestinvest, says: “If you are prepared to take a longer-term view, then FP WHEB Sustainability Fund is an equity fund that invests globally in the shares of companies that fit into nine themes: cleaner energy, environmental services, resource efficiency, sustainable transport, water management, education, health, safety, and well-being. Over the last three years it has returned 40%, but equities are volatile and the past is no guide to the future.” Anna Bowes of Savings Champion says the NS&amp;I bond is not for those who are solely looking for a return on their investment, especially at a time when interest rates are expected to rise and inflation is high. “For the environment’s sake it would be great to think that this bond will still prove popular, but it’s a real blow for savers to be offered such a paltry rate,” she says. Sarah Coles of Hargreaves Lansdown says that as interest rates are expected to rise in the near future, “we can expect fixed rates to keep climbing and 0.65% to look even less attractive by comparison”. The Treasury says that one of the benefits of the bond is that savers are guaranteed to get their money back. However, since deposits of up to £85,000 in other banks are covered by the FSCS, the government protection is, in effect, only relevant to people investing between £85,000 and £100,000. But the low rate will not turn off all investors, especially those who are committed to using their money for sustainable objectives. “For those who just want to know their money is a part of the solution, who want to park it somewhere safe and are really not bothered about real rates of return, then it might still be attractive,” says Rebecca O’Connor of Interactive Investor. “It’s unfortunate though, that this group may be a much smaller group than those who were initially keen on the idea.” Responding to the criticism, a the Treasury said: “NS&amp;I has to offer a fair interest rate to savers whilst offering value for money for taxpayers and maintaining a competitive position within the broader financial services sector. The interest rate reflects this.” • This article was amended on 14 November 2021.

2022-08-17T05:00:07Z,Tideway boss paid nearly £1m despite Thames ‘super-sewer’ project delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/tideway-boss-paid-nearly-1m-despite-thames-super-sewer-project-delays,"The executive overseeing construction of London’s “super sewer” under the Thames has been awarded bonuses that doubled his pay to nearly £1m despite delays and cost over-runs on the flagship project. With executive pay in the water industry already under scrutiny, Tideway has revealed it paid its chief executive, Andy Mitchell, a total package of £928,000 for the year to 31 March 2022, up 7.5% from £863,000 a year earlier. Mitchell almost doubled his £489,000 base salary through a £215,000 bonus and £206,000 granted under a long-term incentive plan, plus benefits, company filings show, after receiving 95% of the bonus he could have raked in under the company’s bonus scheme. Tideway handed a 2.5% salary increase to staff and executives during the year. Amid an extended drought and the threat of widespread hosepipe bans, UK water companies have been criticised for doling out large pay packets to executives and dividends to shareholders while seeing widespread leaks in their networks and notching up poor pollution records. The 25km Thames sewage tunnel, which runs under the river, was originally due to be completed in 2024. However, during the pandemic in 2020, Tideway announced the completion date would be pushed back by nine months to the first half of 2025, with the forecast total cost rising by £233m to £4.13bn. In its annual report, Tideway said the capital cost of the sewer was now £4.3bn, an increase of 2% since its last update. The firm raised an extra £300m in March by issuing green bonds, which are designed to support environmental projects. Its construction is also being funded by Londoners, with Thames Water customers paying an extra £20 to £25 on their bills. Investors including the German financial services behemoth Allianz and the fund manager Dalmore Capital have also put money into the project. The director of the High Pay Centre, Luke Hildyard, condemned Mitchell’s pay packet. He said: “This is an administrative role providing a vital public service. It shouldn’t really require a vast bonus on top of a salary already far beyond the reality of 99.99% of the population. “We are seeing real public anger about the cost of living crisis and boards and pay committees shouldn’t be complacent about the inflammatory nature of top pay awards and the social and economic instability they could cause.” In total, Tideway’s board were paid £2.97m last year, up from £2.61m a year earlier. Its high profile members include non-executive chairman and former Tarmac chief Sir Neville Simms, who received £285,000, and Heathrow airport boss John Holland-Kaye and former Mitie chief Ruby McGregor-Smith, who were each paid £64,000 for their roles as non-executive directors. Mitchell is an infrastructure industry veteran who has worked on a string of projects including Hong Kong airport and the Thameslink rail line. He took the Tideway role after leaving his position in 2014 as programme director at Crossrail, the London rail line which opened in May, three and a half years late. In 2020, Mitchell was mistakenly overpaid £206,000 and the former chief operating officer Mark Sneesby £143,000 under the long-term incentive plan. They later paid the money back after the “administrative error”. The company said in the annual report that “there continues to be a very competitive labour market and it is important for the project’s success that we offer an attractive overall compensation and benefits package”. Michael Queen, chair of Tideway’s remuneration committee, said: “Our company annual bonus targets are set with the aim of promoting individual and collective motivation to realise the company’s objectives and purpose, focusing on health and safety, the time, cost and quality of build and importantly the impact on our communities and support to our people.” The Tideway project aims to prevent the spillage of millions of tonnes of raw sewage into the River Thames each year. London currently relies on a 150-year-old sewer system built for a population less than half of its current size. In Tideway’s annual report, Mitchell said: “Sewage pollution in the UK’s watercourses has never been higher up the public agenda. We have a critical responsibility – our project is urgently needed if London is to meet its environmental ambitions as a world city.” Tideway said the increase in the cost of the project “reflects new commercial agreements, revisions to the cost of works and a revised forecast of the impact of inflation”. The sewer stretches from Beckton sewage treatment works in Newham, east London, to a storm water tanks site in Acton, west London.",London; Executive pay and bonuses; Utilities; UK news; Infrastructure; Business,UK news
2022-08-17T19:00:24Z,Doctors for Extinction Rebellion’s protest puts MCC deals in spotlight | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/doctors-for-extinction-rebellions-protest-puts-mcc-deals-in-spotlight,"The rain came to Lord’s just after two in the afternoon. As the players walked briskly from the pitch, and the spectators popped their umbrellas or started to scurry for cover, a huge orange banner dropped down from the top tier of the Edrich Stand. “JP Morgan,” it read. “Stop bankrolling new oil and gas”. The font “JP Morgan” was written in matched the one used on the sponsored hoardings either side. The firm, which is the world’s leading investor in the exploration of new fossil fuels, has been MCC’s main corporate partner for the past decade and its branding is plastered all over the ground. It wasn’t the first time there’s been a protest at Lord’s, but it was the first in a long while when anyone has managed to smuggle a banner in past the stewards or, perhaps, been willing to pay for tickets to do it. Protesters here in recent years have tended to stay outside the gates, or in one case, in 2008, chained themselves to them. It was all very polite. The man and woman behind it, Chris Newman and Alice Clack, who are both members of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion, explained that they had timed it so it wouldn’t interrupt play, because they didn’t want to ruin everyone’s day. Which meant they were less of a nuisance than the portly MCC member sitting in front of the pavilion, who held up the game when his garish egg-and-bacon blazer distracted Ben Stokes from his batting. The stewards told him to take it off. They took the banner down too, then escorted Newman and Clack out of the ground. “They were,” Newman said, “very kind about it.” So, the banner wasn’t up long, but it didn’t need to be to embarrass MCC, who make great play of their green credentials. They released this statement later in the day: “MCC puts sustainability at the forefront of its running of the club, as conveyed within our environmental, social and governance strategy, and which has seen Lord’s operate on 100% renewable energy since 2016, amongst many other initiatives. JP Morgan is a principal partner and longstanding supporter of MCC and cricket at Lord’s and we are working with them, as we do with all of our partners, on aligning with the club’s own environmental values.” JP Morgan’s press office was on, too. Oddly, their statement didn’t mention the $81bn they invested in fossil fuels in 2020-21, or that they had increased their financing of coal production from $1.28bn to $3.8bn in that same period. “In 2021, we facilitated more than $100bn for green activities like renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation, doubled our green investment banking activity and were the largest underwriter of green bonds,” JP Morgan’s spokesman said. “These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1tn for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet. We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 …” etc and so on. So that’s probably enough of that, let’s get back to Newman and Clack. They said the people around them in the stands applauded their banner when they unfurled it, then cheered again when Clack pulled it back from the stewards after they had hauled it in. “We’re not radicals. We’re just trying to do what’s appropriate,” said Clack. “JP Morgan uses these sponsorships [and Lord’s isn’t the only one, there’s also the Commonwealth Games and the National Portrait Gallery] to sanitise their image when the reality is that they’re the world’s leading financier of the expansion of fossil fuels.” Clack compares it to the advertising money spent by the tobacco industry, and cricket, of course, has history there too, with the John Player League and the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and all the rest. “This is blood money, and we need to start calling it that.” “How do you push back against that?” Clack asked. “JP Morgan pays insane amounts of money to plaster their logo all over this ground. We don’t have hundreds of thousands of pounds to run a counter-advertising campaign. We’ve barely got the £150 to buy a ticket to come here to hang our banner up for five minutes.” They’d heard all those PR lines already. “We know they’re doing a lot of green investment,” Newman said. “Well, great, but it’s like giving someone poison and then being proud you’ve also provided a small amount of the antidote.” The same goes for MCC. They are powered entirely by wind‑generated electricity, they don’t send any waste to landfill, and their own sustainability manager, Dr Russell Seymour, contributed the foreword to the recent Hit For Six report on the impact of climate change on the game. They’re right to be proud of all that. Which shouldn’t stop them from being embarrassed about what they’ve got wrong.",England v South Africa 2022; Cricket; Sport; England cricket team; South Africa cricket team; Climate crisis,Sport
2022-03-17T10:08:42Z,Central banks have humanity’s future in their hands: they must not fail on inflation | Yanis Varoufakis,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/17/central-banks-humanity-future-inflation-green-transition,"Inflation is a disease that disproportionately afflicts the poor. Even before Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war on Ukraine, whose byproducts include soaring energy and food prices, inflation was already over 7.5% in the US and above 5% in Europe and the UK. Calls for its taming are, therefore, fully justified – and the interest rate rise in the US, with the same expected in the UK, comes as no surprise. That said, we know from history that the cure for inflation tends to devastate the poor even more. The new wrinkle we face today is that the supposed solutions threaten not only to deal another cruel blow to the disadvantaged but, ominously, to snuff out the desperately needed green transition. Two influential camps dominate public discourse on inflation and what to do about it. One camp demands that the inflationary flames be smothered immediately by the monetary policy version of shock and awe: raise interest rates sharply to choke expenditure. They warn that delaying a little monetary violence now will only necessitate “Volcker shock” levels of brutality later – a reference to Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve chair who quelled the hyperinflation of the 1970s with sky-high interest rates that scarred the American working class to this day. The second camp protests that this is unnecessary, counter-proposing a steady as she goes stance for as long as wage inflation is kept on a leash. The two camps agree that rising wages are the real threat, their disagreement focusing only on whether it is prudent to act before or after they start picking up. They agree also that, to fight inflation, the supply of money and credit must be dealt with in a two-step sequence: central banks must first stop creating new money and only then raise interest rates. The two camps are dangerously wrong on both counts. First, wage inflation should be welcomed, not treated like public enemy number one. Second, it is precisely when interest rates are rising that central banks should continue to create money. Except this time, they should press it into the service of green investments and social welfare. Since 2008, inequality has been allowed to rise. A dozen years of central bank support for the rich, coupled with punitive austerity for the many, has led to chronic underinvestment and low wages. Central banks plucked the money tree ferociously to boost share and house prices, while wages languished. Asset-price inflation and mind-numbing inequality thus became the order of the day. Eventually almost everyone agreed, including many of the mega-rich, that wages had to rise not just in the interests of workers but also because low wages underpinned underinvestment and created societies bristling with low productivity, low skills, low prospects and poisonous politics. Remarkably, all it took for this consensus to vanish was a modest, by historical standards, wage inflation brought on by a post-lockdown labour shortfall. After a decade of turning a blind eye to rampaging asset-price inflation (even celebrating it, in the case of crazy house prices and boisterous stock markets), a whiff of wage inflation threw the authorities into an almost uncontrollable panic. Suddenly, the prospect of rising wages turned from an objective to a menace – prompting Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, to ask workers to place their wage demands under “quite clear restraint”. But this isn’t a rerun of the 1970s, when the working class was the only casualty of interest rate rises. What’s critically different is that, today, a Volcker shock may well smother the green transition along with a large part of labour’s share of national income. The counter-argument is, of course, that neither workers nor society’s capacity to invest in the green transition will benefit from wage rises that are overtaken by rising prices. True. What is also true, however, is that a monetary policy that prioritises the prevention of wage inflation will, even if successful at nipping inflation in the bud, only lead to another wasted decade marked by underinvestment in people and nature. While the working classes may rise up 10 years from now to claim the share of aggregate income that they deserve, it is arguable that another 10 years of underinvestment in the green transition will push us all to the brink of, if not extinction, irreparable damage to humanity’s prospects. So how do we deal with inflation without jeopardising investment in the green transition? What is the alternative to a class war in the form of a blunt interest-rate policy that squeezes the supply of money across the board either violently (as the advocates of shock and awe propose) or more gently (the steady as she goes suggestion)? A decent alternative policy must have three goals: first, to repress asset prices (such as house and share prices) so as to stop scarce financial resources being wasted in building up paper values. Second, to push down the prices of basic goods while allowing for higher returns to investment in green energy and transport. Third, to deliver massive investment in energy conservation and green energy, transport, agriculture – as well as social housing and care. The following threefold policy agenda can achieve these three goals. First, raise interest rates substantially. Ultra-low interest rates have failed to boost investment – and, in any case, were never available to those who either needed to borrow money or wanted to borrow to do things society needed. All ultra-low rates did was to boost house prices, share prices, inequality and all those things that divide society. But, second, this must be done in concert with a massive central bank-supported green public investment drive. Naturally, raising interest rates will not boost investment, even if it is true that next to zero interest rates also did little to help investment. To escape the low-investment quagmire, the central bank should announce a new type of quantitative easing: it should stop financing the financiers and, instead, promise to stand behind (by buying, if needs be) public green bonds that raise funds to the tune of 5% of national income annually – a sum that will be invested directly into the green transition, giving society a fighting chance to do what it must to stabilise the climate. Third, extend the same public finance model (that is, getting the central bank to stand behind public bonds) to invest in social housing and care. In short, what I am proposing is a reversal of the toxic policies implemented since 2008. Instead of central banks providing free money and low interest rates to the rich, while the rest languish in the prison of austerity, the central bank ought to make money more expensive for the rich (through significant interest rate rises) while providing cheap money for investing into the things the majority and the lived environment both need and deserve.

2021-06-30T23:01:52Z,Google’s delay in fighting online scammers is cause for shame,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/jul/01/googles-delay-in-fighting-online-scammers-is-cause-for-shame,"“We are committed to leading the necessary changes to help fight online scammers,” trumpeted Google’s UK managing director, Ronan Harris, this week, as if the tech giant were somehow a pioneer of a crackdown on online financial fraud and adverts offering “bonds” with implausibly high rates of interest. The reality is that Google’s harder approach has taken an age to appear. It was 18 months ago that the frustration of Andrew Bailey, then the chief executive of the FCA, boiled over. He called for “more assistance from the big internet service companies, particularly Google” on taking down obviously dodgy adverts quickly. If a bank or a regulated financial institution had received such a public shaming, immediate action would be expected. Even last autumn, however, Charles Randell, the chairman of the FCA, was still trying to embarrass Google. It was “frankly absurd”, he said, that the chief financial regulator was “paying hundreds of thousands of pounds to Google to warn consumers against investment advertisements from which Google is already receiving millions in revenue”. That absurdity, let’s hope, will now stop, or be substantially reduced. What, though, if Google’s new policy to “help” the fight comes up short? Note the key line in the FCA’s response to the company’s “positive” move: investment fraud caused by online advertising should be covered by the online safety bill due to go before parliament this year. In other words, don’t rely on voluntary measures; put a legal responsibility on Google and social media platforms to protect users. As things stands, investment fraud has escaped the scope of proposed reforms because the bill is concerned with user-generated content, such as “catfishing” identity scams, rather than paid adverts. You’ll struggle to find a serious financial organisation that thinks such a limited scope is a good idea. About 17 organisations – from Which? to the City of London police – have been arguing for months that tech firms should have a legal responsibility to prevent fraudulent adverts appearing. The Treasury select committee last week described “a missed opportunity”. The concern is widely felt because dramatic talk about “an epidemic” on online fraud is not far off the mark. Action Fraud calculates that UK savers were cheated out of £1.7bn last year, with the activity increasingly happening online. Google’s belated expression of good intentions is not enough. The bill needs amending. Andy Haldane’s inflation warnings need heeding Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s outgoing chief economist, was right on two scores in his farewell speech on Wednesday. First, in his knockabout description of the typical City audience at a Mansion House banquet – “about as diverse a set of white, male, middle-aged, slightly pissed financiers as it is possible to assemble”. Second, in trying to generate a debate about the risks of rising inflation, where the lack of diversity – in opinion – is also glaring. Haldane has been the sole outlier on the Bank’s monetary policy committee in recent months in voting for (slightly) tighter policy. The refrain from elsewhere has been uniform: rising prices were inevitable as the economy bounces back from lockdown, but they will be “transitory” and will disappear next year. That view may prove correct, but it smacks too much of complacency. Haldane’s position is that inflation will be “nearer 4% than 3%” by the end of year, which is a notch above the Bank’s current forecast. Among other factors, he points to “leakages from the savings lake”, as he put it, meaning involuntary savings accumulated during lockdown – £200bn for UK households and £100bn for UK companies. Yes, that force may be being underestimated. At very least, it’s something to debate. There’s little fretting elsewhere within the Bank about the risk of temporary price factors morphing into permanent ones. Or not that outsiders can tell from the official communications. Instead, we are in the strange position where financial markets, as judged by interest rate expectations, look more worried than the policymakers. It ought to be the other way around. Crucial detail is missing in NS&amp;I’s green bonds “Make a difference with green savings bonds,” implores NS&amp;I, doing its bit for the chancellor’s “green financing framework”. So are these government-backed green bonds for the punters a flyer? It depends entirely on the interest rate, which NS&amp;I hasn’t yet revealed, even though the chancellor first flagged this initiative in his budget in March. Why does the government insist on announcing everything five times before it gets to the point?",Business; Google; Financial Conduct Authority; Regulators; Technology; Bank of England; Interest rates; Bonds; Economics,Business
2022-01-30T19:25:03Z,Sink or swim: Macquarie plunges back into crisis-hit UK water industry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/misunderstood-macquarie-takes-another-go-in-uk-water-industry-southern,"The UK’s water industry has for years promised to clean up its reputation for pollution incidents, leaks and murky financial dealings. Yet once again, it is hoping for a clean start. In total, water companies spilled raw sewage into coastal bathing waters more than 5,500 times last year, prompting a another investigation by the Environment Agency and the industry regulator, Ofwat, in November. Weeks later, Ofwat raised a red flag over the financial health of three of Britain’s biggest water companies – Southern, Yorkshire and SES. The regulator expressed concern about “weak levels of financial resilience” and levels of customer service that lagged behind the rest of the industry. For Southern, the resilience report gave a snapshot of the company’s financial health before an equity injection from a familiar character in the water sector’s chequered history, the Australian investment bank Macquarie. Macquarie gained notoriety for its role as the owner of Thames Water between 2006 and 2016, when it attracted fierce political scrutiny for extracting billions in shareholder dividends while Thames’s debt soared. By 2018 the Labour party had called for the sector to be returned to public ownership. But five years after selling out of Thames, the Australian infrastructure investor was given the regulator’s blessing to return to run one of the most troubled water companies in the industry – a move that raised eyebrows in the industry. The £1bn in fresh equity for Southern over the summer followed Ofwat’s decision to enforce a record £90m fine against Southern for deliberately pouring sewage into the sea, and came with a promise to invest a further £2bn over the next four years. Macquarie has not stopped there. Within months of its return to the UK’s water sector, it agreed to invest £130m in green bonds issued by a subsidiary of Affinity Water, and £120m in Anglian Water’s debt. The passive investments are part of the bank’s sprawling set of investments in UK infrastructure. Macquarie owns the Green Investment Bank, which was set up with UK taxpayer funds and controversially privatised four years ago. Under its ownership, GIB’s profits more than quadrupled to £144m for the year ending March 2021, compared with the year before. It has paid a total of £174m in dividends to Macquarie, which also owns gas networks, airports and telecoms service companies across the UK. Aileen Armstrong, a senior director at Ofwat, said the regulator had “really welcomed the money coming into the regulated business” while being “clear about the expectations on what the company needed to do for customers. “We have wanted to see a turnaround, and a component of that is an equity injection into the company, which is what this transaction did. We have been very clear – and would be with any prospective new owner – about what we expected of the regulated company and the need for a turnaround in the operations there,” she said. One senior industry source said Ofwat’s decision to give Macquarie its blessing to return to the water industry showed “just how desperate they were” after Southern’s record pollution fine and its troubling financial position. “Southern was not an attractive prospect for investors, and the company’s management was, perhaps unsurprisingly, on its knees. Investors would not have been falling over themselves to take a share of Southern,” the source said. However, Martin Bradley, the head of Macquarie’s “real assets” team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said his bank was happy to return to the UK’s water industry despite “misunderstandings” over its ownership of Thames and the concerns over Southern’s financial health. “We didn’t pay a premium for Southern Water,” he said. “We invest in long-term infrastructure, and there’s nothing more long-term than the provision of utilities like water. This is what we do, and we think we’re quite good operators.” Macquarie’s spell at Thames was far from blemish-free. In 2017, the water company was fined £20m after admitting it dumped 1.4bn litres of raw sewage into the River Thames at six sites in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire between 2013 and 2014. The water company’s finances were also a cause for alarm, with Macquarie criticised for selling Thames with almost £11bn of debt after a decade in which the bank paid itself £1.6bn in dividends, ran up a £260m pension deficit and paid next to no UK corporation tax. A former senior Thames employee said of Macquarie: “Were they an effective, focused investor? Absolutely. But can you expect them to operate a utility in the public interest? Well, only if you are certain that the regulatory framework rewards the good behaviours and penalises the bad. Ofwat hasn’t always done that.” The characterisation of the Australian bank as a “vampire kangaroo”, or an aggressive asset stripper, has sometimes been unfair, he added. “They did extract more out of the company than would be ideal, but it was in full sight of the regulator. And where it made sense under the regulatory framework for Macquarie to invest in Thames, they were happy to invest too,” he said. Macquarie’s interests in the water sector are part of a more than £50bn of investment in UK infrastructure that it has either arranged or invested directly since 2005. These include Cadent, which is the UK’s largest gas distribution network operator, as well as the operator of Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Southampton airports and the broadcast service provider Arqiva. “We didn’t need to convince the regulator,” Bradley said of Macquarie’s return to the UK water industry. “Ofwat has said they’d be keeping a close eye on the situation at Southern Water. They expect us to deliver, and we expect to deliver.” The former Thames employee said that at the end of the day, Macquarie was driven entirely by the bottom line and the letter of Ofwat’s regulation. “They were always in it for the money, and they were able to use the regulatory regime to take an aggressive approach at times,” he said. However, there have been concerns for some time that there has been “underspending in areas that Ofwat didn’t measure” that has led to “an accumulation of problems over decades”. Armstrong said there had already been “quite a lot of change in the regulatory regime since Macquarie was last in the sector”. “Over the last few years we’ve been very clear about making sure there is financial resilience in the sector and that the companies are focused on delivering good operation performance,” she said. Hopefully this time, Ofwat has been clear enough. The regulator can wash its hands of the past only so many times.",Utilities; Regulators; Pollution; Business; Environment; UK news,Business
2021-08-29T17:37:42Z,Green politics is beset by a fundamental paradox | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/29/green-politics-is-beset-by-a-fundamental-paradox,"Andy Beckett is right to find some optimism in the record of the exceptional Green MP Caroline Lucas and the party’s growing number of councillors (The Greens are on the brink of power – is it more than a political blip?, 27 August). However, the crucial route to power for green politics lies in cooperation with non-Tory parties to gain enough public support for effective environmental policies. The government promises much, but there is a dearth of concrete policies. The chancellor hasn’t even announced his green bonds initiative that is supposed to appear this summer. Our research has shown that were savers to be adequately incentivised, this could provide billions to finance the “green new deal”, if it was announced as a green recovery Isa, enabling usually older savers to fund green jobs. Beckett’s other key point, that the climate crisis tends to leave voters feeling overwhelmed, paralysed or in denial, can be overcome if its solutions are seen as generating work everywhere. Equally, it must be seen as compensating poorer sections of society for the transitions to dearer, more sustainable food and energy supplies while retraining those whose jobs are threatened. The French gilet jaunes were right to say that their main worry was about the end of the month, not the end of the world. The answer lies in making a credible case for how to fund such a transition. This will require green quantitative easing (QE), whereby government-created money is invested directly in public- and private-sector projects, as well as using savings and progressive taxation. In short we need a QuEST (QE, savings and taxation) to immediately finance the crucial green transformation. Colin Hines Convener, Green New Deal UK • The fundamental paradox in green politics is set out towards the end of Andy Beckett’s column, when he states that if all the main parties adopt green policies it would “make it harder for the Greens to differentiate themselves”. The crucial point is that “greenism” is not a policy; it is an analysis that sets out with brutal clarity the need to accept the ecological imperative and to change our way of living. Thus a green campaign is essential, but a Green party actually undermines the acceptance of that imperative: the more successful it is, the more it draws supporters from the other parties and thus reduces the momentum and increases the pressures against it. It is necessary for the green imperative to be embedded in all the parties if we are to avoid catastrophe. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds • I am green, with a small G, because I am in possession of the dire facts, I have the science background to understand what those facts imply, and also I love nature for its own sake. However, I am also a moderate Tory (Macmillanite, I guess), though you may regard that as an oxymoron. And that is a problem: green politics is growing ever more inextricably entwined with leftwing politics, while simultaneously bedding with the increasingly authoritarian SNP. For this reason, I would never vote for the Green party in its present incarnation, though I live as greenly as I can: I avoid waste, I recycle, I walk, and my garden is nature-friendly. Ideally, green issues ought to transcend party politics, because we all die of heatstroke at the same temperature.

2021-06-30T23:01:51Z,Rishi Sunak to announce £15bn green finance plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/01/rishi-sunak-to-announce-15bn-green-finance-plan,"Rishi Sunak will announce plans to transform the City of London into a hub for green finance on Thursday as the government pushes to boost its competitiveness on the global stage after Brexit. The chancellor is expected to use his first speech to City financiers at the annual Mansion House address to announce details of a £15bn UK programme of government bond issuance, with the proceeds being spent on environmentally friendly projects. Aiming to turn Britain into a world leader for low-carbon financial services, Sunak will also launch a separate green savings bond for UK consumers, which he will say is to be used to help fund infrastructure schemes and create more green jobs across the UK. The green savings bonds will be available through National Savings &amp; Investments (NS&amp;I), offering consumers an opportunity to support green projects while receiving a fixed rate on their savings over a three-year term. The state-owned savings bank will launch the bonds later this year, with a minimum investment of £100 and a maximum limit of £100,000 per person. Although state spending is not dependent on the government raising funding from investors for specific projects, the chancellor will say the money raised from selling the two green bond issuances will help to finance low-carbon schemes such as zero-emissions buses, offshore wind, and investments to boost biodiversity and natural resources such as tree planting. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said there was a danger that the government’s green bonds scheme was “all talk and no action” and would stand as another legacy of ministers doing too little to address the climate emergency. “We need far more details and a watertight guarantee that these bonds are spent properly on the green jobs and initiatives that will curb climate breakdown,” she said. It comes as ministers prepare to host the COP2 climate conference in Glasgow later this year. As part of the green bond programme, the government will report on the social benefits of the projects, so that investors will have data on the number of jobs created and businesses or households who have benefited. The Treasury said Sunak would use the annual speech to tell finance chiefs and young industry leaders that he wanted to “to sharpen our competitive advantage in financial services”. The annual speech at which the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England address City financiers would usually take place in the evening at a formal dinner in the Square Mile. However, it has been downgraded this year due to social distancing restrictions, with a morning gathering of about 40 people planned instead. In the speech, Sunak will say: “As the baton passes to a new generation of leaders in finance, I feel optimistic about the future. Ambitious at home. Confident internationally. With a plan to make this country the world’s most advanced and exciting financial services hub for decades to come, creating prosperity at home and projecting our values abroad.”",Rishi Sunak; Politics; Bank of England; Business; Environment; UK news,Politics
2021-07-01T16:17:26Z,"Post-Brexit talks on City access to EU have stalled, Sunak reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/01/post-brexit-talks-on-city-access-to-eu-have-stalled-rishi-sunak-reveals-mansion-house,"Talks to secure City of London access to the EU have stalled, Rishi Sunak has confirmed in his first Mansion House speech to financiers, as he set out sweeping reforms designed to help Britain’s finance industry embrace global opportunities after Brexit. Addressing a hand-picked gathering of 40 young financial workers at a slimmed-down version of what was, in the days before the pandemic, a landmark annual gathering, the chancellor said a deal on a comprehensive post-Brexit financial services settlement with the EU had not happened. “Now, we are moving forward, continuing to cooperate on questions of global finance, but each as a sovereign jurisdiction with our own priorities,” he said. Sunak said Britain would diverge from Brussels’ rules on financial services as he set out a vision for the City. Suggesting the UK would pivot away from Europe, he said he would build instead on deals such as a partnership on financial services signed with Singapore earlier this week – with plans to grow business in the Indo-Pacific, the US and China. He also issued a message to Beijing, however, that deeper economic ties would not come at the expense of Britain abandoning its principles. The annual Mansion House dinner, normally a lavish black tie event at which the City’s leading lights mingle with the ministers of the day, was replaced this year with a low-key breakfast livestreamed on the Treasury’s Twitter account. The gathering was Sunak’s first as chancellor, after the cancellation of last year’s dinner. Speaking from inside the lord mayor’s residence at Mansion House, said Britain now had the “freedom to do things differently and better, and we intend to use it fully”. While his predecessors would have stood over banqueting tables laden with wine and port in the building’s neoclassical Egyptian Hall, the teetotal chancellor gave his address at a lectern with a glass of water. He said a more nuanced relationship was needed while attempting to benefit from the nation’s fast-growing financial services market with assets worth more than £40tn. Former chancellors have used the event to court Chinese business. Sunak sounded a more cautious note, but while dismissing Tory MPs who want to reduce ties with Beijing, he stressed Britain needed a “mature and balanced relationship”. “That means being eyes wide open about their increasing international influence and continuing to take a principled stand on issues we judge to contravene our values,” he said. “After all, principles only matter if they extend beyond our convenience.” He also set out a roadmap for financial sector reforms he said would boost Britain’s competitiveness after Brexit, but said the UK would continue to cooperate with Brussels and set high industry standards. Experts have warned that splitting away from EU rules could make it harder for City firms to do business with continental clients. It comes amid concerns in government over a gradual leaching away of finance business to EU financial centres such as Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin, after Brexit ended unfettered access to the single market for global banks based in London. Amsterdam overtook London as Europe’s largest share trading centre earlier this year, in a symbolic blow to Britain’s status as the most important regional hub for international finance. Government efforts had focused on securing “equivalence” for UK finance industry regulations as part of talks with Brussels, in which the two sides recognise each others’ rules as equivalent to their own. Centred on access for UK-based clearing houses – financial market infrastructure providers which sit in-between banks’ trading activities – Sunak said there was “no reason of substance” why they should not continue to serve EU clients. “The EU will never have cause to deny the UK access because of poor regulatory standards,” he said. It is understood, however, that talks between London and Brussels have stalled, with the chancellor believing the ball is in the European Commission’s court to advance the negotiations, and that the time is right to move forwards with sweeping post-Brexit reforms. As part of a pledge to maintain the City’s competitive position after leaving the EU, the Treasury launched consultations on reforms to the insurance industry, the regulation of wholesale capital markets and rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange. He also promised that tax rates on banking profits should not rise significantly from current levels. The chancellor also confirmed the government would sell green bonds to British consumers, aiming to make the UK the best place in the world for green finance. The Treasury plans to sell £15bn of government bonds, as well as offer savings bonds to consumers through NS&amp;I. • This article was amended on 2 July 2021, to change “leeching away” of finance business to leaching away.",Financial sector; Rishi Sunak; Economic policy; Business; Brexit; Regulators; UK news,Business
2021-08-13T10:15:10Z,Treasury blocking green policies key to UK net zero target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/13/treasury-blocking-green-policies-key-to-uk-net-zero-target,"The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK’s own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian. A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future. The UK’s credibility as host of the Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow rests on a clear net zero strategy – but publication has been postponed until near the eve of the summit, giving the UK little leverage to bring other countries to the negotiating table with the tougher carbon targets needed. Meanwhile, steep cuts to overseas aid have severely damaged the UK’s standing internationally, experts on the UN talks said. Jamie Peters, director of campaigning impact at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Treasury has been helping to fuel the climate emergency for far too long. The reality is that a rapid transition to a zero carbon future would be far less expensive than delaying the green measures we so urgently need, and that will create significant economic opportunities and new jobs.” Civil society groups, thinktanks and political insiders said the Treasury had refused to commit to the spending needed to shift the UK’s economy to a low-carbon footing. Complaints about the potential short-term costs of net zero policies have been one flashpoint during weeks of high tension between the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the Guardian understands. Kate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “There are strong reports that Rishi Sunak is intent on blocking climate spending at exactly the moment we need it most, and that his fingerprints sit heavily on moves to delay or block crucial investment to cut emissions from buildings or gas boilers.” The lengthy charge sheet against the Treasury includes: scrapping the green homes grant insulation scheme; freezing fuel duty while slashing electric car incentives; mulling cuts to air passenger duty on domestic flights, while making above-inflation train fare increases; failing to cut VAT on green home refurbishment; underfunding the new infrastructure bank; and delaying the phasing out of gas boilers. There have also been glaring omissions and delays. For instance, the transport strategy failed to back road pricing, which many believe will be essential to reducing emissions, which have remained stubbornly high as more people buy SUVs. Both the hydrogen strategy and heat and buildings strategy have been delayed until autumn, as has the overarching net zero strategy. Not all of these policies were under direct Treasury control, but the Treasury holds the purse strings and can effectively veto plans by other departments that require government investment or might raise costs for consumers. “The Treasury is at the root of this,” said Ed Matthew, campaign director at E3G, a green thinktank. “They are completely obsessed with short-term costs. It’s bonkers.” Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The Treasury has this huge institutional resistance to medium term economic benefits [that entail short term costs]. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider it.” Ministers and advisers are understood to be anxious that costs such as switching to heat pumps from gas boilers, estimated from £5,000 to £20,000 for some households, or the higher purchase price of electric cars, will hurt consumers’ pockets. But the independent committee on climate change has said the costs of net zero are affordable and falling, at about 1% of GDP by 2050, while green investment will generate new jobs, and policies can be devised that shift the costs from lower-income households and distribute them fairly. Moreover, as this week’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out, extreme weather is already here and will get worse. As recent flooding has demonstrated, the costs of inaction will far outweigh the costs of action. Even observers normally sympathetic to the government find the Treasury’s reluctance concerning. Josh Buckland, author of a report for the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The Treasury is absolutely crucial to net zero. It has taken some welcome steps thus far to drive green finance and investment, but the jury is still out on how far it is willing to go given wider pressures on the public finances.” Buckland, a former environmental adviser to Johnson, believes that Sunak, known to be a fiscal “hawk” and free-marketeer, is not ideologically opposed to climate action. He said that while the Treasury was traditionally reluctant to commit spending on any issue, Sunak “also has a lot of priorities as we recover from the pandemic”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, disagrees. “Their ideology is standing in the way – they think that it can be done by the market and it can’t. They are held back by thinking this can all be done by the private sector, when all the evidence is that this has to be done by the public and private sectors.” Recent calls by Conservative MPs including Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay to halt the race to net zero, which have received a warm welcome in sections of the press, have suggested that some MPs may also sniff electoral advantage in being seen to be anti-green. Blagojevic said: “The chancellor’s position may be politically expedient for him in trying to court the small number of Tory MPs intent on delaying climate action. Ultimately, though, history will not look kindly if he is the chancellor who tried to hobble our chances of reaching a low-carbon future, with all the growth, good jobs and stable better future it offers.” If the UK is to meet its net zero targets, ministers will have to face down backbench critics. E3G’s Matthew said: “It’s becoming understood [by the government] that you can’t just leave it to the market to deliver net zero, as that isn’t going to happen. For a Conservative government, that’s an inconvenient reality.” Last year, as the world was plunged into recession after the first lockdowns, Johnson appeared to grasp this when he promised to “build back greener”. Since then, however, few spending plans to reduce emissions have been brought forward, other than the green homes grant. Johnson also produced a 10-point plan setting out areas of focus, including nuclear power and offshore wind, but this was dismissed by many experts as a wishlist rather than a strategy. The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the 10-point plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and announcing plans to issue £15bn in green bonds over the next year.” As the UK prepares to host Cop26, the government will be trying to persuade other countries to set out clear policies on emissions cuts for the next decade, a task much harder if ministers have no policies of their own. Ultimately, says Venables, only one person can sort this out: “The prime minister needs to get stuck in, to make the difficult decisions, and soon.”",Green economy; Tax and spending; Cop26; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Politics; UK news,Environment
2021-03-02T00:01:33Z,UK urged to create green apprenticeships to help Covid recovery,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/02/uk-urged-to-create-green-apprenticeships-to-help-covid-recovery,"Green apprenticeships would prepare young people for jobs in renewable energy and the restoration of the UK’s natural landscape, and stop young people having their careers blighted for life by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, a report says. The report found that 250,000 green apprenticeships and a network of skills centres at further education colleges could be created with about £10.6bn of government money. Local authorities could create more than 44,000 apprenticeships in London with the right investment, along with about 20,000 in the West Midlands and 14,000 in Greater Manchester. Other regions also have high potential, as the report found scope for nearly 12,000 apprenticeships in West Yorkshire and 6,400 in the Sheffield area. About 500,000 young people aged 16 to 24 are out of work, and that number could double when the furlough scheme is withdrawn, according to the report, commissioned by Friends of the Earth from Transition Economics. The authors say the consequences of this past year’s setbacks for young people thrown into unemployment could last for years. If wages remain lower for young people through their working lives, from the “scarring” effect of early unemployment, the cumulative loss to their earnings could reach £39bn over the next 20 years. The government is under pressure to forge a green recovery from the Covid-19 shock, meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050 and build credibility on the world stage as president of the Cop26 UN climate conference later this year. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, has promised green measures including a £22bn investment in a national infrastructure bank, some of which would go to low-carbon projects, and the sale of green bonds to investors. He said: “The UK is a global leader on tackling climate change, with a clear target to reach net zero by 2050 and a 10-point plan to create green jobs as we transition to a greener future. We’re also launching new competitions that will unlock innovation in renewable energy and help us develop the cutting-edge technology we need to reach net zero.” However, green campaigners are concerned that the government’s green measures so far in response to the pandemic have been weak, and that concentrating on developing future technology such as hydrogen and nuclear fusion is distracting ministers from creating “shovel-ready” green jobs now through building electric-vehicle charging points, extending broadband networks, insulating homes and restoring natural landscapes, all of which require substantial investment. The green homes grant, the flagship £2bn programme to insulate homes and subsidies low-carbon heating, has been troubled and may be axed or have its funding withdrawn, while fuel duties will be frozen and investment in other low-carbon projects has been slow. Denis Fernando, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, urged ministers to consider green apprenticeships as a way of rebuilding the economy on green lines, while engaging young facing unemployment. “There’s a serious risk that this country is going to leave its young people to a future devastated by the climate crisis and unemployment,” he said. “But it’s not too late to turn this around. Investing in green apprenticeships in areas such as renewable energy and woodland creation could prevent a new wave of youth unemployment, while helping the UK towards a more climate-friendly future.” The report, An Emergency Plan on Green Jobs for Young People, also proposes bursaries of £1,500 for disadvantaged groups including BAME communities, women and disabled people. BAME people have had difficulty accessing green jobs, previous work has found. Laura Chow, the head of charities at the People’s Postcode Lottery, which supported the research, said: “The steps we take now to tackle climate change can also introduce opportunities for young people. Ending youth unemployment while fighting climate change offers a worthwhile solution to tackling two of the key issues we face.” The report found that some green apprenticeships were already on offer, but many young people were unaware of them or unable to access them. Bridie Salmon, who is 22 and from Lincolnshire, is studying for a level 3 BTec National in engineering with support from Orsted, the Danish offshore wind company. “Most apprenticeships offer half of the minimum wage,” she said. “The government should offer grants to support companies to offer minimum wage for apprenticeships. They also need to advocate for green jobs.”",Green jobs; Environment; Green building; Green economy; Green politics; Young people; Apprenticeships; Further education; Economic recovery; Business; Economics; Education; Politics; Friends of the Earth; UK news,Environment
2021-03-29T09:01:39Z,UK urged to take lead in helping poor countries fund climate action,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/29/uk-urged-take-lead-helping-poor-countries-fund-climate-action-cop26,"Boris Johnson’s government must take the lead in giving poor countries access to the finance they need to tackle the climate crisis, to make vital climate talks a success, the UN’s development chief has said. Ministers from around the world will meet virtually this week at a conference hosted by the UK to discuss the needs of developing nations struggling to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, as their economies have been left reeling by the Covid pandemic. The UK will need the support of more than 130 developing countries to make a success of the Cop26 UN climate summit, to be hosted in Glasgow this November. But relationships with poor nations have been hit by the government’s decision to slash overseas aid by billions of pounds. Achim Steiner, the administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), urged governments to show the same will to tackle climate breakdown as they were showing with the recovery from the pandemic. He said: “We need to arrive at a mindset like the Marshall plan, a bigger vision that we need to recover [from Covid-19] together, a new investment paradigm for a global economy, not an aid or charity paradigm.” Helping developing countries invest would reduce global emissions and benefit all countries, said Steiner. “What will be critical [at Cop26] is to find a way to finance the acceleration of climate action and higher ambition on emissions. This must be a collective effort, a joint undertaking,” he told the Guardian in an interview. Cop26 comes at a crucial time, as developing countries face key decisions on how to help their economies recover from the Covid crisis. Many are under pressure to continue with fossil fuels, but investments now in coal, oil or other high-carbon infrastructure will lock in high emissions for decades to come. “It is not in the interests of industrialised countries to wait another year [to assist investment],” Steiner said. “Global climate action is dependent on being able to solve the financial challenges and fiscal dilemma [over investing in fossil fuels or clean energy] that countries will be confronted with at Glasgow.” The UK’s decision to cut overseas aid from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5% a year will not directly affect its spending on climate finance, which has been ringfenced at £11.6bn from 2021 to 2025. However, many in the climate talks are concerned that it will provide cover for other rich nations to cut spending ahead of Cop26. Steiner said: “It sends a very mixed signal, and makes developing countries very concerned. It certainly does not enhance the confidence with which developing countries come to the table.” Poor countries are already concerned that a longstanding promise, made in 2009, that rich countries would ensure flows of $100bn (£72bn) a year to the developing world by 2020, to help countries cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, have not been met. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the Guardian in December that having a credible plan to meet this target would be essential to agreement at Cop26. Steiner also wants to see the UK spearhead innovative ways for poor countries to cope with their debt mountain, and raise capital for investment, for instance through “green” bonds. Help from rich countries is needed because the cost of capital to poor countries is so high: a 10-year Kenyan government bond trades at a yield of 12.6% compared with 1.6% for the US, with other countries showing similar or higher rates. “The harsh reality is that the cost of borrowing is so prohibitively higher for a developing country,” said Steiner. Debt repayment costs are also crippling developing economies. The World Bank recently estimated that 2.5% of this year’s debt service payments for poor countries, amounting to about $28bn, would be enough to vaccinate 2 billion people in the poor world. The UN is pushing for debt suspension or forgiveness for some of the worst-hit economies. Forthcoming research by the UNDP has found that 72 vulnerable countries are facing $600bn in debt service payments from 2021 to 2025. Of these, 23 countries with $387bn in debt payments owed are not covered by existing debt relief programmes. “The debt issue is constraining them,” said Steiner. “We are asking a lot from developing countries [at Cop26] that are under great debt distress, when their cost of borrowing is so much higher than industrialised countries.” Separately, green campaigners have written to the UK government ahead of this week’s ministerial meeting to call for the overseas aid budget to be restored, warning that failure to do so would undermine the UK’s credibility as hosts of Cop26. Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, the chief executive of Christian Aid, said: “In the year of Cop26, as host and significant emitter, all eyes are on the UK to lead the world in stepping up ambition on climate action. Vulnerable countries on the frontline of a climate emergency they did not cause need financial support. If the UK is to deliver a successful climate summit, then this week’s meeting must restore the much-needed aid, ensure that debts are cancelled, and commit the finance needed to help poorer nations adapt to a changing climate.”",Global climate talks; Cop26; Climate crisis; United Nations; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; World news,Environment
2021-03-03T06:00:09Z,From forecasts to furlough: what to expect in the budget,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/03/from-forecasts-to-furlough-what-to-expect-in-the-budget,"Rishi Sunak will use the budget on Wednesday to set out further government support before lockdown ends, alongside steps to reboot Britain’s economy from the worst recession in 300 years. The chancellor is expected to extend spending measures, tax breaks and government grants to help soften the blow from Covid-19 for businesses and their workers before restrictions are eased in-line with the government’s roadmap over the coming months. Sunak will also aim to lay the foundations for a post-Covid recovery, while addressing the impact of the pandemic on the public finances. Economy Forecasts Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 9.9% in 2020 – the worst performance since 1709 – and the economy remains under pressure. However, official forecasts due on Wednesday from the Office for Budget Responsibility could paint a rosier picture, as progress administering the vaccine paves the way for a swift recovery later this year. Public finances The budget is expected to pave the way for higher taxes or spending cuts in future as government borrowing hits a peacetime record this year. The budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – is expected to come in at about £370bn for the 2020-21 financial year. Business support Grants The chancellor will offer £5bn in government grants to businesses in retail, hospitality, accommodation, leisure and personal care. Grants of up to £18,000 each for 700,000 firms will be made available to prevent mass bankruptcies during the latest lockdown. Rates relief An extension in the temporary 100% tax cut for hospitality, retail and leisure is expected. A fundamental review is rumoured to have been delayed until the autumn, possibly to allow time for an online sales tax to be developed. Hospitality sector VAT Already extended once, the temporary reduction from 20% to 5% is likely to be extended to the summer, possibly for three months beyond the current 31 March cutoff. A delay could add £800m to the estimated £3.3bn cost so far. Support for workers Furlough extension Sunak will announce an extension until the end of September to support the economic recovery from Covid. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their wages until the scheme ends, but firms will be asked to contribute 10% in July and 20% in August and September as the scheme is gradually phased out. Self-employed Grants of up to £7,500 will be available from next month for three months, including an expansion in the scheme to allow those who started working for themselves in the 2019-20 financial year to make claims. Benefits Universal credit The temporary £20 per week uplift in universal credit benefits is earmarked for a six-month extension. Due to be cut at the end of March, charities warn that a limited extension is insufficient for tackling rising poverty. Housing Stamp duty A three-month extension until the end of June is expected at a cost of about £1bn to the exchequer. It is designed to avoid a cliff-edge in the property market in March before the economy has recovered. The government will also launch a scheme to bring back 95% mortgages, which are mainly used by first-time buyers and in short supply due to the pandemic. Taxation Corporation tax A gradual increase has been widely touted, reversing cuts instigated by George Osborne to the current rate of 19%. Among the lowest rates in the wealthy world, it is expected to be raised by anywhere up to 25%. With the US planning a rise from 21% to 28%, the UK would remain the lowest in the G7. Each percentage point rise would provide an extra £3bn in annual receipts. Income tax Although the Tories promised not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT before the 2019 election, Sunak is expected to freeze the threshold for the 20% basic rate of income tax at £12,500 and £50,000 level for the 40% rate for three years. It would bring 1.6 million people into a higher bracket by 2024, raising about £11bn. Pension tax A restriction on the amount wealthier people can put into their pensions to £1m over their lifetime could save £250m in tax relief. About 1.2 million people are projected to exceed the threshold by the time they start drawing on their private or occupational pension. Environment Green bonds Sunak will unveil what is expected to be the world’s first government green bond. Offered through NS&amp;I it will allow savers to invest in a product that will contribute towards green projects. Electric cars The budget is expected to roll out further measures to bring down carbon emissions, including a more extensive electric vehicle-charging network. However, fuel duty is set to be frozen. Arts and sport Arts and culture Funding worth £410m will be earmarked, including support for museums, theatres and galleries. Sport Sunak will announce £300m of funding for sport to help the sector through lockdown and into the summer, including for cricket. Funding of £2.8m for a UK and Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup will also come alongside £25m for grassroots football. Other Freeports More than 30 bids were received for 10 freeports – areas with lower tax or customs requirements – to be created around the UK. Sunak is expected to announce the winners in the budget. The chancellor could also reveal a location for the Treasury’s new economic campus – with Darlington thought to be among frontrunners. National infrastructure bank Plans for a launch this spring will include £12bn of capital funding and £10bn of state guarantees in the budget. The government will also invest £375m more into its Future Fund for fast-growing high-tech companies. Vaccine rollout A further £1.65bn will be made available to help meet the government’s target for every adult to be offered a Covid jab by the end of July.","Spring budget 2021; Tax and spending; Coronavirus; Budget; UK news; Business; Rishi Sunak; Public finance; Politics; Universal credit; UK job furlough scheme; Hospitality industry; Office for Budget Responsibility; Stamp duty; Pubs; Pensions; Pensions industry; Green economy; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Infrastructure",UK news
2020-09-20T17:30:51Z,The Guardian view on a just transition: make the red wall green | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-a-just-transition-make-the-red-wall-green,"As Britain confronts the unemployment crisis that will blight so many lives this winter, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has promised to be “creative” in introducing new measures to support jobs. Mr Sunak still seems stubbornly determined to end, next month, the furlough scheme that remains a lifeline for so many workers. But the misery that will ensue appears to have persuaded him that some kind of alternatives must be found. Inevitably they will be cheaper and less effective, but when the criticism comes, Mr Sunak will protest that it is not the government’s role to indefinitely prop up businesses that the pandemic has consigned to the past. What about propping up the future then? The government’s failure to develop any kind of plan to meet legally binding net zero targets has flown under the radar in recent months, as coronavirus-related chaos reigns in Whitehall. With the exception of a minimalist £2bn “green homes” grant, some new cycle routes and other minor measures, Boris Johnson’s promise to “build back better” has so far proved to be of purely alliterative value. Germany has allocated £36bn to greening its recovery programme, with a strong emphasis on investing in hydrogen. The European commission last week said 30% of a €750bn coronavirus recovery fund would be raised through green bonds, as part of a new growth strategy. Mr Johnson’s administration havers, prevaricates and fails to lead. A much-delayed energy white paper is now expected in November, with meaningful action kicked into next year. Meanwhile, an Institute for Government study this month found that the UK is now “well off track” in the race to meet the 2050 net zero target. The immobilism is not only negligent; it is baffling. As numerous reports and studies have pointed out, a pump-primed green industrial strategy is not only the obvious way to meet Britain’s legal obligation to move towards net zero; it can also hold the key to Mr Johnson’s regional “levelling up” agenda and help address the country’s Covid-induced unemployment crisis. A recent study, commissioned by the Trades Union Congress, outlined a “just transition” plan that could generate 1.24m new jobs across Britain. With sufficient government investment, and clear signals to private investors that the state will offer incentives and share the risk of innovation, the post-industrial map of Britain could be redrawn. The north-east of England has the potential to become an international hub of carbon capture technologies and wind-related new energy sources, such as green hydrogen. Belated large-scale investment into new battery technologies could transform the automotive industry in the Midlands and Wales, as fossil-fuel transport is phased out. England’s north‑west has nuclear expertise, and government inaction in this sector has already cost Wales dear. Nationally, the Institute for Government is calling for a mobilising body, along the lines of the Olympic Delivery Authority, to retrofit homes and workplaces across the country. For a government that styles itself as the new champion of Labour’s old “red wall” constituencies, the opportunity to embed such places in the nation’s economic future – after decades of neglect and decline – seems obvious. Yet traditional Tory preoccupations about state intervention in the economy and “picking winners” appear to be too hard to shake off. Mr Johnson has recently been more interested in denouncing climate activists as “crusty leftwing anarchists” than in coming up with the long-term green strategy the country needs. However changeable his disposition towards his government’s other legal obligations, he must not be allowed to turn the commitment to net zero into another front in his facile culture wars. Britain is lagging far behind its neighbours in developing the green industries of the future, at a time when the jobs stimulus they could provide has never been more needed. Without a new sense of urgency, and some genuinely creative thinking from the government, this risks becoming both a moral abdication and an economic folly.",Economic policy; Communities; Politics; Environment; Green politics; Unemployment; Fossil fuels; UK news; Rishi Sunak; Coronavirus; Conservatives; Labour; Housing; Energy,Opinion
2020-11-24T17:43:56Z,"AIA sponsorship is stain on Spurs shirts, say Kick Out Coal campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/aia-sponsorship-is-stain-on-spurs-shirts-say-kick-out-coal-campaigners,"Tottenham Hotspur may be top of the Premier League for a change, but the climate credentials of its shirt sponsor AIA are among the lowest of any club in the country, according to a new report by fossil fuel divestment activists. The logo of AIA has been emblazoned across the chests of Harry Kane, Hugo Lloris and teammates since 2013. But campaigners say it risks becoming a source of shame for the club, because the Hong Kong-based insurance company holds a stake of at least $3bn in coal projects. The AIA Kick Out Coal campaign, which comprises several divestment groups, says this “dirty secret” stains the shirt of Tottenham, which has otherwise gone further than almost any other club in its commitment to climate action. They say the coal investment also tarnishes the reputation of England football captain David Beckham, who is the global brand ambassador of AIA. The targeting of football sponsorship deals represents a new front in global divestment campaigns, which have so far concentrated on persuading financial institutions, governments, universities and churches to halt investments in fossil fuel companies. Several Premier League sponsors have dire climate records, including Chevrolet (Manchester United), Etihad (Manchester City) and Fly Emirates (Arsenal). The Champions League has partnered with Russian fossil fuel company Gazprom. The campaigners are focusing on AIA and Tottenham because that is where they see the greatest potential for change. Both organisations publicly aspire to the highest standards of efficiency and sustainability. This, says the campaigners, does not align with a link to coal – the dirtiest of fossil fuels and the main source of the carbon dioxide that is disrupting the climate. Last month, Tottenham became a founding member of Count Us In, a global initiative aiming to mobilise a billion people to act on climate change. One of its aims states: “Choose financial institutions and funds that invest responsibly.” AIA also has a reputation as a leader within the insurance field on environmental, social and governance issues. It has divested from tobacco and ammunition and is part of the Climate Action 100+ investor group that pressures fossil fuel producers and other companies to cut emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement. But the report says it is the only insurer in the group that has not fully divested from coal or adopted restrictions on new coal investments. Research for Insure Our Future – one of the groups behind the campaign – indicates AIA holds at least $3bn (£2.25bn) and most likely $6bn in bonds and equities of coal power utilities and loans to coal projects. This is said to include $125m of shares in Tenaga Nasional Berhad, which operates more than 13,000MW of coal power plants in Malaysia and other countries, and a $21m loan for the Toledo coal power plant in Cebu, in the Philippines. “We congratulate Spurs for being top of the league. They deserve a sponsor who is top of their own league and should call on AIA to drop all their toxic coal assets,” said Peter Bossard, the coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign. “Along with Champions League sponsor Gazprom, next World Cup host Qatar and several other Premier League shirt sponsors, AIA are an example for climate villains using football to launder their image. Tottenham Hotspur is a climate champion among football clubs and could set an example by calling on their sponsor to clean up their coal business.” Tottenham, which signed an extended shirt sponsorship deal with AIA last year reportedly worth £320m, said it took its environmental responsibilities “extremely seriously” and would work towards improving efficiency and sustainability at all levels. “AIA has shared with us the significant strides it has already made to address the carbon intensity of its investments. In addition, more action in this area is planned to further reinforce their efforts as a result of the threat posed by climate change,” a spokesman said. AIA said it has reduced the carbon intensity of its portfolio in recent years by halting direct equity holdings in coal mining and coal power generation, focusing on renewables and investing in more green bonds. The company says it is now considering its position regarding its remaining coal-related investments. “The results of that process are currently being reviewed and finalised, and they will guide our future investment strategy in this area,” a spokesman said by email. “AIA places the highest priority on the wellbeing of our communities and we continuously work to ensure long-term sustainable outcomes through our investments.” UN secretary-general Antόnio Guterres has called for an end to the construction of new coal projects. Divestment activists have seen considerable progress in recent years in their efforts to deprive the sector of finance. Along with the falling price of wind and solar, this has promoted hopes that coal emissions – the main source of human-caused climate disruption – may finally have peaked. Climate campaigners say Tottenham, like other sports clubs, has a role to play. “Football could be a game changer on climate change, activating millions of fans,” said Eric Levine, a coordinator of Count Us In. “The Club (Tottenham) is a leader on climate action in football and committed to working with all its partners to encourage best practices.”",Environment; Coal; Tottenham Hotspur; Climate crisis; UK news; Football; Energy; Fossil fuels; Sport,Environment
2020-01-20T23:01:39Z,Greenpeace hits out at Davos banks for $1.4tn climate hypocrisy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/20/greenpeace-hits-out-at-davos-banks-for-14tn-climate-hypocrisy,"The world’s leading financial institutions have been accused of hypocrisy over the climate emergency, after providing significant support for the fossil fuel industry over the last five years. A report by Greenpeace, the environmental group, highlights that 24 banks which regularly attend the World Economic Forum in Davos have provided $1.4tn (£1.1tn) of financial support for the hydrocarbon sector since the Paris agreement set new emissions reduction goals in 2015. The financial cooperation with fossil fuel firms includes loans, debt underwriting, equity issuances and direct investment. The report, called It’s the Finance Sector, Stupid, also shows how some major insurers and pension funds that flock to Davos each year are key supporters of polluting industries such as coal. The data was compiled from BankTrack, an organisation that monitors the financial sector. It shows that JP Morgan, the Wall Street investment bank, has provided $195bn of financial support to fossil fuel companies since 2015. JP Morgan declined to comment on the report. Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International’s executive director, said the WEF’s mission statement is to “improve the state of the world” but the banks cited in the campaign group’s report are falling short of this goal. “The banks, insurers and pension funds here at Davos are culpable for the climate emergency. Despite environmental and economic warnings, they’re fuelling another global financial crisis by propping up the fossil fuel industry,” said Morgan. “These money men at Davos are nothing short of hypocrites as they say they want to save the planet but are actually killing it for short-term profit.” Ten top banks provided around $1tn of the financial aid for fossil fuel firms, the report said. They are JP Morgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America, RBC Royal Bank, Barclays, MUFG, TD Bank, Scotiabank, Mizuho and Morgan Stanley. A Barclays spokesperson said: “We recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today, and are determined to do all we can to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met. In 2018 we facilitated £27.3bn in social and environmental financing across our business including green bonds and renewable financing.” Greenpeace is also concerned that three major pension funds — the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and PensionDanmark — hold investments worth at least $26bn in major fossil fuel companies. Some financial companies have made encouraging noises about addressing the climate emergency, after seeing rising public concern and an escalation in extreme weather events. They cite initiatives such as green bonds, and a UN-backed “principles of responsible banking” initiative. Last week, asset manager BlackRock announced it would put sustainability at the heart of its active investment model. The announcement represented a major shift for the world’s biggest fund manager, although BlackRock’s huge “passive” investment arm will continue to invest in fossil fuel firms through tracked funds, for example. Vincent Manier of ENGIE Impact, which advises companies on sustainability goals, said he believed investors will be forced to take the issue more seriously. “What we can take away from BlackRock’s move is that investors that don’t integrate climate risk assessments into their overall portfolio management processes are not capturing the full risk profile of their investments. The onus is on companies to demonstrate that they have a holistic understanding of all risks facing their business, disclose them and are developing plans to mitigate those risks,” Manier said. The climate emergency is a major issue at Davos this year. Klaus Schwabb, WEF’s founder, has written to attendees asking them to make their companies carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest. Climate activists are demanding faster progress. Greta Thunberg, who speaks at Davos on Tuesday, is pushing global leaders to end the “madness” of huge ongoing investments in fossil fuel exploration and enormous subsidies for coal, oil and gas use.",Banking; Davos 2020; Davos; Greenpeace; Climate crisis; World news; Environment; Business; Environmental activism,Business
2020-09-20T12:58:47Z,More long-term thinking is needed to protect the UK economy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/20/more-long-term-thinking-is-needed-to-protect-the-uk-economy-rishi-sunal-covid-19,"What a difference a matter of weeks makes – in that little time England has gone from eat out to help out to the brink of national lockdown. After a summer of positive news for the economy as lockdown measures were relaxed and optimism started to return, the autumn is looking set for a painful reprise of the events of earlier this year. Everything had appeared to be going well for Britain’s economic recovery from Covid-19. The worst forecasts for the economy have not been realised, helped by unprecedented levels of government support. Retail sales have risen above pre-pandemic levels, and Britain is set to jump from rockbottom in the G7 growth league table to the top in the third quarter. This, however, is symptomatic of the dilemma the government currently faces. Good news for the economy is most likely bad news for containing the virus. People leaving their homes for work, school, socialising and spending are sadly the perfect vectors for spreading Covid-19. Johnson and his ministers are in a situation few would envy, affording the prime minister more leeway than might be usual among voters. But he appears increasingly to be playing a bad hand with unnatural ineptitude – wheeling from one U-turn to the next with increasing speed and frequency. The past two months of his government’s stewardship of the economy are the latest example: first it pumped more than £500m of public money into encouraging socialising in pubs and restaurants through eat out to help out, now there’s the threat of a stiff fine for mingling. These rapid gear changes are becoming riskier the longer the coronavirus pandemic continues. It is increasingly clear that Britain is in for the long haul, and even if a vaccine were to become widely available tomorrow, changes in how we live and work have been set in train that won’t be reversed. Rather than rapid short-term gear changes, more long-term thinking is required to support Britain’s economy. Here, the government has an opportunity, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, draws up his comprehensive spending review and prepares for the autumn budget – two landmark events for setting out a longer-term vision. First on his list for better long-term planning must be halting a move to scale back support for businesses and workers. Sunak has been clear that the Treasury’s furlough wage subsidy scheme will end at the end of October, despite repeated warnings from businesses, the Labour party and unions about a tsunami of job losses. With the coming second wave putting renewed pressure on firms – placing more jobs at risk as unemployment climbs – a wholesale change in tack or a substantial replacement for the furlough scheme is desperately needed. His second priority must be to put in place measures to embed the country’s transition to the economy of the future. Here there are two issues in particular that should be at the heart of the government’s agenda: ensuring a green recovery, and reducing the entrenched inequalities that Covid has so badly exposed. The government has talked up both of these elements as key to its plans. But, in the same breath, the chancellor has warned his spending round and budget will require “tough choices” – code for higher taxes or cuts in spending. He would be best advised to avoid such a shift. The worst mistake made in response to the 2008 financial crisis was for Britain and other advanced economies around the world to follow the neoliberal playbook. The policy of “expansionary austerity” delivered the worst decade for growth in two centuries, as an ideologically driven programme of cuts in the name of reducing the deficit allowed longstanding inequalities to fester and ripped apart the fabric of the welfare state that had helped to paper over the cracks. Importantly, global institutions that backed such policies have changed their tune in recent years, including the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – both now are far more supportive of fiscal intervention and long-term thinking than they were in 2008. Last week, in a move underscoring the shift in direction and the change in thinking the government must adopt, the OECD secretary general, Angel Gurría, called for countries to go further in greening the stimulus packages they have announced to tackle the impact of Covid-19. Doing so could drive sustainable, inclusive, resilient economic growth and improve wellbeing, he said. “Green recovery measures are a win-win option as they can improve environmental outcomes while boosting economic activity and enhancing wellbeing for all,” he said. The problem for Johnson’s government is that Tory ideology for the past four decades has been fundamentally opposed to these needs. It tends to prefer free-market solutions, which are ill-suited to the Covid crisis and the global economy that will emerge as the pandemic recedes. In a new report, Dr James Nixon of the consultancy Oxford Economics warns that if governments around the world return to the neoconservative growth agenda of the last four decades – deregulation, privatisation and austerity – that the post-pandemic recovery will come at the expense of existing environmental protections, leaving the world unable to cope with global heating. Rather than a decade of fiscal consolidation to “pay for the pandemic”, which would sap investment required to fund a green transformation, he argues for quantitative easing from central banks to be directed to purchasing green bonds, implicitly helping to finance the energy transition. The next change in direction for Johnson’s government could therefore be his toughest yet: U-turning on four decades of his party’s priorities to meet the priorities of post-pandemic Britain. Rather than rolling back the state, the time now is for longer-term support.",Economics; Economic growth (GDP); Economic policy; Economic recovery; Business; Politics; Coronavirus; Food & drink industry; Recession; UK job furlough scheme; Job losses; Tax and spending; Green economy; Unemployment,Business
2020-07-22T04:09:30Z,'World-first' legal case: student accuses Australia of misleading investors on climate risk,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jul/22/world-first-legal-case-student-accuses-australia-of-misleading-investors-on-climate-risk,"A Melbourne university student has launched what has been described as a world-first legal case against the Australian government, accusing it of misleading investors in sovereign bonds by failing to disclose the financial risk caused by the climate crisis. In a claim filed in the federal court on Tuesday, Katta O’Donnell, a fifth-year law student at La Trobe University, said the government was breaching a legal duty and deceiving investors by not informing them upfront of the climate risk they face. Climate risk refers to assessments of the expected impact of the climate crisis on investments, including the likelihood that fossil fuel investments will lose value and potentially become stranded as the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the country’s corporate and financial regulators have warned that climate change exposes the economy and financial system to risks that will get worse if action is not taken. O’Donnell’s case, backed by David Barnden of Equity Generation Lawyers, argues that the government and its officials have failed in their duty of care by not taking climate change into account when doing their job. The student said the case had been developed after she introduced herself to Barnden when he gave a lecture at La Trobe on climate risk last year. She said it would put the government “on trial for misconduct” for failing to deal responsibly with the climate crisis. “I’m 23, I look to the future and I can definitely see that climate change is here and is going to get worse,” O’Donnell said. “It’s time the government told the public about the impact climate change will have on our future and the economy.” She said young Australians owned bonds through their superannuation funds but were in the dark about government assessments of the climate risk their investment faced. Sovereign bonds are issued by governments to fund spending. Australia’s are worth more than $700bn, mostly held by central banks and pension funds. “While the current government will be long out of power by the time we can access this money, our financial security … will bear the brunt of its climate legacy,” O’Donnell said. Barnden said he believed it was the first case that dealt with climate change as a material risk to the global sovereign bond market. He said the risk was increasingly being recognised by institutional investors, pointing to the Swedish central bank last year selling bonds from Western Australia, Queensland and the oil-rich Canadian province of Alberta due to their failure to do more to address climate change. “Australia is on the frontline of sovereign climate risk,” Barnden said. “We confront the harrowing physical impacts of drought and bushfires and we also face the financial risks of an economy over-exposed to fossil fuels being left behind as the world shifts to clean energy.” He said the legal claim had been filed after he wrote to the government on O’Donnell’s behalf asking for it to change its disclosure policy. O’Donnell is also represented by the barrister and former federal court judge Ron Merkel QC. A spokesperson for Josh Frydenberg said the Treasury was aware of the claim and Commonwealth legal representatives were considering it, but they declined to comment further on the basis court proceedings were underway. Rob Henderson, a former National Australia Bank markets chief economist, now an economics and financial consultant, said it was a “really interesting claim”. He said there had been a significant shift in thinking over the past decade that had accelerated after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority warned in 2017 that it was not safe for companies to ignore climate risks. He said Australia’s major banks now all published annual climate reports and issued green bonds. “In some ways I’m surprised this claim hasn’t been brought earlier, and the commonwealth hasn’t taken the initiative in laying out how it would do this properly,” Henderson said. “It’s an anomaly in our current financial system.” Apra is developing a climate risk vulnerability assessment for investors based on scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System, a collection of 66 central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. The assessment was expected to be finished by September but has been delayed by the Covid-19 shutdown. The scenarios included an estimate that global GDP could fall 25% below the assumed level this century if the world did not act to reduce emissions. The Morrison government a target of a 26% to 28% cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 – less than scientists say is necessary to play its part under the Paris climate agreement. It is resisting a global push to set a goal of net zero emissions by mid-century.",Law (Australia); Australian economy; Melbourne; Climate crisis; Australia news; Bonds; Business; Sovereign wealth funds; Environment; Law; Reserve Bank of Australia,Law
2021-03-02T06:29:45Z,"Tuesday briefing: Green jobs now, not fusion later, Sunak urged",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/02/tuesday-briefing-green-jobs-now-not-fusion-later-sunak-urged,"Top story: Rebound economies pump out CO2 again Good morning – Warren Murray making sure you are not overtaken by events. Green apprenticeships would prepare young people for jobs in renewable energy and restore the UK’s natural landscape while preventing their careers being blighted for life by the pandemic, a report says. It finds that 250,000 green apprenticeships and skills centres at further education colleges could be created with about £10.6bn of government money. About 500,000 young people aged 16 to 24 are out of work and that number could double when furlough ends, according to the report, commissioned by Friends of the Earth from Transition Economics. With the budget coming on Wednesday, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has promised green measures including a £22bn investment in a national infrastructure bank, some of which would go to low-carbon projects, and the sale of green bonds to investors. However, green campaigners are concerned the government is concentrating too much on future technology such as hydrogen and nuclear fusion instead of “shovel-ready” green jobs: such as building the electric-vehicle charging network, extending broadband, insulating homes and restoring natural landscapes. Separately, the International Energy Agency has warned that the world has only a few months to prevent the energy industry’s carbon emissions from surpassing pre-pandemic levels this year as economies rebound from Covid-19 restrictions. Its figures show fossil fuel emissions climbed steadily over the second half of 2020 and by December were 2% higher than in the same month the year before. It happened only months after Covid-19 triggered the deepest drop in carbon dioxide output since the end of the second world war. Countries whose economic stimulus packages aim for a net environmental benefit – such as France, Spain, the UK and Germany – have been most successful in keeping a lid on the carbon emissions rebound. Those with the weakest green recovery measures, such as China, India, the US and Brazil, have recorded a steep resumption of emissions. * * * ‘The girls are free’ – All 279 Nigerian students kidnapped from their boarding school in the northern state of Zamfara have been released and are on government premises, the governor of the state has said. “I am happy to announce that the girls are free,” Dr Bello Matawalle told AFP. “They have just arrived in the government house and are in good health.” An AFP reporter saw hundreds of girls wearing hijabs, gathered at the government premises. Authorities initially said 317 girls were abducted in the raid by hundreds of gunmen on the Government Girls Secondary School in remote Jangebe village on Friday. But Matawalle said the “total number of female students abducted” was 279. * * * Big unknown of child ‘long Covid’ – With schools in England poised to reopen on Monday, scientists are warning that emerging data on “long Covid” in children so far is uncertain but should not be ignored, given there is no coronavirus vaccine yet available at their age. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has suggested 13% of under-11s and about 15% of 12- to 16-year-olds report at least one enduring symptom five weeks after being infected. However, some experts say the way ONS data is collected makes the figures not entirely reliable in this case. Japan has insisted that China stop subjecting Japanese citizens to anal Covid swabs, saying it causes “great psychological pain”. France has given the OK for the Oxford vaccine to be given to people aged 65-75 with serious health risks – a reversal of the previous position – while those over 75 will continue to receive the Moderna vaccine. And the WHO says the pandemic will not be over this year – this and other developments at our live blog. * * * Phone-addict students lose sleep – Almost four in 10 university students may have an addiction to smartphones, a habit that plays havoc with their sleep. A study of 1,043 students aged 18-30 at King’s College London found 406 displayed symptoms of smartphone addiction. More than two-thirds of the addicts had trouble sleeping, compared with 57.1% of those not hooked on their device. Students who used their phone after midnight, or for four or more hours a day, were at highest risk but even two hours could be addictive. The researchers write in Frontiers in Psychiatry: “Of those that stopped using their device more than an hour before bedtime, 23.8% exhibited addiction, compared to 42% of those stopping less than 30 minutes before bedtime.” Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “The negative impact of smartphone use on sleep is very concerning from a mental health perspective … young people should try to limit their smartphone use late at night, for example, by charging their phone in a different room to their bedroom.” * * * Claims Libya PM won office on bungs – Libya’s democratic transition has been upended by UN findings that the new interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, may have gained power after his supporters offered bribes as high as $200,000 to attract votes. They allegedly offered the money in a hotel in Tunis where a UN-selected forum met to elect an interim PM ahead of national elections in December. The inquiry reports that a row broke out in the lobby after some delegates discovered their bribes were less than others’. The UN report is due to be published on 15 March after an investigation was demanded by the UN special envoy for Libya, Stephanie Williams. Libya’s parliament was due to meet on Monday to give a vote of confidence in the new government but the bribery controversy and Dbeibah’s inability to name his cabinet have put that at risk. * * * Devoid of all flavour – A food website has been taken down after it stripped bloggers’ recipes of their gubbins and presented them as, well, just recipes. Recipeasly said it wanted to “fix online recipes” by removing adverts and “life stories”. Amid a furious backlash, food writer Kat Kinsman tweeted: “Wait, so you are just stealing content, eliminating context and creator revenue, and diminishing the labour that is the only way these recipes exist in the first place because you have decided the humans behind them are annoying?” After it was taken down the site’s landing page said it would “commit to making changes where we have fallen short”, which is quite apt really.

Pascal Gaüzère will not be dropped from the Six Nations panel of referees despite admitting that he should not have allowed Wales’s opening two tries against England in Cardiff on Saturday. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has pledged £2.8m towards a potential joint bid from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland to host the 2030 World Cup, saying it is the “right time” to “bring football home”. It was only a one-word expletive but, coming from the mouth of a manager facing an eighth defeat in nine Premier League matches, Ralph Hasenhüttl’s immediate reaction to two late chances Southampton squandered at Everton was the sound of despair, anger and disbelief. Arsenal found their away form again, Manchester City gave Chelsea little room for error, and there was no stopping Jill Scott in the Women’s Super League on the weekend.

2020-06-15T16:57:31Z,Reworking our economy for a post-coronavirus society | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/15/reworking-our-economy-for-a-post-coronavirus-society,"Your editorial (9 June) rightly calls for the post-coronavirus economy to be rebuilt in a fairer, labour-intensive and environmentally sustainable way. What wasn’t addressed, however, was the crucial question of how such an enormous transition could be paid for. In the short term, the government’s sensible response to the crisis has been to turn on the spending taps, maybe to the tune of £300bn. Expanding this to tackle the climate emergency is made easier by the government’s ability to borrow money at negative interest rates. Green quantitative easing could also help, while members of the Green New Deal group have also proposed that private savers’ money be used to help fund the green transition by changing the rules on Isas and pensions, so that some of the £170bn saved annually in such accounts and pensions might be invested in government-backed green bonds. In addition, over time there will also be higher tax takes from the industries and workers newly involved in such an enormous programme that will help pay for it. The green new deal can be paid for, but the government must pump-prime the process, and all political parties should support such a move. Caroline Lucas MP Green party Prof Richard Murphy City, University of London • Larry Elliot’s article about the April drop in GDP, with “two decades of growth … wiped out”, does indeed sound “calamitous” (Calamitous GDP figures show UK economy has fallen off a cliff, 12 June). But what is growth in a modern economy, where GDP is essentially a measure of consumption, and what exactly has been wiped out? Covid-19 has inflicted the pain of bereavement on thousands of families, but our population is much the same as it was in January. Our infrastructure is intact, energy and water are flowing, our cars and trains can still get us from A to B, and our human resources have not changed. The UK has not physically shrunk by 20% (though that might well happen if we fail to tackle climate change, and the sea moves inland over the coming decades). As Larry suggests, GDP has mostly fallen because everyone is consuming less. This is not necessarily a bad thing for most of us, though it is terrible for politicians and the owners of capital. The dramatic fall in consumption has already had a positive impact on our planet (and thus our long-term health), and people I meet are talking of real gains in the less materialistic areas of their lives. Surely it is time to find a new indicator of success or calamity that focuses on human wellbeing and the health of our planet instead of how much we grow through the treadmill of consumption. We might even find that things are not that calamitous after all, and that what we now have is a new platform for moving to a zero-carbon socio-economy that is low on consumption, high on wellbeing, and able to confront the existential crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Christopher Tanner Llandovery, Carmarthenshire • The economy won’t be saved by a return to the shops to purchase often unsustainable and largely unneeded goods, or by pouring money into dinosaur airlines. As the former chancellor Ken Clarke sagely observed on Channel 4 news last week, Rishi Sunak has done the easy bit. Unfortunately, this is a talentless government – an array of toadies who have limited life experience and are loth to listen. Boris Johnson has no economic strategy, only a desire to get the end of next week. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Plans for a green new deal aren’t new, being already well reasoned and developed. Perhaps their best attribute is the ability to deliver social infrastructure projects – such as energy insulation – at a local level, offering skills training, employing smaller companies, and building on the community engagement that has sustained people largely abandoned by Westminster. It won’t be welcomed by the big companies that traditionally fill Tory party coffers, but it does provide an achievable policy for Labour to wholeheartedly campaign on.

2020-12-05T16:00:44Z,Jobs slump and Covid lead litany of post-Trump crises facing Janet Yellen,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/05/jobs-slump-and-covid-lead-litany-of-post-trump-crises-facing-janet-yellen,"Of all the 78 US Treasury secretaries since Alexander Hamilton first took up the office in 1789, few have faced an in-tray piled quite so high as the one that will greet the first woman in the job: Janet Yellen. The choice of the Brooklyn-born doctor’s daughter to succeed Steve Mnuchin was a statement of intent by president-elect Joe Biden. Where many of her predecessors have been scions of Wall Street, Yellen’s background is in economics and public policy, and she has made it clear that her priorities are with Americans struggling to get by rather than with investment bankers. “There is a huge amount of suffering out there,” she said in September as she urged Congress to agree a new stimulus package. Yellen’s expressed desire for tighter financial regulation did not, however, stop Wall Street from joining the applause for her nomination. In part, that was due to the fact that, having been the first woman to be in charge of America’s central bank, she is seen as a seasoned pro. Donald Trump declined to give her a second term as chair of the Federal Reserve in 2018 not because she was doing a bad job, but because she was a Democrat appointed by Barack Obama. More importantly, though, Wall Street sees Yellen as a Treasury secretary who will push hard for expansionary policies aimed at boosting growth, profits and share prices. Nothing in her record suggests that the financiers are wrong. American economists are often divided into two camps: “freshwater” economists who believe in the primacy of market forces and whose spiritual home is the University of Chicago in landlocked Illinois; and “saltwater” economists, who emanate from the universities on the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards and admire the teachings of John Maynard Keynes. Yellen is a Keynesian to her fingertips: she warned against an over-hasty removal of stimulus during the financial crisis of a decade ago; she insisted that the Fed pay as much attention to unemployment as to inflation when she was its chair; and she believes the state has a duty to tackle poverty and inequality. Mohamed El-Erian, once chief executive of the investment management firm Pimco but now president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, said: “The appointment was probably one of the most well-received in the history of the US Treasury, and for good reason. Economists, lawmakers and market participants rightly see her as highly qualified, having lots of relevant experience and coming to the job with a deep understanding of both domestic and international issues. The policy portfolio she inherits will require an agile mix of traditional and out-of-the-box thinking.” Top of the to-do list will be a new package of support for a US economy struggling with three interlinked problems: a pandemic, high levels of unemployment, and the imminent expiry of financial support for laid-off workers. The jobless total has come down since surging to levels not seen since the Great Depression in the first wave of infections in the spring, but remains troublingly high for a country with, by western standards, a limited welfare safety net. What’s more, the latest data on Friday showed the rate of job creation slowing. Biden wants Congress to pass a “robust” stimulus package, and the chances of that happening will be greatly improved if the Democrats seize control of the Senate by winning the two vacant seats in Georgia next month. If not, as Mark Sobel of the Omfif thinktank says, Biden will be dealing with a “stingy” Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell. “Yellen will help negotiate and provide intellectual backing, making the case that now is the time to spend and that with low debt service costs, America should not fret in the near-term about rising debt,” Sobel says. Getting an emergency package of stimulus through Congress will only be the start of the legislative battle, because Biden also wants to spend more on upgrading America’s crumbling infrastructure and on tackling global heating. Yellen’s scope for fiscal action (tax and spending measures) may be limited by gridlock in Congress, in which case the White House will require the Fed to provide more stimulus and a good working relationship between Yellen and the man who succeeded her as head of the central bank, Jerome Powell. While sorting out the labour market and boosting living standards will be the biggest challenge, Yellen will also devote time to other policy issues. She has the executive power to toughen up what she sees as too-weak financial regulation without Congress’s say so; she will adopt a less hostile – if still robust – approach towards China; and she will seek to reassert US leadership on the global stage, pursuing a multilateralist rather than a go-it-alone approach. In all, Yellen can be expected to act as if Trump’s four years in office never happened. The message will be that the grownups are back in charge. Six central bankers who shaped the future of their economies Ben Bernanke Chair of the US Federal Reserve between 2006 and 2014, Bernanke was credited with preventing a deep recession following the 2008 financial crisis. A student of the 1930s Great Depression, he vowed to rescue the banking system and maintain the flow of funds to prevent a wave of foreclosures and mass unemployment. His determination contrasted with the Bank of England, which hesitated before rescuing Northern Rock. However, Bernanke, a former Princeton professor, played down the threat from the US sub-prime mortgage scandal during the first two years of his tenure, which he has admitted made the crisis, when it came, much worse. Karl Otto Pöhl Often dubbed a father of the euro, Pöhl was appointed president of the German Bundesbank from 1980 to 1991 by his friend and mentor, chancellor Helmut Schmidt. A colourful, English-speaking former economics journalist, he came to prominence after the conservative Helmut Kohl surprised many and reappointed him. He famously warned Kohl against rushing ahead with German unification based on a one-to-one valuation of the east German mark with its West German equivalent, fearing the collapse of the east’s uncompetitive export industries. He said the same about the implementation of the euro. Kohl ignored him. East Germany’s industrial base collapsed. After the 2008 financial crisis, southern Europe erupted in riots, with protesters blaming the euro for their ills. Mario Draghi If Pöhl laid the foundation stones for the euro, Draghi prevented the currency from toppling over. In 2012, after campaigns in several member states to quit the euro – notably in Greece and Italy – triggered panic in financial markets, he said the single currency was “irreversible” and famously pledged to do “whatever it takes” to save it. As president of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019, which absorbed most of the powers from 19 member states’ central banks on its creation in 1999, he drew a line under the destabilising debate about the currency’s future. After he stepped down, the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman described him as “[arguably] the greatest central banker of modern times”. Mark Carney Carney was governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to March this year. He was appointed by the chancellor at the time, George Osborne, who courted him for a year and called the former Goldman Sachs banker and head of Canada’s central bank “the outstanding central banker of his generation”. Yet within a year, he was likened to an “unreliable boyfriend” who failed to match his promises with action. This followed a series of overly optimistic forecasts that led many to prepare for an increase in interest rates that never came. Carney, more polished and dapper than his contemporaries, recovered much of his reputation in 2016 when he was dubbed “the only adult in the room” following the Brexit referendum. While parliament went into shock and No 10 was consumed by the resignation of David Cameron, Carney toured the TV and radio stations, calming fraying nerves. Raghuram Rajan The Chicago Booth economics professor is often described as one of the few economists to predict the financial crisis. In a speech in 2005 to the world’s top central bankers he explained that an explosion of borrowing made financial markets more dangerous. At the time he was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, so he might have expected his warning that “it’s possible these developments are creating a greater (albeit still small) probability of a catastrophic meltdown” would be taken seriously. It wasn’t. He took over as governor of India’s central bank in 2013 after warning that the country was suffering from hubris, adding that “growth can never be taken for granted” and that “self-delusion is the first step towards disaster”. The rupee, which tumbled 12% against the dollar in the three months before his arrival, stabilised. By the time he left in 2016, price inflation had fallen from almost 10% to below 4% and a series of banking reforms were in place. Christine Lagarde As president of the European Central Bank since last year, Lagarde has shown she is a would-be central bank hero. Shifting the dial at an institution covering 19 countries is never easy, but the former boss of the IMF has embarked on a campaign for greater transparency in a break from the traditionally closeted bank’s decision-making, and for unemployment and inequality to be as much of a yardstick for the ECB as inflation. She has also matched Carney in the drive to make central bank lending more climate-friendly, with green bonds that only allow loans to businesses that are environmentally friendly.

2020-07-01T14:00:24Z,England's sewerage: what the water companies have to say,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-sewerage-water-companies-practices-policies,"Thames Water: “We invested more than £1bn again in 2019-20, leading to a total of £15bn in the past 15 years, and we will continue to spend wisely on improving resilience, service and efficiency, as well as provide more support for customers in vulnerable circumstances. “Our shareholders are in it for the long term and have not taken a dividend for three years to prioritise investment in improving service for customers and to protect the environment.” Anglian Water: “With regard to dividend payments, it would be incorrect to say that borrowing is used to pay dividends. Financing though debt is the most cost-effective and legitimate way to fund new infrastructure. Customers benefit, bills are cheaper. This is why we do it. “To be able to continually maintain and improve our critical infrastructure, reduce leakage and meet the needs of a fast-growing, prosperous region, we rely on generating cost-effective funding from a variety of sources. “Over the past 20 years, customers have paid for just half of the investment that has been made in new infrastructure. The rest has come from our debt investors. By borrowing money and using the right amount of debt, we are able to keep customers’ bills down. This year customer bills reduced by 6% after inflation, roughly £26 per year. “Last year, we invested about £1bn in the region and in infrastructure, and it is worth noting that our entire capital programme is financed by green bonds, reflecting our cost-effective, low-carbon and sustainable approach to construction.” United Utilities: “Over the past 18 years, United Utilities has invested £1.2bn improving our overflow discharges to reduce the incidence, volume and impact of spills. After obtaining permits from the Environment Agency for 606 temporary-deemed consents, we have carried out further investment to stop some of them discharging altogether. “We now have a greater understanding of the system than at any point in history, thanks to a successful project, completed in March, to install flow monitors on more than 90% of our overflows. This vast amount of data is being analysed in order to inform our investment programmes and we are actively exploring innovative solutions to help us do this work faster.” Wessex Water: “In an ideal world there would not be a combined sewerage system. But many sewers were laid at a time when only one drain served a property – carrying both rainwater and sewage. “To separate the flows into two systems is not possible without causing massive disruption to motorists as thousands of kilometres of road would have to be dug up, which would cost many billions of pounds and resulting in a significant increase in bills. “Since 2000, we have invested £181m to upgrade more than 582 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and there are plans to improve more over the next five years, spending a further £26m on CSO investigations and improvements, in line with the storm overflow assessment framework.” Severn Trent: “CSOs are central to the design of sewer systems as they also play an important role in protecting properties from flooding, and the discharges they make are permitted and regulated by the Environment Agency so as not to have a detrimental impact on rivers. “Since privatisation, Severn Trent has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading and maintaining our CSOs to achieve stringent river water quality standards set by UK and European legislation. “Over the past five years we have installed monitoring at more than 80% of our CSOs and have completed detailed investigations of 32 river reaches within our region to identify further sites for improvement.” Southern Water said: “Protecting rivers is a key part of Southern Water’s mission. CSO releases are made to protect homes and businesses from internal and external flooding. These releases occur because in many areas surface drains are connected into our sewer system – which is how they were constructed for many years. “In heavy rain, such as experienced this winter when more than 2bn litres of water fell on Hampshire in the first two months of the year alone, no wastewater treatment work can cope – they were not designed to handle storm water. “Many of our wastewater treatment works have storm tanks as buffers, and only when these are full of the highly dilute mixture of rain and wastewater are releases permitted by the Environment Agency. “The company has led the industry in storm-spill event and duration monitoring, meaning that our self-reporting of storm releases far outstrips the industry average. “We continue to invest in both monitoring and other mitigation measures. Our bathing water enhancement programme spent £33m in the past five years including on projects such as a £3m storm tank tunnel in Shanklin on the Isle of Wight which will cut the number of storm releases by an estimated 33%. “In some areas especially prone to sewer flooding we have taken the expensive and disruptive step of physically separating combined sewers and surface water drains. In one small part of Portsmouth this was a £50m project. This makes it clear that digging up thousands of streets and roads would cost many billions and cause massive disruption and would not be acceptable to our customers or to regulators. “In the last 12 months a further 111 monitors were added to overflows to further enhance our monitoring. We have now virtually completed installing monitoring across our storm over flows and by March 2021 we will be reporting virtually every event to the EA.” Northumbrian Water and Yorkshire Water did not respond to requests for a comment. South West Water said it was content for the industry body Water UK to respond on behalf of the sector. A spokesperson for Water UK said: “The water industry is committed to the very highest environmental standards … Although there is currently no simple and effective alternative to overflows, there are some innovative solutions being used, such as sustainable drainage systems, which are natural features that help keep rainwater out of the sewer. In new housing developments, these can help to take some of the pressure off the sewer network. “There’s also action we can all take in our day-to-day lives to help safeguard our rivers and waterways, such as helping to prevent blockages or fatbergs clogging up sewers – these are among the biggest causes of unauthorised overflow discharges into the environment. “By not flushing products such as wet wipes down the down the toilet or pouring fats, oils and grease down the sink, we can all help keep our sewers clear and minimise the wastewater entering our natural environment.”",Environment; Pollution; Utilities; Business; Household bills; Consumer affairs; Money; United Utilities; Severn Trent,Environment
2020-02-05T15:16:47Z,Barclays faces fresh investor revolt over fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/05/barclays-bank-revolt-investor-forum-fossil-fuels-climate,"Barclays is facing a fresh revolt from the UK’s most powerful investor group amid mounting concerns over its role as the biggest European financier of fossil fuel companies. The Investor Forum, which holds £18.5tn in assets and represents Britain’s largest investors, is understood to be pressing Barclays to adopt stricter policies on climate change before the bank’s annual shareholder meeting in May. The bank is already facing criticism from a separate group of 11 pension and investment funds managing more than £130bn of assets. Spearheaded by the campaign group ShareAction, they have filed a resolution calling for Barclays to set clear targets to phase out services to energy companies that fail to align with Paris climate goals. But the reported intervention of the Investor Forum, whose members include all the big names in the UK fund management industry, will intensify the pressure on the bank. The Investor Forum declined to comment. Barclays is being targeted because of its leading role in funding fossil fuel projects. A recent study found that its lending and underwriting to carbon-intensive companies and projects between 2015 and 2018 totalled $85bn (£64bn). The sum is more than any other British or European bank, and prompted campaign group ShareAction to coordinate the resolution tabled for May’s AGM. Barclays said: “We continue to engage with ShareAction and other stakeholders on this issue and will make a further statement at the appropriate time.” Privately, the bank believes the campaign against it is unfair, pointing to figures that show that while it remains a significant banker to the fossil fuel industry, its business with the companies most aggressively expanding in the sector fell sharply, from $13.1bn in 2016 to $5.2bn in 2018. It has also facilitated £27.3bn in “green” bonds and renewable financing. Unlike some European banks, Barclays has not ruled out funding projects or companies involved in coal or tar sands, regarded as particularly polluting as they require large amounts of energy to extract. Barclays has faced protests in its branches from Greenpeace campaigners over its involvement in tar sands, focusing on the pipelines being built across Canada and the US to bring oil to market from Alberta’s tar sands. If the AGM resolution is approved by shareholders, the bank will have to publish a plan to phase out the provision of financial services to energy companies that are not meeting Paris climate goals. It is understood that since the pension and investment funds filed their resolution, the Barclays chairman, Nigel Higgins, has engaged with institutional investors. The Financial Times suggests the bank is considering putting forward its own climate change plan to stave off the investor revolt. Barclays has a way to go before it meets the standards set by some other European financial giants. The insurer Axa said in 2017 that it was divesting from 25 tar sands companies as well as the three large pipelines needed to deliver their oil to market. BNP Paribas, one of the biggest banks in France, has also pledged to stop financing companies whose main activity is extracting oil and gas from shale deposits or tar sands. Biggest banks providing finance to fossil fuel extraction, 2015-18 total 1. JP Morgan Chase $195.6bn 2. Wells Fargo $151.6bn 3. Citi $129.5bn 4. Bank of America $106.7bn 5. RBC (Canada) $100.5bn 6. Barclays $85.2bn 7. MUFG (Japan) $80.1bn 8. TD (Toronto Dominion) $74.1bn 9. ScotiaBank $69.6bn 10.

2019-02-28T17:00:43Z,Out on its own: Australia the only country to use climate funding to upgrade coal-fired plants,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/01/out-on-its-own-australia-the-only-country-to-use-climate-funding-to-upgrade-coal-fired-plants,"Australia is the only developed country that allows climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants, green finance experts say. Experts say allowing Vales Point coal-fired power station to register with the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund, rebadged this week as a “climate solutions” policy, puts Australia out of step with the World Bank, Europe and the US, which have all rejected using climate financing for coal power retrofits. The World Bank has issued US$13bn in green bonds since 2008 to stimulate spending to combat global warming. China has used green bonds to help build new coal-fired plants to replace older, dirtier stations on the grounds it reduces nitrogen-based emissions causing the country’s oppressive air pollution. But it announced in December it would no longer consider “clean coal” plants – which still emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas – investments in green technology. Sean Kidney, chief executive of the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative, says China’s shift leaves Australia out on its own. “If you were committed to meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the Australian government says it is committed to, this is just lunacy,” Kidney says. “No investors in the western world will accept any green bonds that incentivise anything like coal station retrofits. From an investor’s perspective, coal is a dead duck.” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, says Australia is moving across the trend by considering giving taxpayer support to coal. In addition to the potential support through the climate solutions fund, the government is considering underwriting the cost of building new coal-fired power stations. In the past fortnight, mining giant Glencore has said it will cap coal production in response to pressure from shareholders, while Rio Tinto stressed it was the only large mining company with no fossil fuel investments, having sold its final coal assets to Glencore last year. “At a time when private-sector capital is increasingly looking for low carbon and decarbonisation opportunities, it would seem to be swimming against the tide to put government taxpayer funding into these [coal] activities,” Herd says. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that limiting global warming to 1.5C – a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement – would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. While global markets increasingly recognise a decline in coal use is inevitable, the shift away from it has been fitful. The Global Carbon Project found global emissions were likely to have hit a new high in 2018, in part due to an increase in coal burning in China. It bucked a global decline in emissions from coal in 2015 and 2016. Though it has been registered, Vales Point coal plant is yet to bid for money from the emissions reduction fund due to a dispute over whether it needs to reduce its carbon intensity to less than the grid average to win a government contract. The plant’s owners say the project would reduce emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant’s emissions over that time. The environment minister, Melissa Price, has backed the interpretation of the Clean Energy Regulator, which says the project does not qualify in its current form. The company disagrees, noting former environment minister Greg Hunt said the fund could be used to “clean up” power plants and that published guidelines explicitly said coal could win backing. The methodology is being reviewed by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee. Even if Vales Point is not successful, critics such as the Australian Conservation Foundation say there is nothing preventing other coal-fired plant owners from applying for a climate subsidy. Major companies are being paid from the fund for other fossil fuel projects: South African miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant the company says it would have built regardless; Rio Tinto has received $2m for a diesel-fired power plant at a bauxite mine. With prime minister Scott Morrison announcing the Coalition would top up the $2.55bn fund with an additional $2bn over a decade, economists and environmentalists have called for emissions from fossil fuels to be dealt with through different policies and for the fund to focus on projects that restore or protect natural habitat. Experts say the scheme will be improved if the government tightens the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was promised to limit emissions from big industry but which has largely allowed major companies to nominate their own pollution. National emissions have increased each year since the emissions reduction fund replaced the abolished carbon price scheme in 2014. Money from the fund is distributed via reverse auction, with land owners and businesses bidding for contracts to reduce emissions cheaply. Analyses have found some projects under the fund have merit but it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere.",Emissions trading; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Business; Australia news; Coalition; Liberal party; Australian politics,Environment
2019-09-02T17:08:36Z,Manchester Extinction Rebellion activists glue themselves to banks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/02/manchester-extinction-rebellion-activists-glue-banks-barclays-hsbc,"Environmental protesters have glued themselves to banks in Manchester to protest against fossil fuel investments on the final day of Extinction Rebellion’s action in the city. Nine activists stuck themselves to the pavement outside Barclays in Piccadilly Square, with a further two following suit at HSBC in St Ann’s Square on Monday. No arrests were made. About 100 protesters also staged “die-ins” across the city, blocking the road outside the fish market in the Arndale shopping centre “to highlight the damage animal agriculture does to the environment”. They then lay on the site of the former Central Retail Park, which the council wants to turn into a car park. Extinction Rebellion has donated all plants from its pop-up park to the site, which local residents have occupied and declared a “people’s park”. Lizzy Haughton had glued one hand to another protester and the other to the paving stone outside Barclays. A sabbatical officer at Manchester University, she has already been arrested twice at Extinction Rebellion protests, receiving a conditional discharge for spray painting the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs building and awaiting trial for another action in Manchester last year. She said she was not worried about being arrested for a third time. “I have given up my career prospects because there will be no planet to do anything in if we don’t act soon,” she said. By lunchtime she was released by Greater Manchester police after officers made it clear they had no plans to arrest the group. “[Arrests] would have been good,” she said, “but we have got into the media already and the point was to bring attention to Barclays.” A recent report from the Rainforest Action Network and the BankTrack group, which tracks and analyses the investments of banks around the world, found Barclays had invested $24bn (£20bn) in fossil fuels last year. The bank said that was less than the £27.3bn it had facilitated in green bonds and renewable financing in the same period. It said it was determined to “do all we can to support the transition to a low carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met”. At the HSBC protest, Michael Silkstone, 60, from Huddersfield, said he was there “because it’s my generation that are the ones that have caused this”. He added: “We’re here outside HSBC because the banks invest huge amounts in the fossil fuels that are polluting our climate for profit. They aren’t concerned about me or my son or my grandson.” Reem Reynolds, 28, from Whalley Range in Manchester, took part in a die-in outside HSBC. “I’m disabled and I was lying on the floor earlier in the die-in with my walking stick because I’m scared for all of our futures. I’m too scared to have kids with the way things are going, because climate change will affect all of us, no matter how safe you feel now,” she said. Extinction Rebellion has occupied a section of Deansgate – one of Manchester’s main streets for shopping, eating and drinking – since Friday. A petition has been launched to close the street permanently to motorised traffic, arguing that it would be good for health and business. Research from the Walk Ride Greater Manchester campaign group said businesses on the closed stretch had a bumper weekend. The cafe and bar Over Under said it had doubled takings and ran out of food three times on Saturday. Pret a Manger, which has a vegetarian branch on Deansgate, asked: “Can we do this every week?”. Go Falafel said it was tthe store’s best Saturday for four years. Waterstones had the “best Saturday footfall ever”.

2019-09-20T07:00:03Z,"It’s taken years, but at last there’s real hope for meaningful climate action | Caroline Lucas",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/green-new-deal-bill-co2-emissions-britain-climate-action,"It’s been more than 10 years in the making, and is the top demand of the youth strikers gathering on Friday for the UK’s largest ever climate protest – which is why Friday is also the first attempt in Britain to put legislation in place to make a Green New Deal a reality for our country. Working with the Labour MP Clive Lewis, I am launching the full version of a Green New Deal bill (formal title, the decarbonisation and economic strategy bill), which sets out a transformative programme driven by the principles of justice and equity. It aims to move our economy away from its harmful dependence on carbon, at the scale and speed demanded by the science, and to build a society that lives within its ecological limits while reversing social and economic inequality. Our country needs investment and a worker-led just transition. Too many areas have been all but abandoned by Westminster over the past 30 years: industries shut down with nothing to replace the jobs lost; people ignored and disempowered. I’m struck by the opportunities our country is missing, compared with the bold action taken by others. In Spain, for example, the closure of the coalmines comes with a £221m investment package, agreed with the unions, which includes environmental restoration of mining areas and reskilling of miners for green industries. UK workers want to be part of the sustainability revolution and we are denying them the chance. So how will our bill help this? First, we need to fundamentally change the way our economy is managed, so that democratically elected governments – not the whims of the market – set our future direction. Freed from false economic constraints that benefit only the wealthy, public investment can go directly into productive activity that will, in turn, generate tax revenue. Our pensions and savings can also be redirected into new green bonds, generating a safe return and the investment needed. It also means moving away from the pursuit of growth as the primary economic objective. Instead, we should prioritise health and wellbeing, reducing inequality and – crucially – tackling the climate emergency. The bill proposes a Green New Deal commission, representing all sectors of society and multiple areas of expertise, which will draw up detailed plans. By focusing investment particularly in those areas and communities that have been failed most, and by ensuring that workers are at the forefront of designing a just transition, we’ll have the potential to build a broad and durable coalition that can sustain this transformation. Government will work with the private sector to invest in the innovative work required to transform everything from manufacturing to the way we produce and consume energy, heat our homes, travel and grow food. This investment will create well-paid jobs and new industries across the country, producing tax revenues for the government. The bill sets out yearly targets on emissions, inequality and wellbeing. In a report to accompany the bill, our advocacy organisation Green New Deal Group proposes investing up to 5% of annual GDP, around £100bn annually, for the next 10 years. The shortage of “shovel-ready” projects means it may not be possible to spend those sums immediately. But what matters most is what we do in the near future: we need to invest in the infrastructure that will allow us to live within our ecological limits and take us towards the government’s declared goal of net-zero emissions – and well before 2050, which is far too late. And as Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change, has said, the sooner we do it, the cheaper it will be. This is not just about decarbonising our industry and transport systems with investment in railways and emissions-free bus travel. It is also about transforming our farming, and restoring soil health and biodiversity by directing subsidies towards farming methods that support this. But it is also, crucially, about redistributing power in our country. We are one of the most centralised states in the western world, with power concentrated overwhelmingly in Westminster and, increasingly, Downing Street. Although the Green New Deal must be driven by national government, the details of the plans will be devised and implemented locally. Local authorities are best placed to develop detailed plans with the communities they represent. It must be about international fairness too, and the bill accounts for this by ensuring finance and technology for the global south. The years I have spent discussing the Green New Deal with economists and environmentalists have often felt like wasted years. The climate crisis has grown rapidly worse and biodiversity loss is accelerating. But the upsurge in support for climate action, particularly among young people, has been inspiring. An overwhelming majority of the public think the climate emergency is the most important issue we face. Politicians need to respond: there is no time to waste and a nation to transform. • Caroline Lucas is the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion",Politics; Climate crisis; Environment; Climate science; Green deal and energy companies obligation (ECO); Science; Energy efficiency; Energy; UK news,Opinion
2019-07-02T05:00:21Z,"Firms must document climate impact on profits, Treasury says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/firms-climate-impact-on-profits-treasury,"Britain’s leading companies, investment funds and pension schemes must show by 2022 how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances, under government plans to boost the UK’s green credentials. Firms must document within the two-and-a-half-year deadline how extreme weather and changes to climate rules, such as a ban on plastic packaging, could hit their profits. The Treasury is also urging City banks to play a bigger role in supporting the UK meeting its legal target to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Under a new government strategy, banks will be pushed to invest in sustainability and come clean about their own exposure to the climate crisis. The Treasury said its green finance strategy would help the City emerge as a green finance capital by funding green investment, an education charter, a green home finance fund and by establishing a new green finance institute. The institute succeeds the green finance taskforce that was launched in 2017 and will encourage investment in sustainable businesses such as renewable energy firms. Financial services firms will also be expected to disclose how climate emergency risk impacts their activities by 2022. John Glen, the City minister, said the green finance strategy would help establish London as “a pre-eminent international centre for green finance”. He said: “The UK has a long history of leading the way in tackling climate change, but we need to do more to protect our planet for future generations.” The Treasury’s flurry of green finance initiatives has emerged as it prepares to face questions from a committee of MPs over its role in supporting the government’s climate targets. The Treasury select committee launched an inquiry last month to scrutinise the role played by Treasury officials, regulators and financial services firms after Theresa May’s announcement that a net-zero carbon emissions target would be enshrined in law. Philip Hammond responded to the policy by saying a net-zero carbon economy would cost £1tn to create. The claim was quickly rebuffed by No 10 in a rare rebuke to the chancellor. John McDonnell recently outlined plans to give the Bank of England powers to help scrutinise the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. The shadow chancellor has promoted the idea of a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a key member. The new body would be supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. McDonnell said: “From the government, this is too little and too late. It’s also totally ineffectual and toothless. “While it’s true that the finance sector will need to play a huge role in securing a sustainable economy for the future, it seems like the government is still stuck in the mindset of fiddling around the edges and hoping the free market will solve the climate emergency.” Climate emergency campaigners have supported the concept of a Green New Deal that mostly involves state support for a switch to low-carbon energy use and greener infrastructure. Hammond said he preferred to encourage the private sector to back green companies through a green finance institute, headed by former Barclays executive Rhian-Mari Thomas. He pointed to the already burgeoning market for green bonds, which act like mortgages for businesses that want to pursue environmentally friendly projects. All the main city regulators said they backed the chancellor’s move, saying a new stewardship code that required investors to check the “environmental, social and governance issues, including climate change” of UK businesses would make them more sustainable.",Business; Climate crisis; Investment funds; Pensions industry; Philip Hammond; Politics; UK news; Extreme weather; Environment; World news,Business
2019-09-17T16:00:08Z,Leading burger supplier sourced from Amazon farmer using deforested land,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/leading-burger-supplier-sourced-from-amazon-farmer-guilty-of-deforestation,"The world’s biggest supplier of burgers sourced meat from a farmer in the Amazon who had been found guilty of using deforested land, say reports, even as new figures reveal the beef industry’s deforestation risks. Marfrig, a Brazilian meat company that has supplied McDonald’s, Burger King and other fast-food chains around the world, bought cattle from a farm that had been using deforested land earlier this year, according to a joint investigation by Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The company said it was misled by a government certificate that cleared the farm of deforestation, and it has since ended the association. Marfrig has recently launched an environment “transition bond” to tap into the growing sustainable investment market. In January, inspectors from Ibama, Brazil’s environmental watchdog, found cattle from Limeira Ranch grazing on illegally deforested land inside a protected region, the Triunfo do Xingu environmental protection area in Pará state. The region has been devastated by forest fires this year. The part of the farm where the cattle were found had been placed under an official embargo – which prohibits grazing – three years before, due to illegal felling. Embargos are imposed for environmental violations and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover. For breaking the embargo, the ranch was fined 1.19m reais (£236,000) this year. Despite this, documents obtained by Repórter Brasil show that 144 cattle from Limeira Ranch were subsequently supplied to a Marfrig abattoir in Tucumã, in Pará. The company also bought cattle from the ranch on multiple occasions in late 2018. There is no evidence that the cattle Marfrig purchased were themselves raised on illegally deforested land. Marfrig told the Guardian: “On the date of purchase, February 16, 2019, Marfrig’s geo-monitoring platform collected all available information about the supplier … At that date … there was no record of non-compliance. It was not on the Ibama embargoed producers list, there was no satellite detection of deforestation in the area and the rancher was not on the official list of companies using slave-like labor. “Ibama issued a negative certificate assuring that on that date … nothing was against the supplier. And that’s the only way companies – not just Marfrig – can look for official information in real time. From the moment the official inclusion information was made available by Ibama, the supplier (and so in any and all cases) was automatically and immediately blocked. This means that, since then, rancher Adriano José de Mattos and Fazenda Limeira cannot supply Marfrig.” Marfrig supplied the Ibama certificate clearing the ranch as part of their reply. The Bureau has established, using trade data and shipping records, the extent of the links between Brazilian meat companies and the UK. Nearly £1bn worth of beef supplied by three of the meat giants – Marfrig, JBS and Minerva and their subsidiaries – was directly imported to the UK in the past five years. Much of this supplied major UK supermarkets, as well as wholesalers and independent food companies. Meanwhile new figures released by Trase, a supply-chain initiative run by the Stockholm Environment Institute and NGO Global Canopy, delineate the deforestation risks in the export supply chains of three of Brazil’s major beef companies, including Marfrig. The Trase research mapped supply chains for beef from international markets back through customs and slaughterhouses to the municipalities where cattle were raised, using customs, agricultural, and sanitary inspection data. Having traced the cattle back to their original municipalities, Trase cross-referenced government figures on cattle numbers with deforestation data and official data on new pastures to calculate a deforestation “risk” – presented as an area in sq km – associated with companies and specific international markets. The analysis includes data on “indirect” suppliers, which are often intermediate farms that don’t sell directly to abattoirs, but supply other farms that may truck cattle to slaughter. According to Trase’s calculations, Marfrig’s beef exports come from farms linked to up to 100 sq km of deforestation risk a year in Brazil. Trase also calculated figures for JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, and Minerva Foods, another large global supplier of Brazilian beef. JBS beef exports have been linked to farms involved in up to 300 sq km of deforestation risk per year, and Minerva Foods linked to farms involved in 100 sq km of risk, according to the research. Marfrig said: “It would be a mistake to conclude from Trase data that there is a link between the cattle purchased by Marfrig and deforestation in the region. Precisely because it understands that there is a risk and that Trase information provides relevant services for the preservation of biomes, Marfrig developed and implemented its geo-monitoring platform. This system is audited by an independent third party – Norwegian DNV GL. Using this platform and analysing Trase information, Marfrig substantially mitigates the risk of acquiring animals from deforestation – using, since 2009, the zero deforestation criterion for the Amazon biome.” Minerva said: “Sustainability forms one of the fundamental pillars of Minerva Foods, at its core to feed the world, conserve the planet and enhance human value … 100% of Minerva’s purchases come from zero-deforestation areas in the Amazon biome. Overlapping our suppliers’ ranch map with deforestation polygons, indigenous lands and environmental protection areas, our sustainability department blocks any supplier that are not compliant with any of the criteria, which effectively means that Minerva can’t buy any animals coming from these suppliers.” JBS said: “JBS has an unwavering commitment to combat, discourage and eliminate deforestation in the Amazon region … For nearly a decade, we have monitored our supply chain with satellite technology, geo-referenced farm data and official government records to ensure compliance with our stringent responsible sourcing policies … The most recent audit in 2018, conducted by DNV GL, a global quality assurance and certification company based in Norway, confirmed that 100% of our cattle purchases were in compliance with our responsible sourcing policies.” Burger King told us: “Our goal is to eliminate deforestation within our global supply chain, and we are working toward this.” They said that all their suppliers were required to comply with their sustainability and forest protection policies. McDonald’s said it aimed to eliminate deforestation from its global supply chains by 2030 and that it had “made a commitment not to purchase raw material from any farm in the Amazon … linked with deforestation”. This July Marfrig launched a $500m “transition” bond. Like “green bonds”, which allow environmentally friendly firms to raise cash, bankers have designed transition bonds for companies with the potential to clean up their practices to fund that change. In the bond framework, the company states: “Our vision is to be recognised as the best global protein company. This will happen with commitment to sustainability.” This article was amended on 18 September 2019 to remove a reference to JBS being audited under Greenpeace’s Amazon Cattle and Biome standards. After publication, Greenpeace said that it had ended the engagement with JBS in 2017.",Meat industry; Environment; Farming; Food; Deforestation; Conservation; Trees and forests; Brazil,Environment
2019-08-23T16:23:04Z,Greening your life is all very well – but only a global climate strategy will fix this | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/23/greening-your-life-global-approach,"Judging by the latest opinion polls, the public is ripe for some green austerity. Ipsos Mori says that 85% of Britons are concerned about climate change, with 52% admitting they are very concerned. These are the highest figures since the pollster started tracking opinion in 2005. Given the spate of extreme weather-related events, and the pictures of the torching of the Amazon rainforest, such concern is both logical and predictable. In this country, the climate deniers have been put to flight. What the polls don’t show is whether the public is willing to translate this concern into action; whether similar levels of concern are present in less prosperous parts of the world; and whether it is possible to translate individual concerns into collective political action. Here, the message is a lot more mixed. The furore over the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s private jets are a case in point. People don’t like being lectured to, particularly when those doing the lecturing fail to live by their own ethical code. Emmanuel Macron wants the future of the Amazon rainforest to be top of the agenda at the meeting of the G7 he is hosting this weekend in Biarritz, but this is an empty gesture. There is not the remotest possibility of the G7 doing anything to rein in the activities of Brazil’s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Indeed, Macron’s own experience shows how hard it is to translate a desire to curb carbon emissions into practical action. The French president said making driving more expensive was a price worth paying in the fight against global heating but faced nationwide protests from the yellow vest movement. For the gilets jaunes, the immediate threat to their livelihoods mattered more than the long-term threat posed by the climate crisis. What Macron failed to grasp was that winning this battle first means winning the battle for hearts and minds, not least by countering the impression that tackling global heating is a luxury only the better off can afford or that going green means being miserable. The success of the UK’s 5p plastic bag levy is a classic example of how nudge economics can work. Plastic bags have not been banned: consumers simply have to think about whether they are actually prepared to pay for one. The message is that consumers respond to signals: it is not always necessary to ban things. Despite receiving a bloody nose, Macron is right when he says the climate crisis is a global problem requiring a global response. But securing international agreement is not going to be easy, in the main because the biggest increases in emissions are coming from countries where governments put a higher priority on poverty reduction than they do on safeguarding the environment. Sales of meat and dairy products are rising fast in China because rapid growth means households can afford fridges. In the grand scheme of things, that matters a lot more to global heating than universities banning beef from their canteens. China and India currently have much lower rates of car ownership than countries in the west, but as they grow richer their new middle classes will inevitably seek to emulate western consumers. The number of cars per thousand people are as follows: the US, 811; the UK, 471; China, 179; India, 22. There are 2.8 billion people in China and India. Do the maths. Africa accounted for one in five of the world’s live births in the 1990s, but by the end of the next decade it will be one in three. Demand for energy will soar as the population rises. All of which makes the case for a global green Marshall plan to finance the transfer of low-carbon technology to poorer parts of the world look pretty compelling. The US pumped billions of dollars into the reconstruction of western Europe after the second world war to secure markets for US exporters and to discourage the spread of communism. Enlightened self-interest is required again today. If rich countries provided the financial resources to transfer low-carbon technology to the poorer parts of the world, there would be three clear benefits to the west: lower carbon emissions, fewer economic migrants and bigger markets for green goods. Donald Trump is no Harry Truman and US participation in a green Marshall plan will have to await a change of personnel in the White House. But Elizabeth Warren, one of the leading Democrats in the presidential race, is a fan. However, even as we wait for international agreement, there are low-hanging fruit to be picked. About one-sixth of carbon emissions in the UK come from residential property, largely as a result of old-fashioned and inefficient central heating. It represents a bigger contribution to global heating than meat-eating or flying. A drastic cut in carbon emissions from homes requires two things: better insulation and the replacement of gas-fired heating with the latest technology – heat pumps and hydrogen boilers. This will not be cheap; few households have the money to pay for the new kit, and making them pay for it through higher energy bills would be unpopular. The independent Committee on Climate Change said putting hydrogen boilers and electric heating into every home would cost tens of billions a year, and if this is to happen quickly – as it should – the government will have to foot the bill. It could do this in two ways: by taking advantage of historically low interest rates to float green bonds – something the German government is planning – or by channelling money created by the process known as quantitative easing into environmental projects. Retrofitting homes so that energy does not leak out of badly insulated walls and roofs means lower energy bills and the prospect of well-paid, secure jobs in every part of the country – and would make public engagement with the climate crisis easier to sustain. • Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor",Green economy; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Ethical and green living; UK news,Opinion
2019-01-03T18:09:21Z,Let’s make 2019 the year of a green new deal | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/03/lets-make-2019-the-year-of-a-green-new-deal,"The counter to Larry Elliott’s gloomy economic projections for 2019 (For those inclined to pessimism, the new year offers plenty to be worried about, 31 December) is to be found in his earlier article making the case for countries to put their economies on an “environmental war footing” (We’re back to 1930s politics: anger and, yes, appeasement, 20 December). To deliver this will, however, require that people be convinced that they will benefit and that there is the money to pay for such a transformation. This funding can be raised in a number of ways. One way is to make clear that this is an emergency and to tap private savings via “green war bonds”. Another mechanism would be to improve tax collection: the UK still has a tax gap of many tens of billions a year. We could also increase taxes on the wealthy, with this having the added benefit of tackling increasing inequality, which is fuelling the rise of populism. And we could also use quantitative easing to fund the transition to a sustainable economy. We proposed just such a green quantitative easing in 2010. The Bank of England might well be sympathetic to this form of QE. Mark Carney is on record as saying that if the government agreed then it could expand the range of assets it purchases. The Bank could then purchase new debt issued in the form of green bonds by a national investment bank to fund energy efficiency in all buildings, renewables and local transport systems. This green new deal would provide jobs in every constituency and dramatically reduce carbon emissions.

2019-04-02T02:33:53Z,Melissa Price lobbied by energy company before coal-fired power review requested,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/02/melissa-price-lobbied-by-energy-company-before-coal-fired-power-review-requested,"Environment minister Melissa Price requested a review of how climate change policy could be used to upgrade coal-fired power stations after being lobbied by an energy company, freedom-of-information documents show. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the Vales Point power station in New South Wales had been registered under the emissions reduction fund, the “direct action” climate policy introduced by Tony Abbott that Scott Morrison has promised to spend another $2bn on if re-elected. Its owners, Sunset Power International trading as Delta Electricity, wanted to bid for taxpayers’ support from the fund at an auction in December. If successful, it would have used the money as part of a $14m project to replace turbine blades at the plant. But the bid for taxpayers’ support was blocked by the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, on the grounds the company had not provided enough information to show it would qualify for carbon credits. Documents released under freedom-of-information laws show a consultant working on behalf of Delta Electricity contacted the regulator, the environment department and the offices of Price and energy minister Angus Taylor about the decision. He asked for an “urgent meeting” between Price and Trevor St Baker, the company’s part-owner and a coal advocate and political donor. The consultant, John Short, said St Baker and Delta’s chief executive wanted to discuss concerns the Clean Energy Regulator had adopted a position that discriminated against coal-fired electricity. He suggested the company would consider appealing the regulator’s decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if not overturned. The emails suggest the meeting did not take place, but Price had asked the independent emissions reduction assurance committee to review how coal-fired power stations could earn carbon credits under the climate scheme. Kelly O’Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which received the freedom of information documents, said Price was within her rights to call for a review but the timing and focus on coal raised questions about St Baker’s influence and the government’s support for fossil fuels. “The Morrison government needs to explain its relationship with Trevor St Baker, a major party donor who is seemingly pushing hard to get public money and institutional backing for his coal business,” she said. An upgrade of the Vales Point plant has also been included on a shortlist of power generation projects the government is considering underwriting. It was the sole coal project on the shortlist released last week. Price’s spokesman told the ABC the government frequently reviewed methods used under the emissions reduction fund to ensure they continued to meet integrity standards. She said the scheme was designed to provide funding to projects from across the economy, including industry. The minister’s office had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Green finance analysts say Australia is the only developed country with rules that allow climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants and that China announced in December it would no longer use green bonds to help replace old coal plants with newer technology. Delta Electricity says the proposed Vales Point upgrade would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant’s emissions over that time. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year found limiting global warming to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. The emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as a “climate solutions” fund, distributes cash through a reverse auction, with the cheapest proposed cuts winning contracts. The scheme has been dogged by problems with methodology and criticisms that it is not an adequate policy to deal with national emissions, which continue to rise. There have been concerns within the bureaucracy about how emissions cuts from vegetation projects are calculated, prompting the government to propose amendments to the fund’s rules. The changes suggest some projects have been receiving more carbon credits and taxpayer money than they needed. Most contracts have been awarded to vegetation projects, but industrial developments are also eligible. Rio Tinto received $2m to build a diesel power plant and miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant it says it would have built anyway. The government dedicated $2.55bn to the fund after winning power in 2013, $476m of which has been paid out with another $1.8m under contract. The Coalition has promised to inject an extra $200m a year from 2021 to 2030 if in government. Labor would scrap it and restore a carbon farming initiative, focused on land-based projects.",Australian politics; Energy; Australia news; Coal; Energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; Coalition; Liberal party,Australia news
2019-04-23T12:14:25Z,It's time for nations to unite around an International Green New Deal | Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/23/international-green-new-deal-climate-change-global-response,"In times of crisis and catastrophe, children are often forced to grow up quickly. We are now witnessing this premature call to action on a planetary scale. As the adults in government accelerate their consumption of fossil fuels, children are leading the campaign against our species’ looming extinction. Our survival now depends on the prospects for a global movement to follow their lead and demand an International Green New Deal. Several countries have proposed their own versions of a Green New Deal. Here in Europe, DiEM25 and our European Spring coalition are campaigning under the banner of a detailed Green New Deal agenda. In the UK, a new campaign is pushing similar legislation with MPs such as Caroline Lucas and Clive Lewis. And in the US, dogged activists in the Sunrise Movement are working with representatives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push their proposal to the front of the political agenda. But these campaigns have largely remained siloed. Their advisers may exchange notes and ideas, but no strategy has emerged to coordinate these campaigns in a broader, global framework. Unfortunately, climate change knows no borders. The US may be the second-largest polluter in the world, but it makes up less than 15% of global greenhouse emissions. Leading by example is simply not enough. Instead, we need an International Green New Deal: a pragmatic plan to raise $8tn – 5% of global GDP – each year, coordinate its investment in the transition to renewable energy and commit to providing climate protections on the basis of countries’ needs, rather than their means. Call it the Organization for Emergency Environmental Cooperation – the namesake of the original OEEC 75 years ago. While many US activists find inspiration in a “second world war-style mobilization”, the International Green New Deal is better modeled by the Marshall plan that followed it. With financial assistance from the US government, 16 countries formed the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), dedicated to rebuilding the infrastructure of a devastated continent and coordinating its supply of energy. But if the original OEEC entrenched an extractive capitalism at Europe’s core –protecting the steel and coal cartel – the new organization for an International Green New Deal can empower communities around the world in a single transformational project. The transnational scope of this mobilization is crucial for three main reasons. The first is production. Recent studies show that, as long as countries cooperate, all continents have the wind, solar and hydropower resources they need in a zero-emissions world. Northern countries and mountainous regions have better access to wind power, while southern lands are better suited to exploiting the sun. An International Green New Deal could exploit these differences and ensure that renewable energy is available to all of them year-round. The second is innovation. Confronting the climate crisis will require more than keeping fossil fuels in the ground. We will also need major scientific breakthroughs to develop renewable sources of energy, adapt existing infrastructure, detoxify our oceans and decarbonize the atmosphere. No country alone can fund the research and development necessary to meet these challenges. The OEEC would pool the brainpower of the global scientific community: a Green Manhattan Project. The third is reparation. For centuries, countries such as the US and the UK have plundered natural resources from around the world and polluted them back out. Less developed nations have been doubly dispossessed: first, of their resource wealth, and second, of their right to a sustainable life – and in the case of many small island developing states, of their very right to exist. An International Green New Deal would redistribute resources to rehabilitate overexploited regions, protect against rising sea levels, and guarantee a decent standard of living to all climate refugees. The UN climate change conferences will not save us from extinction – the demise of the Paris agreement should be evidence enough. These frameworks lock us into prisoners’ dilemmas, in which every country has an incentive to defect on their climate commitments, even if cooperation between them would yield a greater collective good. As long as climate cooperation is framed around sacrifice, it is vulnerable to strongmen like Donald Trump who vow to buck international rules in the name of national interests. The International Green New Deal changes the frame. Rather than pleading for restraint, it sets out a positive-sum vision of international investment, in which the gains from joining in outweigh those to going it alone. This is the strategy that won Franklin D Roosevelt the original New Deal. His plan addressed people who had given up hope and inspired in them the idea that there is an alternative. That there are ways of pressing idle resources into public service. It made sense to the disheartened and offered opportunity to the entrepreneurial. The same is true of the International Green New Deal, which mobilizes public finance to crowd in private investments that, together, fund the $8tn transition. Just like in the original New Deal, public financing will involve a mix of taxes and bond instruments. On the former, we can introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate that is then redistributed on the basis of their sales. On the latter, public investment banks – including the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank – can coordinate the issue of green bonds that the major central banks agree collectively to support in the secondary markets. Suddenly, countries with large trade surpluses will realize they are better able to invest their excess capital if green investments in deficit countries are coordinated under the auspices of an international plan. The positive-sum dynamic will prevail. In this sense, the stakes of the International Green New Deal are not merely environmental. By uniting countries in the project of bottom-up economic transformation – and coercing multinationals to fund their fair share of it – it will also stem the tide of bigotry and xenophobia engulfing the world. “Advanced” capitalist countries today are literally falling apart. In the US, net public investment has fallen below half of one per cent of GDP. Across the eurozone, net public investment has remained below zero for nearly a decade. It is little wonder that political monsters are rising again: just as in the 1930s, the grapes of wrath are ripening and “growing heavy for the vintage”. To revive the liberal democratic project, some pundits have suggested making China into a bogeyman. But the real bogeyman is of our creation: a climate crisis wrought by decades of inaction and underinvestment. To address the true existential threat that we face today, we must reverse the economic policies that brought us to this brink. Austerity means extinction. The promise of an International Green New Deal to is to avoid the pitfalls of cold war politics and unite humanity in the only project capable of preserving a habitable planet. To do this, however, we need a powerful progressive international movement to demand that our leaders begin to act beyond their own borders. Let’s start building it. The children are watching.

2018-07-04T10:00:26Z,Declare energy independence with carbon dividends | Joseph Robertson,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/04/declare-energy-independence-with-carbon-dividends,"Taking action on climate is about a lot more than our energy economy. Climate disruption is the leading threat to our built environment, an accelerant of armed conflict, and a leading cause of mass migration. Its effects intensify and prolong storms, droughts, wildfires, and floods — resulting in the US spending as much on disaster management in 2017 as in the three decades from 1980 to 2010. Fiscal conservatism and national security require a smart, focused, effective solution that protects our economy and our values. Political division between the major parties in Washington has left the burden of achieving that solution largely on Democratic administrations using regulatory measures that — for all their smart design and ambition — cannot be transformational enough to carry us through to a livable future. Conservatives say the nation needs an insurance policy. Business leaders want to future-proof their operations and investments. Young people are demanding intervention on the scale of the Allies’ efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II. The International Monetary Fund — whose mission is to ensure national dysfunction doesn’t undermine the solvency of public budgets and lead to failed states — warns that nations that depend heavily on publicly subsidized fossil fuels are endangering their future solvency by investing in a way that destroys future economic resilience. Resilience intelligence requires diversification and innovation on a massive scale. The rapid expansion of green bonds is making clear the deep need for clean economy holdings among major banks and institutional investors. Climate-smart finance, still a new concept, is expected to be the standard for both public and private-sector actors at all levels within 10 to 20 years. Republican former Secretaries of the Treasury James Baker and George Shultz have called for a carbon dividends strategy, because: it avoids new regulation, it abides by conservative principles of market efficiency, and it leverages improvements to the Main Street economy to ensure a future of real energy freedom. Unpaid-for pollution and climate disruption limit our personal freedom and then, by adding cost and risk to the whole economy, undermine our collective ability to defend our freedom and secure future prosperity. Even with record oil and gas production, the US still depends heavily on foreign regimes hostile to democracy that manipulate supply and undermine the efficiency of our everyday economy. Energy freedom means reliable, everywhere-active low-cost clean energy, answering the call of expanded Main Street economic activity. Ask any small business owner if they would rather have higher or lower hidden business costs built into everything they buy from their suppliers. Of course, they would prefer lower hidden costs and risks, and for consumers to have more money in their pockets. That is how carbon dividends work. A simple, upstream fee, paid at the source by any entity that wants to sell polluting fuels that carry such hidden costs and risk. This is administratively simple, light-touch, economy-wide, and fair to all. 100% of the revenues from that fee are returned to households in equal shares, every month. This ensures the Main Street economy keeps humming along. Because both the fee and the dividend steadily rise, pollution-dependent businesses — and the banks that finance them — can see the optimal rate of innovation and diversification to liberate themselves from the subsidized pollution trap. The whole economy becomes more competitive and more efficient at delivering real-world value to Main Street. To ensure energy intensive trade-exposed industries are not drawn away by other nations keeping carbon fuels artificially cheap, a simple border carbon adjustment ensures a level playing field, while adding negotiating power to US diplomatic efforts, on every issue everywhere. The result is a steady shift in new investment to practices that are more competitive on a level playing field. With the flow of dividend dollars through local economies, lawmakers can concretely leverage good policy to motivate new investment and job creation, without having to build “bridges to nowhere.” Banks will either lead or follow, but it is certain that when investment in local economies and energy innovation are both more efficient than they are now, finance at all levels will go to work on that trend. Trillions of dollars in subsidies for the old economy will be freed up to support expansion of the new economy. New opportunities for industrial production of clean energy devices, electric vehicle infrastructure, battery storage, smart grids and related services, will ensure under-served communities in both rural and urban areas will draw new investment and locally rooted job creation. There is no faster way to reduce emissions while driving investment into the creation of millions of new jobs. There is no more economically efficient way to ensure the 21st century energy innovation economy reaches major cities, heavy industry, and also “the last mile,” where conventional infrastructure has always been hardest to fund. The shortest route to American energy freedom and climate solvency is through a clear-headed, high-efficiency carbon dividends strategy.

2018-05-16T10:47:03Z,"UK must secure billions in investment to meet climate targets, MPs warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/uk-must-secure-billions-in-investment-to-meet-climate-targets-mps-warn,"Investment in the UK’s low-carbon economy has fallen dramatically, endangering jobs and putting in doubt the government’s commitments on climate change, an influential committee of MPs has warned. Funds going into renewable energy, the mainstay of the low-carbon economy, fell more than 50% in 2017, having dropped by 10% in 2016, bringing annual investment in the sector to its lowest since the financial crisis in 2008. The environmental audit committee (EAC) said on Wednesday that the government would be unable to meet its pledges on carbon emission reductions, if the collapse continued. The MPs also said the government was failing to implement policies to cut emissions from transport, heating and industry, and called on ministers to consider raising a “sovereign green bond”, as other countries have done, in order to stimulate investment. The criticisms come even as the government has boasted of a clean growth strategy, and a 25-year environmental plan that will address climate change along with other green priorities such as pollution and biodiversity. Mary Creagh, chair of the EAC, said: “The clean growth strategy was long on aspiration, short on detail. The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the [billions of pounds of] investment required to meet the UK’s climate change targets, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its strategy.” Cuts to taxpayer-funded support for renewable projects, along with planning obstacles that have effectively ruled out new onshore wind turbines across much of the country, have deterred energy companies and their financial backers. The market for energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, has also seen a sharp decline since the government scrapped its flagship policy, and the Green Investment Bank was sold off. Alex White, senior policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, said: “There are willing investors in the green economy, but not enough projects to invest in. Boosting the pipeline of green infrastructure projects will be critical to meet the UK’s environmental goals and should be the first priority in green finance. Policy detail is key [for investors].” Alongside the EAC report, researchers and NGOs have called for a “greening” of the Bank of England, to meet carbon targets and encourage clean growth. Positive Money, a thinktank, called for the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to have to take the risks of climate change into account in making its decisions, a controversial recommendation that would require wide reviews of how climate change could make an impact on inflation. The report, A Green Bank of England, also suggested that the Bank of England should be given a specific remit on environmental sustainability, which would affect its decisions and advice to government, and should no longer buy bonds issued by fossil fuel companies. Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisors, said linking the Bank of England’s work to climate change was essential, as was linking the performance of other government departments on the issue. “We have compartmentalised our reactions to climate change – we say, we have a minister for this, so the secretary of state for health or the chancellor do not think they have responsibility for it.” He said: “The Bank of England can make a huge difference by using its own direct powers, and by influencing [others].” He was backed up by Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow secretary for international trade, who said: “We have to make it clear to the Bank of England that it is given a specific remit to deal with these issues, not to limit its activity to more conventional banking activity.” The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has repeatedly warned of the risks of climate change to the financial sector, and the need for action by companies, investors, government and regulators to ensure the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy happens beneficially, rather than by shocks to the finance system. Sovereign green bonds, recommended by the EAC, are financial borrowing instruments issued by governments to raise cash for environmental improvement projects, with part of the return on the projects going to market investors. They enable governments to take advantage of the low interest rates on borrowing available to them, while investors are attracted by the relatively low levels of risk. Poland made a bond issue in 2016, with Belgium following suit this year, and countries around the world from Nigeria to Indonesia have also entered the market. The Bank of England would have to take the lead in issuing such bonds in the UK. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it would respond to the EAC proposals in due course. A spokeswoman said: “We’re committed to meeting our climate change targets and will have invested £2.5bn in low-carbon innovations by 2021.”",Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; UK news; Energy; Environment; Energy industry; Business; Green Investment Bank,Environment
2018-04-02T10:00:08Z,"On climate change, zero-sum thinking doesn't work | Joseph Robertson",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/02/on-climate-change-zero-sum-thinking-doesnt-work,"Democracy is not a zero-sum game. Behaving as if it is degrades democratic process and our personal political sovereignty. A zero-sum game is a contest for control of finite resources. Whatever one gains, another must lose. When two or more candidates compete for a single public office, only one can win, so many people view politics as bloodsport, applying “winner takes all” thinking to everything political. But elected officials are not conquerors; they are sworn servants to all their constituents. The beating heart of a free society is the guarantee of personal political sovereignty, safeguarded by transparent institutions, checks and balances, and a free press. Political sovereignty is informational sovereignty. Disinformation disempowers. Distortion of our informational environment has slowed humanity’s overall effort to eliminate corruption and transcend harmful practices, like those that destabilize Earth’s climate. What corrosive hyper-partisanship misses is that human intelligence, creative collaboration, and adherence to basic principles of fairness, make more good possible and so result in real value added — throughout the system, for the benefit of everyone. Success requires dealing ably with complexity. Neurons in the human brain organize themselves into vast 7-dimensional sandcastle structures — flashes of consciousness that emerge and disappear in millionths of a second. Brains are organic synaptic networks. More connections mean more possibilities – more “going on.” Bigger, more complex constellations of neural-attentive cohesion are effectively a bigger landscape for thoughtful attention, recall and imagination — an expanded, diversified space for figuring out what needs figuring. Zero-sum thinking strips intelligence from our politics. Generative thinking recognizes that complex constructive interactions make us smarter, more capable, freer, and more secure. At the human scale, we naturally demand trustworthy generative value-building be an organic part of our experience. If we are informationally sovereign, we can scale up smart decision-making to correct hidden market failures and expand routine access to increased value for everyone. To distort and disrupt climate and energy decision-making, carbon polluters spent hundreds of millions of dollars over several decades. Their aim was to degrade the sovereignty of voters, consumers, rivals in the innovation space, the free press, and even nation states. Such corrosive behaviors have undermined the competitiveness of polluting industries, making outdated methods appear longer lived than they stand a real chance of being, even as they build up unprecedented, nonlinear carbon liability. Market forces will eventually stop rewarding ever more costly carbon-intensive practices that put irreplaceable natural life-supports at risk. • In 2017, the United States spent as much in disaster relief — for floods, wildfires, drought, and storms — as the total comparable spending from 1980 to 2010. • We now have scalable clean power-generating technologies, cost-effective industrial-scale and in-home battery storage, and rapidly expanding clean finance. • In many places, wind and solar are now cheaper than coal, and distributed energy production systems are supported by decentralized information networks. • Entrepreneurs are learning to empower communities to share surplus clean energy amongst themselves, overruling the market dominance of fuel-burning power plants. The practice of depending on society (and natural systems) to absorb unaffordable costs of doing business generates massive structural debt — investment risk and secondary liability built into the structure of the economy. Soon, markets may have access to high-precision calculations of such costs, in near real time. There is no reason for such risky business models, or corrupt institutions, to continue to undermine humanity’s ability to solve big problems. • We are now witnessing the rise of high-efficiency climate-smart finance to drive new investment and innovation in many sectors. • The mainstreaming of green bonds and application of smart carbon pricing policies will make the whole economy more efficient at building value for people, institutions, and enterprise. • High-resolution Earth systems science and new data technologies will soon allow us to acquire actionable resilience intelligence at both the planetary and human scales. The work of making a better, freer, more livable world is in our hands. We owe it to each other, and to those who will come after us, to go beyond zero-sum thinking, out-maneuver corrosive political actors, and build new value wherever human ingenuity allows.

2018-03-19T07:00:26Z,"Water shortages could affect 5bn people by 2050, UN report warns",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/19/water-shortages-could-affect-5bn-people-by-2050-un-report-warns,"More than 5 billion people could suffer water shortages by 2050 due to climate change, increased demand and polluted supplies, according to a UN report on the state of the world’s water. The comprehensive annual study warns of conflict and civilisational threats unless actions are taken to reduce the stress on rivers, lakes, aquifers, wetlands and reservoirs. The World Water Development Report – released in drought-hit Brasília – says positive change is possible, particularly in the key agricultural sector, but only if there is a move towards nature-based solutions that rely more on soil and trees than steel and concrete. “For too long, the world has turned first to human-built, or ‘grey’, infrastructure to improve water management. In doing so, it has often brushed aside traditional and indigenous knowledge that embraces greener approaches,” says Gilbert Houngbo, the chair of UN Water, in the preface of the 100-page assessment. “In the face of accelerated consumption, increasing environmental degradation and the multi-faceted impacts of climate change, we clearly need new ways of manage competing demands on our freshwater resources.” Humans use about 4,600 cubic km of water every year, of which 70% goes to agriculture, 20% to industry and 10% to households, says the report, which was launched at the start of the triennial World Water Forum. Global demand has increased sixfold over the past 100 years and continues to grow at the rate of 1% each year. This is already creating strains that will grow by 2050, when the world population is forecast to reach between 9.4 billion and 10.2 billion (up from 7.7 billion today), with two in every three people living in cities. Demand for water is projected to rise fastest in developing countries. Meanwhile, climate change will put an added stress on supplies because it will make wet regions wetter and dry regions drier. Drought and soil degradation are already the biggest risk of natural disaster, say the authors, and this trend is likely to worsen. “Droughts are arguably the greatest single threat from climate change,” it notes. The challenge has been most apparent this year in Cape Town, where residents face severe restrictions as the result of a once-in-384-year drought. In Brasília, the host of the forum, close to 2m people have their taps turned off once in every five days due to a unusually protracted dry period. By 2050, the report predicts, between 4.8 billion and 5.7 billion people will live in areas that are water-scarce for at least one month each year, up from 3.6 billion today, while the number of people at risk of floods will increase to 1.6 billion, from 1.2 billion. In drought belts encompassing Mexico, western South America, southern Europe, China, Australia and South Africa, rainfall is likely to decline. The shortage cannot be offset by groundwater supplies, a third of which are already in distress. Nor is the construction of more dams and reservoirs likely to be a solution, because such options are limited by silting, runoff and the fact that most cost-effective and viable sites in developed countries have been identified. Water quality is also deteriorating. Since the 1990s, pollution has worsened in almost every river in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and it is expected to deteriorate further in the coming two decades, mainly due to agriculture runoffs of fertiliser and other agrochemicals that load freshwater supplies with nutrients that lead to the growth of pathogens and choking algae blooms. Industry and cities are also a significant problem. About 80% of industrial and municipal wastewater is discharged without treatment. Crucially, the report emphasises a shift away from watershed management towards a wider geographic approach that takes in land use in distant areas, particularly forests. Although farmers have long seen trees as a drain on water supplies, the authors recognise more recent studies that show vegetation helps to recycle and distribute water. This was apparent in the São Paulo drought of 2014-15, which the city’s water authorities and scientists have linked to Amazon deforestation. The key for change will be agriculture, the biggest source of water consumption and pollution. The report calls for “conservation agriculture”, which would make greater use of rainwater rather than irrigation and regularise crop rotation to maintain soil cover. This would also be crucial to reverse erosion and degradation, which currently affects a third of the planet’s land, a different UN study found last year. Perhaps the most positive message of the report is that the potential savings of such practices exceed the projected increase in global demand for water, which would ease the dangers of conflict and provide better livelihoods for family farmers and poverty reduction. Nature-based solutions can be personal – such as dry toilets – or broad landscape-level shifts in agricultural practices. The report contains several positive case studies that show how environments and supplies can improve as a result of policy changes. In Rajasthan, more than 1,000 drought-stricken villages were supported by small-scale water harvesting structures, while a shift back towards traditional soil preservation practices in the Zarqa basin in Jordan are credited with a recovery of water quality in local springs. The authors stress the goal is not to replace all grey infrastructure, because there are situations where there is no other choice, for example in building reservoirs to supply cities with water. But they urge greater take-up of green solutions, which are often more cost-effective as well as sustainable. They also encourage more use of “green bonds” (a form of financing that aims to reward long-term sustainable investments) and more payments for ecosystem services (cash for communities that conserve forests, rivers and wetlands that have a wider benefit to the the environment and society). Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of Unesco, which commissioned the report, noted two-thirds of the world’s forests and wetlands have been lost since the turn of the 20th century – a trend that needs to be addressed. “We all know that water scarcity can lead to civil unrest, mass migration and even to conflict within and between countries,” she said. “Ensuring the sustainable use of the planet’s resources is vital for ensuring long-term peace and prosperity.” The World Water Forum is the biggest single gathering of policymakers, businesses and NGOs involved in water management. It is being held in the southern hemisphere for the first time, and is expected to draw 40,000 participants. Among them are indigenous and other grassroots activists who believe the event is too close to government, agriculture and business. They are staging an alternative forum in Brasília that puts greater emphasis on community management of water as a free public resource.",Water; Access to water; Environment; Global development; Unesco; United Nations; World news,Environment
