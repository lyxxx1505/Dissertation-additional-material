2024-10-13T06:00:46Z,‘Very concerning’: BP dilutes net zero targets as global retreat from green standards gathers pace,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/13/very-concerning-bp-dilutes-net-zero-targets-as-global-retreat-from-green-standards-gathers-pace,"In early 2020, Bernard Looney had one clear goal as the incoming chief executive of BP: to convince the world to see the oil company differently. For a time, he did exactly that. In a glossy, high-concept London campaign launch, the BP boss set out 10 new aims for the company, the most significant being BP’s transformation to a net zero energy company by 2050. Within months, he reinforced the rebranding with a pledge to cut the company’s oil and gas production by 40% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade. At the time, his strategy even won the approval of Greenpeace – a feat few oil executives can boast. But by early 2023, BP had watered down the 40% cut to a 25% reduction after the war in Ukraine caused oil prices to surge, doubling the company’s profits. Within months, its greenest ever chief executive was ousted from the company amid revelations about undisclosed relationships with colleagues. His green plans have followed suit. It emerged last week that BP plans to abandon its curbs on fossil fuel production in favour of targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. The news angered climate campaigners, but surprised very few. BP’s green retreat has arguably been the most brazen in the industry – from a grandstanding green agenda to a fresh focus on fossil fuels – but the backtrack from environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is gaining pace among the world’s biggest companies and investors. The term ESG was first coined by the UN in a 2004 report entitled Who Cares Wins. It provided companies and investors with a model for implementing the ideals of responsible investing in their spending plans. By 2015, the idea of ESG had evolved from being a talking point to a set of standards which could, and should, be measured. But in recent years, companies and investors in the US and Europe have begun to chafe at the requirements to disclose their ESG credentials, and retreated from the commitments themselves – often to protect their profits. BP’s oil industry rival Shell signalled earlier this year that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. Shell has also backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling”, which involves breaking down plastic polymers into tiny molecules that can be made into synthetic fuels or new plastics. It promised to use 1m tonnes of this recycled plastic in its global petrochemicals plants, but later admitted the plan was “unfeasible”. Oil companies are not alone in scaling down their green promises. Volkswagen has quietly dropped a voluntary target to cut CO2₂ emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 30% between 2015 and 2025 in favour of making the same cuts between 2018 and 2030. And Unilever – the conglomerate that owns brands including Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Vaseline, and which is widely credited with pioneering the ESG movement – signalled earlier this year that it would abandon or water down a string of ESG pledges amid a growing backlash from investors and politicians. “It’s a very concerning trend,” said Lewis Johnston, director of policy at the responsible investment organisation ShareAction. “In general, we have seen quite a concerted and organised pushback against some of the principles of responsible investment. It’s a very different philosophy of what generates long-term value.” As recently as 2021, the world’s biggest investors counted ESG principles as important hallmarks of a sound investment. The US investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard voted in favour of almost half of all shareholder ESG resolutions proposed in 2021. But since then they have dramatically withdrawn their support following a fierce political backlash. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, legislators in Texas and other critics of ESG escalated the stakes in late 2022 by collectively pulling billions of dollars in state funds from BlackRock. The investment group’s support for ESG measures has since plummeted. BlackRock has confirmed that in the 12 months to the end of June 2024, it supported only 20 of the 493 environmental and social proposals put forward by shareholders at the annual meetings of the firms in which it invests. This represents just 4% of ESG proposals, compared with 47% three years ago. Vanguard supported none of the 400 environmental or social shareholder proposals that it considered in the 2024 US proxy shareholder season, saying they were “overly prescriptive”, unnecessary or did not relate to material financial risks. Gemma Woodward, the head of responsible investment at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, highlighted the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a tipping point in the trend against ESG. “We saw a real turn in the market where value came back into fashion, and so we saw an ‘easing of the pedal’ of the interest in [ESG],” she said. “I’m very worried, obviously … I guess the problem we’ve got is that we don’t have a global standard.” However, BP and Shell still looked “pretty good” compared with oil companies in the US, where there was an even bigger backlash against ESG, Woodward said. US banks JP Morgan and State Street pulled out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group, which pushes for change from big greenhouse gas emitters, this year. “It’s certainly at its most extreme in the US,” Johnston said. “But we’re not immune to it in the UK or in Europe.” Last summer, the EU confirmed plans to water down the final rules for corporate ESG disclosures through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The move comes after European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to cut red tape across the EU executive’s work to counter complaints from big companies over the mounting cost of environmental rules. Under the new rules, companies will have more flexibility to decide what information is “material” and therefore should be reported, in effect making some disclosures voluntary instead of mandatory. The easing was described by HSBC analysts at the time as a “step back” in ambition and robustness, but a step that may facilitate convergence in sustainability reporting globally. Johnston insisted that climate transition reporting should not be considered yet as another raft of burdensome reporting rules. Instead, he said, it was about making sure companies were aware of both the risks and the opportunities involved in adapting to the climate crisis. “Mandatory [climate] transition plans are a means of empowering companies and positioning the financial system as a whole, and aligning that and the real economy with the transition that we know is coming,” Johnston said. “So I think it’s absolutely wrong to look at this as merely another regulatory burden, because it really isn’t … It’s about imposing discipline and making sure that companies are preparing for what they should be doing, and that’s, again, responsible stewardship.”",Corporate governance; BP; Ethical business; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Commodities; Business,Business
2025-02-18T00:01:51Z,"Support for ESG proposals at record low driven by US investors, report shows",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/18/support-for-esg-proposals-at-record-low-driven-by-us-investors-report-shows,"Support for shareholder proposals aimed at tackling environmental and social risks hit a record low last year, figures show, amid a “worrying retreat” by investors, particularly in the US. A report compiled by the responsible investment campaign group ShareAction found that, out of 279 environmental, social and governance (ESG) shareholder resolutions put forward at annual general meetings last year in the UK, Europe and the US, only four – or 1.4% – secured majority support. It marks a sharp decline from recent years, having dropped from 21% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, and 3% in 2023. However, it also reflects a severe drop in support for ESG issues in the US, where rightwing activists and politicians have targeted financial firms for supporting climate and diversity policies. Policymakers in Donald Trump’s administration are encouraging a retreat from environmental policies, in favour of support for oil and gas production. The shift has prompted six of the largest banks in the US – Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – to withdraw from the UN-sponsored net-zero banking alliance in recent weeks. Trump has also used executive orders to reverse diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies in the federal government and is trying to apply them to the private sector. Companies including the Google owner, Alphabet and the Facebook owner, Meta, as well as the financial firms Deloitte and Goldman Sachs, have started to roll back their own DEI policies in response. Shareholder resolutions are usually put forward by campaigners and activists trying to force company directors to address issues including their climate impact, potential human rights abuses, diversity and inclusion policies, and executive pay. While those resolutions are not legally binding, they can put pressure on the board to take action. ShareAction’s Voting Matters report illustrates the growing divide between asset managers on either side of the Atlantic, with those in the UK and Europe supporting 81% of shareholder ESG proposals on average last year, compared with US peers, who supported just 25% of proposals last year. It also highlighted the lack of support by the world’s four largest asset managers: BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard. The firms, which are US-headquartered and together manage $23tn (£18tn) in assets, collectively supported just 7% of shareholder resolutions in 2024. “This is the worst result we’ve seen from asset managers in the six years we’ve been monitoring their voting performance and shows a worrying retreat from ambition when it’s most needed,” said Claudia Gray, head of financial sector research at ShareAction. “We live in a world where asset managers have a huge impact through the companies they invest in. Many claim to be playing their part in tackling important issues like climate change, yet our report calls into question whether the majority of the world’s wealth is being managed effectively by investment firms,” Gray added. The campaign group claimed that, had asset managers thrown their weight behind shareholder resolutions, they could have helped improve conditions for low-paid workers struggling with the global cost-of-living crisis and driven climate action at a time when the impact of the climate crisis is devastating communities worldwide. Just two of the 73 shareholder resolutions focused on climate change received enough shareholder support to pass last year. “At a time when the climate breakdown is already devastating lives around the world – from prolonged droughts to deadly wildfires – the finance sector should be driving urgent environmental action, not slowing it down,” Gray said. “What’s clear is we need better regulation from policymakers and bold leadership and ambition from decision-makers across the financial sector.” Commenting on the ShareAction report, a spokesperson for Vanguard said: “The Vanguard-advised funds vote with an unwavering focus on the long-term interests of fund investors, in accordance with their published proxy voting policies.” A spokesperson for BlackRock said its voting decisions “are based on the long-term financial interests of our clients. For the 2024 proxy year, we found that most environmental and social shareholder proposals were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or were unlikely to promote long-term shareholder value.” It noted that clients had the power to cast votes themselves, including in favour of shareholder resolutions.

2025-06-23T15:00:18Z,AustralianSuper criticised for buying up shares in Whitehaven Coal while claiming to be committed to net zero,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/24/australiansuper-criticised-for-buying-up-shares-in-whitehaven-coal-while-claiming-to-be-committed-to-net-zero-ntwnfb,"A major Australian superannuation fund is under fire for substantially increasing its investment in the coal company Whitehaven, and being on the brink of becoming its biggest backer, while still claiming to be committed to reaching net zero emissions. Shareholder advocacy groups said AustralianSuper was moving against the trend of its peers with recent share purchases in the company, which they said were “flying in the face of environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments”. Clean energy finance organisation Market Forces said the super fund was “on the precipice” of becoming Whitehaven Coal’s largest investor, with shares worth about $395m. Recent disclosures by Whitehaven, first reported by the Australian Financial Review, reveal AustralianSuper now owns 70.9m shares in the company, or 8.47% of shares on issue, after the recent purchases. AustralianSuper is the second-largest shareholder in the coal company and, according to Market Forces, holds nearly triple the combined shares of all of the other top 30 super funds in their default investment options, based on the latest disclosures effective as at December 2024. Market Forces said “after fully and publicly divesting from the company in 2020”, AustralianSuper now held its biggest interest in Whitehaven in 10 years. Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter “How on earth can AustralianSuper call itself a responsible investor after buying millions of shares in Whitehaven Coal?” Market Forces’ senior analyst, Brett Morgan, said. “AustralianSuper is backing Whitehaven’s expansion plans, which would result in nearly 5bn tonnes of carbon pollution from burning coal, equivalent to running all of Australia’s coal-fired power stations until 2062.” Morgan said the organisation had been contacted by dozens of AustralianSuper members concerned “that their fund is greenwashing and endangering a safe future for their retirement”. An AustralianSuper spokesperson said the fund remained committed to its long-term goal of net zero by 2050. “Whitehaven’s acquisition of BHP’s metallurgical coal assets changed the company’s revenue profile and made it a more attractive investment given their importance in steel making,” the spokesperson said. Metallurgical coal is used primarily to make steel while thermal coal is primarily used for electricity generation. “The energy transition is not linear, which means thermal coal will be an important stabilising source of electricity for the grid for some time to come, both domestically and overseas.” But Naomi Hogan, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said climate-aware investors across the superannuation sector had been making an effort on ESG and emissions reductions and “this AustralianSuper move is going against the trend of its peers”. “Metallurgical coal investing cannot be used to shield against scrutiny of coal,” Hogan said. “Last year ACCR published research based on a global survey of 500 investors in the steel value chain, which found that 80% of investor respondents believe metallurgical coal’s risk profile will increase in the next decade.” Hogan said AustralianSuper, having previously “talked up” the importance of its companies aligning with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, now has a “huge amount of work ahead to bring [Whitehaven’s] emissions into line”. “ACCR will be looking closely at AustralianSuper’s disclosures outlining its ESG risk assessment of this investment,” she said.",Superannuation; Energy; Business; Climate crisis; Environment; Australia news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Coal; Fossil fuels; Energy,Australia news
2025-08-10T17:25:28Z,The Guardian view on climate finance: crumbling under a second Trump presidency | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-finance-crumbling-under-a-second-trump-presidency,"Earlier this month, as Nordic countries were hit with an unprecedented heatwave and wildfires in the US began spurting “fire clouds”, Barclays pulled out of the net zero banking alliance. The story may have seemed less alarming than extreme weather, but it has existential implications, as the finance sector quietly surrenders its former climate commitments. The initiative forms part of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a voluntary network of banks that Mark Carney, formerly the UN’s special envoy on climate action and now Canada’s prime minister, launched in 2021. At the time, the alliance, which encourages banks and asset managers to work towards the goals of the Paris agreement, seemed like an optimistic step in the right direction. Mr Carney described it as a “breakthrough”. But times change. The election of Donald Trump, whose advisers have waged war on “climate fanaticism” and “woke” capitalism, has created an environment of impunity where businesses no longer need to even pay lip service to progress. Fossil fuel companies donated $19m to Mr Trump’s inauguration fund. So far, their investment has paid off. Mr Trump has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, used an “invented” energy emergency to justify the expansion of fossil fuels, opened public lands to drilling, and plans to cut funding for renewable energy. With America reneging on climate action, businesses may feel they can relax. Barclays is the second British bank to leave the net zero alliance after HSBC quit earlier this year. Six of the largest US banks quit just weeks before Mr Trump’s inauguration. Some institutions have come under direct pressure from the right: BlackRock left the net zero asset managers initiative, another GFANZ group, after it was sued by Republicans who claimed its promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals had cut coal production. In each of his annual investor letters from 2020 to 2024, BlackRock’s chair, Larry Fink, namechecked climate change. His 2025 letter made no mention of it. The deterioration of GFANZ reveals the weaknesses in relying on businesses to do the right thing. Its goals were always fuzzy: instead of calling for hard limits on the financing of fossil fuels, GFANZ encouraged banks to invest in low-carbon sectors. It has since drifted further from its mission, expanding its membership to companies without net zero commitments. Though it was never supposed to be a substitute for government action, inactive governments welcomed it. Boris Johnson, prime minister at the time of its creation, promised the alliance would help to “build back greener”. Many green finance initiatives have less to do with preventing climate breakdown than minimising investors’ exposure to the risks this creates, such as carbon taxes or curbs on fossil fuels. “Green ethical investing”, writes Adrienne Buller, is a way of betting “on the likelihood of a greener economy, rather than contribute to bringing that economy into being”. When the risk of regulation wanes, as it has under Trump, so too does the impetus for this style of investing. The lesson is that government action (and inaction) will determine the severity of the climate crisis. Governments need to prohibit fossil fuel extraction, reduce profits through progressive carbon taxes, support renewables and confront powerful interests. The myth that businesses are capable of self-policing has led to a dangerous delay.",Green economy; Environment; Mark Carney; World news; Climate crisis; Barclays; Banking; Business; Donald Trump,Opinion
2025-03-06T13:07:51Z,"Treat weapons investments as ‘ethical’ to help arm Ukraine and UK, MPs urge",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/06/investment-weapons-manufacturers-arms-esg-defence-spending-ukraine-uk,"Banks, investors and pension funds should treat weapons manufacturers as “ethical” investments so that more money goes to the industry to arm Ukraine and the UK, according to a group of more than 100 Labour MPs and peers. Ninety-six MPs and six peers have signed an open letter calling for financial businesses to “sweep away ill-considered anti-defence rules which are acting as a barrier to doing what is right”, in another sign of the backlash against environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies. Donald Trump’s talks with Russia and denial of US military aid and intelligence to Ukraine this week have prompted a scramble by European countries to boost defence spending. Keir Starmer has said the UK will increase spending to 2.5% of GDP, up from 2.3%, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has pledged a raise, while Germany’s incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, wants to loosen strict debt rules to fund an increase. On Thursday the Italian defence group Leonardo announced a deal with the Turkish drone-maker Baykar to try to rapidly increase the manufacture of unmanned weapons for Ukraine within Europe. Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo’s chief executive, told the Financial Times Trump’s verbal “attacks” on Europe had given the region “an unprecedented sense of urgency” to spend more on defence. The Labour politicians who signed the letter argued that ESG rules adopted by some institutions have held back defence spending, echoing a longstanding gripe from weapons company bosses. However, it is unclear whether ESG rules have held back investment in defence companies. The industry’s stock market value has soared in recent weeks in anticipation of higher spending. The market value of BAE Systems, the British maker of weapons ranging from shells to fighter jets and submarines, has nearly tripled since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. The huge share-price surge of Rolls-Royce, which makes fighter jet engines and submarine reactors, has also benefited from increased defence spending, while the valuations of the British plane parts maker Melrose and the military services company Babcock International have more than doubled since the start of Russia’s invasion. The peers who signed the letter included George Robertson, a former Nato secretary general who is working on a strategic defence review for Labour. “There can be no more ethical investment than giving the Ukrainian people every ounce of support that can be mustered by their allies,” the letter said. The letter was led by Alex Baker, MP for Aldershot, known as the home of the British army because it is the site of a major garrison. Baker won Aldershot for Labour in last year’s general election for the first time since the seat was created in 1918. That highlighted the scale of the landslide victory, but also the party’s renewed support for the armed forces. Starmer has been a keen proponent of the UK defence sector. His predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was much more critical of weapons spending after a career campaigning against arms exports to countries accused of humans rights abuses. Baker said: “The businesses I speak to in Aldershot and Farnborough are ready to step up and help deliver the new defence capabilities this moment demands – but badly composed ESG rules are stifling the innovation we need to fire up our industrial base.” Emily Apple, from the UK-based Campaign Against the Arms Trade, said the manufacturers who would benefit from relaxing ESG rules “make vast profits from death and destruction across the world”.",Investing; Arms trade; Defence policy; Stock markets; Politics; Europe; UK news; Business,Business
2025-07-07T10:19:42Z,Like looking in a mirror: how HR data and AI can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility,https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/how-hr-data-and-ai-support-corporate-social-responsibility,"Businesses have had to get to grips with a range of new criteria in recent years that reflect more socially conscious goals, impacts and metrics. These are often lumped together under the acronym ESG, which refers to environmental, social and governance factors. They might incorporate these criteria for regulatory purposes or simply to better manage their business risks – whether it’s physical risks from the impact of climate breakdown, financial risks, or risks to their reputation. When it comes to ESG, the environmental and governance factors have typically been more measurable. You can count your carbon emissions and you can measure how much waste you produce. Similarly, you can set up governance frameworks and follow best practice. But the S part of the acronym has always been trickier to quantify. This is partly because of a lack of objective and comparable data. Likewise, social factors have often been regarded as subjective and malleable – contingent upon changing social attitudes and individuals’ personal lived experiences. They also vary from company to company and across geographies – taking in everything from diversity and pay disparities to relationships with stakeholder groups, corporate stances on contentious issues and volunteering. Organisations often don’t know where to start, even if they want to do the right thing. But despite being difficult to get a grasp of, social responsibility can’t be ignored. Companies now need to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements, such as the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and European sustainability reporting standards. Moreover, they might also have to meet the requirements of their own business partners in their supply chains, who may stipulate social disclosure and reporting. They also need to think about how they are viewed by potential new hires. Younger people, in particular, increasingly want to work for businesses that align with their own values. Social responsibility is therefore part of being an employer of choice. While it can be confusing terrain to navigate, data can provide clarity. As the adage goes: what gets measured, gets managed. Given that so many social criteria relate to the welfare of a company’s employees, having a robust and dynamic HR platform can help. These platforms provide companies with a wealth of objective data, from deeper insights into the diversity of their workforce to pay gaps at different management levels and social responsibility initiatives. Steve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at software company Sage, says high-quality HR data can be a bit like looking in the mirror for a business. It can really help you understand what your culture means, what you stand for as a business, where you’re going, and what you need to do to get there. “This really helps when you are trying to attract and retain the best people,” he notes. This can make it easier for businesses to do everything from meeting disclosure requirements to demonstrating community engagement. Of course, all this data still needs to be sifted in order to generate useful insights. Kaustubh Sevak, a principal solutions consultant at Sage, says businesses have often struggled with this. “Traditionally, companies will take all of this data, and it’ll take a team of analysts a week to actually come up with some insights or nuggets on what that data actually is.” Now, he says, companies can take advantage of what Sage calls a “workforce intelligence offering”. “This is where AI and machine learning-led statistical analysis is really powerful, because it’s bringing those insights to HR at the click of a button. HR practitioners can look at whatever data points are important to them in the jurisdiction that they want to restrict it to, and in a couple of clicks they get real-time insights.” This is particularly important when it comes to dealing with different disclosure requirements across different countries or geographical territories. It also enables multinational businesses to integrate data from different territories with different HR policies. There are many other ways that a high-quality HR platform can make it easier for businesses to comply with disclosure requirements. They can provide transparency about company policies, and also the methodology companies use to measure its performance against ESG criteria – which is particularly important given that some ESG reporting regulations require information about how the data was calculated. Moreover, a good HR platform can provide all this required data in one place that’s easy to access and collate. Lampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at Sage, notes how the company’s all-in-one HR and payroll platform, Sage People, can combine HR data insights with responses to employee surveys. “You can use Sage People to gather data on the social side of things and share it with whoever needs it,” he says. “You might, for example, ask staff if enough is being done to support wellbeing or volunteering, or you could look at the backgrounds of new hires – and this could be reported or shared with regulatory bodies.” Data can also be used to help companies improve their own performance and reach their internal social objectives. One Sage People customer has incorporated social mobility data into KPIs (key performance indicators). The idea here is that you can cascade a top-level goal down the organisation and use data to see how employees are contributing to achieving it and what more needs to be done. Sekliziotis emphasises that this is very much a two-way flow of information. “You could also communicate the sort of social responsibility programmes you are undertaking and ask staff if they’re interested in participating, or report on community collaboration.” Another benefit of the platform is that this communication can be targeted. For instance, it can often make sense, if volunteering news is sent to those closest to the communities it takes place in. “[Employees] can even book volunteering days on the system so that the company knows you’re not booking a day’s holiday and that you’re working in your local foodbank,” says Sekliziotis. An organisation can learn from this data and use it to make improvements. For example, it can look at programmes it has instituted and see what the takeup is. Watmore says that this can be useful when it comes to making comparisons across different parts of a business or across different regions and territories. “Comparative data is useful, but you sometimes need to use it to recognise that all data should be comparative,” he notes. “You can use software to slice and dice it into different regions – and the richer the data is, the more powerful this becomes.” Discover more about how HR data can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility",,Empowering Your Employees
2024-03-05T23:59:35Z,"US banks abandon ‘bare minimum’ environmental standards project, alarming climate groups",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/05/us-banks-leave-esg-finance-climate-crisis,"Four of the world’s biggest banks have left the Equator Principles, a set of minimum industry standards and safeguards for financial institutions to address environmental and social risks in countries where they finance fossil fuel and mining projects. The Equator Principles have been around for more than two decades, and while not enforceable, they provide a basic framework of environmental standards that banks agreed would underpin financing deals on pollution-causing extractive projects. The American banks – Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo – are listed as having left the group of institutions that have signed the principles. The news was condemned by climate groups as “shocking” and “cowardly”. “It is a very troubling move by some of the biggest fossil fuel financing banks in the world to abandon a bare minimum set of standards that banks themselves have set. It is both ethically shocking and financially irresponsible. It is becoming increasingly apparent these banks do not care about anything other than the bottom line,” said Richard Brooks, the climate finance director at Stand.earth. “This is yet another display of cowardice that shows how Wall Street is bending to pressure from climate-denier extremists rather than upholding some of their most basic climate and human rights commitments,” said Adele Shraiman, the Sierra Club’s fossil-free finance campaign senior strategist. Spokespeople for the four banks all said they would continue to be informed by those principles, Reuters reported. But the banks’ names have been removed from the Equator Principles list, which now includes 10 standards for aspects of projects ranging from initial due diligence to grievance mechanisms. The move is part of an alarming trend among banks headquartered in the US of backpedaling on commitments on the climate and to vulnerable communities affected by their financing deals. Republican states have increasingly targeted “woke capitalism” and moved to pass laws to boycott banks and investors that embrace environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was once a vocal champion of ESG, but now talks about “transition investing”. Bank of America has removed explicit bans on financing coal and Arctic drilling projects. JPMorgan Chase has introduced an “energy mix” for calculating its financed emissions, which will include renewable energy and make it harder to assess the environmental impact of projects. The banks’ departure from the environmental standards benchmark is the latest example of major financial services companies leaving corporate environmental initiatives since US Republican politicians started suggesting participation could breach antitrust rules. It’s unclear what impact the withdrawals will have, given that the banks in question are already the biggest funders of oil, gas and coal in the world, investing $1.4tn in fossil fuel projects globally between 2016 and 2022. “The silent retreat from major US banks which are among the biggest financiers of fossil fuels globally from this initiative is deeply concerning,” said Aditi Sen, the climate and energy director at Rainforest Action Network. “It further undermines the rights of frontline and fence-line communities across the world who bear the brunt of impacts from toxic projects.”",Banking; Environment; Business; Bank of America; Citigroup; Wells Fargo; JP Morgan; US news,Business
2025-04-19T07:00:33Z,UK banks expected to win shareholder approval for big pay rises for bosses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/19/uk-banks-expected-to-win-shareholder-approval-for-big-pay-rises-for-bosses,"UK banks are expected to win approval for massive pay increases in the coming weeks after convincing influential shareholder advisers that hiking maximum payouts for chief executives by more than 40% would give them a competitive edge. ISS and Glass Lewis, two prominent proxy advisory services that suggest how shareholders should vote on company policies at annual meeting, have backed NatWest, Barclays and HSBC over plans to substantially increase potential payouts after the removal of the UK banker bonus cap in late 2023. NatWest Group is proposing a 43% increase in the maximum for its chief executive, Paul Thwaite, giving him the chance to earn up to £7.7m for a single year’s work. Meanwhile, his Barclays counterpart, CS Venkatakrishnan, could earn up to £14.3m, a 45% hike, if shareholders approve a new pay policy next month. HSBC is suggesting a 43% increase for Georges Elhedery, for a maximum payout of about £15m. Glass Lewis and ISS said shareholders should be “mindful” of the significant increases, but sided with remuneration committees who argued payouts needed to compete with that offered at rival banks including on Wall Street. That includes JP Morgan, where the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was paid $39m (£29m) last year. “Against these peers, Barclays’ pay proposals are well below market,” ISS said in its report ahead of the bank’s AGM next month. That could make it hard to recruit talented bankers, banks claimed. ISS said it recognised there was an “ongoing discussion on the competitiveness of executive pay in the UK market, especially for companies with a global presence and significant US exposure”. The London Stock Exchange and City lobby groups including the influential UK capital markets industry taskforce (CMIT) have claimed higher pay is key to luring top talent and US businesses to Britain. But NatWest, which does not have an international presence, has also secured the backing of proxy advisers. “We recognise that the company’s incentive opportunity is currently lower than that of its UK banking peers, as it remains the only UK bank that had not previously sought shareholder approval to raise the variable pay cap from 100% to 200% of fixed pay,” Glass Lewis said. NatWest is expected to shake off its remaining government shareholding and fully return to private hands within weeks, making it easier to raise pay. The decision by ISS and Glass Lewis to back the pay increases mark a significant shift in shareholder sentiment, and has also been coupled with a backlash against environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. The focus on ESG prompted a raft of shareholder rebellions over pay in the early 2010s, including at HSBC and Barclays, as investors demanded a more measured approach by company executives after the 2008 financial crisis. But anxieties over the UK’s global standing post-Brexit, as well as Donald Trump’s crackdown on progressive policies such as diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), have led to a significant social shift in corporate culture. ISS has already bowed to pressure over DEI, having said in February it would not recommend voting against any US board members for failing to meet gender and ethnicity leadership targets. Glass Lewis and ISS have also faced pressure from high-profile chief executives including Dimon, who last year said the proxy advisers had too much sway over shareholders, while criticising their foreign ownership structures. Glass Lewis and ISS are owned by Canadian and German firms, respectively. “I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance,” the JP Morgan chief executive said. NatWest will hold its annual meeting on 23 April and HSBC will host its shareholder meeting on 2 May. Barclays’ is scheduled for 7 May.",Banking; Executive pay and bonuses; Business; NatWest Group; Barclays; HSBC; JP Morgan,Business
2025-07-01T05:00:05Z,"To all who think capitalism can drive progressive change, it won’t – and here’s the shocking proof | Polly Toynbee ",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/01/capitalism-drive-progressive-change-aberdeen-inequality,"The axe fell with shocking suddenness. On Thursday Aberdeen Group plc terminated its Financial Fairness Trust without notice and sacked the CEO, Mubin Haq, the chair and all the trustees, leaving eight staff dangling. The company tells me it plans to move in a different direction. That dreaded phrase marks the end of 16 remarkable years, during which the trust sponsored some of the most influential research into inequality and its financial causes. Aberdeen is a wealth management and investment company. I admired its willingness to fund research not in its own immediate interest, but for the sake of social improvement, as a sign that decent capitalism was possible. Now that’s over. The mood has changed. Wildfires started by President Trump are engulfing global companies as his administration attempts to bar asset and retirement plan managers from considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment decisions and targets private sector diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives with executive orders. Companies doing good are at risk. I ask Aberdeen if that’s why it has shut down the trust. It denies it strongly, saying it is just a “natural evolution”. Expect an explosive backlash. Just look at the list of research organisations it has previously given funding to but is now casting off: the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the Resolution Foundation, the Royal United Services Institute, Bright Blue, the New Economics Foundation, the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation (CenTax), the Child Poverty Action Group, the High Pay Centre and Transport for All. It has also funded funeral poverty research by Quaker Social Action and consumer research by Which?. The trust has £3.6m of grants promised, in a field where small sums for social research projects can profoundly affect policy and politics. Paul Johnson, the outgoing IFS director, says this money is “a crucial part of the UK’s research funding infrastructure focused on improving the financial security of those on lower incomes”. He talks ruefully of billions of pounds for scientific research but a pittance for social research. “We have no Large Hadron Colliders.” Aberdeen should beware the swathe of distinguished economists, researchers, academics, public servants, public thinkers and charitable entrepreneurs it has unthinkingly cut off in this political assault. The trust was founded in 2009, using unclaimed assets after the demutualisation of Standard Life, which later merged with Aberdeen Asset Management. Last week, its website shut down instantly, with the misleading notice “Please bear with us and we will aim to resume normal service as quickly as we can”. There will be no normal service. David Norgrove, the summarily sacked chair, is not going quietly. Neither is he someone to be treated so high-handedly. He is a former chair of the UK Statistics Authority, the Pensions Regulator, the Low Pay Commission, the M&amp;S pension fund, the Family Justice Review and more. He is outraged at how the trust was cancelled in a day. “Shoddy behaviour,” he says to me, then adds: “Abrupt, rude, ungracious.” This will, he says, “be damaging to them”. Aberdeen did lose £5bn in net outflows in the first quarter of this year – its share price has somewhat revived since – but says all the funds will still go to charity. I ask if there is a guarantee that the latest £3.6m of grant funding letters will be honoured. The reply is weaselly: “The various funding relationships will be under review and that will include looking at what contractual commitments are in place, so it’s too early to be definitive.” CenTax is a grant recipient left in limbo over the future of its promised three years of funding. This week the trust was about to start on another £2m round: due for grants were the Living Pension Foundation, to sign up 500 companies to join Aviva, L&amp;G and others pledging more livable pensions. The Child Poverty Action Group will now get no funds for an annual forensic review of child poverty strategy, nor will the High Pay Centre receive money for research into remuneration committees that focuses on entire workforces, not just top executives. Why is Aberdeen trashing its reputation? Because times have changed. Doing good is not fashionable in the business world. Johnson says: “I presume some of the trust’s funding is not compatible with Aberdeen. It’s an overreaction to our research on pension tax relief, or the Resolution Foundation’s work in wealth tax reliefs.” Most social research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Nuffield Foundation, but he says after the trust, there are “no significant others”. Aberdeen says the only reason for the change is to divert its funds to a conventional charitable foundation that supports individuals, such as young unemployed people – although this is funding that won’t lead to a larger questioning of social, financial or tax systems. The company is already famous for idiocy – it abolished the Es in its name in 2021 to become the unpronounceable “Abrdn”, claiming it was a “modern, agile, digitally-enabled brand”. Mocked for “irritable vowel syndrome”, it joined disaster rebrands such as Royal Mail’s Consignia and PwC Consulting’s Monday. It makes you question any decisions their boards make. But this is serious. It’s a symptom of darkening business attitudes. Research this month shows that 56% of senior financial professionals in the UK now “believe their leadership will place less focus on ESG principles over the next five years”. WPP, one of the largest media companies in the world, removed all mentions of DEI from its latest annual report. Research by the Observer found that mentions of ESG declined by 22% in last year’s annual reports from FTSE 100 companies. Amazon is scaling back its DEI policy, calling this civilisational regression an “evolution”. Former trustees suggest Aberdeen may have had complaints from clients who hate research about poverty and wealth that exposes unjust tax reliefs for the rich. When I ask, its press officer does admit he sometimes has to tell journalists from the Telegraph and others that Aberdeen Group plc is not responsible for the research its trust may fund: every trust-funded report has a disclaimer saying the trust is entirely independent of the company. This turns out, sadly, not to be true, since Aberdeen can cancel it at whim. This week will mark the launch in Westminster of a trust-funded two-year commission into pensions by the IFS, with the former minister David Gauke chairing its advisory committee and Torsten Bell, the pensions minister and former head of the Resolution Foundation, speaking. The chair of Aberdeen Group, Douglas Flint, who is due to attend, may find himself less in favour than when he was invited to join Labour’s City advisers as part of a financial services review. He lobbies for less regulation of banks, calling the post-financial-crash restrictions ”disproportionate”. If I were him, I wouldn’t dare turn up.

2025-05-18T06:00:26Z,Revealed: European ‘green’ investments hold billions in fossil fuel majors,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/18/revealed-european-green-investments-hold-billions-in-fossil-fuel-majors,"European “green” funds holding more than $33bn of investments in major oil and gas companies have been revealed by an investigation, despite fossil fuels being the root cause of the climate crisis. Some of these investment funds used branding such as Sustainable Global Stars and Europe Climate Pathway. Over $18bn was invested in the five biggest polluters: TotalEnergies, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP. These topped a 2023 Carbon Majors ranking for oil and gas production among shareholder-owned firms. Other investments by funds following EU sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) included those in US fracking company Devon Energy and Canadian tar sands company Suncor, the investigation by Voxeurop and the Guardian found. Investors claim that holding a stake in a company allows them to influence the firm’s pursuit of climate goals. However, no major oil and gas producer has plans consistent with international climate targets and many companies have weakened their plans in the last year, according to a report from Carbon Tracker in April. The investment firms with the biggest stakes in fossil companies in their green funds were JP Morgan, BlackRock and DWS in Germany. The investment companies have not breached the SFDR rules, which do not explicitly rule out some fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said change was needed to avoid people being misled. “For a fund claiming to be ‘green’, holding investments in major fossil fuel companies should be a red line,” said Giorgia Ranzato, sustainable finance manager at Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E). “Since oil majors are not contributing meaningfully to the energy transition, any investment in such companies by a green fund is essentially greenwashing. To effectively combat this, T&amp;E and other organisations advocate for a meaningful review of the SFDR. “It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies,” said Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute. A BlackRock spokesperson said: “BlackRock’s funds are managed in accordance with their investment objectives, that are clearly disclosed in each fund’s prospectus and on BlackRock’s website. Our sustainable funds are managed in line with applicable regulations governing sustainable investing. For investors that have decarbonisation investment objectives we offer a range of products that provide such exposure.” After being contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for asset manager Robeco said its Sustainable Global Stars fund would remove “sustainable” from its name. A spokesperson said the fund had a 20% better CO2 footprint than the market index and that the firm had “productive and intensive engagement” with TotalEnergies. The investigation analysed the ownership in the last quarter of 2024 of the publicly traded fossil fuel companies listed in the Carbon Majors report, using the London Stock Exchange Group Data &amp; Analytics platform. It found $33.5bn held by green funds in 37 large fossil fuel companies. The fossil fuel investments were in funds regulated under SFDR rules, specifically articles 8 and 9, which respectively deal with the promotion of “environmental or social” goals and “sustainable investments”. More than 480 investment companies had these types of investments, which included stocks in fossil fuel companies. The investigation also found more than $1bn of shares in the five fossil fuel giants in funds using green keywords in their title in March 2025: A Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) fund called Europe Climate Pathway had $88m invested in Shell, BP and TotalEnergies. In total, LGIM held $210m in “green” funds. The Robeco Sustainable Global Stars fund had $40m in TotalEnergies. Overall, Robeco held $207m in these funds. Another fund, a State Street product called World ESG had $43m in combined investment in all five of the oil majors. ESG is a label for funds promoting environmental, social and governance goals. In total, State Street Global Advisors UK held $243m in the “green” funds. The financial institutions with the biggest fossil fuel stakes in their article 8 and 9 funds and those using green keywords were JP Morgan Asset Management and its UK subsidiary with $3.2bn, DWS in Germany with $2.2bn and BlackRock Investment Management UK and BlackRock Advisors UK with a combined $1.7bn. The SFDR regulations were not originally intended to be used in marketing but the classifications have been used to showcase a financial product’s environmental credentials. This has remained the case even after the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) called for sweeping reforms to tackle greenwashing and published tighter guidelines in August 2024 for the use of sustainability and ESG-related terms in fund names. The new guidelines include “transition” funds, where managers should demonstrate the investments are on a “clear and measurable path to social or environmental transition”. The deadline for application of the new guidelines is 21 May. BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management announced in March and April respectively that they would remove words such as sustainable and ESG from some fund names. Campaigners said they could have acted sooner. JP Morgan, DWS, LGIM and State Street all declined requests to comment. The guidelines are not legally binding but from 21 May national financial regulators will be able to require companies to report publicly whether their products comply with the rules and could choose to sanction any guideline breaches. Paul Schreiber at Reclaim Finance said: “We need strict rules that ban investments in companies developing fossil fuels from any fund with an ESG-related description. This is precisely what the SFDR failed to do. In this context, the review of the regulations must include strict fossil fuel exclusions covering all fund categories.” An Esma spokesperson said: “Our focus is on supporting [national authorities] to implement the current guidelines, as they are only becoming applicable to existing funds on 21 May. In the future, if needed, we will evaluate the possibility of changes to the guidelines together with competent authorities, also bearing in mind potential developments in the review of the SFDR.” TotalEnergies has said the company supports the objectives of the Paris Agreement and that its strategy is consistent with a global temperature rise of less than 2C. Shell declined to comment, while other fossil fuel companies did not respond to requests for comment.

2024-08-15T11:28:48Z,Texas comptroller adds NatWest to list of companies ‘boycotting’ fossil fuel firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/15/texas-comptroller-adds-natwest-to-list-of-firms-said-to-be-boycotting-energy-companies,"Texas officials have added NatWest Group to a growing list of financial firms considered to be taking part in a “boycott” of energy companies, in a move that could limit the UK bank’s business with the oil-rich US state. The high street banking group is the latest company to be targeted by the Texas comptroller, Glenn Hegar, who has been naming companies that restrict their business dealings with climate-harming fossil fuel firms. NatWest has said that, by 2026, it “will not renew, refinance or extend existing reserve-based lending used specifically for the purpose of financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and production”. The lender’s website said that the sustainability policy was part of its efforts to “end the most harmful activity” fuelling the climate crisis. The stance puts NatWest among a growing list of financial services companies on the Texas comptroller’s divestment statute list, including BlackRock, HSBC, UBS, and Société Générale. The list – entitled “financial companies that boycott energy companies” – is the result of a 2021 law designed to protect the state’s oil and gas sector. The law states that Texas agencies must either stop doing businesses with companies divesting from the oil and gas industry, or explain why they are continuing to deal with those firms. NatWest is understood to have limited exposure to Texas. The banking group, formerly named Royal Bank of Scotland, declined to comment. Hegar’s decision is part of a wider crackdown on companies’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies by the oil-friendly state, which has also put pressure on financial companies to pull out of international initiatives that push signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In February, Hegar welcomed news that JP Morgan and State Street Global Advisors had pulled out of Climate Action 100+, and chastised the ESG movement for creating an “environment that put politics above profits and led many financial firms to disregard their fiduciary duty to clients”. The Texas policies are contrary to the shift taking place in countries in mainland Europe and the UK, which are increasingly pushing for more climate-friendly policies from financial institutions, as governments race to limit global heating to 2 degrees above preindustrial levels.",NatWest Group; Texas; Banking; US news; UK news; Business; World news; Oil; Commodities; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Energy; Energy industry; Environment; Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels,Business
2025-03-23T13:00:19Z,"It’s AGM time, season of free sandwiches and protest fireworks",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/23/its-agm-time-season-of-free-sandwiches-and-protest-fireworks,"The leafy surroundings of Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey will provide an unlikely backdrop for potentially one of the most explosive events of an intriguing shareholder meeting season, as corporate Britain grapples with a rapidly shifting geopolitical backdrop. Next month, BP will host its annual general meeting (AGM) outside London for a second consecutive year, a move that last year failed to deter the climate protesters who have frequently disrupted oil companies’ meetings. The company is in the crosshairs over the U-turn it has made on its green ambitions, while investing $10bn a year in new oil and gas projects – and will also be coming under fire from angry shareholders over its poor share performance. There could also be a showdown between the board and the activist investor Elliott, a New York hedge fund, in what could be the last meeting presided over by under-pressure chair Helge Lund. Many major listed UK companies hold their AGMs between April and May. The meetings offer a rare opportunity for investors who own just a few shares – as well as large financial institutions – to take multimillionaire executives to task over issues big and small before they head for the free sandwiches. The return of Donald Trump to the White House has changed the picture significantly since last year’s AGM season. Trump has swiftly embarked on an anti-diversity push and his “drill baby, drill” agenda to keep the US, and the world, hooked on oil and gas, so bosses can expect questions about companies’ rollback on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets and watering-down of climate goals. But some large investors are already easing their climate stance. Aviva Investors – the investment arm of Britain’s biggest insurer – last week in effect ditched its 2021 plan to sell stakes in companies that fail to restrict their carbon emissions and meet climate targets. In January, BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, became the latest financial firm to quit a major climate change industry group, after coming under attack from US conservative politicians. “The 2025 AGM season is set to be a tough one for responsible investors,” said Paul Hunter, chief executive of the shareholder advisory group Pirc. “Recent years have seen a concerted effort to roll back progress that has been made to reduce environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks. This has been spurred by politicised debate about ESG in the US and what we see as a misguided approach to seeking growth.” At BP, some investors have voiced concerns that it has decided not to put its climate plans to a vote, while rival Shell will be quizzed by shareholders including the Greater Manchester and Merseyside local government pension funds on its plans to increase sales of liquefied natural gas and how its growth strategy is compatible with its climate goals. HSBC has also drawn criticism from environmental campaigners after postponing key parts of its climate goals by 20 years, while watering down green targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, worth up to £9m. UK-listed companies may also face some heat as they are expected to step away from explicit DEI targets, and to remove diversity initiatives as criteria for executive pay. Trump’s anti-DEI executive order means those with ties to the US have been caught between UK and US standards. The pharma company GSK is likely to face questions at its AGM – at a five-star London hotel in May – over its recent decision to pause diversity activities. It has argued that it had to comply with Trump’s executive orders because the US is the company’s biggest market. Boardroom pay will be in the spotlight as usual during AGM season, after several companies announced huge potential pay packets for their bosses in recent weeks, arguing they need to stay competitive with US rivals to attract, and hang on to, top executives. There have been sizeable shareholder rebellions over executive pay in the past – for example, against Britain’s best-paid boss of a listed company, Pascal Soriot, who runs the drugmaker AstraZeneca. His annual pay could go up from £14.7m last year to as much as £25m. Governance experts Institutional Shareholder Services say questions may be asked about whether the company, after “significant dissent to remuneration proposals at the last AGM”, has “sufficiently assuaged shareholder concerns raised regarding variable pay”. Astra is among the companies holding its AGM, which is on 11 April, virtually. Since the pandemic, some companies have hosted hybrid meetings – in person and streamed online. While many companies in North America have virtual-only meetings, it is more unusual for large UK corporates to do so. And for the sake of spectacle, traditional AGMs remain far more compelling.",Annual results; Corporate governance; Shell; BP; GSK; AstraZeneca; Pharmaceuticals industry; Oil; Business,Business
2025-04-13T12:00:14Z,BP dropped its green pledges and turned back to oil. Now the price of crude has collapsed,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/13/bp-dropped-its-green-pledges-and-turned-back-to-oil-now-the-price-of-crude-has-collapsed,"After Donald Trump’s “liberation day” on Wednesday last week, BP lost almost a quarter of its market value in a share price rout even deeper than the oil giant endured in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The collapse in global oil prices in the wake of the US president’s tariff blitz may have wiped billions from its market value – but Trump isn’t BP’s only problem. The oil company will face shareholders this week for the first time since it bowed to investor pressure to abandon its green energy ambitions in favour of a return to fossil fuels, and its chair, Helge Lund, agreed to step down from the board. The twin retreats were considered the only defence against the advance of an aggressive activist investor fund that could spell the breakup of the 115-year-old company, which has been haemorrhaging value for years. Elliott Asset Management, a feared New York hedge fund notorious for shaking up laggard companies, amassed a substantial stake in BP earlier this year. It has reportedly been in talks with key investors over the future of BP after its ill-fated plan to become a green energy company. The resignation of Lund will not spare the board the embarrassment of a bloody nose from shareholders, many of whom are likely to protest by voting against the chair’s reappointment even though he has already decided to leave. The board may also take some relief in knowing that its greatest climate activist foe, the shareholder campaign group Follow This, has decided not to put forward a resolution calling for greater emissions cuts at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting amid growing investor antagonism over ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues. BP set out the plan to reduce its fossil fuel production under former chief executive Bernard Looney in late 2020, the year before its industry rivals began raking in bumper profits from rocking global oil and gas markets. At the same time, BP’s plan to invest in low-carbon energy projects, including two giant offshore windfarms in UK waters, were dealt a blow by the soaring cost of borrowing and post-pandemic supply chain bottlenecks that pushed costs higher across the industry. After Looney’s humiliating exit from the company in late 2023, his successor, former finance chief Murray Auchincloss, began to water down the green plans. He set out a “fundamental reset” of BP’s strategy, blaming the company’s “misplaced” optimism in the green transition. But BP’s pivot back to fossil fuels may already be floundering. The oil company told investors on Friday that its first-quarter results for the year would include lower than expected gas production figures and a “weak” trading result. Worryingly, the company revealed that net debt surged by $4bn (£3bn) in the first three months of the year, as fears over the global financial uncertainty reached fever pitch. BP is considered more exposed to the fallout of Trump’s tariffs, which caused market prices for oil to plummet from almost $75 a barrel to under $60 for the first time in almost four years, due to fears that a trade war will tip the global economy into recession and shrink the world’s appetite for crude. Already, the company appears to have been harder hit by the sell-off than its rivals in the US and Europe. Since the start of the year its share price has plummeted by almost 17%, while Shell has lost just over 8% and US rivals ExxonMobil and Chevron have lost about 7% each. Equity analysts at investment bank UBS downgraded their view of the company from “buy” to “neutral” after warning that the fall in oil and gas prices could slash BP’s earnings over the coming years by as much as a fifth. BP’s strategic reset “was an important first step to restore investor confidence, in our view”, said UBS equity analyst Joshua Stone. “The next steps, including a reduction of net debt and replenishment of the reserves base, were always going to take longer to achieve, but the level of financial uncertainty in the market makes delivery harder in our view, especially as it relates to BP’s ability to grow earnings and sell assets.”",BP; Business; Donald Trump; Energy industry; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment; Oil; Oil and gas companies,Business
2025-04-07T08:48:48Z,"UK has ‘huge opportunity’ to be space watchdog, says former science minister",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/07/uk-has-huge-opportunity-to-be-space-watchdog-says-former-science-minister,"The UK’s role in the next generation of interplanetary exploration should be that of a space “watchdog” leading on regulation, insurance and finance, a former science minister has said, in an effort to rein in a situation he compared to the wild west. George Freeman, the MP for Mid Norfolk who was minister for science, research, technology and innovation under Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, said the need for standards was pressing. “The truth is, with little or no regulation space is in danger of becoming a free-for-all wild west of commercial and military satellites being launched in the new space race,” he said. “There are now 40 tonnes and a million pieces of debris. Ninety-eight per cent of satellites are uninsured. As the global commercial space sector takes off and more and more businesses are reliant on satellites, space is not unlike the early days of the automobile. But who wants to drive down a highway where 90% of vehicles are unmanned, have no insurance and you have to navigate around debris and broken down vehicles?” Freeman said as space minister he had focused on UK leadership in space regulation, insurance and finance; convening the industry partnership with the UK space sector and Lloyds of London to create the Earth∞Space Sustainability Initiative (ESSI), which aims to set global standards for the sector, and securing the backing of Canada, Japan and Switzerland through the global summit at the Royal Society. “The idea of my space debris regulation and the creation of the Earth Space Sustainability Initiative was very simple,” he said. “If you’re compliant with the UK [standards] – if your satellite is retrievable, if it’s rechargeable, if it’s recyclable – you’ll get quicker licensing, cheaper insurance and access to ESG [environmental, social and governance] finance.” Freeman added that by smart regulation, markets can be created for innovative UK companies, noting the satellite retrieval company Astroscale has a base in the UK. A shift from launching ever more satellites to increasing the spectrum bandwidth on satellite constellations, could also produce opportunities. “It just isn’t sustainable to continue the race for constellation coverage on the basis of the volume of satellites,” he said, arguing for a system where contractors carry “ multiple data streams in safely encrypted spectrum bandwidth for multiple operators”. While Freeman noted the UK does not have a fully integrated space industrial sector, he said it does have world-class science and technology and innovation. “We are a Formula One pit lane of smart satellite manufacturing, telemetry, SatComms services and EO [Earth observation] applications,” he said. But it isn’t only in the field of satellite technology where regulation will be important. From crewed missions to Mars to the prospect of lunar mining and even creating data centres on the moon, the opportunities space offers are myriad. Regulations around space debris, Freeman said, could act as a gateway to rules in other areas. “It can gradually evolve,” the MP explained. “You could imagine, say, on space traffic control, that you wouldn’t get permission to launch from aviation authorities unless you’ve got a licence to operate. Licence to operate says you must be compliant with basic standards. “You can’t be littering space with metal. You can’t be doing unregulated and dangerous nuclear, biological or chemical experiments on the surface of the moon. You can’t be ripping out minerals, unless you’ve got an abstraction licence. So once you start to create a framework, you intermesh the permissions and stop rogue actors.” Freeman added the UK is well placed to lead on such matters. “Space needs a global regulatory alliance led by and headquartered in a trusted nation. You need a country that’s got a long and distinguished history as a trusted partner, a long, 300-year role as a regulator of choice, that believes in and is respected internationally for its legal system and is connected to financial market and international courts and jurisdiction,” he said. “This is a huge opportunity for the UK. We should seize it.”",Space; Science; UK news; World news,Science
2025-04-17T06:06:21Z,Can your super be good for you and the planet?,https://www.theguardian.com/australian-ethical-invest-in-a-better-tomorrow/2025/apr/17/can-your-super-be-good-for-you-and-the-planet,"Why do I need to worry about what my super fund is investing in? Australian superannuation funds invest trillions of dollars held in 22.2m member accounts. Our money makes things happen. It’s invested in everything from infrastructure, equities, property, retail and banks to gambling, tobacco and fossil fuels. Anyone concerned about social harm, human rights, environmental degradation or climate change might want to look closely at how and where their money is invested. If you’re making choices in your everyday life to do better, such as by choosing certain brands, recycling or using renewable energy, consider how this could be amplified by directing your retirement savings into projects and businesses that do good on a bigger scale. What is ethical super – and how do funds’ approaches differ? Funds differ in their approaches to ethical investment. One fund, or investment option, might only screen out certain sectors, while another might also look for companies and projects that do good, and allocate capital towards them. Lots of different labels are used to describe investment approaches, which can make it difficult to assess at a glance how ethical a fund is. The lines are blurred between the terms ethical, sustainable and responsible. Some approaches sound good but may not be what you are looking for. Applying an ESG (environmental, social and governance) filter, for example, is about assessing financial risk rather than making judgments based on ethics, and could lead to portfolios containing companies you don’t approve of. It’s also worth noting that ethics vary from one individual to the next. What you consider ethical and what a fund considers ethical may not be the same thing. Is the focus on returns, or ethics, or both? Look at the investment options in most super funds and you’ll find a range of categories to choose from. These categories are often focused on your stage of investing and appetite for risk, rather than the ethical nature of the investments. Even when super funds offer choices, most are primarily focused on returns. You’ll find high-growth (and high-risk) investment options, or more conservative options with lower risk, often favoured by people close to retirement. Some funds also offer ethical investment options. Australian Ethical specialises in them; investments in sectors such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy and tobacco are restricted, while investments in sectors such as renewables, healthcare and IT are supported. How ethical investments are chosen varies between funds, and between investment options within funds, but the goal is always to get good returns as well as invest ethically. My fund says it is one of the good ones. How can I check? Since March 2022, super funds have been obliged to provide publicly accessible twice-yearly portfolio holdings disclosure statements, which outline the composition of the investment options they offer. However, if you’re not a finance nerd, these statements can be overwhelming. Luckily, they are not the only tools at your disposal. You may find reports on ethical funds in the media. The funds themselves can also be a source of information; many are keen to explain their different approaches to investing, and offer detailed information about their ethos and investment choices. The Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) ranks ethical super funds on an investment scorecard in its annual responsible leaders report. Organisations such as Market Forces, which exposes institutions financing environmentally destructive projects, or Choice, can also help you determine if your super fund or investment option is the right one for you. I need my money to work hard – can ethical investing deliver strong returns? Research has found that many ethical funds or investment options perform just as well as, if not better than, standard superannuation offerings. The fund researcher SuperRatings benchmarks the performance of super funds with ethical options, and in 2024 ranked Australian Ethical’s Australian shares option number one for returns over 10 years out of 39 funds. The ATO, Canstar and Finder all offer comparison tools through which you can see how your fund is performing. If you’re unhappy with the ethics of your fund’s investments, the Responsible Returns comparison website can help you find an ethical super fund that meets your criteria.

2024-11-12T15:37:14Z,Donald Trump Jr to join venture capital firm rather than father’s administration,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-jr-1789-capital,"Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of president-elect Donald Trump, has decided to join a venture capital firm and will not be part of his father’s administration. Trump Jr told a crowd of donors over the weekend that he will be joining the Florida-based venture firm 1789 Capital, according to a report in the New York Times. The announcement was made at a conference held by the Rockbridge Network, a conservative political advocacy group that was founded by the vice-president-elect, JD Vance, and Christopher Buskirk, the founder of 1789 Capital. 1789 Capital, which is led by the investment banker Omeed Malik, a Trump donor, focuses on investing in companies and products that appeal to conservative audiences. Named after the year the Bill of Rights was adopted, 1789 Capital says it is “anti-ESG”, referring to investments driven by environmental, social and governance issues. Instead, the company invests in what it describes as “EIG”, or entrepreneurship, innovation and growth. The company also states that it invests in and focuses on deglobalization and “cutting-edge technologies that disrupt industries weighed down by excessive bureaucracy”. The firm was founded in 2022, according to the Financial Times, and reportedly has one listed investment on a private markets database, which is the streaming platform created by Tucker Carlson. Among its board members is Blake Masters, the entrepreneur, investor and venture capitalist who ran an unsuccessful campaign for the US Senate in Arizona in 2022, and denied the results of the 2020 election. Trump Jr has played a central role in both his father’s 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns. This campaign, Trump Jr was reportedly the person who advocated most strongly for the Ohio senator JD Vance to be Trump’s vice-presidential pick. He has also been actively involved in the current White House transition process to establish a new administration. So far, the incoming administration has offered positions to several people, including the Florida senator Marco Rubio (secretary of state) and the immigration hardliner Stephen Miller (deputy chief of staff for policy). On Thursday, two days after the election, Trump Jr told Fox News that he would be “heavily involved” in the transition process. “I want to make sure now that we know who the real players are, the people who will actually deliver on the president’s message, the people who don’t think that they know better than the duly elected president of the United States,” Trump Jr said. “I want to make sure that those people are in his cabinet. I want to make sure that those people are in this administration.” Trump Jr also told Axios that over the summer that he hoped to have “veto power” over hiring decisions for the new administration, if his father were to win. “I don’t want to pick a single person for a position of power, all I want to do is block the guys that would be a disaster,” he said at the time. “I want to block the liars, I want to block the guys that are pretending they’re with you,” he continued. “You guys pick the guy that’s right, I want a veto power to cut out each and every one of those people,” he said. Trump Jr has built a loyal following in the Trump universe, and hosts a podcast, Triggered With Don Jr. He also serves as the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, where he works to “expand the company’s real estate, retail, commercial, hotel and golf interests”. In recent months, Trump Jr has also been promoting a cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, along with his brother, Eric Trump.",Donald Trump Jr; US news; US elections 2024; Donald Trump; Trump administration; Venture capital; Business; US politics,US news
2025-03-01T18:00:45Z,JP Morgan’s ‘sustainable’ funds invested £200m in mining giant Glencore,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/01/jp-morgan-sustainable-funds-mining-giant-glencore,"One of the world’s biggest banks, JP Morgan, has promoted environmental and “sustainable” funds to customers which have invested more than £200m in the mining giant Glencore, it can be revealed. Ethical investing has become big business for JP Morgan and other financial giants, with worldwide “sustainable” investing expected to surpass $40tn by 2030. But the industry now faces scrutiny over the rules around investments focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Several of JP Morgan’s “sustainable” funds are investing in the London-listed commodity trader Glencore, which is under fire for its coal operations in South Africa, an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the news website Voxeurop and the Daily Maverick, an online South African news publication, has revealed. JP Morgan’s asset management arm has more than 500 funds promoted as environmental or sustainable investments, ranging from a climate change solutions fund to a global healthcare fund. Under current rules, some of these may still hold investments in firms criticised for environmentally damaging practices. For many of its funds that are promoted as sustainable, JP Morgan specifies that at least 51% of investments must have positive environmental and/or social characteristics. The remaining 49% can be invested without such restrictions. Jakob Thomä, chief executive of climate thinktank Theia Finance Labs, said: “The overwhelming majority of retail investors, in my view, would feel misled if they knew that was the criteria for labelling something as a sustainable fund.” He said some sustainable funds may be breaking EU law, which says anything that “deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer” is misleading commercial practice. JP Morgan’s sustainable funds also exclude companies that make more than 20% of revenues from thermal coal extraction. Despite being one of the world’s biggest coal companies, Glencore slips under this threshold in terms of revenues. In terms of actual profit, however, coal mining accounts for nearly half. The investments have angered campaigners who have highlighted environmental breaches in Glencore’s operation in South Africa’s coal belt. Glencore runs three mining complexes around the mining town of Phola, Mpumalanga, which is about 70 miles east of Johannesburg. According to a recent South African government report, obtained via a freedom of information request, one of those has been breaking environmental laws since 2017. The company’s Tweefontein coalmine has been accused by the South African water and sanitation department of several breaches including seriously contaminating a local river, storing hazardous waste in open containers and failing to fix broken walls at a sewage facility. Residents at Phola say they don’t trust the local water supply. Daisy Tshabangu, 52, moved to Phola because her family worked at the coal-fired power station that looms on the horizon. “Most of the people, when they do drink this water they get stomach aches,” she said. Phola residents say they feel abandoned by the companies whose mines dominate the landscape. Unemployment is high and infrastructure is crumbling. “We don’t benefit from the mines,” said Tshabangu. “There’s a lot we don’t have but we are surrounded by mines. So to us, it seems like we are being sidelined as a community.” Glencore says that its water treatment plant supplies clean water to Phola as part of its “commitment to sustainable development”. It says it is not directly responsible for the overall supply of water and cannot comment on claims about water quality. It says it has had no complaints via a grievance procedure regarding the supply of water. Despite repeated requests to clean up its operations, the Tweefontein mine was still in breach of multiple environmental laws as recently as November 2023, an inspection report by the South African water and sanitation department reveals. Campaigners question why the company’s licence has not been revoked. “Our regulators are often compromised and give in to the pressure of the coal mining industry. [They] do not have the political will to enforce our laws,” said Mariette Liefferink, chief executive of the Federation for a Sustainable Environment, a local campaign group. Angered that finance promoted as sustainable is supporting Glencore, Liefferink wrote to the former Labour MP Chuka Umunna in November last year about the environmental risk, ecological degradation and pollution associated with JP Morgan’s investments in Glencore. Umunna is now head of sustainable solutions and head of green economy for investment banking at JP Morgan. However, the Observer understands that the former shadow secretary of state for business, who did not respond to the letter, is involved only in the activities of the investment bank, and is not involved in and does not have oversight over the sustainable policies of the asset management arm. Liefferink urged the bank to review its investments in Glencore due to the company’s alleged breaking of environmental laws, as well as the pollution, wildlife damage and environmental risk its activities were causing. Liefferink’s correspondence highlighted two JP Morgan funds with ESG in their name, both of which had millions of pounds invested in Glencore. After a rapid rise in popularity, ESG investing is the subject of increasing scrutiny around the world. Regulators are trying to settle on what it means, and create labels that are easy for investors to understand. The Mpumalanga mines form a small part of Glencore’s global operations. It is the world’s fifth biggest coal miner, selling more than 100m tonnes in 2023 – including from the Cerrejón mine in Colombia where there have been allegations of human rights abuses and environmental destruction. Glencore says it is committed to responsible engagement and the wellbeing of all workers, and that mitigating negative impacts of its mines is imperative to building trust with local communities, which it maintains through ethical and responsible business practices. The company said the water supply in Phola is a municipal service, but that it contributes to a reservoir that also receives water from other sources. It said it monitors the quality of the water provided by its treatment plant on a weekly basis to ensure it is suitable for consumption. The company said it has been taking action in response to Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) inspections since 2017 and that incidents identified in the 2023 audit have been addressed. “Our industrial assets are closely linked to the communities and regions where they operate. We aim to avoid harm to people from our activities, respect human rights, and establish and maintain trusting relationships with stakeholders, through ethical and responsible business practices,” the company said. JP Morgan declined to comment. This investigation was supported by the Bertha Challenge fellowship; Stefano Valentino is a 2024 Bertha Challenge Fellow.

2025-04-05T08:00:16Z,Marketing’s ‘woke’ rebrand has ultimately helped the far right | Eugene Healey,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/05/marketing-advertising-industry-far-right-activism,"Nobody likes to admit we need marketing, but the discipline has always been necessary to match people with the products and services that fulfil their needs and desires. It started simply enough, with us focusing primarily on brands’ features and tangible benefits. But as consumer society evolved, we moved on to symbolic benefits: identities, lifestyles. Finally, we began selling values: an ideology that hit its zenith between 2015 and 2022 in the era of “brand purpose”. It’s here we started to lose the plot. Brands no longer sought to be loved – they demanded to be supported, treated as movements rather than commercial entities. Do you stand with Nike against racial injustice? Do you support Hellmann’s in the fight against food waste? By making purchasing decisions moral declarations, we sold the idea that we could self-correct through consumption. And brands were our champions at the centre of it all: our profitable agents of social reform. And yet a decade on from the start of this period, in every conceivable domain, from the environment, to LGBTQ+ protections, to women’s bodily autonomy, to immigration and multiculturalism, it seems we’re skirting closer and closer to the fascist ideology we claimed to have defeated in 1945. Every week, we’re met with news of brands adjusting to that new order, either scaling back their DEI or environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments or abandoning them all together. How did it come to this? It’s easy to blame the Trumps, the Tates, the podcasters, the broligarchy. Less easy is to examine the conditions that created them – and our own complicity within the professional class. The contradictions of the brand purpose era are most apparent when looked at from the view of the average person. Social progress once came hand-in-hand with economic progress. Now, instead, social progress has been offered as a substitute for economic progress. For the better part of the last decade, both consumers and employees have observed a marked contrast between multinational brands promoting wholesale social transformation, with bold proclamations for equity and justice for marginalised communities, while simultaneously being some of the single greatest contributors to the decline in living standards across the vast majority of the western world. They’ve seen messaging grow increasingly heavy-handed, couched in shame, or used as a tactic for plain obfuscation. And they’ve asked the consumer to bear the cost of transition, often charging more for objectively worse products (hello, paper shopping bags). It’s this contradiction that’s been so effectively exploited by the far right. The appropriation and weaponisation of “woke” was supercharged by the narrative that leftist thinking had infiltrated the highest echelon of corporations. Painting the two as bedfellows has allowed a new breed of conservatives to occupy the position of “counter-cultural” – the net effect being large swathes of young people supporting authoritarian or ethno-nationalist political movements. In a bizarre inversion of reality, it’s somehow become punk to champion the same power structures that have dominated society for centuries. What is saddest about this turn of events is that it was entered with good intentions. The brand purpose era was, in many ways, marketers trying to reconcile their roles such that they could feel they were effecting positive change even while playing the corporate game. Instead, it became yet another cautionary tale in capitalism’s ability to absorb its critiques and repackage them as aesthetics to be sold on a supermarket shelf. Through the rear window it’s easy to see that the backlash was inevitable: if progressive values could so easily be commodified as a tool for selling mayonnaise, why shouldn’t those values be treated with the same fickleness as condiment preferences? This piece isn’t intended as a call out to any individual. We all live under this system. To make a living means we are all in some way complicit. But as marketers, we must reckon with how we’ve trivialised activism by turning it into comms strategy, how we’ve co-opted movements only to abandon them when the winds changed. The responsibility we bear now is undoing the lesson we inadvertently taught consumers over this era. Structural reform can’t be achieved through consumption choices – unfortunately, we’re all going to have to get dirt under our fingernails. If this all sounds a bit doom and gloom, let me provide a reason to be optimistic. After two decades of misplaced optimism, we have entered a period the writer and “luxury memeologist” Edmond Lau has termed “the dark mode shift”. In this “mask-off” era, everyone’s true intentions have come to light. Your boss is back to looking like your boss, not Adam Sandler on a coffee run; your office is back to looking like an office, not a college common room. And brands are back to their true role: creating fiction and spectacle to grease the wheels of consumption. Done right, I believe that fiction can still produce moments of extraordinary clarity and beauty. But there’s a line to be drawn between what we do and where meaningful progress really comes from: grassroots movements, political organising, policy reform. Brands’ swift exit grants oxygen for more authentic acts of resistance to return to centre stage. And if we’re not prepared to sacrifice profit in support of those causes, then perhaps our most radical act is one of humility – wielding our influence with greater care and consciousness than before.

2024-11-25T14:59:03Z,Trump adviser who funded supreme court takeover wants to ‘crush liberal dominance’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/leonard-leo-npr-interview,"Leonard Leo, who financed and directed the rightwing takeover of the US supreme court, admitted he wants to “crush liberal dominance” across American society. “I want to crush liberal dominance,” the dark money impresario told NPR, in an interview published three weeks after Donald Trump’s stunning election win. Leo added that he wanted to “make sure that there’s a level playing field for the American people to make choices about the lives that they want to have in their country”. “I’m perfectly happy having a world where people can make choices between various kinds of things. But what I don’t want is a system where our entertainment system or our world of news media or our business and finance worlds are heavily dominated by left ideology that either chokes out other ways of thinking about things, or that just creates a system where sort of inappropriate political and policy decisions are being made in places where politics and policy don’t really have a proper place,” he said. Leo had a prominent role in installing to the nominally apolitical US supreme court three hardline rightwingers who have helped hand down epochal rulings on abortion rights, presidential immunity, corporate regulation and more. Leo is a Catholic rightwinger from New Jersey who came to prominence with the Federalist Society as it helped transform US courts over the past 30 years. Funds at Leo’s fingertips include a record $1.6bn donation from Barre Seid, a Chicago billionaire – the sort of deal that saw one Leo-linked group, Donors Trust, called “the dark money ATM of the right”. NPR asked Leo about Teneo, a group that in its own words seeks to “recruit, connect, and deploy talented conservatives who lead opinion and shape the industries that shape society”. Last year, ProPublica reported a “slick but private video” in which Leo told potential Teneo donors he wanted to “crush liberal dominance”, adding: “I just said to myself: ‘Well, if this can work for law, why can’t it work for lots of other areas of American culture and American life where things are really messed up right now?’” Leo told NPR he expected quicker results than in his campaign to transform the American justice system. “I have to say I am impressed by how quickly the Teneo Network has been able to build pipelines of talent,” he said. “And I am also very impressed with how quickly you’re seeing efforts, for example, in the journalism and entertainment spaces, the standing up of new production studios and news platforms. Very impressed with the speed with which the debate about ESG [environmental, social and governance corporate policies] has kind of flipped and changed. “And so, yes, these things do take a long time. But I am struck by the speed with which some of this has occurred in the past two or three years. And I can’t explain why it is. But it does seem to be faster than what I saw in the law.” Asked if he expected to help install new supreme court justices, either to reinforce the current 6-3 rightwing slant or to take the court even further right, Leo played coy. “I think it’s probably unlikely” that a senior rightwinger such as Clarence Thomas or Samuel Alito will retire in the next four years, Leonard said. “But you never know. It’s always a possibility. And every administration I’ve ever known has always prepared for that contingency just to make sure.” • The subheading of this article was amended on 26 November 2024 to correct a misspelling of Leonard Leo’s first name.",Trump administration; US news; US politics; US political financing; Republicans; US supreme court; Donald Trump,US news
2025-01-20T15:36:56Z,Global financial sector dropping key green pledges as Trump takes office,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/20/global-financial-sector-dropping-key-green-pledges-as-trump-takes-office,"The second Trump administration is expected to strike a blow to efforts to align the global financial sector with the path to net zero, with banks, asset managers and industry groups already moving to accommodate the incoming president’s avowed policy of “drill, baby, drill”. As authorities declared 2024 the hottest on record, atmospheric carbon dioxide leapt by a record amount and fires ravaged Los Angeles, a key private sector climate alliance, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) abandoned a requirement that members be aligned to the Paris agreement. That was followed by a network of net zero asset managers suspending work, and deleting from its website its statement of commitments that members must adopt, after BlackRock, the biggest of them all, quit its ranks. As Trump takes office with an agenda of reversing US green policies, seen as part of a “woke” agenda at which he and his followers have taken aim, analysts and observers expect that worse is yet to come. “Honestly, even if you look at politics around the world, it feels like the populist right is pushing hard on an anti-net zero ticket,” said James Alexander, the chief executive at the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. “It is particularly disheartening to see this news come right at the time of, you know, the worst wildfires we’ve ever seen in Los Angeles, floods across the world, heat waves, and right on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration. “The inauguration doesn’t look like a coincidence. And it’s really disappointing to see that this is the effect that … political attacks are having on the commitments of institutions to these alliances.” Launched with fanfare at Cop26 in Scotland three years ago, GFANZ was intended to be a sector-wide collaboration to “mobilise the trillions of dollars necessary to … deliver the goals of the Paris agreement”. At the time, Mark Carney, the UK government’s climate finance adviser for Cop26, said: “This is the breakthrough in mainstreaming climate finance the world needs.” He became chair of the new groups, which he said would be “the gold standard for net zero commitments in the financial sector”. But on the eve of the new year, Carney announced a major revision to those commitments, as GFANZ in effect dropped its requirement for members’ activities to be aligned with Paris, amid a drip-drip exodus of major US banks – the six biggest of which have quit the banking industry’s net zero group since December. But Andrew Garraway, the head of climate policy at climate analytics firm Risilience, said: “It would be wrong to ascribe the difficulties at GFANZ and the sectoral alliances solely to Trump, as they’ve faced increasing Republican resistance since their establishment in 2021. “However, the Trump presidency is indeed the catalyst for many US financial firms stepping back from GFANZ and the sectoral alliances, with firms nervous of the potential political and legal ramifications of being seen to be too active on decarbonisation.” BlackRock, which manages funds worth $11.5tn, quit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, saying its membership had “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials”. Almost immediately, NZAM suspended its monitoring of members’ progress towards commitments, and announced a review “to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context”. Paddy McCully, a senior energy transition analyst at Reclaim Finance, said: “NZAM’s requirements of its members were so weak as to be to mainly symbolic, but symbolism can be important, and Wall Street saying it will no longer cooperate to finance the energy transition sends a message to big polluters that they can carry on with business as usual.” Alexander said firms were not just trying to please the incoming Trump administration and a few rightwing politicians, but that there was a widespread mistrust of progressive policies among the US electorate. “And our analysis is the ESG [environmental, social and governance investing principle] backlash is not a grassroots thing,” he said. “It’s something that has been created by those that stand to lose the most from the net zero energy transition. And they are, of course, oil and gas firms, some of the most well capitalised companies in the entire economy. “They’re facing an existential threat in the sense of their licence to operate being removed. And they are fighting back really, really big-time. And it’s working really well in America for them right now.” GFANZ and NZAM have been approached for comment.",Banking; Greenhouse gas emissions; Donald Trump; Environment; Business,Business
2025-01-11T13:00:04Z,Wall Street looks forward to a bonfire of capital and climate rules under Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/11/wall-street-looks-forward-to-a-bonfire-of-capital-and-climate-rules-under-trump,"When some of the biggest banks on Wall Street reveal their full-year earnings this week, they will have more to celebrate than just rising profits. Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration on 20 January – scheduled the Monday after US bank results week – will raise the curtain on a period of looser regulation, lower corporation tax, and weak climate commitments. These moves are likely to be welcomed by lenders such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, which have already been back-pedalling on net zero promises, and railing against higher capital rules. And if those changes deliver higher returns for investors, shareholders are unlikely to complain. “Investors have already welcomed these prospects given how shares in many US banks have performed since the US election result,” says Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. JP Morgan, which is expected to report a jump in annual profits on Wednesday, according to UBS, has seen its shares pop 10% since Trump’s victory in November. Shares in Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have risen 13% and 11% respectively. The prospect of Trump’s anti-green agenda could result in further profit growth on the back of fossil-fuel-friendly industries. It comes amid a growing backlash against ESG (environmental, social and governance) goals by US politicians, particularly those on the right of the Republican party. Officials in Texas have started to penalise financial firms that dare to promote their green credentials, with the state’s comptroller having added NatWest to a growing list of firms accused of boycotting its oil industry last summer. In a letter to shareholders last April, Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, hinted at plans to dilute the bank’s climate pledges. He said JP Morgan would “use the word ‘commitment’ much more reservedly in the future, clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding commitments”. Nine months later, the bank joined peers such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo in announcing that it was leaving the UN-sponsored net zero banking alliance, which helps lenders to reduce their carbon footprints. JP Morgan said it would instead work independently to help clients “engaged in energy transitions”, and pledged to work on “pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security”. Meanwhile, Trump’s second term in the White House is expected to lead to a bonfire of regulations, with the incoming president saying he would slash 10 regulations for every new one added. Bank bosses will be hoping that among them will be the so-called Basel III rules, which are meant to ensure banks hold enough capital to absorb potential losses. Basel III was part of international efforts to avoid a repeat of the financial meltdown in 2008, which forced governments to spend billions of dollars bailing out big lenders that took too much risk. Over the past two years, US bank lobby groups have embarked on a campaigning blitz against the capital requirements. Regulators had begun caving in under the pressure. In September, the US Federal Reserve slashed a planned capital increase to 9% in September, less than half the 19% proposed. The lobbying continued, and successfully delayed the decision until after the US presidential election. Trump’s win cleared some final hurdles. Officials such as Fed vice-chair Michael Barr – who had pushed for stricter oversight of UK banks – resigned last week, citing the “risk of a dispute” once Trump takes office. Analysts are now betting the Basel rules will be all but gutted. But the new administration will need to tread carefully to avoid any financial failures. Trump’s decision to unpick some of the credit requirements of the Dodd-Frank banking rules in 2018 were partly blamed for sparking the mini banking crisis of 2023, leading to the collapse of a handful of lenders including Silicon Valley Bank. Dodd-Frank required banks with at least $50bn (£41bn) in assets – that is, those considered “systemically important” – to undergo an annual Federal Reserve “stress test” and to maintain certain levels of capital as well as plans for a “living will” if they fail. Coatsworth believes Trump will stop short of pulling protections completely. “Trump wants to make things easier for banks, but he won’t want to risk any damage to the financial system,” he says. “That means being more lenient with rules but not having them too loose. In general, the larger US banks are well capitalised following efforts to rebuild after the global financial crisis and that’s going to provide some comfort to investors.”",Banking; Business; Donald Trump; JP Morgan; Goldman Sachs,Business
2025-02-14T16:16:13Z,"Rollback on diversity policies ‘risks undoing decades of progress’, says Co-op",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/14/ditching-diversity-risks-progress-co-op,"A rollback of diversity initiatives in the UK risks undoing decades of progress, the CEO of the Co-op group has warned, as US multinationals scale back commitments. Companies including Amazon, Disney, Google and Meta have begun abandoning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies in the US as the president, Donald Trump, reverses government anti-discrimination measures. This month in the UK, BT reportedly cut DEI initiatives from its bonus scheme for middle managers, while saying it remained “committed” to diversity principles. The Manchester-headquartered Co-op, which employs nearly 60,000 people in the UK, is the UK’s first big retailer with a female CEO, CFO and chair. The group’s CEO, Shirine Khoury-Haq, said DEI was true to Co-op’s founding principles and that it would continue to champion fairness having seen the benefits. She said: “Rolling back on DEI isn’t just an internal business decision, it has real-world consequences. It deepens inequality, weakens trust, and risks undoing decades of progress. “It is no coincidence that the drive to reverse inclusion efforts is often led by those who already hold advantage – those who benefit from an unlevel playing field. The reality is that at some point, every one of us will find ourselves in a minority – whether due to mental health, age, disability, or other circumstances.” Amid concerns for DEI in the UK, the equalities minister, Seema Malhotra, said the government had an “absolute commitment” to tackling racial inequality and diversity and inclusion. Meanwhile, leading industry figures defended the benefits of DEI and outlined their fears. Khoury-Haq said she was “saddened” at some businesses scaling back diversity policies, adding: “The speed at which some are doing it makes you wonder if they ever truly meant it.” Malhotra said a consultation would be launched later this year on the Equality (Race and Disability) bill, which would compel large employers to report on ethnicity and disability pay gaps. “Your race should never be a barrier to your progress,” Malhotra said. “This is not just about fair access to opportunity, but ensuring how we grow our economy.” The consultants McKinsey previously found that companies in the top quarter for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability compared with those in the fourth quartile, and its research showed the “strong business case for both gender diversity and ethnic and cultural diversity in corporate leadership”. Helena Morrissey, a former City fund manager and a long-time campaigner for boardroom representation for women, said: “I can’t believe that anyone in their right mind would say they want less diverse talent.” Morrissey, who chairs the Diversity Project, a cross-company investment and savings industry initiative, said they had received calls from employees concerned by unfolding developments, and she was worried companies might think “it’s all over, there’s no point in us trying any more”. Paul Sesay, an industry expert and the founder of the National Diversity Awards, said rather than drop DEI, some UK businesses might merge it with environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, which emphasise ethical behaviour, to avoid backlash. He said there was an understanding in UK business that there was further to go, and while “middle management” across sectors had seen “significantly more progress” since 2020, change was a “lot slower” when it came to chief officers and that when black professionals “do reach the top, they have to prove themselves so much more”. Nearly all the UK’s 100 largest listed companies now have at least one minority ethnic director on their boards, according to the most recent progress update from the government-backed Parker review, which revealed a number still don’t. In addition, women occupied more than two in five seats on the boards of the UK’s largest listed companies in 2023, according to the government-backed annual FTSE women leaders review, which also found there were “too few” top female executives. Pavita Cooper, the UK chair of the 30% Club which campaigns globally for gender equality in corporate leadership, said: “If I thought we had a completely meritocratic system then I would be less worried. “It’s about making sure everyone gets that same chance, rather than a small group of elite people getting to the top of British institutions, whether that’s the arts or business.” Shabna Begum, the CEO of the race equality thinktank Runnymede Trust, criticised the previous Conservative government for framing diversity as “woke” red tape. She said: “There’s strong evidence DEI policies, implemented thoughtfully, actually improve productivity, performance and financial returns. This attack on DEI is a highly ideological act of self sabotage.” Co-op group initiatives include video interviews to prevent bias, replacing CV requirements for operational roles with assessments, an “opt-out” workplace savings scheme, and development programmes for female and black, Asian and minority ethnic representation in leadership. Co-op’s head of social mobility, inclusion and belonging, Zahoor Ahmad, said Trump had encouraged the false idea diversity is “discriminatory, not based on merit”. He said: “There’s a plane crash and [Trump] says DEI is to blame. The message is that we didn’t have qualified people doing that job, that the default setting, the white male, is the qualified person – and that’s fundamentally untrue.” Khoury-Haq said: “We should not be fooled into weakening our own prospects by dismantling the progress that has been made” when “the cost of living crisis has hit millions hard, and socioeconomic disadvantage is rife”, adding: “Now, more than ever, businesses have a responsibility to stand together to ensure every child and adult has the opportunity to reach their full potential.”",Business; Race; Gender; Disability; Co-operative Group; UK news,Business
2024-08-07T12:16:59Z,Investors push Glencore to scrap spin-off of heavily polluting coal division,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/07/glencore-keeps-coal-polluting-division,"Glencore has scrapped plans to spin off its coal business after shareholders urged the commodities company to hold on to the highly profitable but heavily polluting division. The FTSE 100 company said that an overwhelming majority of its shareholders favoured retaining the coal business over its plan to list the division as a separate company on the New York stock exchange. More than 95% of Glencore’s investors favoured keeping the business primarily on the basis that the fossil fuel would enhance the company’s “cash-generating capacity”, which would “accelerate and optimise the return of excess cashflows to shareholders”, the company said. “They recognise that cash is king,” said Gary Nagle, the company’s chief executive. Nagle drew up the now defunct restructuring plan last year, saying it would help create more shareholder value for both companies by listing them in separate markets. Under the plans, Glencore was expected to merge its own coal business with the steelmaking coal division of its recent acquisition, Canada’s Teck Resources, and list the new company in New York. Glencore emerged as one of many fossil fuel companies expecting to tap the US markets, where investors tend to take a more lenient view on polluting companies than many European investors. Tribeca Investment Partners, an Australian hedge fund, wrote to Glencore earlier this year to urge the company to keep hold of its coal division and move its primary market listing from the UK to Australia, where it employs more than 17,000 staff at a string of coalmines across the country. The hedge fund said the London Stock Exchange was “no longer the home of mining” due to the “low appetite for mining investment” among climate-conscious European investors. However, Nagle said the industry was now a “dynamic space” in which views on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues had “moved materially”. He said: “The ESG pendulum has swung back over the last nine to 12 months. The world has recognised the need for coal as we decarbonise.” The comments are likely to anger green groups that have campaigned against coal on the grounds it is one of the most polluting fossil fuels, and a leading contributor to the rise in global emissions, which has hastened the climate crisis. Glencore confirmed the board would heed the calls of its shareholders to retain the coal division, despite its heavy carbon footprint, alongside a 33% slump in its underlying profits for the first half of the year to $6.3bn (£5bn) compared with $9.4bn in the same months last year. The company’s former executives, including its billionaire former head of oil trading, have recently been charged with conspiring to make corrupt payments to benefit the firm’s oil operations in West Africa between 2007 and 2014. Alex Beard, who ran Glencore’s oil division from 2007 until his retirement in 2019, will face charges alongside the former Glencore executives Andrew Gibson, Paul Hopkirk, Ramon Labiaga and Martin Wakefield after a long-running Serious Fraud Office investigation into allegations of bribery at the company. Nagle said Glencore now has a “best in class, gold-standard compliance programme” that has created a “responsible and ethical” business. “It’s something we work on every day,” he said.",Glencore; Coal; Fossil fuels; Business; Energy; Environment; Commodities; Energy industry; Corporate governance; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; UK news; Financial sector; Australia news; Mining,Business
2025-02-14T15:05:08Z,What is the DEI rollback and where will it spread next?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-us-trump-google-amazon-walmart,"Last month Donald Trump signed a slew of executive orders overturning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the federal government, in a backlash against measures to help underrepresented groups. Since then, many large US corporates have followed suit and announced they are dropping or overhauling policies or schemes. Here we examine what has changed and how far the rollback might go. Which sectors are dropping DEI? So far, the most prominent names to announce changes are from the US finance and tech sectors. This week, the bank Goldman Sachs scrapped a policy that stipulated it would only take on a company’s initial public offering if it had at least one board member from a diverse background. The consultancy firm Accenture said last weekend it was ending the global diversity and inclusion goals it set in 2017, along with career development programmes for “people of specific demographic groups”. Earlier this month, Google said it was reviewing some diversity initiatives and scrapping a goal to hire more employees from historically underrepresented groups, and has since removed references to events including Black History Month, LGBTQ+ Pride and Women’s History Month from its online and mobile calendars. Is this a new trend? No, rightwing campaigners have been pushing for some time for organisations to scrap the more inclusive policies that were created in response to the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, claiming they result in “reverse discrimination”. Those efforts moved up a gear after a US supreme court ruling in 2023 that banned affirmative action in university admissions decisions, prompting Conservative groups to launch a wave of legal action against companies over their diversity programmes. Last year, Wall Street banks became some of the first companies to publicly distance themselves from diversity initiatives, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, opening up the diversity programmes previously aimed only at people from ethnic minorities. The change gathered pace after Trump’s election in November, with a swathe of firms dropping DEI in the run-up to the president’s inauguration on 20 January, including Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford, Amazon and Meta, which also overhauled its content moderation to remove restrictions on topics such as gender and immigration. Has it reached the UK yet? So far the main impact of the changes in Britain have been on users of Silicon Valley-based tech and social media platforms. The policy changes have also prompted some splits within organisations that operate in both countries, as their US and UK arms follow different paths. This week, the consultancy and accounting firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government to remove pronouns from their emails, while also announcing the end of its DEI programme. However, the boss of Deloitte UK informed staff its British operations would remain “committed to [its] diversity goals”. A memo from Richard Houston said changing government priorities in the US would not change its “commitment to building an inclusive culture” at its UK arm. Employment lawyers have warned that if companies embrace the Trumpian trend they could open themselves up to legal risk in the UK. British companies have “always had a merit-based approach” for hiring employees, as affirmative action does not apply, said Lucy Lewis, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin. However, she warned that “it is a big unknown if the federal government will require contractors who they are working with to go further and row back on diversity and inclusion in other ways”, which could create problems when working with some US firms. UK employers will continue to be required by law to report on certain diversity metrics, such as the requirement to disclose the representation of women and ethnic minorities on the board and in the executive teams of listed companies. Companies which announce changes to diversity schemes may also find it harder to recruit younger staff, according to multiple surveys of workers belonging to Gen Z – born between 1997 and 2012 – which have highlighted their desire to work for organisations that align with their values. “They only want to join companies which they see pay attention to these issues,” said Pavita Cooper, UK chair of the 30% Club, which campaigns globally to boost the number of women in boardrooms and in the leadership of companies. “The war for the very best talent has not gone away, and this is what matters to them.” Who is fighting back? Trade unions oppose the shift but are concerned that international companies may follow US policies, even within their UK businesses. The GMB union said it was worried that “multinational companies will bring a rightwing, regressive, anti-worker approach to their UK operations”, said Eleanor Saunders, GMB’s equality and inclusion organiser. “Employer diversity initiatives often don’t push hard enough against the causes of workplace discrimination, bias and harassment,” Saunders said. “But they are essential for employers to meet their legal obligations and to go beyond the bare minimum to make work accessible, fair and rewarding for all.” The Prospect union, which represents professionals including engineers, scientists, and tech workers, is concerned that the rollback of schemes in large US-based tech companies could have a direct impact on British employees, despite the different legal framework. It has written to the chair of the UK parliament’s women and equalities committee to ask it to call in tech executives for questioning on the changes. The bosses of large companies including Barclays and Unilever have in recent days reaffirmed their commitment to diversity programmes, with Barclays’ chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan saying the lender wanted “to provide equality of opportunity” and to “create that inclusive environment”. Meanwhile, the strategic communications adviser Kekst CNC believes many companies are reassessing, not scrapping, their diversity and inclusion policies. “What they’re working towards are policies that are better bound to commercial strategy, and so stronger and more durable,” said Meghan Sheehan, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability at Kekst CNC.",US news; Inequality; US politics; Donald Trump; Trump administration; World news; Business; Google; Amazon; Meta; DEI policies,US news
2024-09-29T12:00:33Z,Leonard Leo-linked group attacking efforts to educate judges on climate,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/leonard-leo-group-influencing-judges-climate-education,"A rightwing organization is attacking efforts to educate judges about the climate crisis. The group appears to be connected to Leonard Leo, the architect of the rightwing takeover of the American judiciary who helped select Trump’s supreme court nominees, the Guardian has learned. The Washington DC-based non-profit Environmental Law Institute (ELI)’s Climate Judiciary Project holds seminars for lawyers and judges about the climate crisis. It aims to “provide neutral, objective information to the judiciary about the science of climate change as it is understood by the expert scientific community and relevant to current and future litigation”, according to ELI’s website. The American Energy Institute (AEI), a rightwing, pro-fossil fuel thinktank, has been attacking ELI and their climate trainings in recent months. In August, the organization published a report saying ELI was “corruptly influencing the courts and destroying the rule of law to promote questionable climate science”. ELI’s Climate Judiciary Project is “falsely portraying itself as a neutral entity teaching judges about questionable climate science”, the report says. In reality, AEI claims, the project is a partner to the more than two dozen US cities and states who are suing big oil for allegedly sowing doubt about the climate crisis despite longstanding knowledge of the climate dangers of coal, oil and gas usage. In a PowerPoint presentation about the report found on AEI’s website, the group says the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) is a “wholly aligned with the climate change plaintiffs and helps them corruptly influence judges behind closed doors”. “Their true purpose is to preview the plaintiffs’ arguments in the climate cases in an ex parte setting,” the presentation says. Both the report and the PowerPoint presentation link AEI to CRC Advisors, a public relations firm chaired by rightwing dark money impresario Leo. Given his outsize role in shaping the US judiciary – Leo helped select multiple judicial nominees for former president Donald Trump, including personally lobbying for Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment – his firm’s role in opposing climate litigation is notable. “He was greatly responsible for moving our federal court systems to the right,” said David Armiak, the research director for Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group tracking money in politics, of Leo. CRC Advisors’ work with AEI, Armiak said, seemed “to delegitimize a group that’s seeking to inform judges or the judicial system of climate science, something that [Leo] also opposed with some of his other efforts”. The AEI report’s document properties show that its author was Maggie Howell, director of branding and design at CRC Advisors. And the PowerPoint’s document properties lists CRC Advisors’s vice-president, Kevin Daley, as the author. Neither CRC Advisors nor Leo responded to requests for comment. In an email, the American Energy Institute CEO, Jason Isaac, said: “American Energy Institute employed CRC Advisors to edit and promote our groundbreaking report on the corrupt relationship between our federal court system and leftwing dark money groups.” But Kert Davies, the director of special investigations at the non-profit Center for Climate Integrity, who shared the report and PowerPoint with the Guardian, said ELI is “far from leftwing”. The institute’s staff include a wide variety of legal and climate experts. Its board includes executives from Shell Group and BP, oil companies who have been named as defendants in climate litigation, and a partner at a law firm which represents Chevron. Two partners with the law firm Baker Botts LLP, which represents Sunoco LP and its subsidiary, Aloha Petroleum Ltd, in a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, also sit on ELI’s leadership council, E&amp;E News previously reported. “ELI’s seminars are giving judges the ABCs of climate change, which is a complicated subject that they ought to know about,” said Davies. “The idea that they’re corruptly influencing the court from the left … is complete disinformation.” Asked for comment about ELI’s connection to oil companies, the AEI CEO, Isaac, said that “all of those companies have embraced and/or are pushing political agendas” that are “contrary to the best interest of Americans, American energy producers, and human flourishing”, including environmental social and governance (ESG) investing and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). “They are the appeasers, the ones feeding the crocodiles,” he said. He did not respond to questions about the extent of the relationship between AEI and CRC Advisors. In a statement, Nick Collins, a spokesperson for ELI, called the AEI report “full of misinformation and created by an organization whose leadership regularly spreads false claims about climate science”, and described the CJP curriculum as “fact-based and science-first, developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards”. Pending climate litigation AEI’s attack on the judicial climate education program comes as the supreme court considers litigation that could put big oil on the hook for billions of dollars. Honolulu is one of dozens of cities and states to sue oil majors for allegedly hiding the dangers of their products from the public. Hawaii’s supreme court ruled that the suit can go to trial, but the defendants petitioned the US supreme court to review that decision, arguing the cases should be thrown out because emissions are a federal issue that cannot be tried in state courts. This past spring, far-right fossil fuel allies launched an unprecedented campaign pressuring the supreme court to side with the defendants and shield fossil fuel companies from the litigation. Several of the groups behind the campaign have ties to Leo. In June, the supreme court asked the Biden administration to weigh in on the defendants’ request. Biden officials could respond as soon as Monday. “It’s doubtful that AEI’s timing of their report release was a coincidence,” said Davies. The supreme court may weigh in on another case as early as Monday, too: in April, 20 Republican state attorneys general filed “friend of the court” briefs asking the supreme court to prevent states from being able to sue oil companies for climate damages. All of the signatories are members of the Republican Attorneys General Association, to which Leo’s Concord Fund is a major contributor. CRC Advisors In the weeks since its publication, AEI’s report attacking ELI has received a surge of interest from rightwing media. Fox News featured the report, as did an array of conservative websites. On Thursday, the Hill published an op-ed by Ted Cruz attacking the ELI project. Other rightwing groups have previously questioned the motives of ELI. CRC Advisors has counted Chevron, one of the plaintiffs in Honolulu’s lawsuit, as a client. In 2018, the Leo-led PR firm also worked on a campaign aimed at exonerating the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh from accusations of sexual assault. Davies said it “would not be surprising” if CRC Advisors had a “large role” in the creation or promotion of the AEI report attacking ELI’s judiciary trainings. “They’re known for running campaigns for corporate interests and rightwing interests,” he said. American Energy Institute In addition to his work with AEI, Isaac also serves as a fellow at Texas Public Policy Foundation – a thinktank backed by oil and gas companies which has recently garnered scrutiny for its role in drafting the ultraconservative policy playbook Project 2025. A former Republican Texas state representative, Isaac has dedicated much of his career to disputing climate research and promoting misinformation to justify deregulation of the fossil fuel industry. Isaac recently responded to a Twitter post about Climate Week by the EPA, calling the conference on climate change “nothing more than a celebration of people suffering from mental illness, #EcoDysphoria, with those attending insisting the rest of us catch it.” On a 25 September episode of the rightwing Wisconsin talk radio show The Vicki McKenna Show, Isaac offered a defense of the fossil fuel industry, describing oil and gas as keys to prosperity. “I live a high-carbon lifestyle,” he said. “I wish the rest of the world could, too.” Formerly known as Texas Natural Gas Foundation, AEI on its face appears to contribute little more than public relations work in defense of the fossil fuels industry. The group publishes blogposts defending carbon emissions and denouncing the push for climate action. It has also produced a handful of longer reports promoting laws that restrict environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and opposing the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. Among AEI’s board members are Steve Milloy, who served on Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, once ran a tobacco industry front group, and is a well-known climate denier. Milloy did not respond to a request for comment. According to the group’s most recent tax filings, AEI, which lists four staffers and a CEO on its website, is not a lavish operation. The group brought in about $312,000 in revenue in 2022 and appears to fund its operations at least partly by selling merchandise – among other products, AEI offers T-shirts, tote bags and beer koozies emblazoned with the words “I Embrace The High Carbon Lifestyle”.",US justice system; US politics; Climate crisis; US news,US news
2025-07-01T11:35:15Z,"Finance firms’ claim to be ‘saving the world’ was a mistake, says City veteran",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/01/city-finance-firms-aberdeen-asset-managers-esg-issues,"Pension funds and institutional investors made a “huge mistake” and exaggerated their role in environmental, social and government (ESG) issues to promote their products, the outgoing chair of Aberdeen Group, Douglas Flint, has said. Flint, who has chaired the recently rebranded fund manager since 2019, said “ridiculously extravagant claims” had been made by some companies, which were driven by a mindset that their job was “not really about investing money: we’re just jolly good people and we’re saving the world”. Flint, who also chaired HSBC between 2010 and 2017, told a City of London net zero conference on Monday that those claims may have been over-egged, in a way that put them at legal risk, particularly in the US. “Our industry then made a kind of huge mistake. It became a marketing thing: let’s tell everyone we’re saving the world, we’re saving the planet,” he said, in comments first reported by the Financial Times. The legal risks have risen in recent months after a severe drop in support for ESG issues in the US. Rightwing activists and politicians have targeted financial companies for supporting climate policies, having been emboldened by policymakers in Trump’s administration, which pushed for a resurgence in oil and gas production. The ESG backlash has spooked some companies, worried that they could be targeted by lawsuits and blacklisting that could harm their US business. Even before Trump took office in November, Texas added NatWest to a growing list of companies accused of boycotting its oil industry, in a move that threatened the UK bank’s business with the US state. For others, the ESG backlash has provided an opportunity to scrap international green initiatives that some bosses claim make their businesses less competitive. High-profile investors including BlackRock and State Street have cancelled membership in voluntary schemes such as the Climate Action 100+ group in recent months. Although US companies have led the charge in dropping ESG commitments, there are growing fears that UK investors could follow suit, meaning there will be less pressure on publicly listed companies, whose shares they hold, to reduce their carbon footprints. That could be compounded by a potential watering down of the Labour party’s manifesto pledge to ensure that FTSE 100 companies – as well the City’s banks, asset managers, insurers and pension funds – adopt “credible” climate transition plans in line with the Paris agreement’s pledge to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. Last week, a consultation on those rules showed the government was exploring less rigorous rules as part of a drive to cut red tape and compliance costs. One of the options being considered would mean the government “will not require an entity to have a discrete transition plan or to set climate targets in line with a particular climate goal”. “The focus remains on the impact of the environment and climate on business profits, not the impact of business on the planet,” Mark Cliffe, a visiting fellow at the Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter, said. “Given the lack of clarity on the government’s own climate plans, let alone the backtracking in the US and elsewhere, this is likely to lead to further backsliding on businesses’ commitments to climate action.” Last week, a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said the government was “committed to making the UK the sustainable finance capital of the world. “The consultation we have launched seeks stakeholder views on a range of approaches to transition plans, including on climate alignment, as part of our commitment to take forward the manifesto commitment in full.”",Financial sector; Corporate governance; Business; Environment; UK news,Business
2025-06-21T06:00:02Z,Investing apps: which offer the most for beginners?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/21/investing-apps-beginners-robo-adviser-platforms-money,"Rachel Reeves and her government colleagues are keen to get more Britons investing in the stock market. She said recently that a lot of money was being put into cash savings accounts “when it could be invested in equities, in stock markets, and earn a better return”. The good news is that the rise of DIY tools and mobile apps means it is now easier than ever to get investing. However, the vast array of options can make it daunting to know where to start. For new investors who don’t have the time or confidence to manage a portfolio, “robo-advisers” can be a good option. They might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie but are basically online investment platforms that use technology to help automate the process. Most are app-based and typically offer a range of ready-made investment portfolios tailored to your individual preferences. You usually fill in a short questionnaire to determine your goals, how long you want to invest for, and how much risk you want to take. Typically, the longer you are investing for, the more risk you can afford to take. But you need to factor in your personal attitude to risk, too. Stocks and shares have historically delivered better returns than savings accounts, but there is also a chance you could lose money – and there will be ups and downs along the way – so you need to feel comfortable about this before taking the leap. The ready-made portfolios typically invest in a selection of exchange traded funds (ETFs). These are low-cost funds that track a chosen index such as a UK or US stock market, government bonds (such as UK gilts or US Treasury bills) or the price of a commodity such as gold. The apps put a selection of these funds together to create a balanced portfolio which spreads your money across different assets. So which of the apps – if any – is right for you? We looked at some of the most popular ones to see how they stack up. Nutmeg Who? One of the first robo-advisers to hit the market, Nutmeg launched in 2012, and in 2021 it was bought by the investment company JPMorgan Chase. It has more than 200,000 users in the UK, with more than £4.5bn invested through the app. Minimum investment: £500 for Isas and pensions, £100 for lifetime Isas and junior Isas. Investment choice: Nutmeg has different tiers of service, which will affect costs. With its fully managed option, you choose a risk level from one to 10, and a team monitors the portfolio and makes regular adjustments. With the fixed allocation option, there are five risk levels and the portfolio is set by the investment team once a year. Fees: Nutmeg says the total charge for the fully managed option is 0.98%. Someone investing £3,000 would pay about £29.40 a year. For fixed allocation, it is 0.65% – about £19.60 a year for that example. We like: Nutmeg is transparent about performance, and you can see how its fully managed portfolios have done over the past decade. For example, the 6/10 risk portfolio has returned 43.4% over 10 years, compared with 36.7% on average for comparable funds. The 5/10 portfolio is up 31.9% over that time, compared with 36.7% for its peers. Anything else? For those who want more support, Nutmeg offers free guidance to help with general questions, and full financial advice starting from £900. Moneybox Who? Launched in 2016, Moneybox specialises in savings and investments and is reported to now have more than 1.5 million customers and in excess of £10bn of assets under management. Minimum investment: You can open an account with as little as £1. Investment choice: There are just three core options: cautious, balanced and adventurous. The cautious option has just 15% in company shares, with 40% in bonds and 40% in cash, which makes it less risky but means your returns may not be as impressive as with other options. The adventurous option has 80% in shares, 15% in property and 5% in bonds. Fees: A £1-a-month subscription fee covers trading costs. Then there’s a 0.45% platform fee, plus the cost of your actual investments – 0.17% for the core funds. Moneybox says someone with £3,000 invested in its balanced fund would pay total charges of 0.85% – about £25.60 a year. We like: The round-ups feature. Link your bank account or credit card to the app, and it will round your spending to the nearest pound and automatically invest the difference. For example, if you spent £1.87, it would be rounded to £2, with 13p invested – a handy way to boost your contributions. Anything else? Those who feel more confident can pick their own ETFs to invest in rather than the ready-made portfolios. Or, if you want to cherrypick specific companies, there is a limited range of stocks to select – though currently only US stocks are available. Dodl Who? Dodl is the newest of this cohort, launched only in 2022, but it is owned by the wealth management giant AJ Bell, which has been around since 1995. Dodl offers a simpler process and lower minimum investment level than its parent company, and a more limited choice of investments. Minimum investment: £100, or set up a direct debit from £25 a month. Fees: 0.15% a year, with a minimum of £1 a month, plus the cost of your investments – 0.31% for the core range. Someone with £3,000 invested would pay about £19.30 a year. Investment choice: The range of ready-made funds, run by AJ Bell, are labelled by risk level – from cautious to global growth. You can also choose individual shares, with the ability to browse by region (either the UK or US) and sector (such as finance, health or technology). We like: The option to invest by theme, which directs you to a relevant ETF for your trend of choice. For example, the “On top of the world” theme invests in the HSBC FTSE All-World, an index of some of the biggest companies around the globe, which charges 0.13%. Other options include “the home team” for UK-focused investments, and “robo revolution” for a fund investing in robotics companies. Anything else? It pays a competitive 4.25% (variable) on cash you have not yet invested. Wealthify Who? Founded in 2014, Wealthify is now owned by the insurance giant Aviva and has about 100,000 customers. It has a big focus on keeping things simple and jargon-free. Minimum investment: Currently £1 for Isas and £50 for pensions, though from Wednesday 25 June the minimums will be £1 for junior Isas, and £500 for stocks and shares Isas and pensions. Investment choice: There are five risk levels: cautious, tentative, confident, ambitious and adventurous. The cautious portfolio has 85% of its assets in government bonds and just 5% in company shares. The adventurous option has 74% in shares and 14% in government bonds, and also invests in property and infrastructure. Fees: The platform fee is 0.6%, which includes the cost of managing your portfolio. The cost of your investment on top is 0.16% for a general portfolio, and 0.7% for the ethical option. That adds up to £22.80 a year, or £39 for the ethical option, for someone with £3,000 invested. There is no minimum fee. We like: Its outlook page, which offers a short overview of the prospects for different investment regions and assets. It’s a handy way for investors to learn a bit more without hours of research. Anything else? Wealthify boasts of various customer service awards on its website – a good reminder to consider factors aside from fees and the investment range. Always be sure to do your own research and read independent reviews before choosing a provider. Moneyfarm Who? Moneyfarm originated in Italy and launched in the UK in 2016. It now has about 160,000 active users and more than £5bn in assets under management. The firm has backing from big investment groups such as M&amp;G and Allianz. Minimum investment: £500. Investment choice: There are seven risk levels for its managed funds, which are regularly rebalanced by the investment team. For example, the 6/7 risk option has 72% of its assets in developed market companies and 10% in emerging markets companies, while the 2/7 risk option invests predominantly in bonds. Fees: Someone with £3,000 in the actively managed option would pay management fees of 0.75%, plus 0.3% for their investments – equivalent to about £31.56 a year. For the fixed allocation options, which are adjusted just once a year, the management fee is 0.45% plus 0.17% for the investments – a total of 0.62%, or about £18.60 a year for that example. We like: It is easy to see a breakdown of each portfolio on the website to understand how it is invested. You can see how it invests by asset type, region and sector – and there’s a simple explanation of each, too. Anything else? As with most of these apps, there is an option to apply environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to your investments, which is good for any investor worried about where their money is going. This will screen out certain investments – for example, heavy polluters or companies with a poor human rights record. Selecting this option typically increases the costs. Need to know Before choosing a robo-advice app or service, make sure the company is regulated by UK watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It should also be a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the UK’s official consumer “lifeboat” scheme which protects up to £85,000 of your money if your provider collapses. Most apps offer a variety of accounts, but a stocks and shares Isa is usually the best choice. You can put up to £20,000 a year into an Isa, and any interest or growth is sheltered from HMRC, meaning you get to keep all of your gains. When it comes to fees, you are usually charged a percentage of the amount you invest – for example, if you invested £1,000 and the fee was 1%, you would pay £10 a year. However, sometimes there is a minimum charge, so check carefully what you would pay.",Investments; Investment funds; Shares; Bonds; Savings; Isas; Money; Consumer affairs; Apps; Technology; Pensions,Money
2024-06-06T11:27:02Z,Boohoo investors seek £100m in damages after minimum wage row,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/06/boohoo-investors-seek-100m-in-damages-after-minimum-wage-row,"A group of investors in Boohoo are seeking more than £100m in compensation from the online fashion specialist after reports in 2020 alleging its suppliers in Leicester were mistreating workers caused its share price to plummet. Shares in Boohoo dived more than 40% over several days, wiping more than £1.5bn off its valuation, after a 2020 Sunday Times report of labour rights violations at the group’s suppliers’ factories in Leicester suggested some workers were paid as little as £3.50 an hour, well below the legal minimum wage. A damning independent report conducted by Alison Levitt QC on behalf of the fast fashion retailer later found that allegations of poor working practices in the company’s supply chain – initially denied – were “substantially true”. A legal claim on behalf of 49 investors including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System – which has investment assets totalling $332.5bn – led by lawyers at Fox Williams filed against Boohoo Group last month alleges the company made untrue or misleading statements and failed to disclose or delayed the disclosure of material information about the matter to the market, breaching its obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The group are understood to be seeking £100m in damages as well as legal costs and interest that could add millions of pounds more to the potential bill for Boohoo. The investors, whose legal filing was first revealed by City AM, say those who bought shares ahead of the 2020 report suffered huge losses as a result of the share price drop when the problems in Boohoo’s supply chain emerged. They say that further exposés on conditions in suppliers’ factories, including a BBC Panorama report screened in November last year, have led Boohoo’s share price to drop further. “Boohoo has long been aware of these issues, failing to keep to past promises of fair production,” said Andrew Hill, a partner at Fox Williams who has previously led two shareholder claims against Tesco that were settled out of court over the supermarket group’s admission of a profits overstatement in 2014. “Boohoo is a prominent example of a company that failed to live up to its environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities and caused significant harm to investors. We believe that our clients have a strong case for compensation. “This is a landmark case that will test the legal framework for securities litigation in the UK and the role of ESG factors in corporate governance and disclosure.” A spokesperson for Boohoo said: “We have been made aware of a claim that is being brought by certain shareholders. The company strongly contests the allegations and will vigorously defend any claim.” According to the high court claims system, Boohoo has instructed the UK-Australian law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. The claim has emerged after protests from shareholders forced Boohoo to ditch a scheme under which its three top bosses were handed £1m in bonuses despite the company reporting a £160m loss.",Boohoo; Corporate governance; Law; Business; Workers' rights; Minimum wage; Society; UK news; Employment law; Fashion industry,Business
2024-10-13T13:00:56Z,Labour’s new green rules for big companies face resistance in the City,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/13/labours-new-green-rules-for-big-companies-face-resistance-in-the-city,"When Keir Starmer launched the Labour party’s 142-page manifesto in June, the future prime minister was dubbed a man of no surprises. But alongside much-trailed pledges to kickstart economic growth and cut NHS waiting lists were newly adopted plans for new environmental regulations for London’s largest listed companies. “Labour will make the UK the green finance capital of the world,” the manifesto said. And to get there, the party pledged to ensure that FTSE 100 companies – as well the City’s banks, asset managers, insurers and pension funds – adopt “credible” climate transition plans in line with the Paris agreement’s pledge to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. That would be on top of disclosing their carbon footprints. Few bosses dare to publicly disagree with Labour’s intent. And nearly every major UK company at least professes to have some form of climate transition plan in place to reach net zero in the coming decades. But the party could face pressure from City lobby groups, including the influential UK Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT) and UK Finance. The concern is that mandates and extra regulation could disadvantage UK business and counter years-long efforts to cut red tape and return the London Stock Exchange to its former glory. Indeed, a report published recently by City veteran and former Legal &amp; General boss Nigel Wilson for CMIT railed against allegedly excessive regulations and oversight introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. While it did not refer to Labour’s pending climate rules, the message was clear: “We cannot expect to achieve meaningful growth while we micromanage business through regulators, second-guessing decisions that rightly belong to company boards, and not trusting investors to be able to make their own investment decisions without feeling the need to look over their shoulders.” There has long been anxiety that London’s 326-year-old stock exchange has lost its appeal. The data is stark: the number of companies listed on has dropped by 30% over the past 15 years, from 1,452 in December 2009 to 1,014 in July this year, according to data from AJ Bell. The anecdotal evidence is worrying too. London has been snubbed for blockbuster IPOs, including by UK chip designer Arm, which opted to list on Wall Street last August. Companies such as Paddy Power-owner Flutter and tourism company Tui announced plans to switch their primary listings to rival hubs like New York and Frankfurt this year. Falling valuations have created cheap opportunities for private equity firms to snap up the likes of investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown and cyber-security business Darktrace, taking even more companies off the exchange. Lawyers, bankers, accountants and investors are worried about losing business and investment opportunities to private and foreign markets. That includes members of CMIT, which is headed by London Stock Exchange boss Julia Hoggett, alongside senior City figures including the bosses of asset manager Schroders, pharmaceuticals company GSK, pension savings provider Phoenix Group and the venture capital firm Lakestar. CMIT, unsurprisingly, welcomed news in July that the Financial Conduct Authority was loosening listing requirements in the biggest shake-up of London’s rules in more than 30 years. This included scrapping the two-tier system of standard and premium listings, which heaped extra requirements on companies for a more prestigious label and entry into FTSE-branded indices. It also controversially meant firms would no longer have to hold shareholder votes before approving larger mergers and takeovers. That sparked concerns about an erosion of shareholder democracy. “We can see why the London Stock Exchange decided to do that,” Roger Barker, director of policy at business lobby group the Institute of Directors, said. “But from the perspective of good governance, it was perhaps just taking it a step too far, removing that degree of shareholder accountability.” Whether CMIT will embrace Labour’s environmental regulations with as much gusto remains to be seen. CMIT members and its press team were approached by the Observer for a comment for this article. Lobby group UK Finance, whose listed and unlisted members both fall under the current scope of the climate proposals, insisted environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials of most large UK businesses were already “pretty strong”. However, theyIt is concerned that Labour’s proposals could result in a “one-size-fits-all rulebook” that would be burdensome to the kind of high-growth businesses that Britain hopes to foster. Adding climate transition plans to an “already-heavy menu” of compliance requests “needs to be thought through”, warned Conor Lawlor, UK Finance’s managing director for capital markets and wholesale policy. “If a huge private company has a raft of staff on reporting and accounting teams, it’s proportionate. But if you’re a high-growth company doing something like [AI chip designer] Nvidia, which is the kind of company that the UK is trying to attract … they’re immediately at a disadvantage”. And while it may not cause companies to immediately flee, it could affect the extent to which those companies “scale, grow and invest” in the UK in the longterm, he said. Lobby groups will likely cite new rules forcing regulators to consider whether they are harming firms’ competitiveness on the global stage. And that could be exacerbated by a growing divergence with the US. An ESG-backlash on the other side of the Atlantic has already dealt a blow to international green initiatives, with the likes of JP Morgan and State Street pulling out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group earlier this year. In August, Texas added NatWest to a growing list of firms accused of boycotting its oil industry, in a move that could limit the UK bank’s business with the US state. No one expects Labour’s proposals to reverse the decline of the City’s stock exchange in the short term, but “if London can position itself as a global centre of financing in this area, that is a huge opportunity”, the IoD’s Barker said. The Treasury said: “Ensuring the UK attracts the most innovative companies to list is compatible with the ambition of making the UK the green finance capital of the world. We will set out further detail on those plans in due course.”",Corporate governance; London Stock Exchange; Stock markets; Business; Economics; FTSE; Banking,Business

In response Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed’s co-founder and CEO, claimed Ramaswamy had “some fundamental misunderstandings” about its business, but offered to meet with him. Ramaswamy, a prominent rightwing supporter of Donald Trump and frequent media critic, now owns 8.4% of BuzzFeed after disclosing his investment last week. In a letter to BuzzFeed’s board in which he argued the business had “lost its way”, Ramaswamy – a biotech entrepreneur – called for a “major shift” in its strategy and vowed to buy more shares. BuzzFeed, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors in the early 2010s as it distributed viral stories across social networks including Facebook and Twitter (now X), has come under significant pressure as traffic from such platforms declined. Shares in the group tanked after it went public on the stock market in 2021. It has laid off hundreds of staff, and shuttered its news division last year. Aside from its main website, today BuzzFeed also owns HuffPost, the news site, and First We Feast, the food-focused site behind Hot Ones, the hit YouTube interview series. Earlier this year it sold most of Complex, a publisher focused on streetwear and pop culture, to Ntwrk for $108.6m – just over two years after buying the business in a $294m deal. In his letter, Ramaswamy urged BuzzFeed to implement widespread job cuts to “get back to startup size”, and focus on video and audio. He also called on the company to own up to what he called its “past journalistic failures”, and drafted a statement for the firm to publish in which it apologized for previous coverage. Ramaswamy, who made his name in politics lambasting the environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda, recommended that BuzzFeed “be bold” and recruit prominent conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens as part of a bid to “challenge” its audience. His list of suggestions also included Bill Maher, Aaron Rodgers and Charles Barkley. In his response to Ramaswamy, Peretti agreed that BuzzFeed was undervalued, but rejected the proposed solutions. “I’m very skeptical it makes business sense to turn BuzzFeed into a creator platform for inflammatory political pundits,” he replied. “And we’re definitely not going to issue an apology for our Pulitzer prize-winning journalism.” Shares in BuzzFeed rose 8% during early trading in New York on Tuesday.",Vivek Ramaswamy; BuzzFeed; Media; Republicans; Business; Digital media; Technology; US news,US news
2024-07-18T10:00:31Z,"Rightwinger Leonard Leo helped fuel Bud Light boycott, tax filings show",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/18/bud-light-boycott-funding,"Tax filings obtained by the Guardian show how the rightwing dark money impresario Leonard Leo helped fuel the Bud Light boycott in response to ads featuring the transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney, an effort that generated threats against Mulvaney, violence against consumers and layoffs by Anheuser-Busch. Uncovered by the watchdog group Accountable.US, the filings for 2022 show the Concord Fund, a group linked to Leo, gave $350,000 to Consumers Defense, an arm of Consumers’ Research, not long before that group played a central role in the Bud Light boycott. Leo is a Catholic conservative activist widely known as the force behind the Federalist Society, which has helped transform the US courts system, ultimately through the installation of three hardline justices on the supreme court that has handed down epochal rulings on abortion rights, presidential immunity and more. But Leo’s fundraising work ranges wider. Consumers’ Research was formed in 1929 to champion consumers’ rights, but went largely dormant before being revived as a rightwing watchdog. It now claims to lead “the fight against ESG”, or environmental, social and governance policies, in corporate America. It issues “woke alerts” concerning companies it deems to be “putting progressive activists and their dangerous agendas ahead of customers”. Links between Leo and Consumers’ Research are known but have not been directly confirmed. In 2021, Marble Freedom Trust, a non-profit controlled by Leo, received a record $1.6bn donation from Barre Seid, a Chicago billionaire. That year and in 2022, Consumers’ Research enjoyed huge funding boosts when it received nearly $15m from Donors Trust. That group, linked to Leo, calls itself a “principled philanthropic partner for conservative and libertarian donors”. It has also been called the “dark-money ATM of the right”. The New York Times and Bloomberg previously linked Leo to the sudden funding influx to Consumers’ Research. Leo did not comment. Consumers’ Research is also known to be a client of CRC Advisors, Leo’s for-profit firm. The tax filings obtained by the Guardian show another direct link. In January 2023, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, Federalist Society alum Will Hild, told the Washington Post Leo was “a good friend and adviser”. Leo said: “Consumers’ Research and … Will Hild are executing the most impactful pushback I know against ESG and other aspects of woke corporate culture. It’s time that businesses that are out of step with the sentiments of most Americans pay a price for their standing up for woke special interest instead of consumers.” In spring 2023, Anheuser-Busch paid such a price. It began with a video featuring Mulvaney, a trans influencer. “Happy March Madness!!” she wrote. “Just found out this had to do with sports and not just saying it’s a crazy month! In celebration of this sports thing @budlight is giving you the chance to win $15,000! Share a video with #EasyCarryContest for a chance to win!! Good luck! #budlightpartner.” It seemed innocuous, but rightwing anger, primed by culture-wars battles over trans imagery in business and education, fueled calls for a boycott. Consumers’ Research launched a six-figure “woke alerts” digital ad campaign, offering to text shoppers wanting to know if a product was “woke” or not. Hild said: “In light of the recent direction taken by companies like Bud Light, Jack Daniels, and Bank of America, we are launching ‘woke alerts’ to help consumers make better-informed decisions about where to spend their money. “We believe companies should focus on their customers and not woke politicians and progressive activists.” The boycott attracted rightwing celebrities, notably including the rapper Kid Rock, and politicians, notably Ron DeSantis, the culture war-loving governor of Florida, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. It all attracted wide coverage, on networks including Fox Business. At the end of 2023, in a year-end review that also touted efforts against Target, Bank of America, Disney and BlackRock, Consumers’ Research celebrated. Calling Anheuser-Busch “the quintessential American beer company”, the group said: “Bud Light’s vice-president of marketing said that she intended to update the so-called ‘fratty’ and ‘out of touch’ brand. However, this led to an extreme drop in sales as they deeply offended their core customer base.” Anheuser-Busch, Consumers’ Research crowed, was now “paying a price”. That much was evidently true. Company facilities reported threats, which CNN said included a bomb threat to a brewery in Los Angeles. In Vaughan, Ontario, police said a couple were assaulted after buying Bud Light. By July 2023, Bud Light was no longer the No 1-selling US beer and Anheuser-Busch shares were down. The company announced 350 layoffs. Mulvaney also suffered. “For months now, I’ve been scared to leave my house,” she said. “I have been ridiculed in public. I’ve been followed, and I have felt a loneliness that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.” Leo did not respond to a request for comment. Caroline Ciccone, president of Accountable.US, said: “Leonard Leo hasn’t just leveraged his dark money network to reshape our courts for the worse – he’s also fueling hateful anti-LGBTQ+ causes. “Leo’s billion-dollar operation and web of shadowy organisations actively work to marginalise vulnerable communities, posing a direct threat to LGBTQ+ Americans.”",US news; AB InBev,US news
2024-11-20T14:00:06Z,"Australia’s Future Fund to invest in housing, infrastructure and energy transition under new mandate",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/australia-future-fund-sovereign-wealth-changes-housing-infrstructure-energy,"Australia’s $230bn sovereign wealth fund will be retooled to help build houses, improve infrastructure and combat global heating under a new investment mandate. The Albanese government has announced that the independently managed Future Fund will get a new investment mandate and statement of expectations, the latter of which is the first update for the financial asset fund in 15 years. Under the changes, the fund will have to consider national priorities including increasing the domestic supply of residential housing, continuing to support the energy transition as part of the net zero transformation of the Australian economy, and delivering improved local infrastructure including economic resilience and security infrastructure. The government is hoping a greater certainty of investment in assets that have long-term benefits will encourage more supply of housing and clean energy projects. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Greg Combet, the chair of the Future Fund board of guardians, said it would appoint a new executive director responsible for the energy transition in response to the changes. “We have also long recognised the importance of environmental, social and governance issues in our investment process and will add resources in this area,” he said. Established in 2006 by the Howard government, the Future Fund has $230bn under management, making it the government’s largest financial asset. It is expected to grow to $380bn by 2032-33, with a benchmark for growth of returns of 4% to 5% above inflation over the long term. In a joint statement the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the changes “will mean more investment where we need it most but not at the expense of returns”. “The government is also confirming the fund’s enduring role in strengthening the commonwealth’s long-term financial position and covering unfunded superannuation liabilities,” they said. “To support this, the government won’t start any drawdowns from the fund until at least 2032-33, providing the fund the certainty it needs to continue to build its portfolio. “The government remains committed to the fund’s independence and commercial focus.” They added that the fund’s primary objective would continue to be to maximise returns, there was no change to the benchmark growth rate and “there will be no change to the expected risk profile”. The Future Fund board of guardians welcomed the announcement, which it said provided the foundation for it “to be an enduring institution able to invest for the long term, and at the same time further strengthen the nation’s balance sheet”. Combet, who began his term as board chair in June, said the policies “are an endorsement of the work that the Future Fund has done over 18 years to deliver its demanding investment mandate”. “The government’s decision to defer withdrawals from the Future Fund until at least 2032-33 provides the Future Fund with the confidence to provide more focus and resources to the areas of national priority identified in the new investment mandate that align with our risk and return hurdle. “The priority areas are aligned with the Future Fund’s thinking … and consistent with its investment focus on seeking more local currency exposure and protection against sustained higher inflation.” The Future Fund has invested in Tilt Renewables, a provider of 1.8GW of power from wind, solar and battery storage projects, in a third runway at Melbourne airport, and in a terminal and runway at Perth airport.",Australian economy; Australian politics; Australia news; Jim Chalmers; Infrastructure; Housing; Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy; Renewable energy,Business
2025-04-01T05:00:08Z,Trumpism is sinking democratic values. It’s Starmer’s job to steer the UK back to safety | Polly Toynbee,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/01/labour-trump-tariffs-national-insurance-council-tax,"The prime minister may pretend to “like and respect” Donald Trump, but elsewhere in parliament anti-Americanism is running hot. In a Lords debate on obesity last week, Labour’s Lord Brooke suggested imposing 25% tariffs on “American products which are causing us difficulties – Coca-Cola, Pepsi, KFC, McDonald’s”. The government replied that the US is an “indispensable ally”. That craven attitude may be politic today – right until it fails tomorrow. The outlook for Britain and other countries is bleak. Wednesday is “liberation day”, when Trump’s tariffs will hit a range of goods likely to send global economies tumbling. There is near-zero expectation that Britain’s genuflections will save us from the same punishment as the rest. As for Trump demanding no VAT on US imports to the UK, that’s extorting with menaces a benefit denied to our own producers. Even if kissing the boot did appease, how cheap do we sell national dignity? As this hurricane rages across the Atlantic, the Brexit reset is gathering speed and public support at home, and not just because the Office for Budget Responsibility warned again last week that Brexit is losing us an alarming 15% in EU trade. Before the crucial 19 May EU-UK summit, the signs are good that “the coalition of the willing” is a spirit that flows beyond armies and weapons to trade and youth mobility. Europe rearming doesn’t presage any actual confrontation with Russian armies on the ground, but the symbolism fosters a united front against rogue states to our east and west. Europeans are standing together as guardians of liberal democratic values, as Trump’s McCarthyism-on-speed intimidates institutions, rewrites history and rips up universal principles that value universities, the arts and museums. Look how Trump’s political threats reach all the way into Europe. A letter sent from US embassies in Europe last week ordered foreign companies and organisations with US contracts or links to obey Trump’s executive order to “certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion). The French foreign trade ministry replied brusquely to that abusive letter: “France and Europe will defend their companies, their consumers and their values.” But many companies are already quietly silencing their environmental, social and governance or DEI schemes for fear of him. The advertising giant WPP is one that has quietly dropped reference to “DE&amp;I” from its annual report. Nature reports that 75% of US scientists are considering leaving the country as research programmes are axed, fearing the loss of their data and their work. Right across Europe, approval of America is falling. Scientists may not be “huddled masses”, but the land of the free is now this side of the ocean. Though this trust in Europe as freedom’s bastion depends on Europeans not succumbing to sirens of its far-right movements. In Britain the tariffs will land in a harsh week when employers’ national insurance contributions increase, alongside a 5% rise in council tax in most places – though a welcome jump in the minimum wage gives 3.5 million people a well above inflation boost. But Labour supporters are left stricken by that gut-wrenching £5bn cut landing on disabled households. It is only a fraction of the £36bn that Tom Waters of the IFS tells me the Tories cut in all from working age benefits as they plunged 700,000 more children below the poverty line, but that’s almost beside the point. The shock is that a Labour government, a Labour government, would do this. That’s bad timing. As the country and Europe face up to the civilisational threat of naked US thuggery, the values of social justice need defending. As Keir Starmer finds a confident footing in asserting united European principles, Labour needs to rethink its trajectory at home. There the party sits with a stupendous majority, unlikely to be seen again, masters of all it surveys. So long as it doesn’t crash the economy, it has nothing to fear but fear itself. Whatever it does, the old enemy will abuse it. The Telegraph is running out of absurd hyperbole – abyss, Armageddon, apocalypse – to describe “the worst government at the most dangerous possible time”. There’s little to fear from the Tories. Kemi Badenoch’s search for meaning alights unerringly on the wrong side of public opinion: opposing net zero ambitions, praising a flat tax or thinking she’s friends with JD Vance. Fear Nigel Farage? He may have already taken all available Labour voters. The greater risk is losing the disappointed to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Yet Labour seems too frit to use its untrammelled power. As Trumpism reminds us all that democratic values are in peril, Labour must make urgent repairs in the UK. Speed up genuine reform of the risible Lords. Bring in electoral reform before the system that delivered Labour the least democratic result in history – 63% of seats from just 34% of the votes – does the same or worse for some worse party: that has public support. Workers’ rights are a good flagship policy, tilting the balance back from gig economy exploitation: there must be no giving in to intensive lobbying from business. Revise anti-protest laws reminiscent of the Tolpuddle martyr era. If Europe is the refuge of freedoms hard-won over the decades, then all countries need to guard against any slippage into Trumpism. Use this exceptional majority to set right a crooked tax system. Unjust council tax has been too politically toxic to touch, leaving Buckingham Palace paying less than a semi in Blackburn. Rebalancing council tax would cut it for 70% of people and raise it only for the best-off 30%. Fix those hundreds of tax reliefs, worth billions, which the National Audit Office found completely uncosted or unchecked for their usefulness. Britain still taxes and spends less than our neighbours. Be brave and issue defence bonds or a levy now, when it’s plain that defence money is needed, as well as funding for social care, the NHS, schools and children. There must be no capitulating to Trump on the digital service tax that charges the likes of X, Apple, Meta and Amazon a fair tax on UK profits: that would make Britain lose face as well as money. The public mood is well illustrated by a Lib Dem poster I saw. It shows Elon Musk – “Cutting taxes for him?” – and a schoolchild – “Cutting lunch for her?” “Change”, Labour promised. All these fixes require Labour to change itself, and to cast aside fear and political strangulation imposed from the top. Labour has little to lose. In these days of deep political mistrust, doing what’s necessary, popular or not, would strike a stronger political note. As Starmer takes Britain into a new closeness with Europe for security and protection, asserting our mutual liberal values is the prime defence against assault from across the Atlantic.

2024-06-12T11:46:19Z,Multiple bands pull out of Download festival over Barclays’ Israel ties,https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/12/multiple-bands-pull-out-of-download-festival-over-barclays-israel-ties,"Multiple bands have pulled out of Download festival over Barclaycard being used as its official payment partner, in protest against Barclays providing financial services to defence companies supplying Israel. Download, the UK’s biggest rock, metal and punk festival which takes place from 14 to 16 June, lists Barclaycard as one of its official sponsors alongside Liquid Death, Red Bull and others. Leeds band Pest Control wrote: “We cannot sacrifice the principles held by this band and by the scene we come from and represent, just for personal gain.” As a result of their boycott, punk bands Speed, Scowl and Zulu also pulled out of the festival over the Barclays sponsorship, criticising the bank for the financial services it provides. British metalcore band Ithaca joined the boycott on Tuesday evening. “Once we were made aware of Barclays’ involvement in Download we knew we could no longer participate,” the band said in a statement to the Guardian. “This moment of solidarity is an opportunity for festival organisers to reflect carefully on who they take money from and see that the younger generation of bands will no longer be silent.” Download festival has not commented on the boycott. The Guardian has contacted organisers for comment. The bands’ decisions follow a widespread boycott of Brighton’s Barclaycard-sponsored Great Escape festival in May, with more than 100 acts pulling out of that event. Barclays has recently drawn ire from pro-Palestine campaigners. This week members of activist group Palestine Action vandalised about 20 branches of Barclays across the UK, including smashing windows and daubing them with red paint; in Edinburgh, rocks inscribed with the names of dead Palestinians were thrown at a bank branch. The actions were undertaken with climate activists Shut the System, with Palestine Action saying they “demand the bank divests from Israel’s weapons trade and fossil fuels”. The UK-based Palestine Solidarity Campaign calls for a boycott of the bank over its “grave complicity in Israel’s attacks on Palestinians”, alleging Barclays “now holds over £2bn in shares, and provides £6.1bn in loans and underwriting” to companies providing weapons systems to Israel. It is also one of the “divestment and exclusion” targets named by the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. In a statement posted online, Barclays addresses the criticism. “We have been asked why we invest in nine defence companies supplying Israel, but this mistakes what we do,” the company wrote. “We trade in shares of listed companies in response to client instruction or demand and that may result in us holding shares. Whilst we provide financial services to these companies, we are not making investments for Barclays and Barclays is not a ‘shareholder’ or ‘investor’ in that sense in relation to these companies.” Specifically regarding Israeli defence company Elbit, Barclays stated: “We may hold shares in relation to client driven transactions, which is why we appear on the share register, but we are not investors.” The statement adds: “The UK government said that supporting high-quality, well-run defence companies is compatible with ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] considerations. It is the role of government to decide foreign policy and laws which restrict the delivery of weapons to any one country.” Barclays also condemned the actions by Palestine Action this week, saying: “While we support the right to protest, we ask that campaigners do so in a way which respects our customers, colleagues and property.” When contacted by the Guardian for comment, Barclays provided a condensed version of the above statements, and said it had supported the UK music and arts sector with £112m over the past 20 years. Pepsi Max is also listed as a Download sponsor. Its manufacturer PepsiCo is the owner of carbonated drink company SodaStream and co-owner of food manufacturer Sabra, two of the eight companies or product groups targeted for consumer boycotts by BDS. The bands boycotting Download have not mentioned Pepsi Max in their statements. Other music festivals sponsored by Barclays this summer include Latitude and Isle of Wight. In May, the activist group Bands Boycott Barclays told the Guardian it would approach the festivals’ organisers “in good faith” to voice their concern about links with the bank. • This article was updated to on Wednesday 12 June to reflect that BDS includes Barclays on its list of “divestment and exclusion” targets.",Download festival; Metal; Punk; Music; Music festivals; Culture; Festivals; Pop and rock; UK news; Barclays; Gaza; Palestinian territories; Israel,Music
2024-02-14T18:59:39Z,Virgin Money faces investor backlash over CEO David Duffy’s £2.6m pay deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/14/virgin-money-faces-investor-backlash-over-ceo-david-duffys-26m-pay-deal,"Virgin Money bosses could be at risk of an embarrassing investor backlash, after an influential adviser hit out at a £2.6m package for its chief executive, David Duffy, saying it was “not appropriate” compared with the bank’s average employee. Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), which advises shareholders including UK local authority pension funds, also raised concerns over what it said was “a lack of board-level accountability for sustainability issues” at Britain’s sixth largest lender. Pirc is urging investors to vote against two resolutions at Virgin Money’s AGM on 1 March, when the lender will ask for backing for its annual report and pay report. The pay report explains how a dedicated committee of board members decided on the final payouts for bosses, based on their performance over the last financial year. The shareholder adviser said it was concerned over the level of Duffy’s package, which includes a £331,000 bonus, and is 37 times higher than the average Virgin Money worker, who earns £71,804 a year. “The ratio of CEO pay compared to that of the average employee exceeds the recommended limit of 20:1 and is therefore not considered appropriate,” Pirc said. Median pay figures – which calculate the mid-point of the range of salaries at the bank – suggest an even larger gap. According to Virgin Money’s annual report, the chief executive’s total payout was 66 times that of the £40,254 earned by the median employee. A shareholder rebellion would be a blow to the FTSE 250 bank, which just last year passed its pay policy with 98% approval. It would also be an embarrassment to Duffy, who has run the banking group since 2015, before Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group launched its £1.7bn takeover of Virgin Money in 2018. The Pirc report comes after Virgin Money revealed a 42% drop in annual pre-tax profits in November, as it was forced to put aside £309m to protect itself against potential defaults. The lender also announced last summer that it would shut 39 of its branches, accounting for nearly a third of its network, in a move that put 260 jobs at risk. It has left about 90 branches across the UK. Virgin Money defended its pay decisions, saying a statement that “offering competitive remuneration packages to senior leaders is essential to secure and retain talented individuals, with pay outcomes in line with the group’s remuneration policy, which was approved by c.98% of shareholders at the February 2023 AGM and benchmarked against industry”. The bank added that its board “has oversight of climate change risk and holds our business to account, with clear governance in place and strategic goals aligned to ESG [environmental, social and governance] objectives. “We are advocates of ESG transparency with robust targets, tracking and disclosures in our annual report and included on a dedicated sustainability hub on our website.”",Virgin Group; Executive pay and bonuses; Banking; UK news; Business; Banks and building societies; Stock markets; Money,Business
2024-06-23T08:30:08Z,Woke capitalism is not to be sneered at. Gen Z is a mighty force for change | Martha Gill,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/23/woke-capitalism-gen-z,"Young people are used to being told they expect too much when it comes to the world of work. Judge Judy, Whoopi Goldberg and Jodie Foster were among the latest of their elders to give them a ticking off – accusing indulgent parents of setting them up to fail. Curmudgeonly employers would not pander to their requests for better hours, they said, or align themselves with their pet social causes, as young people seemed to think. But as generation Z starts to make up a chunkier portion of workers, another story is emerging. The “unreasonable” demands of this generation are in fact beginning to be met. Instead of giving young people a rude awakening, the corporate world is falling over backwards to accommodate them – you cannot, after all, fire a whole generation. A report in the Financial Times charts the rise of gen Z “whisperers”: advisers, among them big consulting firms such as Edelman, that are helping companies adapt to their young employees and ensure, too, that they appeal to younger customers. Managers feel particularly pressured these days, the report found, to take a stand on social causes. Activist young workers are not the only force pushing companies in a more socially liberal direction. There is investor pressure from above and customer concerns from without. Shareholders are aware that the market responds when companies take a stand: firms that pulled out of Russia as soon as it invaded Ukraine did better than those who only made the decision later, according to a study by the Yale School of Management. Consumers, meanwhile, increasingly expect companies to speak out on issues of social justice, and are quick to condemn them for perceived failures. PwC’s customer loyalty survey in 2022 recorded that gen X and millennial customers were more likely to support brands that signal progressive beliefs. SP Global finds a positive correlation between business outcomes and support for ESG – strategies that marry environmental, social and governance issues. Investments in ESG are predicted to grow rapidly. “Woke capitalism”, a term coined by the writer Ross Douthat, tends to be criticised from two directions. On the left, activists complain about hypocrisy – that companies do not always follow through on their so-called values. On the right, critics such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, who wrote about the issue in the Telegraph last week, claim that diversity hiring and spending money on environmental causes is bad for business. Both squabbles, though, miss the larger story, which is that this change in corporate signalling tracks and demonstrates a huge social shift. Companies, if they want to sell things and attract employees, must align themselves with the values of their time. Ours are changing. It might be easy to miss if you are focused only on Westminster’s turbulent politics and the past 14 years of Conservative government, but Britain, along with much of the western world, is becoming ever more liberal. It’s not just the young, although they are moving the fastest: the change is evident in every generation. The gulf we have crossed in the last 40 years is astonishing. In 1981, just 12% of Britons thought homosexuality “justifiable”, according to a recent study at King’s College London. Now two-thirds of us think so. This change of heart mostly occurred very recently: in 2009, only a third thought being gay was acceptable. Around half of the public reckoned same-sex relationships were “always wrong” in 1983; when the question was asked again two years ago, it was 9%. What once were pressing moral concerns – divorce, casual sex, whether women with young children should go out to work – have become facts of life for most people. In 1999, just one in 10 Brits thought casual sex could be justified; in 2022, 42% did. In the last 30 years, there has been a similar shift on abortion, once tolerated by only 14%, and now by nearly half. The British social attitudes survey shows racism has rapidly declined, as has prejudice against those with Aids, along with support for the death penalty. Forty years ago, 75% of people thought that ironing, in a heterosexual relationship, was the woman’s job. That has dropped to 16%. This is what really underlies “woke capitalism”. Where we choose to work and what we buy reflects – perhaps more than other measures – our social preoccupations. In the 1880s, when it was founded, Unilever’s purpose was “to make cleanliness commonplace and lessen the load for women”. Now it is to “make sustainable living commonplace”. Political signalling on the part of big firms is not new. In 1969, not long after the Detroit race riots and the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, Coca-Cola showed an advert called “boys on a bench”, a group of black and white teens sitting together. It followed this with “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing”, its famous ad promoting harmony between races. In the 1960s, some companies took positions against the Vietnam war, and some against apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s. Rees-Mogg, fretting about shareholder value, should remember, too, that firms tend to act in their best interest. If a “woke” advert or company mission statement goes down badly, or turns out to reflect a tiny pressure group rather than the views of most people, it is often withdrawn. Those objecting from the left should take heart too. Their side is winning. Where fights emerge, it is mostly over the pace of change, not the direction itself. When the activist group Fossil Free Books was pilloried over its campaign to make Baillie Gifford divest from fossil fuels, critics did not dispute that the planet needed saving. Instead, they pointed out that the target was wrong, and the strategy poor: Baillie Gifford was fairly woke already. It is in squabbles such as these that our politics, as a country, become clear. Values are not only recorded at the ballot box. • Martha Gill is an Observer columnist",Young people; Society; Business; Activism; Jacob Rees-Mogg; Work & careers; Work-life balance,Opinion
2025-07-03T11:48:35Z,"Global firms ‘profiting from genocide’ in Gaza, says UN rapporteur",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/03/global-firms-profiting-israel-genocide-gaza-united-nations-rapporteur,"The UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories has called for sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel and for global corporations to be held accountable for “profiting from genocide” in Gaza. A report by Francesca Albanese to the UN Human Rights Council on Thursday points to the deep involvement of companies from around the world in supporting Israel during its 21-month onslaught in Gaza. “While life in Gaza is being obliterated and the West Bank is under escalating assault, this report shows why Israel’s genocide continues: because it is lucrative for many,” the report says. Special rapporteurs are independent human rights experts appointed to advise or report on specific situations. Albanese, an Italian legal scholar who has been the special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories since 2022, first referred to the Israeli offensive in Gaza as a genocide in January 2024. The international court of justice (ICJ) is weighing the charge of genocide against Israel but Albanese has argued that the evidence of genocide is overwhelming and pointed out that the court issued preliminary measures last year recognising the possibility of genocide in Gaza, triggering universal responsibility to prevent it. Israel has largely ignored the ICJ’s calls on it to take steps to mitigate the toll on Palestinian civilians and disputed the court’s jurisdiction. Albanese said there was no reason to wait for an ICJ judgment, which she said was only being delayed by the long queue of cases the court has to judge. “I have investigated it day by day for 630 days and, frankly, after five months I could tell you that it was genocide. You don’t need a scientist to establish what is genocide. You just need to connect the dots,” she told the Guardian. “Israel has [committed] acts that are recognised as genocidal, like acts of killing nearly 60,000 people, probably more, creation of conditions of life calculated to destroy, destruction of 80% of the homes and no water, no food.” According to the Gaza health ministry, more than 56,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which was triggered in October 2023 when a Hamas attack killed 1,200 Israelis. Many experts have said the real death toll in Gaza could be much higher as many Palestinians are missing and believed to be buried under the rubble. The special rapporteur’s report is titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide” and looks at international corporate involvement in supplying weapons and supplying heavy machinery used to raze Palestinian neighbourhoods in Gaza and the West Bank, agricultural companies selling produce from illegal settlements, and investment firms helping fund the war. “While political leaders and governments shirk their obligations, far too many corporate entities have profited from Israel’s economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and, now, genocide,” the report says. “The complicity exposed by this report is just the tip of the iceberg; ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable, including its executives.” The report says the Israeli military has benefited from “the largest ever defence procurement programme” for the F-35 fighter jet, made by Lockheed Martin with the involvement of more than 1,600 other manufacturers and eight states. It says Israel was the first to fly the warplane in “beast mode”, carrying 18,000lb of bombs at a time. On Monday the UK’s high court ruled that Britain’s export of parts for the F-35 to Israel was lawful on the grounds that a court should not intervene in a sensitive political issue that was best left to ministers and parliament, even though it said UK-made parts could be used in the “commission of a serious violation of international humanitarian law in the conflict in Gaza”. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said: “Foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions. Discussions about those sales are best addressed by the US government.” The Trump administration has been enthusiastically supportive of Israel in the Gaza war. On its website, Lockheed Martin says it is “proud of the significant role it has fulfilled in the security of the state of Israel”. The US technology firm Palantir comes under particular criticism in the Albanese report for its close partnership with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), with which the company agreed a strategic partnership for Palantir to assist its “war-related missions”. Palantir, whose software allows automated decision-making on the battlefield, has denied any involvement in the IDF’s Lavender or Gospel programmes for identifying targets in Gaza. Palantir did not respond to a request for comment but has said in response to earlier allegations: “We have no relationship to these programmes and their use but are proud to support Israeli defence and national security missions in other programmes and contexts.” It said it took a variety of methods to “mitigate against human rights risk in our work”. The Albanese report also criticises heavy equipment manufacturers such as Caterpillar and Volvo for allegedly supplying heavy machinery used in mass demolitions of homes, mosques and infrastructure in Gaza and the West Bank. “These companies have continued supplying the Israeli market despite abundant evidence of Israel’s criminal use of this machinery and repeated calls from human rights groups to sever ties,” Albanese says in the report. “Passive suppliers become deliberate contributors to a system of displacement.” Caterpillar did not respond to a request for comment. Volvo said much of the equipment being used had been acquired on the secondhand market, over which it had no influence. The Sweden-based company has an agreement with an Israeli company, Merkavim, to assemble buses on Volvo chassis. A Volvo spokesperson said the agreement included a requirement that “Merkavim shall comply with applicable laws and regulations and the Volvo Group supply partner code of conduct, which includes specific human rights requirements.” Albanese pointed to an ICJ advisory opinion last year that said Israel’s continued presence in the occupied territories was unlawful and that Merkavim was on a UN database of companies operating on the West Bank. “So the due diligence that is imposed on Volvo is to withdraw immediately from the partnership that it has with companies that are on the database and with Israel,” she said. The report notes that Israel has helped pay for the war and consequent deep budget deficits by selling treasury bonds. By buying them, the report argues, international finance has helped keep the war going. “Some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade,” it says. It names asset management firms including Pimco (owned by the German-based financial services company Allianz) and Vanguard as major buyers of Israeli treasury bonds. Pimco declined to comment. A spokesperson for Vanguard said the company “maintains robust policies and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and sanctions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes adhering to laws that may require specific investment restrictions in companies that are sanctioned for human rights abuses.” The report also points to the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, for having increased its investment in Israeli companies by 32% since October 2023. On Monday, Norway’s biggest pension fund, KLP, announced it would no longer do business with two companies – the Oshkosh Corporation in the US and ThyssenKrupp in Germany – because they sell equipment to the Israeli military that could be being used in Gaza. Neither company is named in the UN report. Oshkosh did not reply to a request for comment. A ThyssenKrupp spokesperson said the company “conducts its deliveries exclusively on the basis of lawful authorisations and in strict compliance with the foreign and security policy guidelines of the Federal Republic of Germany. The German government is involved in the process from the outset, with preliminary inquiries submitted before any project begins.” KLP is a separate entity from GPFG but they are closely associated and reportedly share their environmental, social and governance analyses of investments around the world. A GPFG spokesperson said: “The market value of our investments in Israel has increased but this is not because we have increased our ownership – the market value has increased due to returns.” They added that its investments were overseen by a council of ethics appointed by Norway’s ministry of finance, which has excluded some firms because of “serious violations”. “As a responsible investor, we monitor our investments and expect companies to conduct enhanced due diligence in situations of war and conflict,” the spokesperson said. Albanese’s report points to precedents in holding corporations legally accountable for human rights abuses they enable, including the prosecution of leading German industrialists at the Nuremberg tribunal after the second world war, in what was known as the IG Farben trial. Another example cited is the South African truth and reconciliation commission, which took the country’s big companies to task for their involvement in apartheid. The UN published its own benchmarks in 2011, in its guiding principles on business and human rights, which said corporations had a responsibility to do due diligence to ensure they were not infringing human rights and to take steps to address harmful effects of their business. In her recommendations, Albanese calls for sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel, and urges the international criminal court “and national judiciaries to investigate and prosecute corporate executives and/or corporate entities for their part in the commission of international crimes and laundering of the proceeds from those crimes”. • This article was amended on 3 July 2025.

2024-06-25T06:00:06Z,EU-regulated ‘sustainable’ funds invest £14bn in biggest polluters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/eu-regulated-sustainable-funds-invest-14bn-in-biggest-polluters,"Fast fashion labels, fossil fuel companies and SUV-makers are present in EU-regulated “sustainable” funds that tout their ethical credentials in their names, the Guardian and media partners can reveal, with $18bn (£14bn) of their investments going to the 200 biggest polluters. Investors hold more than $87bn (£68bn) in funds that disclose under environmental and social sections of EU sustainable finance rules while including some of the biggest emitters of planet-heating gas, an analysis of data from the last quarter of 2023 shows. About one-fifth of the $87bn investments come from funds that also market themselves using environmentally-friendly terms. Campaigners have called for tighter rules on labelling, arguing that the current system confuses investors and means ordinary people unwittingly contribute to climate breakdown. “Pension savers and the general public are being misled when it comes to sustainable finance,” said Lara Cuvelier, a sustainable investment campaigner at Reclaim Finance. The investigation, led by Voxeurop in partnership with the Guardian and other media partners, identified the 25 biggest polluters in each of the eight most carbon-intensive sectors and tracked investments from funds that disclose under the EU’s sustainable finance directive. The bulk of investments into the 200 biggest polluters came from funds classified under article 8, which promotes environmental or social goals, with a further $2bn coming from funds classified under article 9, whose main objective is sustainable investment. The regulations were not designed for marketing purposes but the classifications are often used to showcase a financial product’s environmental credentials. This month the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European banking and insurance watchdogs called for sweeping reforms to the system to tackle greenwashing. “Status as ‘article 8’ or ‘article 9’ products have been used since the outset in marketing material as ‘quality labels’ for sustainability, consequently posing greenwashing and mis-selling risks,” the watchdogs said. They called instead for simpler product categories that are clearer to investors. Campaigners have criticised the scale of the misuse. The analysis found that $11.7bn of investments into the biggest polluters came from funds whose name included “ESG” – environmental, social and governance – while $1.1bn came from funds whose names included climate-specific words such as “clean”, “transition”, “net zero” and “Paris”. The latter two terms refer to the Paris climate agreement that world leaders signed in 2015 to try to stop the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels by the end of the century – a task that entails slashing pollution fast to hit net zero emissions by 2050. Despite this, the top 10 recipients of EU-regulated green funds include fossil fuel companies drilling for more oil and carmakers selling ever bigger vehicles, the analysis found. “Europe’s biggest green portfolios are just the same dirty companies, repackaged as sustainable,” said Xavier Sol, the sustainable finance director at the campaign group Transport and Environment. “We need private capital to accelerate the green transition rather than hinder it,” he added. “Only investments earmarked for green activities should be given a sustainable label.” The ESMA adopted an updated set of guidelines last month that prohibits funds with significant fossil fuel investments from marketing themselves as green. The rules, which will come into effect later this year, are not legally binding, and national regulators can choose to ignore them. Cuvelier said regulators had so far only shown investors the carrot, and not the stick. “We’re seeing now that it’s not enough,” she said. The analysis also found one-quarter of the investments into big polluters came from just 10 asset managers. Several of them said they complied with the EU’s regulatory framework and would update policies if they were to change. They challenged the claim that their investments conflicted with climate goals. Amundi said: “The energy transition will only happen if all economic players change. Amundi therefore has a duty to support and encourage the transformation of all companies and sectors.” Intesa Sanpaolo said: “Investments in high-carbon sectors do not conflict with either the SFDR [sustainable finance disclosure regulation] goals of transparency in sustainability investments, or with the Paris agreement, which promotes a transition to a low-carbon economy.” Fidelity said: “As active stewards of capital, we believe that fostering change through a positive engagement approach rather than exclusion (or disinvestment) policy is the most effective way to positively influence corporate behaviour.” Experts are divided on the benefits of excluding big polluters from investment funds. Campaigners have argued that divesting from fossil fuel companies reduces their share prices and makes it harder to get loans for new projects – pressing them to go green faster. Others have cautioned that the financial consequences for the companies are small – particularly for profitable oil and gas firms that do not need to issue new shares to finance their operations – and that divestment campaigns are more useful in challenging their “social licence to operate” rather than hitting their bottom line. “Decarbonisation is such a massive task that establishing a small ‘green niche’ of sustainable investment funds on its own will contribute very little,” said Jan Fichtner, a sustainable finance research fellow at the University of Witten/Herdecke. “EU rules should focus much more on setting credible and binding minimum standards for proxy voting and private engagements – for sustainable funds but also for conventional funds.” This article is part of an investigation coordinated by Voxeurop and European Investigative Collaborations with the support of the Bertha Challenge fellowship.

2025-02-05T07:00:30Z,EU leaders talk the talk on defence. But where will they find the billions to pay for it? | Paul Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/05/eu-leaders-defence-europe-russia-attack-military,"EU leaders agreed at their summit with Keir Starmer in Brussels this week that much more spending is urgently needed to support Ukraine and to strengthen Europe’s own defences. But they have yet to get real about how to fund it, how to spend it, or how to staff it. Nearly three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine upended European security, an immediate and sustained surge in defence investment is needed to rearm Kyiv and protect the continent from Russian aggression and Chinese assertiveness. Some military commanders and intelligence services have said Europe may have as little as three to five years to prepare for a potential Russian attack on a Nato country. Others see a longer timeline of perhaps eight years as a result of Moscow’s heavy casualties in Ukraine. But given the way that Vladimir Putin has hardened his revisionist ideology, built a war economy and forged strategic partnerships with China, Iran and North Korea, the risk of confrontation is clearly rising unless he can be pushed back in Ukraine. Europe is already facing Russian covert warfare in and around EU and Nato territory, with increasingly frequent acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, disinformation, election interference and assassination attempts. In recent weeks alone, Russian and Chinese ships have been detained on suspicion of repeatedly cutting undersea cables in the Baltic Sea. Yet while the imperative to build Europe’s military deterrence is widely acknowledged after three decades of neglect, most European countries face fiscal constraints because of low economic growth, high energy prices and self-imposed deficit rules. We need more money for defence now, yet our politicians dare not take it from pensions, healthcare, education or welfare. The EU leaders agreed on Monday to explore loosening their strict fiscal rules to allow for a significant increase in national defence spending, perhaps by exempting some or all military expenditure from debt and deficit calculations or using an emergency exception clause – a concession by fiscal hawks such as the Germans and Dutch. But that would not generate sufficient extra money fast enough. The obvious answer is to borrow now and repay out of future defence budgets. Germany created a €100bn (£83bn) special fund through national borrowing in 2022 to start a catch-up in its threadbare armed forces’ equipment. When that programme is exhausted in 2027, Berlin faces a €30bn to €40bn annual hole in its defence budget just to meet Nato’s existing goal of 2% of GDP, let alone a higher target of 3% or more, likely to be set at the alliance’s summit in June. The double challenge after the general election in February will be to persuade the new Berlin government to get over its frugal aversion to borrowing to invest, and to convince it that borrowing with European partners will deliver more bang for the euro, and perhaps more orders for German defence companies, than borrowing nationally. The former looks easier than the latter. Historically, wars have almost always been fought on credit. The UK paid off its final first world war loan in 2015, almost a century after the conflict ended, by issuing new bonds. It would be socially unacceptable and politically suicidal in most west European countries to finance a surge in defence spending in peacetime by slashing social expenditure. Only countries on the frontline with Russia have raised their outlays much beyond the Nato goal, with Poland reaching 4.1% of GDP last year thanks partly to its healthy economic growth. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, argues that if European countries merely spend more on defence, without reforming antiquated national procurement systems, even 4% won’t be enough. A “big bang” in European military capabilities and personnel is possible in the next decade, but only if Europeans spend their increased defence investment in a much smarter, more collaborative way. The best way would be for a coalition of willing European countries to establish a fund of up to €500bn (£416bn) through collective borrowing, to finance jointly procured equipment consistent with Nato’s force requirements such as a European air and missile defence shield, a European cyber-shield, strategic airlift and air-to-air refuelling tankers. Such an intergovernmental fund, which might be managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) or another existing institution, would avoid vetoes by neutral, non-aligned or pro-Russian EU countries, while allowing the UK, Norway and EU candidate countries including Turkey to join, if they so wish. The money would be available well before the next EU long-term budget takes effect in 2028, and would enable European countries to front-load their defence spending and order urgently needed air defence missiles and other kit on credit. At the same time, unspent money in the current EU budget for regional development and Covid-19 recovery should be repurposed to adapt ports, bridges, roads and railheads for military mobility to help reinforce the eastern flank. Moreover, EU finance ministers should instruct the EIB to change its lending guidelines to permit investment in arms and ammunition production, not just so-called dual-use technologies. That would signal to institutional and private investors that defence is a European public good, consistent with those environmental, social and governance principles that prompted some to divest from the sector. EU governments are torn over whether to allow future EU defence funds to be spent on third-country suppliers, as Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands want, or to limit them to EU-based and owned defence companies, as France insists. Given the limited production capacity in Europe’s fragmented defence sector after 30 years of shrinkage, countries are bound to go farther afield if they want to rearm swiftly. Poland, for example, has turned to the United States and South Korea for most of its new kit. The UK and Turkey have strong aerospace and defence industries that could contribute to a European defence surge if they are not shut out. Another hurdle to boosting European defence is a shortage of skilled personnel for the armed forces, defence companies and cybersecurity. Many armies have shrunk to their lowest levels since the 19th century. While Nordic and Baltic countries are moving back towards conscription, which Finland never abandoned, other European states should build up their reserves with regular training and exercising. They should also register young people of both sexes at age 18 to identify candidates and skills for selective military and civil defence tasks. Women are the most underutilised resource for European defence. The purpose of the exercise would be to persuade Russia that it would face an overwhelming response to any attack on a European country, whether or not the US came to Europe’s defence. Investing in deterrence is therefore an investment in peace, to avoid war.

2023-12-16T17:00:02Z,"Diversity policies face ‘full-out attack’ in 2024, leading HR boss warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/16/diversity-dei-us-companies-backlash,"Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies within US companies will “come under full-out attack in 2024”, the president of the largest US human resources organization in the US has said. “It’s going to become a hot-button issue this year,” Johnny C Taylor Jr, president and chief executive of the Society of Human Resource Management, told reporters. The national shift to be more inclusive that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020, and the Black Lives Matter protests that followed, is already fading, he said. “We’re already seeing companies go away from it.” Following Floyd’s murder and figures that showed how hard communities of color had been hit by the Covid pandemic, companies across the US pledged to make their workforces more diverse and tackle racism. “Covid and the murder of George Floyd kind of shine the spotlight on something that we already knew,” the JP Morgan boss, Jamie Dimon, said during an interview in 2020. “We’ve had racial inequality in this country since way before the civil war and we haven’t done a particularly good job of fixing it.” Taylor suggested the reset could be as strong as the backlash against the environmental, social and governance (ESG) movement that was critical of the fossil fuel industry. Texas in 2022 banned companies like BlackRock from doing business with the state because of their work with ESG investing. The backlash to DEI policies is already becoming clear. On Friday, Elon Musk posted on his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), that “DEI must DIE”. “The point was to end discrimination, not replace it with different discrimination,” Musk wrote. The reversal comes after the US supreme court struck down affirmative action in higher education this summer. While the ruling did not explicitly mention company DEI policies, the conservative movement that brought the issue to the supreme court in the first place has its eye on DEI in the workplace. The American Alliance for Equal Rights, run by the conservative legal activist Edward Blum, filed a lawsuit over the summer against the Atlanta-based venture capital firm Fearless Fund, which focuses on funding companies run by women of color. In September, a federal appeals court in Georgia halted a Fearless Fund grant program that would have given $20,000 in funding to Black female entrepreneurs because of the lawsuit. Taylor said that companies are carefully considering their diversity goals and initiatives. Employee resource groups (ERGs), or affinity groups, have become a “really big point of contention” within companies, as have policies that tie leadership compensation to diversity goals. “The question is how companies can say ‘we aspire to be more diverse’ without being prescriptive,” Taylor said, noting that comments about goals to make a workforce a specific diversity percentage could, for example, be taken as a type of quota. “That will run afoul with the supreme court decision.” Taylor said that 2024 will be a “reset moment” for DEI policies. “We’re three years after what happened in 2020, and we think it’s time to say, ‘Did that work’ and make certain adjustments to our approach to diversity,” he said. “Having different experiences, perspectives and people will ultimately yield a better result. But it’s how you get to [that] ... how does this all work out?”",Business; Race; US news; Employment law,Business
2024-05-11T16:00:31Z,"Human rights lawyer Susie Alegre: ‘If AI is so complex it can’t be explained, there are areas where it shouldn’t be used’",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/11/human-rights-lawyer-susie-alegre-ai-artificial-intelligence-human-rights-robot-wrongs-book-interview,"Susie Alegre is an international human rights lawyer and author, originally from the Isle of Man, whose focus in recent years has been on technology and its impact on human rights. As a legal expert she has advised Amnesty International, the UN and other organisations on issues such as counter-terrorism and anti-corruption. Her first book, Freedom to Think, published in 2022 and shortlisted for the Christopher Bland prize, looked at the history of legal freedoms around thought. In her new book Human Rights, Robot Wrongs, she turns her attention to the ways in which AI threatens our rights in areas such as war, sex and creativity – and what we might do to fight back. What prompted you to write this book? There were two triggers. One was the sudden explosion of ChatGPT and the narrative about how everyone can be a novelist now and there’s going to be no need for human creators, because AI will be able to do it all for us. It felt utterly depressing. The second was the story about a Belgian man who took his own life after a six-week intensive relationship with an AI chatbot. His widow felt that, without this relationship, which distorted his worldview, he would have still been there for her and for his children. That triggered me to think – well, this is absolutely about the right to life; to family life, to freedom of thought and freedom from manipulation. And how are we thinking about AI and the really severe ways that it’s impacting our human rights? You don’t give much credence to the threat of an AI apocalypse. I think that’s a distraction. What we need to be worried about is putting limits on how AI can be developed, sold and used by people. And ultimately, there are people behind the technology, in the design phase and particularly in the marketing, and also in the choices that are being made about how it’s used. Everything we’re hearing about AI suggests that it’s advancing at incredible speed, and that the models operate at levels of complexity that even their creators can’t grasp. How can regulators ever hope to keep up? I think there’s an awful lot of smoke and mirrors. It’s like in The Wizard of Oz, when Toto pulls back the curtain and we see what’s going on behind. So we don’t need to believe that it’s all inevitable and omnipotent. We can still make choices and ask questions. Also, if something is so complex that it can’t be explained, then there are certain areas where it shouldn’t be used. Do you think the existing legal systems and human rights charters are up to the task of dealing with AI, or do we need to create a new framework? I don’t think we need a new framework, but what we really need is access to justice. There may well be certain legal avenues that need to be developed. But one of the really fundamental challenges is, how do you push back? How do you enforce regulation? And that’s what we’ve seen in relation to some big tech companies: their activities are found to be unlawful, they’re issued with huge fines, and they still carry on. You have a very interesting chapter on sex robots and chatbots. What are the main concerns? This was a whole area that I hadn’t really thought about before and I was quite horrified to realise how widespread the use of AI bots to replace human companionship is. The reason it worried me is because this is private-sector technology that’s being inserted into people’s lives to replace human relationships, and that is very dangerous in terms of social control. It’s not a question of morality but rather, what does this mean for human society and our ability to cooperate and connect? Isn’t AI good news for people who can’t afford legal representation? It depends. If you’re talking about very basic disputes where it’s just about knowing the rules, technology can improve access. But when you’re looking at more complex questions, the problem is that generative AI doesn’t actually know what the law is and it could well be giving you a load of old rubbish – and when something is delivered by a machine in an authoritative tone, it’s very hard for people to doubt it. What happened when you asked ChatGPT: “Who is Susie Alegre?” It said Susie Alegre didn’t exist, or at least didn’t appear on the internet. I felt a bit cheesed off, given that my first book had come out a year earlier. I asked it, who wrote Freedom to Think, and the first person it came up with was a male biologist. I asked it again and again and it came up with 20 different names, all of them men except for one. It was as if, for ChatGPT, the idea that a woman would have written a book about thought was absolutely unthinkable. What’s your opinion on the “fair use” defence that chatbot companies are using to defend hoovering up words and images to feed their AI? I’m not an American copyright lawyer so I don’t really have expertise on that, but I think it’s going to be very interesting to see how cases pan out in different jurisdictions. The US has a very different approach to almost anywhere in the world on questions of freedom of expression and how that’s been used to support developments in the tech industry. Regardless of the legality of the “fair use” defence, it raises enormous questions for the future of human creativity, journalism and the information space. And underlying that is the basic problem of the massive decrease in pay for creators – the general trajectory has been towards depriving creators of economic incentives. If everything you propose in the book in terms of regulation came to pass, isn’t there a danger that it would stifle innovation? That is a bit of a straw man, the idea that regulation stifles innovation. What regulation does is make innovation develop in a certain direction and shut off directions that would be extremely harmful. In fact, I think there is the opposite risk, that if you allow AI to dominate in ways that undermine our ability to think for ourselves, to claim back our attention, we will lose the capacity to innovate. You point out that AI isn’t just some benign cloud floating above our heads. It’s based on material extraction and the exploitation of workers, mainly in the global south, and it’s incredibly polluting to run. But so much of this is hidden from view. How do we go about tackling these impacts? It is a huge question. One way of dealing with it is by looking at the question of AI adoption from an ESG [environmental, social and governance] perspective. All of the equipment that we use, the phones that we’re talking on now, are built from minerals often taken from conflict regions, including with child labour. Being aware of that hopefully can help shift societal demands and consumer habits. You can use generative AI to make a hilarious meme, but how much water and energy are you expending? Couldn’t you just pick up a pencil, and might that actually be more satisfying? Do you sometimes wish that AI could be put back on the shelf? It’s not an all-or-nothing equation between banning AI or embracing it into every aspect of your life. It’s a question of choosing what we want to use AI for. Being critical and asking questions doesn’t mean that you’re against AI: it just means you’re against AI hype. Human Rights, Robot Wrongs by Susie Alegre is published by Atlantic Books (£12.99).

2024-09-13T16:00:02Z,The Guide #156: Why ER still gets my heart racing,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/13/the-guide-er-at-30,"This week I’ve spent a good chunk of my downtime rewatching Industry, BBC and HBO’s high-tension, high-finance drama, which returns for a third series in the UK on 1 October (American viewers are already charging through it). Watching it a second time, is just as intense as a first: the pace, the jargon-filled crosstalk, the queasy, quick-cut camerawork … I’ve never had a speedball, but this seems like the televisual approximation of what taking one might feel like. Another show I’ve been revisiting this week is ER. Not, alas, because there’s another season coming but because the medical drama celebrates its 30th birthday this month, and that seemed excuse enough to dive back in. And, rewatching the first series, what struck me was just how much like Industry it seemed. ER still goes hard, each episode rattling along like a gurney down a hospital corridor. It’s remarkable to watch, Steadicams swooping in and around its harried doctors, nurses and surgeons. Its verité visual style continues to be mimicked across TV. And the show is thick with detail: not just in the density of the medical language, but also in the sheer number of plotlines being juggled in each episode. That was something that bewildered many viewers and critics in 1994, but the willingness to zip between stories seems a lot more suited to our attention-deficit age. For all the 90s-ness of the thing – the references, the decor, the clothing, the pea-soupy picture quality – the show still feels thrillingly modern. ER’s relative sprightliness got me thinking about how TV shows age, or not. How many times have you watched a show from the not-so-distant past, even a show that you enjoyed first time around, and thought, “Wow, this looks dated”? It happens to me quite a bit and it’s not always simply down to a show’s age. When we talk of things being “dated”, we often mean in material terms: it’s easy to mock a show for its outmoded fashions or technology. More interesting, I think, is when a show feels dated because of how it tells a story or even what story it tells. Take Cheers. It’s a show that ended just a year before ER started, but seems beamed in from another century. I should note that I love Cheers, a show that represents a high-water mark for the sitcom with compelling characters, beautifully constructed jokes and that feeling of warm, enveloping familiarity that all the best sitcoms should have. That said, have you watched it lately?! It feels static and stagey, closer to a Victorian drawing room comedy than the quick-cutting single-cam sitcoms of today. On the other hand, Friends, Cheers’s sitcom successor on US network NBC, seems to have somehow avoided the ageing process as well as its regular guest star Paul Rudd (a few unfortunate elements aside), and it’s watched as avidly by gen Z as by its original audience. Friends’s agelessness might have something to do with its studied inoffensiveness: it largely avoided any sort of real specificity, conjuring up a fantasy version of New York that bears little relation to what was actually going on in the city (ballooning rents, Rudy Giuliani’s crime crackdown and, of course, 9/11) at the time it aired – allowing different generations and demographics to project themselves on to it. In fact, being of the moment is often what dooms TV to seeming dated further down the line. I recently revisited Nathan Barley – Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris’s bracing 2005 satire on the creeping hipsterisation of east London – expecting it to feel completely fresh. After all, this was the show considered ahead of its time, “a documentary about the future” as a Guardian 10th anniversary piece noting its prescience put it. Yet another 10 years on from that piece, Brooker and Morris’s show (pictured above), while still extremely funny, seems, to my eyes at least, strangely outmoded in look – hot-pink patterned T-shirts and angular haircuts – and feel. Watching it is like viewing Pathé footage of a war that’s long since ended – in this case, against the shallow provocation of early hipsterdom. It’s essentially one long screed against the gleeful offensiveness of 00s-era Vice magazine and its acolytes. That was a battle worth fighting at the time, but it feels a little out of step with today’s more cautious mood, when gleeful offensiveness is somewhat rarer on the ground. In truth, it’s a little unfair to hold past generations’ shows to today’s standards. After all, they were being made for their own time, not for the approval of some future audience. The advent of streaming has meant that, where once you would have had to seek out older programmes on VHS and DVD, now you can stumble upon them, nestled alongside newer series. And let’s remember that a lot of the shows mentioned here have stood the test of time, by virtue of the fact that we’re still watching them: the shows that feel truly outdated, or even downright offensive (see about 50% of all British sitcoms made in the 1970s), are unlikely to ever resurface on iPlayer or Netflix at all. It will be interesting to see how a show like Industry dates or doesn’t date, though. It’s a show that is happy to tackle of-the-moment topics: unlike other series (notably Succession) it knitted the pandemic and its after-effects into its second series, and its third series will tackle how business is embracing – or pretending to embrace – green energy and environmental, social and governance principles. For contemporary audiences, this patina of realness is part of what makes Industry so compelling, but that same quality may be what makes it feel out of step in the future. Or maybe not. Maybe, like ER, it will still give that gurney down the hallway rush.

The practice allows companies to claim to have good environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies without having them tested, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) chair, Joseph Longo, said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Domestically, we’ve observed some commentators and firms saying, in effect, ‘we have such a good ESG policy, but we can’t say anything about it because the regulators won’t let us’,” Longo told the AFR ESG summit in Sydney on Monday. “The reality is the critics are right: this kind of response is just another form of greenwashing; an attempt to garner a ‘green halo’ effect without having to do the work.” The term “greenwashing” refers to the practice of misleading or overstating a company’s ESG policies which has attracted the attention of regulators. Longo said ESG reporting was part of a series of important moves towards greater transparency and higher disclosure standards for investors. A report by Swiss consultancy South Pole found last year that an increasing number of companies are no longer publicly talking about their climate practices, even when they have developed science-based targets. Greenhushing makes corporate climate targets harder to scrutinise and limits knowledge sharing, the report said. Many Australian companies, including those involved in coal, oil and gas production, have public climate policies that state their support for the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times. However, some have come under heavy criticism given their policies allow for the development of new fossil fuel reserves. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change analysis following the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure are more than enough to push the world beyond its climate goals. Longo said there were four main categories that represented problematic “greenwashing” behaviour in Australia. Those include: having net zero targets without a reasonable basis of achieving it; using terms like “carbon neutral” when not warranted; overstating sustainability investment screens; and the use of inaccurate labelling or vague terms. Longo said that ESG disclosures were important given investors were increasingly relying on them to make decisions.",Business; Australia news; Climate crisis; Fossil fuels; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions,Australia news

In the past 12 months the number of companies on the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has fallen by 70 to 738 at the end of March, according to London Stock Exchange Group data. That is a drop of 9%, and is significantly more than the drop of 25 companies the year before. The London Stock Exchange Group runs Aim, which gives smaller companies the option to raise funds on the stock market without having to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements for listing on the main market. However, the market’s status as a place for companies to grow rapidly has come under scrutiny in recent years, with the number of companies falling from almost 1,700 in 2007. Two small biotech companies, Redx and C4X Discovery, said this month they would delist because they believe they can raise more money as private companies. Scirocco Energy, a green energy investor, said it would leave the market because of high costs to comply with listing requirements. Other companies have exited because of takeovers, such as the retailer Hotel Chocolat and the asset manager Gresham House. The increase in delisting comes at a time when a number of big companies have said they are considering moving from the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, caused alarm among investors this month by saying that the oil company was undervalued compared with peers in the US. The grocery delivery company Ocado is also under pressure from unnamed investors to shift its listing from London to New York, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The focus on the LSE’s fortunes comes in the wake of a series of lost business. The chip designer Arm – one of the few world-leading tech companies to have grown in the UK – floated shares on New York’s Nasdaq exchange in September last year despite intense lobbying by the UK government. The building materials company CRH last year shifted its main stock market listing to the US, following in the footsteps of the plumbing and heating supplier Ferguson. The Anglo-German tourism company Tui is also considering shifting its main listing away from London, this time in favour of Frankfurt. Departures from the stock market are expected as companies fail or are bought up. However, an increase in delistings could cause problems if they are not replaced, and only one company has joined Aim in 2024, after 10 joined in 2023. A shrinking market would be less attractive to potential investors in companies. Marcus Stuttard, the head of Aim and UK primary markets at the London Stock Exchange Group, said: “Aim continues to be a pre-eminent global growth market and the most active in Europe. That position is not taken for granted and the comprehensive reform agenda currently under way will build on the existing strengths of the UK’s capital markets including Aim.” Colin Wright, the chair of UHY Hacker Young, argued that some companies may have been put off keeping an Aim listing because of new reporting requirements, including on environmental, social and governance issues. Extra costs can be difficult for the smallest growth companies hoping to list. “An Aim listing is meant to be relatively low cost and light touch in terms of regulation,” he said. “The challenge Aim now faces is to strike the balance between continuing to enforce high regulatory standards and creating a compliance culture that is flexible enough that it motivates businesses to remain listed.”",Financial sector; Stock markets; London Stock Exchange; Business; UK news; London,Business
2023-11-25T10:00:46Z,King’s estate to transfer £100m into ethical funds after bona vacantia revelations,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/25/kings-estate-transfer-cash-ethical-funds-bona-vacantia-revelations,"King Charles’s estate has announced it is transferring more than £100m, including funds collected from dead people under the archaic system of bona vacantia, into ethical investment funds after an investigation by the Guardian. The surprise announcement came amid growing pressure on the king over the Duchy of Lancaster’s use of funds collected from people who die in the north-west of England with no will or next of kin. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed some of the funds were secretly being used to renovate properties that are owned by the king and rented out for profit by his estate. The duchy conceded that some bona vacantia revenues are financing the restoration of what it calls “public and historic properties”. However, the king’s estate has also been battling separate questions over its management of another portion of bona vacantia funds that are given to its charities. Two of those charities have used bona vacantia to build major endowment funds worth more than £40m. Their accounts state that there are “no specific constraints on the investment portfolio in terms of ethical, social or environmental (ESG) matters”, although investment managers are advised to take such matters “into consideration”. Contacted by the Guardian this week, the Duchy of Lancaster initially declined to say whether its charities had invested in any oil or gas, tobacco, weapons or mining companies. However late on Friday, a spokesperson for the estate announced a change in policy. “In line with the king’s longstanding support of ethical investing, the Duchy of Lancaster has begun the process of transferring its investment portfolio into ESG funds. This process is expected to be completed by the end of the financial year,” the spokesperson said. There been no suggestion from the king’s estate that it plans to cease collecting bona vacantia or change how it is spent. However, the shift in investment policy will bring the Duchy of Lancaster’s approach into line with that of the Duchy of Cornwall, another royal estate that receives bona vacantia funds, which has an ethical investment policy. The king previously owned and closely managed the Duchy of Cornwall, which raises profits for the heir to the throne. When Charles became king, it was inherited by his son Prince William. At the same time Charles inherited from his mother the Duchy of Lancaster, which exists to raise “private” income for the monarch. Both the duchy itself, and its charities, have investment portfolios. The duchy’s own portfolio, according to its accounts, include equities, bonds and other financial investments worth £74m. That too is now being transferred to ethical funds. The charities the duchy gives bona vacantia revenues to, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund and Duchy of Lancaster Jubilee Trust, have also built large endowment funds, worth £18m and £26m respectively. Both charities’ accounts state they aim for an annual return of £500,000 from their investments, and benchmark the success of the bulk of their stock investments against the FTSE All-Share Index, an index that includes companies such as Shell, BP and British American Tobacco. Ben Faulkner, of the ethical investment company EQ Investors, said benchmarking against an index could mean replicating investments in the companies involved: “Using an index as a base for a replication strategy is very common, known widely as index tracking. When doing so you will typically have more invested in the biggest companies within the index you are tracking … Shell is the largest listed company within the FTSE All-Share Index.” In the last five years, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund has made nearly £2m in income from its investment portfolio, while the Jubilee Trust has made £2.5m. The Duchy of Cornwall, which collects bona vacantia from Cornish residents, has a clear ethical policy in relation to investments by the Duke of Cornwall Benevolent Fund, which has built a £5m endowment. Its accounts state: “The fund is entirely invested in the Newton SRI Fund for Charities, a global and diversified portfolio of equities and fixed interest securities with particular emphasis on environmental, social and governance considerations, screened against negative socially responsible investment criteria.” The Duchy of Lancaster’s announcement of a similar policy comes amid growing questions for the royal estate which has long claimed that bona vacantia proceeds go to charity after costs are deducted. In a shift in language, it now concedes funds are additionally spent on “restoration and repair” of qualifying buildings on the estate. Leaked documents reveal properties deemed eligible for the funds include a suite of properties rented out to raise profit for the king, including holiday lets, farmhouses, a barn on a shooting range and a petrol station. The duchy collects bona vacantia assets from residents of the ancient county palatinate of Lancashire – a territory that includes Lancashire and parts of Merseyside, Cheshire and Cumbria. Cat Smith, MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: “Like so many other local people I was surprised to learn the anomaly that means those dying without a will or heir in the county palatine see their assets passed to the king rather than the state. It’s an unjust and archaic hangover from the medieval times and I’ll be seeking advice on how to bring my constituents’ rights out of the feudal era.” Her comments come after criticisms from two mayors from the north-west of England. “This appears to be a bizarre remnant of feudal Britain,” said the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. “At the very least, people in the north-west are owed transparency and accountability. They should also have a say on how these proceeds are used. I would call on the government and the Duchy of Lancaster to initiate a public consultation on this issue to work towards a set of arrangements that could command greater public consent.” Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, also expressed concern. “Worthy causes have been bypassed and instead it appears that funding has been spent renovating royal properties. I hope the situation will be clarified urgently and, if money has been misused, it is put back where it should be: with those charities it was promised to.”",King Charles III; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment; Monarchy; UK news; North of England; Lancashire,UK news
2025-02-19T15:01:40Z,"HSBC net zero goal delayed 20 years, as CEO offered 600% bonus",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/19/hsbc-net-zero-goal-delayed-20-years-ceo-bonus,"HSBC has been criticised after it delayed key parts of its climate goals by 20 years, while watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, that could be worth up to 600% of his salary. The London-headquartered lender said it was reviewing its net zero emissions policies and targets – which are split between its own operations and those of the clients it finances – after realising its clients and suppliers had “seen more challenges” in cutting their carbon footprint than expected. HSBC had planned to hit net zero targets for its own operations – arguably a much easier goal than cutting the emissions of its loan portfolio and client base – by 2030. However, those plans, which were set in 2020, are being pushed out by two decades to 2050. “Progress in reducing emissions in the … supply chain component is proving slower than we anticipated,” HSBC’s annual report said. “We currently expect a 40% emissions reduction across our operations, travel and supply chain by 2030 which would mean that we would need to rely heavily on carbon offsets to achieve net zero in our supply chain by 2030. “As such, we have revisited our ambition, taking into account latest best practice on carbon offsets. We are now focused on achieving net zero in our operations, travel and supply chain by 2050.” HSBC is also proposing to water down environmental targets in Elhedery’s new pay package, including a long-term incentive plan (LTI) worth up to £9m, or 600% of the his base salary. It is part of a wider pay proposal that will give Elhedery a chance to earn up to £15m a year, a 43% increase on his current potential pay of up to £10.5m. The environmental portion of the LTI, a bonus that will cover performance from 2025-27, has been reduced to 20% from 25%. HSBC said this would “ensure a greater proportion of the LTI is aligned to value creation while supporting our ESG (environmental, sustainability and governance) ambitions”. Meanwhile, the LTI will only be linked to progress made in cutting the bank’s own emissions – including those that have been delayed – given that tracking progress of its client base was “difficult”. HSBC’s remuneration committee said in its annual report: “At this stage, financed emission targets remain difficult to include given challenges in the methodology, timeliness and frequency of reporting. This was recognised by the investors we spoke to as part of our policy engagement. “We therefore decided to retain metrics on carbon reduction in our own emissions and sustainable finance and investment, given we cannot currently use financed emissions, which is a material metric in supporting our ESG ambitions.” The pay proposals will be put to shareholders at its annual general meeting this spring. HSBC’s climate target delay prompted criticism from a wide range of environmental campaigners. “HSBC is just putting its feet up and watching the world burn, rather than owning its responsibility for the climate crisis,” Joanna Warrington at Fossil Free London said. “HSBC helped get us into this mess by financing the growth of fossil fuels which drive up emissions, so it has no right complaining that now it’s suddenly too hard to bring them down,” she added. Zahra Hdidou, a senior climate and resilience adviser at ActionAid UK, urged HSBC to “abandon this disastrous delay and stop financing the fossil fuels and agribusiness corporations that are destroying the planet. The time for kicking the can down the road is over.” HSBC announced the decision amid a climate backlash in the US, where the president, Donald Trump, has been encouraging a retreat from environmental policies in favour of support for oil and gas production. The shift has already prompted six of the largest banks in the US – Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – to withdraw from the UN-sponsored net-zero banking alliance (NZBA) in recent weeks. Elhedery said the bank remained committed to a wider net zero goal by 2050 but told journalists it was “reasonable that we take stock of where we are on that journey”. When asked whether he was committed to remaining a member of the NZBA, Elhedery confirmed only that HSBC was, indeed, a member. HSBC confirmed the scale of its cost-cutting drive, with plans to cut $1.5bn (£1.2bn) from its annual costs by the end of 2026, including through an unconfirmed number of job losses across its 220,928 international workforce. Pre-tax profits for 2024 rose 6.6% to $32.3bn.",HSBC; Banking; Business; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news; World news,Business
2024-03-06T22:07:53Z,US regulators approve significantly scaled back climate disclosure rule,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/06/us-sec-climate-change-emissions-disclosure,"US regulators have voted to require large, publicly traded companies to disclose climate change-related information to investors, though the rule’s scope has been significantly scaled back from the original draft proposal. The long-awaited rule which was finalized in a 3-2 vote by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, marks the first nationwide climate disclosure rule in the US. Some experts say it will give investors more transparency into the threat the climate crisis poses to corporations and how they contribute to global warming. But one former acting SEC chair said the final version “paves the way for greenwashing”. And at Wednesday’s hearing, some commissioners lamented the agency weakening the rule. “While it has my vote, it does not have my unencumbered support,” said SEC commissioner Caroline Abbey Crenshaw, who said the new standard constituted the “bare minimum”. The SEC has long faced pushback from business interests and Republican state officials who claim the standards are a form of agency overreach. Though the final rule has been severely watered down, it is expected to inspire a slew of lawsuits from rightwing officials and corporate interests. Just hours after the rule was approved, the West Virginia attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, announced that a group of nine Republican-led states will challenge it in court. But the legal hurdles may not only come from the right: the environmental group Sierra Club, represented by the legal nonprofit Earthjustice, also said Wednesday it is considering challenging the SEC’s “arbitrary” removal of key provisions from the final rule, though representatives say the group would defend the SEC’s authority to implement such a standard. Under the original proposal, all public companies would have been required to calculate and report certain greenhouse gas emissions. The final rule, by contrast, will apply only to large businesses. Asaf Bernstein, who served as senior academic adviser to the SEC on the new climate rule noted that the companies to whom the rule applies constitute 95% of US market capitalization. But some climate advocates have criticized the narrowed scope, noting that some 60% of all domestic public companies, including smaller companies and emerging growth businesses – which generally have less than $1.2bn in annual revenues – will be exempt. Beginning in 2025, those larger public companies will be required to disclose short- and long-term physical climate risks to their assets, such as potential exposure to hurricanes and droughts. They will also need to reveal any spending related to their climate goals, such as purchases of carbon offsets or renewable energy credits. Unlike the original proposal, the final rule does not require companies to state the climate expertise of members on their board of directors. The rule will require companies to disclose pollution from certain greenhouse gases, but only if the corporations consider the emissions “material”, or of significant importance to their investors – another major change from the original proposal. In practice, this will leave reporting up to companies’ discretion, said Laura Peterson, corporate analyst at the environmental non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists. Beginning in 2026, businesses who deem the information material will also be required to disclose both their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Direct or “scope 1” emissions stem directly from the burning of fossil fuels to produce products, drive vehicles or heat buildings, while indirect or “scope 2” emissions, come from energy purchased from utilities. To “address concerns raised by commenters”, the final rules will give registrants more time to file their emissions disclosures, the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, said at Wednesday’s hearing. But unlike the agency’s 2022 draft rule, the final regulation will not require companies to disclose their “scope 3” emissions, or pollution generated by a company’s supply chain and the consumption of its products. “Based on public feedback, we’re not requiring scope three emission disclosure at this time,” Gensler said at the hearing. The change could help the rule withstand court challenges, legal experts say. But they will also make the overall rule less effective at promoting transparency and accountability, climate advocates say. “By cutting Scope 3 disclosures from the rule, the SEC has fallen far short on a core mission – providing investors with the information they need to make investment decisions,” said David Arkush, director of the progressive advocacy group Public Citizen’s climate program, in an emailed statement. The watering down of the rule, he said, “illustrates the peril” of a supreme court that recently moved to hamstring agencies’ regulatory power, including authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, showing that “agencies will self-censor and decline to execute their roles fully”. “Scope 3 emissions are something many investors have been asking for for years because they account for a huge percentage of a company’s pollution,” said Peterson of Union of Concerned Scientists, which has long urged the SEC to impose requirements to disclose scope 3 emissions. Indeed, for most companies, scope 3 emissions represent more than 70% of their carbon footprint, according to the consulting firm Deloitte. The treatment of scope 3 reporting has been highly controversial for corporations, said Peterson. One reason, she said, is that accounting for that pollution can make companies “look really bad”. Another reason for the controversy, said Bernstein: they can cause regulatory complications by potentially compelling small businesses who purchase products from larger corporations to publish their emissions. “It would potentially feel like it imposes the disclosure requirements on private firms, small firms, international firms, which otherwise wouldn’t be under the purview of the SEC,” said Bernstein, who is also associate professor of finance at University of Colorado, Boulder. Though the rules were scaled back, some SEC commissioners still said it constituted overreach. “These changes do not alter the rule’s fundamental flaw: its insistence that climate issues deserve special treatment,” commissioner Hester Peirce, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to the SEC, said on Wednesday. Since first publishing its nearly 500-page draft proposal in March 2022, the SEC has received more than 24,000 comments on the new climate disclosure requirements, the agency said on Wednesday – the most comments in the agency’s history. Bernstein said the comments “hugely influenced” the final regulation. “I could imagine a world where regulators get letters … and they go into a special folder called ‘trash’,” he said “But that was not my experience at all. They really informed the process.” The US joins other countries, including China, Chile, Egypt, European Union member countries, India and the United Kingdom, which also require climate reporting by public companies. In October, Governor Gavin Newsom of California signed a law requiring large companies doing business in the state to give a detailed accounting of their greenhouse gas emissions, starting in 2026. They will affect about 5,300 corporations, including major companies like Chevron, Wells Fargo and Amazon that will also have to comply with the new SEC rules. The new rules come as Republican lawmakers and corporate interests also push back on the use of environmental, social and governance principles, known as ESG. It also comes amid increasing public concern about vague corporate claims about their climate plans. But some experts said the weakening of the rule amounted to a gutting and should not do much to ease those concerns. “Under the new rule companies will not have to disclose the bulk (or in some cases any) of their GHG emissions,” said Allison Herren Lee, former commissioner and acting chair at the SEC who now works with the whistleblower law firm Kohn, Kohn &amp; Colapinto. “It paves the way for greenwashing.” Charles Slidders, a senior attorney at the non-profit Center for International Environmental Law, said the agency caved to “industry pressure”, and that the rule “threatens to give a veneer of legitimacy to woefully inadequate corporate reporting on climate impacts and risks”. “The SEC’s approach also represents an abdication of the agency’s authority and responsibility to address significant financial risks,” he said. “Climate change unquestionably poses such risks.”",Business; US news; Climate crisis; Environment,Business
2024-02-28T11:42:02Z,Jim Chalmers to push for incentives for sustainable mining amid concerns over Australian nickel ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/28/jim-chalmers-to-push-for-incentives-for-sustainable-mining-amid-concerns-over-australian-nickel,"The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will call for incentives for producers of environmentally sustainable critical minerals in a major international speech. Chalmers will speak to the G20 economic ministers in São Paulo overnight, warning that Australia’s growth in the last quarter was “quite weak” and the soft landing to reduce inflation without a recession is “assumed but not assured”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup With growing concern about the Australian nickel industry due to growing international competition from Indonesian producers, Chalmers argues that “critical minerals industries and supply chains are not reliable enough or sustainable enough”. “Right now, we don’t have the right market structures to reward global producers that improve their environmental and social footprint,” he says, in an advance copy of the speech. “We should look to reward sellers that invest in improving the quality and sustainability of critical minerals.” “This should include consideration of a differentiated international trading market for resources produced to higher [environmental, social and governance] standards.” The comments appear to leave open international cooperation to impose tariffs on less environmentally sustainable minerals exports, along the lines of the European Union’s carbon tariffs. In August the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said his department would begin consulting on whether Australia should adopt a so-called cross-border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to avoid disadvantaging domestic companies. Steel and cement would be the first two products to be considered. In his speech to the G20, Chalmers says that “inflation remains our major concern but for most of us the balance of risks in the economy has shifted, is shifting, or will shift before long from inflation to growth”. Chalmers says that the Australian government expects “growth in next week’s December national accounts to be quite weak”. This is “the inevitable consequence of global uncertainty, higher interest rates and cost of living pressures”, he says. “Inflation has moderated substantially in Australia since its peaks in 2022 and the monthly inflation gauge that came out today is further evidence that inflation is moderating in welcome ways – but we’d like it to moderate further and faster.” On Wednesday the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed the consumer price index was 3.4% in January, fuelling hopes of interest rate cuts from the current cash rate of 4.35%. Surveying conditions around the world, Chalmers notes that “global inflation has peaked, issues in the banking system have been well-contained and growth in some major economies like the United States has defied expectations”. “But since we last met we’ve seen technical recessions confirmed in Japan and the United Kingdom, two good friends and two big and important economies. “Around a quarter of the G20 has recorded a recession or just narrowly avoided one. “This is before the lagged effect of the synchronised tightening of monetary policy is fully-felt.” In a separate G20 speech about inequality, Chalmers argues that the global financial crisis, pandemic and spike in inflation “all risk turbocharging the inequalities and vulnerabilities which threaten our communities and our economies and diminish our politics”. Chalmers notes “five big shifts” around the world: from hydrocarbons to renewables; from information technology to artificial intelligence; from younger populations to older; the changing composition of our industrial bases; and from globalisation to fragmentation. Chalmers argues governments must do “everything we can to ensure our people are the beneficiaries of this change rather than victims of change” including by allowing people to “earn more and keep more of what they earn”. “Our agenda needs to be middle-out and bottom-up, not top-down.” On Tuesday evening the Australian parliament passed Labor’s $359bn tax cut package, delivering bigger savings to low and middle-income earners earning less than $146,486.",Australian politics; Jim Chalmers; Chris Bowen; Australia news; Energy; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment; G20; Mining; Mining,Australia news
2023-12-06T17:05:10Z,"‘Substantial volume’ of clothing tied to Uyghur forced labour entering EU, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/substantial-volume-of-clothing-tied-to-uyghur-forced-labour-entering-eu-says-study-china,"A “substantial volume” of clothing tainted by the use of Uyghur forced labour is entering the European Union market, according to a report, as campaigners say the EU’s checks are not doing enough to weed out coercive work from large supply chains. Dozens of well-known brands including H&amp;M and Zara are identified as being at high risk of sourcing materials, particularly cotton and PVC, made by Uyghurs compelled to participate in state-imposed labour transfer programmes, according to a report from Uyghur Rights Monitor, Sheffield Hallam University and the Uyghur Centre for Democracy and Human Rights. The researchers investigated four leading Chinese apparel companies that have “significant ties” to Xinjiang, via sourcing, subsidiaries, and manufacturing, and have links with western brands. Those companies have supplied brands including Zara and Primark, according to the report. Xinjiang, a region in north-west China where most of the country’s ethnic Uyghur minority live, accounts for more than 80% of China’s cotton. It is also a region where there are widespread reports of human rights abuses, including an estimated 1 million people who have been held in extrajudicial detention camps. Apart from the detention camps, however, there is also a longstanding programme of state-sponsored labour transfers, which Uyghur activists and human rights campaigners say involve a high risk of coercion. Beijing describes these transfers as a poverty alleviation tool. Under the programmes, unemployed people are transferred to farms or factories in different locations where there is a need for workers. This happens within Xinjiang and from the region to other parts of China. The report’s authors highlight several examples of the Chinese companies being involved in these programmes. Beijing Guanghua Textile Group, for example, has a joint venture with Xinjiang Jinghe Textile Technology, a firm with links to labour transfer programmes. In 2018, Xinjiang Jinghe said it was investing 200m yuan (£22.3m) to expand its production facilities and employ 2,000 people via rural surplus labour programmes. In March this year, a Xinjiang newspaper reported that 73 “poverty-stricken households” had sent workers to the firm to become industrial workers. Beijing Guanghua’s parent company, Beijing Fashion Holdings, advertises its links with a number of well-known western brands, including Zara and Next. One of the group’s subsidiaries, TopNew, is a supplier for H&amp;M. A spokesperson for Inditex, Zara’s parent company, said the western fashion brand no longer purchased products from Beijing Guanghau Textile Group or Beijing Fashion Holdings, and had “no plans to do so in future”. “Inditex has no commercial ties with any factories located in [Xinjiang]. Inditex is fully committed to respecting, protecting and promoting human rights across its entire value chain and rigorously adheres to all forced labour regulations. We regularly conduct detailed due diligence and monitoring of our suppliers to ensure compliance with our stringent standards and we are fully committed to the traceability of the raw materials used in our products. “All suppliers and manufacturers of the Inditex group must comply with our traceability requirements, including selecting a supply chain made up of ethical and responsible companies and providing accurate, true and appropriate information about the supply chain used for each order, from raw materials to final garment.” A spokesperson for H&amp;M said: “Transparency about our supply chain is very important to us and we have come far in that work.” TopNew is listed as one of H&amp;M group’s suppliers on its website. A spokesperson for Primark said: “We can confirm the use of Anhui Huamao Group Co Ltd in two suppliers’ supply chains. We have spoken at length with the suppliers linked to this facility and, so far, we have not been able to find any direct link to the XUAR [Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region] ... Out of caution, our supplier has agreed with us to immediately stop using the facility in question while our investigation is ongoing.” Anhui Huamao is a textile company with three subsidiaries in Xinjiang, according to its most recent annual report. Beijing Fashion Holdings and Next did not respond to a request for comment. In 2020, H&amp;M expressed concerns about the risk of forced Uyghur labour in cotton production. That led to a backlash in China and a widespread boycott of the brand, leading to a drop in sales of nearly 25%. The brand later said its commitment to China remained strong. In December 2021, the US government passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which treats goods from Xinjiang as being tainted with forced labour – and therefore banned from the US – unless an importer can prove otherwise. To date, the legislation has resulted in more than $500m (£397) worth of goods being denied entry to the US. The report’s researchers said: “This is a sea change that only legislation could have made happen. Companies are now subject to investigation of their entire supply chains, which has encouraged more due diligence and more visibility in what were previously incredibly opaque relationships.” But the EU has no such stance on goods from Xinjiang, something the researchers said needed to change. The report’s authors also noted that state-sponsored labour transfer programmes were less widely understood than Xinjiang’s detention camps, which have received widespread media attention and which, according to the UN Human Rights Office, “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity”. This means that while many of the western brands named in the report celebrate their participation in ESG (environmental, social and governance) rankings and validation schemes, such as the global organic textile standard and the Better Cotton initiative, “the significance of these certifications vary widely” as they “typically do not account for state-imposed forced labour”. “It is highly important to incorporate state-sponsored labour transfers and participation in other forms of repressive policies implemented in the Uyghur region as a red flag while evaluating companies based in mainland China,” said Yalkun Uluyol, one of the researchers. The report was commissioned by Raphaël Glucksmann, a member of the European parliament from the centre-left Place publique party, which is part of the parliament’s Socialists &amp; Democrats grouping.",European Union; Uyghurs; Forced labour; China; Xinjiang; Fashion; Retail industry; Business; Europe; World news,World news
2023-06-06T10:15:05Z,Climate risks have made California uninsurable. When will we wake up? | Kate Aronoff,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/06/climate-risks-are-making-california-uninsurable-when-will-we-wake-up,"State Farm, the country’s largest property insurer, announced this week that it will almost entirely stop issuing new policies in California, the country’s largest property insurance market. The reasons for forgoing all that new business are entirely economic. The company cited “historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market”. Those things are owed largely to the wildfires engulfing bigger parts of the state in bigger chunks of the year. California’s woes have a lot to do with the climate crisis, which fuels the hot, dry conditions that turn wooded hills into kindling. It’s also a political failure. Housing crises in the Golden state have pushed more and more people out of densely populated areas and into the so-called wildland-urban interface – places that are cheaper to live in, and more prone to burn. Wealthy homeowners in fire-prone enclaves are also reluctant to move, keen to keep rebuilding properties that keep getting destroyed. Similar dynamics are playing out around the country. Insurance companies are hiking up costs or wholly withdrawing from some areas after deadly, costly flooding in Appalachia and hurricanes in Louisiana and Florida, where property insurance rates are now roughly triple the national average. In each case the rich will make out all right, for now, able to pony up the cost of more expensive policies or relocation. The rest will find themselves on the losing end of what happens when the private sector is entrusted with planning for climate chaos. State Farm didn’t mention climate change in its announcement, of course. The sector has been under pressure from rightwingers that have attacked private sector initiatives like the Net Zero Insurers Alliance (NZIA) as a plot by shadowy globalists to enforce a radical climate agenda through undemocratic means; more concretely, Republican lawmakers are engaged in sabre-rattling premised on the notion that such alliances constitute a violation of antitrust rules. Owing to such pressures, 11 global insurers have left the NZIA since March. The irony of the Republican crusade against all things ESG (environmental, social and governance investment principles) takes flashy corporate climate pledges at face value, alleging that Wall Street is substituting ideology for what should be a focus on the bottom line. But ESG, for companies, is all about protecting profits. State Farm – which touts its own ESG commitments – is leaving California, it said, “to improve the company’s financial strength”. Republican lawmakers are trying to ban companies from making similarly pragmatic considerations of climate risk in their planning. Governments, meanwhile, have been slow to do much climate planning at all. There is no comprehensive federal plan to house people – let alone whole communities – wiped out by climate-fueled storms and floods, despite the fact that some 13.1 million people could be displaced by sea-level rise through the end of the century. When governments don’t plan for such events, corporations fill the gap, raising prices and deepening existing inequalities. Even the relatively well-off will be left to navigate a thicket of piecemeal, neglected public programs and private-sector middlemen to rebuild their lives. Rising prices and coverage gaps aren’t some moral failure on the part of State Farm or any other for-profit firm, just business: these companies exist to return value to their shareholders. The government’s job, though, is to protect its people. That it’s failing to do that now doesn’t bode well for an even more climate-ravaged future.

2025-05-21T05:00:18Z,"EU’s ‘chocolate crisis’ worsened by climate breakdown, researchers warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/21/eu-chocolate-climate-breakdown-crisis-report,"Climate breakdown and wildlife loss are deepening the EU’s “chocolate crisis”, a report has argued, with cocoa one of six key commodities to come mostly from countries vulnerable to environmental threats. More than two-thirds of the cocoa, coffee, soy, rice, wheat and maize brought into the EU in 2023 came from countries that are not well prepared for climate change, according to the UK consultants Foresight Transitions. For three of the commodities – cocoa, wheat and maize – two-thirds of imports came from countries whose biodiversity was deemed not to be intact, the analysis found. The researchers said the damage to food production by climate breakdown was made worse by a decline in biodiversity that has left farms less resilient. “These aren’t just abstract threats,” said the lead author of the report, Camilla Hyslop. “They are already playing out in ways that negatively affect businesses and jobs, as well as the availability and price of food for consumers, and they are only getting worse.” The researchers mapped trade data from Eurostat on to two rankings of environmental security to assess the level of exposure for three staple foods and three critical inputs into the EU’s food system. They used a ranking of climate readiness from the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, which combines a country’s vulnerability to climate damages with its access to financial and institutional support, and a ranking of biodiversity intactness from the UK Natural History Museum, which compares the current abundance of wild species to pre-modern levels. They found the majority of imports came from countries they ranked “low-medium” on the climate scale and “low-medium” or “medium” on the biodiversity scale. Some food products were particularly exposed. The EU imported 90% of its maize from countries with low-medium climate readiness and 67% from countries with medium or lower biodiversity intactness, the report found. For cocoa, a key ingredient in the chocolate industry that Europe does not grow itself, the import exposure was 96.5% for climate preparedness and 77% on the biodiversity scale, the report found. The industry is already struggling with rises in the price of sugar, driven in part by extreme weather events, and supply shortages of cocoa. Most of its cocoa comes from west African countries facing overlapping climate and biodiversity risks. The report, which was commissioned by the European Climate Foundation, argued that large chocolate manufacturers should invest in climate adaptation and biodiversity protection in cocoa-growing countries. “This is not an act of altruism or ESG [sustainable finance], but rather a vital derisking exercise for supply chains,” the authors wrote. “Ensuring farmers are in their supply chains paid a fair price for their produce would allow them to invest in the resilience of their own farms.” Paul Behrens, an environmental researcher at the University of Oxford and author of a textbook on food and sustainability, who was not involved in the research, said the findings painted an “extremely worrying picture” for food resilience. “Policymakers like to think of the EU as food-secure because it produces quite a lot of its own food,” he said. “But what this report shows is that the EU is vulnerable to climate and biodiversity risks in some vital food supply chains.” The report found coffee, rice and soy had fewer risks overall but noted hotspots of concern. Uganda, which provided 10% of the EU’s coffee in 2023, had low climate preparedness and low-medium biodiversity intactness, the report found. Joseph Nkandu, founder of the National Union of Coffee Agribusinesses and Farm Enterprises in Uganda, called for more access to international climate finance to help farmers become more resilient in the face of worsening weather. “The weather in Uganda is no longer predictable,” he said. “Heatwaves, prolonged dry spells and erratic rains are withering our coffee bushes and damaging production.” Marco Springmann, a food researcher at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said a shift to healthier and more sustainable diets would be needed for food systems to withstand climate shocks. “About a third of grains and basically all imported soy is used to feed animals,” he said. “Aiming to make those supply chains more resilient therefore misses the point that this supports the very products that are to a large degree responsible for what is being tried to protect from.”",Climate crisis; Environment; European Union; Chocolate; Europe; World news; Food; Biodiversity; Uganda; Coffee; Africa; Food security,Environment
2022-12-25T10:30:04Z,F1 teams told they must work to improve governance and transparency ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/25/f1-teams-told-they-must-work-to-improve-governance-and-transparency,"Formula One teams must do more to improve their governance and transparency if they are to embrace a sustainable future, according to new research. The report by the Standard Ethics group has concluded that F1 teams need to make clear their position and goals on environmental, social and governance issues, with only three of the 10 on the grid currently having a publicly stated code of ethics. “There is work to do for the governance side, this is the most important,” said Jacopo Schettini, the director of research at Standard Ethics. “It is very, very important to see a long-term commitment to sustainability. A long-term commitment comes from crucial important documents like a code of ethics or a sustainability plan or policies on specific issues. “There were three teams with a code of ethics – McLaren, Aston Martin and Ferrari. They were talking about all major sustainability issues but I would like to see more from the other teams.” Standard Ethics assesses companies on their performance relating to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. They were not commissioned to analyse F1 teams but undertook the research independently. In their report, teams were assessed on whether they publish a code of ethics, the quality of reporting of ESG issues, whether they have a human rights policy and whether they disclose environmental targets. They did this by analysing the information each team has published in the public domain. Schettini noted that investigating this way was a vital test of the transparency he believes is key to a positive sustainability policy. “We analysed by what they publish,” he said. “It’s very important, the first part of sustainability is to be transparent, to inform people what you are doing about that. You should publish everything.” Schettini acknowledged that in some areas the teams performed well. Most, the report concluded, were addressing human rights and addressing environmental targets. However outside of the three teams cited the lack of a published code of ethics and of an ESG reporting system meant governance and transparency was lacking. “Sustainability is not just environmental topics, but also gender inequality or risk management, or health and safety. It’s a lot of issues,” Schettini said. “Having an ESG reporting system we can see what they are doing, they have to improve governance and reporting.” Clearly, however, teams are acting positively. Mercedes have committed to fund the MSc motorsport scholarship programme with the Royal Academy of Engineering, aimed at improving diversity among motorsport engineers, part of their Ignite partnership with Lewis Hamilton. Schettini added that some teams may also have a code of ethics and ESG reporting system that was not public, but reiterated that was a part of the problem. “Sustainability needs transparency,” he said. “Transparency and a long-term vision, give us a long-term vision. What you are thinking about sustainability and keep us updated on your goals. If you fail to meet a target we understand, you can postpone a target but it’s very important that you have a target and a roadmap.” The group have since received feedback from several teams looking to improve their performance in future. F1 recently published its latest report into its environmental goal of going carbon neutral by 2030, a target the sport believes it is on course to meet. However, F1’s teams are far from alone in requiring improvement. “We do something like this, even more accurately with most leading European football teams,” said Schettini. “Last year, we discovered more or less the same approach from them, so we have seen some environmental targets but even leading football teams lack transparency.”",Formula One; Motor sport; Sport; Sport politics,Sport
2023-07-26T16:26:33Z,"Farage blames ‘woke capitalism’ for his row with Coutts, but banks aren’t woke. Their obsession is profits   | Larry Elliott",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/26/farage-woke-capitalism-coutts-ethical-humbug,"There are no branches of Coutts in Sheffield Hallam, Mid-Bedfordshire and Swansea East. In fact, there are no branches of any bank in these and the 14 other parliamentary constituencies that have been at the sharp end of a mass closure programme in the past decade. In all, there have been almost 6,000 branches shut since 2015 and the NatWest Group – the owners of Coutts – has closed more than any other bank. So the first thing to say about the high-profile row that led to the resignation of Alison Rose, the chief executive of NatWest, is that Nigel Farage is not the only account holder to be debanked. He is simply more famous than your average NatWest customer living in Reading West or Colne Valley. Nor is Farage by any means the first customer to feel that an account has been closed unfairly. There have been more than 8,500 such complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service in the past five years. Rose can expect scant sympathy from these people, nor – judging by the brutal way in which the government used its 39% stake in the bank to oust her – from the wider public. Rishi Sunak thinks voters will side with Farage rather than Rose, and he is almost certainly right. There is little love for the banks, which is understandable. These are the same banks, remember, whose speculative activities led to the global financial crisis of 2008 – an episode that came close to precipitating a second Great Depression. Banks spent only a short while on the naughty step, but bankers’ pay and bonuses still rankle with those struggling to make ends meet during a cost of living crisis. Banks are also doing well out of rising interest rates. That’s because the rates they are charging borrowers are going up more quickly than the rates they are paying savers. A widening of the spread between borrowing and saving rates means higher profits, but as the Bank of England raised interest rates from 0.1% to 5%, the gouging of customers became so obvious that Jeremy Hunt called in the bank bosses for a dressing down. It is quite something when a Conservative chancellor feels the need to call on the banks to raise the “measly” rates paid to savers. Normally, those on the left struggle to find a kind word to say for the banks. They argue – correctly – that the economy has been over-dependent on the City. They say – equally correctly – that much of what the financial sector does is of dubious value other than to the highly paid people involved in all the wheeling and dealing, and that some of what the banks do – funding fossil fuel extraction – is positively harmful. They would support the idea of a windfall tax on excess bank profits. The fact that it has been Farage having a fight with Coutts and NatWest complicates matters, because the left has to decide who it hates most. In reality, it should be no contest. On one level, this is simply a freedom of speech issue that requires liberals to stand up for the right of people with whom they disagree to express their views. In part, too, it means calling out Coutts – an elitist institution if ever there was one – for its laughable attempt to brand itself as inclusive. More than that, though, supporting Coutts against Farage has meant turning a blind eye to the limitations of what has become known as woke capitalism – an attempt to marry the desire of companies to make money with support for all sorts of worthy causes. Despite the good intentions, the real priority – maximising profits – has too often been hidden behind a cloak of ethical humbug. It is not just the banks. The telecoms regulator, Ofcom, is facing calls to investigate why mobile and broadband companies pushed through price increases of up to 17% this year. The water industry has been shamed into apologising for more than 300,000 incidents of sewage pollution in 2022 after years of underinvestment. At the same time, all the big companies in the mobile and water sectors regularly issue environmental, social and governance (ESG) reports. Just mentioning one from each: the first line of the Thames Water ESG report says, “We have a long commitment to becoming more sustainable in all areas of the business.” Vodafone’s says, “Our approach to ESG is an integral part of our purpose and strategy to enable an inclusive and sustainable digital society.” Public limited companies enjoy enormous legal privileges in the UK, and in the past, gains from efficiency savings and higher productivity were shared between a company’s shareholders, its workers and its customers in the form of higher dividends, higher wages and lower prices. Interestingly, Hunt used an article in the Times today to make precisely this point. “Profit is the engine of investment,” he said. “But the other side of the coin is a social contract in which customers get reassurance they are treated fairly.” The banks say their branch closures are simply a response to the way people manage their money, with more transactions conducted online or by phone. The same argument is wheeled out to justify the closure of ticket offices on the railways. In both cases, those who really suffer are poor and vulnerable people who may not have smartphones, or aren’t tech savvy, or are disadvantaged in some other way. Sure, there are examples of companies putting progressive policies into practice. Some supermarkets are doing their bit for the planet by cutting down on plastic packaging and sourcing food more sustainably, for instance. But, in truth, there is a massive reality gap between what many companies say they stand for and what they do. The reason claims of greedflation – companies quietly bumping up their profit margins during the cost of living crisis – resonate is that many people feel as if they are being fleeced in rip-off Britain. And they see corporate inclusivity and diversity policies for the window dressing they often are.

2025-04-17T14:15:37Z,BP suffers investor rebellion at first AGM since climate strategy U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/17/bp-braces-for-investor-rebellion-at-first-agm-since-climate-strategy-u-turn,"BP suffered an investor rebellion on Thursday after facing shareholders for the first time since abandoning its climate strategy at a meeting marred by protest. About a quarter of shareholders voted against the chair, Helge Lund, at the company’s annual meeting in Sunbury-on-Thames, on the edges of London, which attracted protest from several green campaign groups. The Guardian understands that five protesters were forcibly blocked from entering the meeting before the vote, which marked the first time in at least a decade that more than 10% of BP’s shareholders voted against the re-election of the chair. The activists from Fossil Free London and Energy Embargo for Palestine protested outside the venue, describing the board as “murderers, looters and genocide enablers”, before major institutional investors voted against the re-election of Lund. The shareholder meeting was held weeks after Lund, who presided over BP’s failed green agenda, promised to step down from the company by next year. Despite his resignation, the chair was forced to face a shareholder vote to re-elect him to the post until his departure, creating a lightning rod for disgruntled investors. The resolution received a provisional 24.3% of opposed votes. The outgoing chair told shareholders that the company had “pursued too much while looking to build new low-carbon businesses” but that “lessons have been learned”. BP’s chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, repeated his previous claim that BP’s optimism in the global green energy transition was “misplaced”, and that the board’s “one simple goal” was to “grow the long-term value of your investment”. A strategy overhaul was considered by many industry commentators as BP’s only defence against the advance of an aggressive activist investor fund that could threaten the breakup of the 115-year-old company. The feared New York fund Elliott Investment Management amassed a stake in the company earlier this year. It typically takes aim at underperforming companies by agitating for changes that could resuscitate their flagging market value. Elliott is expected to call for sweeping changes to BP, which has lagged behind rivals such as Shell and ExxonMobil that have profited from the global energy market crisis in recent years by increasing their fossil fuel production. Mark Van Baal, the founder of the green activist investor group Follow This, said shareholders had “made it clear that weakening climate commitments is unacceptable”. He added: “This historical result serves as a wake-up call to BP’s board and emphasises investor expectation for robust governance mechanisms and genuine leadership on ESG issues.” Agathe Masson, a campaigner at Reclaim Finance, said the historic vote “sends a clear message to the BP board that their green U-turn was a backwards step and that some shareholders clearly want to invest in a green transition”. The rebellion included the UK asset manager Legal &amp; General, a leading shareholder in BP, which voiced plans to vote against Lund’s re-election ahead of the vote, citing the company’s recent green U-turn and its decision not to allow its shareholders to vote on the new direction. Under Auchincloss, BP has scrapped plans to restrict its fossil fuel production in favour of green investments. Instead, the company will be “very selective” about investing in low-carbon options while growing its planned fossil fuel production to 2.4m barrels of oil and gas a day by 2030 – about 60% higher than the figure in its net zero plan set out five years ago. The vote marks the biggest rebellion against the board since 2016, when almost 60% of shareholders voted against BP’s decision to hand the then CEO, Bob Dudley, a $20m (£15.1m) pay packet in the same year that a global oil market rout pushed the company to record losses. The latest shareholder standoff took place almost 15 years to the day after the deadly Deepwater Horizon disaster led to the largest marine oil spill in US history and plunged the company into a $70bn dollar crisis. The company announced this week an oil discovery in “the Gulf of America” – using Donald Trump’s newly mandated US name for the Gulf of Mexico – which it said underscored its plan to “step up investment in exploration”.",BP; Oil; Business; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Commodities; Energy; Environment; Climate crisis,Business

One of the key challenges is how to remove carbon emissions from the global economy – a subject that researchers at the University of Derby are leading the way in. “Zero carbon” is one of six academic research themes at the University of Derby, and within that field is carbon economics, or “carbonomics”, an emerging discipline that studies the balance between the economic costs of addressing climate change and the economic opportunities of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. It encompasses the economic aspects of dealing with carbon emissions and the climate crisis, including the functioning of carbon offset markets, and has huge implications for the world of business. “Carbonomics is a new and very exciting branch of economics, and a necessary area for businesses and society to understand and get involved in, as well as for academics to contribute to,” says Dr Polina Baranova, an associate professor of strategy and sustainability at the university’s Derby International Business School. “We are pioneering this particular discipline, which looks at every aspect of business operations through the lens of carbon reduction, net zero, and reducing the environmental impact of businesses.” The discipline reflects the business school’s approach of focusing on research that directly addresses challenges facing modern businesses, and that can result in real-world impact. To date, the university has had considerable success in securing local, regional and European funding for research into the low-carbon economy, explains Baranova, and over the years, it has forged crucial close links with industry and commerce – both in the UK and across the globe. Along with “zero carbon”, “business” is another key component of the university’s six academic themes and reflects the business school’s commitment to “better business, better society, better future”. Professor Hassan Yazdifar, head of research and innovation at Derby International Business School, explains how the link between the two themes is strengthening all the time: “We are seeing an increasing convergence between our business scholars and zero carbon researchers leading to interdisciplinary projects focused on understanding the implications of the net-zero transition across various economic sectors. These collaborations are designed to deliver tangible improvements in sustainability practices, sector performance, and strategic decision-making.” Such is the university’s ambition in this area and confidence in its expertise and research that it’s forging ahead with plans to develop an Institute of Carbonomics. This will involve the creation of a founding chair in carbonomics, with responsibility for leading this important agenda. “This new professorship demonstrates our commitment to sustainability, innovation, and the economics of climate solutions, while positioning us at the forefront of this critical field,” says Yazdifar. “The founding chair of carbonomics, which is funded by industry, allows us to collaboratively grow this vital discipline, deepen our research capacity in carbon markets and shape strategies that will help drive vital change across the world. “The planned Institute of Carbonomics will be a centrepiece of our innovation strategy. It represents our long-term commitment to pioneering research in climate economics and sustainability, with strong academic leadership and close engagement with business and policy stakeholders.” The University of Derby works with a wide range of industries and organisations, from major corporations to small businesses. This summer, Derby International Business School will relocate to the city centre to its new home in the Cavendish Building. The intention is that this will foster even closer collaborations between academics, students and industry in areas such as carbon capture, climate innovation and sustainable logistics. The university is also focusing on environmental solutions, for example, finding ways to absorb more carbon from the atmosphere into Derbyshire’s peatlands and agricultural landscape. It is also undertaking pioneering work into seagrass restoration, one of the world’s most important yet rapidly declining marine habitats. “Look at the role that oceans play in marine habitats like sea grass and kelp and the impact that the warming of the oceans is having on them,” says Professor Chris Sansom, head of the zero carbon research theme at the University of Derby. “We know if we can reduce greenhouse gases, we can reduce the rate of global warming, but in the short term, we need to save those sea grasses and corals, and the work we’re doing is focused on making them more resilient.” The university also houses a Centre for Supply Chain Improvement – a centre of excellence for operations and supply chain management in advanced research and industry partnerships. It’s led by Dr Jose Arturo Garza-Reyes, who is professor of operations management and head of the centre. His research into green-lean logistics is having an impact globally, helping organisations such as DHL and the Red Cross in Mexico achieve excellence in their internal and supply chain processes. It is this critical work that strengthens the university’s ambition for its business school to become an international hub for research-led solutions in carbonomics. “We want to be at the forefront of this agenda, and in a position to share insights, knowledge and strategies that support businesses and government to effectively transition to a low-carbon economy. Only by working together, will we be able to bring into effect the required change that is needed,” says Baranova. Upskilling auditors for a green future With carbon reporting mandatory for many organisations, carbonomics has a significant role to play in the world of business finance. Josiah Nii Adu Quaye is a postgraduate research student at Derby International Business School. A qualified accountant, he was head of finance for several institutions, before also becoming a lecturer in tax at the university. The research focus of his PhD explores how audit practices can drive climate accountability and promote sustainable financial disclosures. “Auditors are becoming frontline defenders in the climate crisis,” says Quaye. “As businesses face increasing pressure to disclose their carbon footprints, auditors must ensure these disclosures are accurate, transparent, and trustworthy. However, one surprising finding from my research is that while many auditors recognise the importance of climate disclosures, they feel underprepared or unsupported in verifying that information. This is not just an upgrade of skills – it’s a shift in mindset. Auditors must evolve into stewards of sustainability assurance. “We will need auditors who are much more in tune with non-financial reports and audit procedures linked to environment, social, and governance (ESG) areas such as emissions reporting, supply chain transparency, and biodiversity impact. I believe my PhD will enable me to help equip the next generation of auditors with the skills they will need.” To find out more about Derby International Business School, visit derby.ac.uk",,Shaping The Next Generation Of Gamechangers
2024-05-21T12:00:03Z,‘It’s a barbarity’: why are hundreds of families asking to be moved away from this Dominican Republic goldmine?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/may/21/its-a-barbarity-why-are-hundreds-of-families-asking-to-be-moved-away-from-this-dominican-republic-goldmine,"In the shadow of El Llagal, a tailings dam that holds waste from one of the world’s largest goldmines in the Dominican Republic, sits the home of Casilda Lima. The roof is corrugated iron and the walls are wood, painted pink and yellow. A sign reads “God bless this home”. Outside,the 114-metre-tall grey wall of the dam looms large. Behind it lies a lake of waste from the mining process, where machinery and chemicals, along with a huge volume of water, are used to grind up rock to extract gold and silver. Many substances found in tailings are lethal, others are radioactive. In 2014, Lima, 47, says she was told she had high lead and heavy metal levels in her blood. She says she has developed heart problems, and lives with headaches, nausea and fevers. She alleges it is because of the pollution from the Pueblo Viejo goldmine and the dam. Pueblo Viejo, about 60 miles north-west of the capital Santo Domingo, lies within Sánchez Ramírez, a farming province that faces significant challenges in terms of poverty. The mine has had a number of different owners but became a 60/40 joint venture between the Canada-based Barrick Gold, the operator, and Newmont, a US corporation, in 2006. Barrick’s mining operations started in 2013. “I never suffered from anything before Barrick came,” says Lima. “Now I have a lot of headaches and kidney problems. I find it hard to breathe and get very dizzy.” Lima’s house is in Las Lagunas. She lives with her five children and two nephews who also have health problems. “My 23-year-son doesn’t stop getting headaches and feeling dizzy,” she says. Las Lagunas is one of six communities, collectively home to more than 450 families, in the area surrounding the Barrick-built tailings dam, whose representatives have alleged grave harms to health, livelihoods and environment due to mining operations. Barrick plans to expand the Pueblo Viejo mine, and to build a new tailings dam three times the size of El Llagal less than a mile away. A report by Steven H Emerman, who evaluates mining impacts, found that the environmental impact study Barrick presented to the Dominican government was “incomplete”, did not properly explore safer alternatives and underestimated the consequences of failure. In a letter to the Guardian, Juana Barceló, the president of Barrick Pueblo Viejo, countered that Emerman’s report itself lacked supporting data and analysis, was not subject to peer review and is contradictory. Both the existing and proposed dams have been rated as “extreme”, meaning that more than 100 fatalities are expected in the event of dam failure. “It’s a barbarity,” says Fernando Peña, the coordinator of the Espacio Nacional por la Transparencia en las Industrias Extractivas (Entre), a coalition of more than 100 organisations monitoring mining in the Dominican Republic, adding that Barrick’s arguments do not justify installing the tailings dam. Plans for the new dam and mine’s expansion are forefront in the minds of the Comité Nuevo Renacer (New Rebirth Committee), representing the six affected communities. Its headquarters are painted with skulls and crossbones and phrases “Yes to life” and “Relocation now!”. For years, they have been asking the government and Barrick to relocate people. Leoncia Ramos, a spokesperson for the committee, sits down at a table to explain what has changed over the past 12 years: “There are many people who suffer respiratory problems, vision loss, skin lesions, heart problems and depression because of the situation. People are dying.” Community members have repeatedly highlighted possible water contamination. Barrick and the Dominican mining ministry say Pueblo Viejo is not responsible. Before Barrick took over, another company had started mining on the property in 1975. In 1979, the Dominican government acquired the site. Operations ceased in 1999 leaving, Barceló claims, “significant historical environmental contamination”. She said, “the legacy impacts, as well as those from other operating mines, persisted outside of the responsibility and liability of Barrick”. She adds that Barrick provided $75m (£59m) to clean up areas outside its boundary. All water is treated to meet regulatory standards before it is discharged, and the sole discharge point is the Margajita River. Tests are carried out daily to ensure compliance. A ministry of mining spokesperson says analysis carried out by the government concluded there was no direct impact on people’s health and livestock from current mining operations in the area. However, some people say they’ve seen a decrease in cacao production. Others described how fruits they used to grow easily, such as mangoes, plantains and oranges, rot on the plant before they are ready, forcing people to buy food from the town market five miles away. “The Pueblo Viejo mine is one of the biggest in the world,” says Ramos. “We could be living in wonder, and well. However, there are people here who only eat once a day, because they have nothing.” Barceló says Pueblo Viejo has invested $7m in community agribusiness projects and cacao plantations and that cocoa production in the area has generally increased since 2008. In 2019, it was reported that the publication of a study by a Canadian university professor showing widespread dissatisfaction with the goldmine was stopped by the Dominican government after Barrick raised concerns about the results. Gold is one of the main commodities produced in the Dominican Republic, and Pueblo Viejo is one of the world’s largest goldmines. Barrick’s total revenue in 2022 was just over $11bn (£8.7bn): the company returned $1.6bn to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The Pueblo Viejo mine represented approximately 10% of Barrick’s attributable gold production in 2022 and generated $776m of revenue, according to the company’s annual report. The GDP of the Dominican Republic is $113bn. Dominican law requires 25% annual income tax and a 5% contribution of net profits to municipalities where the mine is located from mining concessionaires. A plan to relocate 450 families from the affected communities was drawn up, according to Peña and Ramos, but has not happened. Barceló and the ministry of mining say they are not aware of such a plan. Barceló adds: “Since 2008, many people have moved into the area around the mine with the express intention to be resettled and to benefit financially.” She claims many families seeking resettlement live upstream of Barrick’s operations making it “impossible for the mine to have contributed to any contamination of waters, even setting aside the fact that we do not discharge into this catchment”. A letter sent to Barrick and government ministries in May last year, coordinated by Entre and signed by 16 Dominican and international organisations, claims “the harms alleged by community members may suggest a contravention of Barrick’s international human rights commitments, its contractual obligations, and the company’s own environmental, social, and governance standards”. Barceló rejects this, saying those at the company pride themselves “on being good corporate citizens and conscientious and responsible stewards of the environment”. Meanwhile, the six communities’ situation is attracting wider attention. After visiting the area last year, Juan Dionicio Rodríguez Restituyo, the president of the human rights committee of the Dominican Chamber of Deputies, told parliamentarians in December that what he and his team saw “filled us with horror” and that “the only solution that these 450 families have is to be transferred to another place”. He added: “It is not possible that there is no authority in the Dominican Republic that can tell that company (Barrick), ‘We are going to put it in the budget, find the formula so that these people can live and have a future.’”",Global development; Dominican Republic; Americas; Mining; Gold; Commodities; Environment; World news; Health,Global development
2023-10-24T05:33:39Z,"Top ASX firms report social and environment performance by revising pastdata, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/24/top-asx-firms-report-improved-social-and-environment-performance-by-revising-past-data-study-finds,"Australian companies are reporting better social and environment performance but many gains are generated by revising past outcomes, particularly when a chief executive’s own remuneration is tied to the results, a new study has found. The study, “CSR Restatements: Mischief or Mistake?”, examined 674 instances of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting from the Top 500 ASX-listed companies between 2004 and 2020. The researchers found about 17% of a CEO’s bonus pay was linked to sustainability targets alone, potentially lifting payouts by around $200,000 if targets were met. All up, 33.5% of all restatements of CSR outcomes were for one or more CSR goals that were tied to bonuses. Only about 15% of revisions of past outcomes were to correct an error, compared with 69% resulting from measurement changes. After back-dated revisions, the following year showed an average 28.3% improvement of the metric being assessed, a gain that rose further to 36% when a CEO’s bonus was linked to the outcome. “Our results show that CSR contracting is associated with a greater number of CSR restatements, particularly when social performance measures are contained within CEO compensation contracts,” the paper, published in the Journal of Management Accounting Research, found. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Overall, our results suggest that compensation provides an incentive to manipulate CSR performance through restatements.” The authors, associate professor Helen Spiropoulos from the University of Technology Sydney and Rebecca Bachmann from Macquarie University, said CSR reporting was already perceived as “greenwashing” – the selective disclosure of positive environmental or social performance and the withholding of negative information. One motivation for the study was that CSR reporting remained “largely unregulated across the globe”. Separate research has identified that 37% of CSR reports from Global Fortune 250 firms included revisions with a bias towards overstatement, the authors noted. “CSR reporting is [also] an important issue given its increasing occurrence and pressure to conduct business in a way that minimises any negative social and environmental impacts,” the paper said. The authors hope the findings will be considered by the International Sustainability Standards Board. The body plans to draft sustainability reporting standards but has yet to consider issues surrounding metrics and measurement, it said. “Currently, there is significant discretion in how [environmental, social and governance] performance is measured and reported, and one way to show improved performance in the current year, is to adjust or restate last year’s score to reflect worse performance relative to this year,” Spiropoulos said in a statement. Bachman said: “Auditors who will be required to audit environmental performance disclosures under forthcoming sustainability assurance standards should also investigate the legitimacy of restatements.” “The irony is striking – what was intended to be a mechanism to drive positive environmental and social change may instead act as an incentive to manipulate sustainability performance.”",Corporate social responsibility; Business; Australia news; Australian economy; Environment,Environment
2023-03-19T07:45:33Z,‘We have money and power’: older Americans to blockade banks in climate protest,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben,"Climate activists across the US will on Tuesday blockade branches of banks that finance fossil fuels, cutting up their credit cards in protest and holding rallies featuring everything from flash mobs to papier-mache orca whales. Unusually for such a spectacle, the protests won’t be led by young activists but those of a grayer hue. The protests, across more than 90 locations, including Washington DC, are billed as the first set of mass climate demonstrations by older Americans, who have until now been far less visible than younger activists, such as the school strike movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg. In a nod to the more seasoned age of participants, older people in painted rocking chairs will block the entrances to some of the US’s largest banks to highlight their funding of oil and gas extraction. “So far the kids have had to do all of the work and they’ve done an amazing job but it’s not fair to ask 18-year-olds to solve this problem,” said Bill McKibben, the veteran climate campaigner who co-founded the Third Act group last year, which is designated for people aged over 60. The group has gathered momentum, attracting more than 50,000 members and recently holding a test-run protest in New York City, where participants marched under a banner reading “fossils against fossil fuels”. “Older people have got money and structural power coming out of our ears,” said McKibben, who is 62. “We have to show young people we have their back. I’m going to be dead before the climate crisis is at its absolute worst, but being nearer the exit than the entrance concentrates one’s mind to notions of legacy and we are the first generation to leave the world in a worse place than we found it. “I understand why people say ‘OK boomer’ – it’s not like we have done an amazing job in protecting the world.” While polling has shown that fears over global heating are most prevalent among younger people, to the extent that some question the wisdom of having children themselves, McKibben said he has found “huge concern” among older people about the climate emergency. “There is a sense people get more conservative as they age but I’m not sure if that’s true of this group of older people,” said McKibben, who pointed out that people in their 70s and 80s now were young people during the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. “The people sitting on rocking chairs on Tuesday were marching on the first Earth Day in 1970,” he said. “We probably all believed that the government would address these concerns – we may have gotten a little complacent.” McKibben said he hoped the protests would highlight the link between “cash in the bank and carbon in the air”. Third Act is encouraging people to sign a pledge to quit Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America if they don’t stop funding fossil fuels. The “big four” are the world’s leading banking financiers of oil and gas projects, despite variously committing to helping address the climate crisis, with a recent report finding they have collectively provided $1.1tn in financing to fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The protests, despite their months of planning, appear to be prescient, coming in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a leading funder of renewable energy projects, and a growing backlash against investor environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations by rightwing groups and leading Republicans, many themselves funded by fossil fuel interests. The previously bone-dry world of ESG, which is the effort to reduce investor risk to outside threats such as the climate crisis, has found itself thrust firmly into the US culture wars, with the governors of 18 Republican-led states, including the Florida governor and presumed presidential contender Ron DeSantis, last week jointly condemning the “proliferation of ESG throughout America” that is “putting investment decisions in the hands of the woke mob”. DeSantis has, without evidence, blamed the fall of Silicon Valley Bank on its diversity initiatives “and politics and all kinds of stuff”, leading a concerted Republican effort to paint financial institutions as being in thrall to progressive priorities in the form of ESG. Marlo Oaks, the Republican state treasurer of Utah, said last week that ESG was part of “Satan’s plan”. Joe Biden’s first presidential veto is expected to be over the issue of ESG, following a successful attempt by Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would have overturned an administration rule on sustainable investing. Biden’s rule had lifted a ban placed by Donald Trump upon money managers considering ESG and the climate crisis in investment decisions, such as assets that could be damaged by extreme weather, or become unviable in a decarbonized world. The furore over ESG has seen several Republican-led states draft legislation to ban consideration of the climate crisis in investments, despite the party’s previous support for free market economics. The attacks on ESG have been “politically motivated”, according to Amelia Miazad, a law professor and ESG market expert at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. “ESG is about risk management and generating sustainable value but its critics have made it about values, which is easy to attack,” she said. “The anti-ESG movement has just repeated a simple, inaccurate message over and over again. It’s quite remarkable market meddling by so-called free market advocates, telling investors and banks what they can and can’t invest in.” Miazad said that investors were now being “very careful” about mentioning ESG because it had become so politicized, instead favoring terms such as “sustainability”. “There has been a chilling of corporate speech because of this ESG backlash,” she said. “If they are worried about saying the C-word – climate – we are in a far worse place in terms of business norms, public discourse and democracy.”",Climate crisis; US news; Protest; Activism; Environment,Environment
2023-05-14T07:00:50Z,‘Sustainable’ pension funds accused of greenwashing over billions held in oil and gas firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/14/sustainable-pension-funds-accused-of-greenwashing-over-billions-held-in-oil-and-gas-firms,"People investing their pensions in funds that claim green credentials are being warned they may actually be backing the world’s largest oil and gas companies. Carbon Tracker Initiative said that asset managers have invested $376bn (£295bn) in oil and gas companies, despite publicly pledging to back efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. The environmental thinktank based in London and New York found that more than 160 funds with a green label held $4.6bn in 15 companies including ExxonMobil, Chevron and TotalEnergies. It also found that 25 members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative had invested in those companies and some had increased their holdings in 2022. NZAM said its international initiative started two years ago and investors needed time to change their strategies. The warning comes as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority prepares to publish anti-greenwashing rules that are intended to clean up how investment funds are labelled. Just under 50% of all UK employees now pay into employer schemes or private pensions where they can make a choice about how their money is invested – a huge rise since 2012 when employers became legally obliged to automatically enrol workers in a workplace scheme. Most people with a private pension or a stocks and shares ISA make a choice as to how their money is invested and many emphasise sustainability. The financial industry has reacted by creating funds badged as sustainable, climate, carbon, transition or ESG – short for environmental, social and governance. “What we found is that these funds, despite their names, can often include sometimes large positions in fossil fuel companies,” said Maeve O’Connor, one of the report’s authors, and an analyst at the Carbon Tracker Initiative. “For retail investors that could be seen to be misleading. If I’m investing in a green fund, do I want my investment to be going to ExxonMobil? Probably not.” According to the report, BlackRock’s ACS Climate Transition World Equity Fund says it invests in companies “well-positioned to maximise the opportunities and minimise the potential risks associated with a transition to a low-carbon economy” – but it has $219m in 10 of the 15 leading oil and gas companies. O’Connor said asset managers were usually given performance targets over short periods, which might influence their thinking. She said: “They could be assessed over two to five years and that timescale doesn’t really fit with the realities of the energy transition.” Coalitions such as UK Divest and Share Action campaign for pension funds to be invested sustainably. Robert Noyes, an energy economist at Platform London, part of UK Divest, said that with about £2tn invested in pensions, it was the largest source of investment in the UK and people should ask their pension providers for information. “People should ask three questions,” he said. “Does it invest in the problem, like a company that spends money on fossil fuels? Does it invest in things that drive changes in the real economy that lead environmental programmes? So, for example, it’s hard to see how investing in Microsoft is driving a change towards net zero. “And thirdly, is it vocal about the need for political action?” A spokesperson for NZAM said that while its partners “share Carbon Tracker’s perspective that the oil and gas industry must very rapidly decarbonise to meet the urgency of the climate crisis, the Net Zero Asset Managers’ commitment statement does not require signatories to choose equity holdings to meet a particular climate target”. It added: “Passive investors cannot divest from the oil and gas sector without significantly changing their investment strategy.” NZAM expected those funds with passive portfolios to engage in dialogue with companies, proxy voting and policy advocacy to align their holdings with the 1.5C commitment. Asset managers depended on governments to follow through their own commitments under the Paris agreement, the spokesperson added.",Pensions industry; Fossil fuel divestment; Business; Financial Conduct Authority; Regulators; UK news; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Environment; Fossil fuels; Money; Pensions; Energy,Business
2024-05-21T12:00:03Z,A new project promised low-income families ‘zero net energy homes’ – but they still rely on gas,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/21/gas-company-habitat-for-humanity,"US gas utilities are partnering with one of the nation’s most trusted non-profits as part of a “cynical PR stunt” to combat efforts to curb fossil fuel usage, a Guardian investigation has found. Local Habitat for Humanity affiliates have teamed up with at least four utilities across 10 states to build “zero-net energy homes”, which are meant to produce more energy than they use. The houses, which are sold at affordable rates to low-income families, are weatherized and meticulously insulated to boost efficiency and equipped with rooftop solar panels. But they also come with appliances powered by gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel that has been shown to degrade indoor air quality. The utilities say the homes provide lower electricity bills and affordable mortgages for vulnerable families. “It’s part of our culture to really give back to the communities that we serve,” Jennifer Altieri, vice-president of public affairs for Atmos Energy’s Colorado-Kansas division, said in a video announcing the utility’s first Habitat home in Evans, Colorado, in September 2021, which was provided to a single mother and her children. Yet Atmos has privately described the project as something closer to a public relations tactic, intentionally launched in a state that is “on the frontlines” of attempts to quell reliance on gas. Atmos has since expanded the Habitat partnerships to seven communities, with plans to launch similar initiatives in at least two more. National Fuel in the north-east, SoCal Gas in southern California, and Nicor in Illinois have also partnered with Habitat on zero-net energy (ZNE) projects. The moves by utilities to attach themselves to social justice causes come as the US is embroiled in a broader political culture war over federal, state and local attempts to phase out gas and make new buildings electric. The projects by Atmos and others have won widespread praise from gas interest groups. An autumn 2022 feature in Southeast Gas’s magazine Natural Living says the Atmos-Habitat partnerships promote “healthy living”, and that same year, its Evans, Colorado, home was a finalist for an ESG award from the Southern Gas Association. “These ZNE homes demonstrate that natural gas is a part of the solution to achieve our low-carbon energy future,” the award submission says. Habitat for Humanity International has participated in international climate negotiations and says it prioritizes climate safety. In a statement, the non-profit said: “We know that innovation is required so future construction doesn’t exacerbate the climate crisis.” Habitat for Humanity says it helps millions of people access affordable homes each year who are often “among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change”. But to do so, it relies on independent, locally run affiliates, which can decide how houses are built and funded. Asked about the perceived conflict between the gas utility partnerships and its climate-related statements, a spokesperson for the organization said the group’s affiliates “engage a wide range of partners”. The world is “facing a growing crisis in affordable, adequate housing” which requires “a multi-faceted challenge that demands non-profit organizations, individuals, corporate partners, elected officials and more to work alongside one another”, he said. He said Habitat’s advocacy and partnerships were “designed to confront the housing crisis and ensure more people have a decent place to call home”. But critics say those arrangements appear to have opened the door for gas utilities to attach themselves to the organization and its reputation. “It’s a cynical PR stunt by the gas utilities,” said Itai Vardi, research and communications manager at the utility watchdog group the Energy and Policy Institute, which provided some research about the partnerships to the Guardian. “We know that we need to transition very rapidly and dramatically off of fossil fuels, and there’s really no good reason to build new construction that is not all electric.” Zero-net energy homes “Zero-net energy” is a building standard requiring a home to produce as much energy as it uses. Builders first work to boost a home’s efficiency with insulation and air sealing, then equip the home with energy production capacity, such as solar panels. But efficient homes that still use gas should not be considered climate-friendly, said Mike Henchen, who leads the carbon-free buildings program at the pro-electrification non-profit RMI. “When it comes to climate, gas is part of the problem,” he said. “There’s this effort to hype natural gas as clean energy, but it’s not.” Gas is primarily composed of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planet-warming than carbon dioxide in the short term. In the US, gas accounts for the vast majority of planet-heating pollution from buildings, which makes up more than one-10th of all US greenhouse gas emissions. The utilities say the projects illustrate that gas can be part of decarbonization efforts. Describing its Habitat partnerships to American Gas Magazine, a representative from the gas utility Nicor said: “These homes demonstrate the importance of natural gas as part of a diverse energy mix in a net-zero future.” Jennifer Golz, spokesperson for Nicor, said that “research shows a hybrid energy approach will help drive greater emissions reductions at lower overall costs” while improving reliability during extreme weather. A spokesperson for Atmos said: “We believe a balanced energy approach that includes natural gas and preserves energy choice, rather than supporting specific fuels or technologies, will achieve goals of reducing emissions while maintaining energy reliability.” But climate experts agree that gas must be swiftly curbed to avert climate catastrophe. Spokespeople from Atmos and Nicor did not directly respond to questions about that scientific consensus. In an emailed comment, a representative from Colorado’s Greeley-Weld Habitat affiliate said: “We have long constructed homes with a variety of energy sources, including natural gas and electricity.” Daniel Aldana Cohen, a co-director of the progressive thinktank Climate and Community Project, said the gas-powered ZNE projects made an unnecessary compromise: they tie access to affordable housing to increased planet-heating pollution. “The two great existential crises that most people face are eviction and climate breakdown, and the second one is making the first one worse,” said Aldana Cohen, whose research has informed federal Green New Deal for Public Housing proposals. Health concerns Experts have long warned that gas appliances can emit pollutants, including carcinogens. In recent years, a slew of studies have linked gas stoves to increased risk of childhood asthma, chronic lung disease and other health impacts. Low-income people and people of color may be at higher risk if exposed to these pollutants, as they are more likely to have asthma and other underlying respiratory issues due to disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants. Gas trade groups note a recent World Health Organization-funded study found gas stoves had a non-significant impact on childhood asthma. The same study noted a connection between gas use and pneumonia and lower respiratory infections. Last year, US regulators suggested a potential eventual nationwide gas stove ban, though Biden later ruled out such a policy. Yet the utilities behind the partnerships have repeatedly referred to gas as “clean”. And during a dedication ceremony for a zero-net energy home built by a Habitat affiliate and Atmos in Lafayette, Louisiana, a representative from the utility claimed that the air quality in the home would be of “the best quality breathing air that you can have”. Spokespeople from Atmos and Nicor did not respond to inquiries about whether the ZNE homes included gas stoves. But an Atmos representative in a December 2023 industry webinar said there was “natural gas cooking in these homes, in every single one of them”. Asked about concerns that gas appliances can degrade indoor air quality, a representative for Atmos Energy directed the Guardian to claims made by the American Gas Association, a major trade group for private gas utilities. Public relations Despite evidence of the dangers of gas, utilities and their interest groups are using the Habitat partnerships as a public relations tool. The Energy Solutions Center, a trade association of gas utilities, cited the partnerships in a gas-promoting marketing document for its members, which was reviewed by the Guardian. (In an emailed statement, the executive director of Energy Solutions Center, Sonia Vahedian, pointed to recent studies that it said showed gas “remains essential for energy security and will significantly contribute to economic security beyond 2050”.) And during a December 2023 industry webinar, a recording of which was also reviewed by the Guardian, a representative from Atmos said that the project began as a response to attempts to ban gas in buildings. “In Colorado, they are a little bit on the frontlines, as far as some of the efforts to maybe dissuade people from utilizing natural gas,” a representative of the utility said. “And as such, that became the chosen site for our very first natural gas-fueled ZNE home build.” Another representative went on to describe the need to produce a “marketable” product. “Like everyone in the natural gas industry … we’ve kept an eye on the growing loud voice for green energy and squeezing out fossil fuels as an energy source,” he said, adding that the partnerships sought to show that “natural gas can be a part of that future solution or transition state”. The choice to “combine with renewables”, the representative says, is “kind of a great talking point that ‘hey, we’re partnering with renewables, we’re not against them.’” It’s a strategy that was highlighted in a congressional report last month, based on a tranche of subpoenaed internal documents. A 2018 draft presentation from BP said one way to “harness excitement” about renewables was to suggest gas could be a backup fuel source for wind and solar. Atmos representatives on the call also said Habitat had a “well-oiled machine in terms of public relations”. “Utilities enter into places where government investment is lacking and use that to promote its product, but also brandish its image through these kinds of PR stunts,” Vardi said. Environmental justice Each ZNE home in these projects has gone to low-income members of vulnerable communities, including immigrants, people of color and veterans. “The gas companies,” said Aldana Cohen, “are essentially using poor people as human shields to perpetuate a business model that is going to do the most harm to poor people.” It’s not the only instance of fossil fuel interests hitching their wagon to this kind of advocacy. Reports show that utilities have long funded Black civil rights leaders; the NAACP in 2020 urged local chapters to stop accepting this funding. Promotional materials often say the ZNE homes can help lower energy bills. “Natural gas is really important to the homes we build because it’s reliable, predictable and affordable month to month,” a representative of the Habitat affiliate in Austin, Texas, said in a 2021 report on environmental, social and governance investments. In a 2022 call with financial analysts shared with the Guardian by the Energy and Policy Institute, Atmos’s CEO, Kevin Akers, said the ZNE homes demonstrated “the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner”. Recent research, however, shows that newer, efficient electric appliances – such as heat pumps and induction stoves – can cost the same amount or even less to run as their gas-powered counterparts, though they can be more expensive to install. In some cases, utilities are also using customers’ money to pay to build the homes. In Mississippi, public utility commission documents shared by the Energy and Policy Institute show Atmos is recovering costs to build the ZNE homes from ratepayers. Zero-net? Though the projects are billed “zero-net energy” homes, it is not clear that they are always meeting that goal. SoCal Gas in 2017 partnered with Habitat for Humanity of Orange county on a ZNE home, and has touted the benefits of “dual-fuel” ZNE homes over all-electric ones, saying customers prefer them. But a 2021 study funded by SoCalGas and the California Energy Commission comparing two ZNE homes in the city of Stockton – one fully electric model and another home that included both solar panels and gas appliances – seemed to undercut the purported benefits of gas. Researchers found that the all-electric home produced more energy than it used, but the gas-powered model did not achieve ZNE status. In webinars held last year researchers noted that even when ZNE homes do not achieve “absolute zero”, they can still help to promote efficiency. ZNE homes with gas can meet the zero-net benchmark – in a statement, Atmos said its Habitat homes have done so – and not all fully electric ZNE homes necessarily achieve the goal. Still, Vardi said the SoCal Gas-funded study provided yet more evidence that gas is unnecessary. “There is really no reason to build new construction that is not all electric,” he said. Some Habitat partnerships show that this is possible. Habitat’s affiliate in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, built all-electric homes in partnership with a Cape Cod utility, which in 2021 were the “best-rated” Habitat homes in the nation in terms of efficiency. Another affiliate in Massachusetts’s Pioneer Valley built an affordable, all-electric ZNE home that won praise from the federal government. This year, the federal government announced $2bn for a coalition of non-profits including Habitat for Humanity International and Rewiring America to build fully electric low-income housing. The costs The projects began amid a widespread lack of affordable housing in the US. A poll this year found that most US renters believe they will never be able to afford a home, and that a majority live in areas that are so unaffordable that they are “barely livable”. Meanwhile, US public housing stock shrank by 25% between 2009 and 2022, according to a recent analysis of federal data by Climate and Community Project. Habitat depends on financial donations to fund their work, which Aldana Cohen said created the opportunity for “dramatic inconsistency or contradiction, like using affordable housing to prop up the gas industry”. In another example, Habitat International, has accepted donations from the multinational fossil fuel conglomerate Koch Industries. “When you delegate things to any number of non-profits and for-profit companies, you’re far more likely to just get totally self-serving interventions,” he said. “There’s no reason to lock a single social policy priority, like affordable housing, into the survival of the fossil fuel industry,” he said.",Gas; US news; Environment; Gas; Climate crisis; Housing; Energy,US news
2023-08-25T10:00:07Z,‘He’s an insider’: Ramaswamy’s deep ties to rightwing kingpins revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/25/vivek-ramaswamy-rightwing-elite-close-ties-leonard-leo-peter-thiel,"Vivek Ramaswamy has described himself as an “outsider”, accusing rivals for the Republican presidential nomination of being “bought and paid for” by donors and special interests. But the 38-year-old Ohio-based venture capitalist, whose sharp-elbowed and angry display stood out in the first Republican debate this week, has his own close ties to influential figures from both sides of the political aisle. Prominent among such connections are Peter Thiel, the co-founder of tech giants PayPal and Palantir and a rightwing mega-donor, and Leonard Leo, the activist who has marshaled unprecedented sums in his push to stock federal courts with conservative judges. Ramaswamy is a Yale Law School friend of JD Vance, the author of the bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy who enjoyed success in finance before entering politics. At Yale, Vance and Ramaswamy attended what the New Yorker called an “intimate lunch seminar for select students” that was hosted by Thiel. Last year, backed by Thiel and espousing hard-right Trumpist views, Vance won a US Senate seat in Ohio. Thiel has since said he has stepped back from political donations. But he has backed Ramaswamy’s business career, supporting what the New Yorker called “a venture helping senior citizens access Medicare” and, last year, backing Strive Asset Management, a fund launched by Ramaswamy to attack environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies among corporate investors. Vance was also a backer. Ramaswamy’s primary vehicle to success has been Roivant, an investment company focused on the pharmaceuticals industry founded in 2014. The Roivant advisory board includes figures from both the Republican and Democratic establishments: Kathleen Sebelius, US health secretary under Barack Obama; Tom Daschle of South Dakota, formerly Democratic leader in the US Senate; and Olympia Snowe, formerly a Republican senator from Maine. Ramaswamy’s links to Leo – recently the recipient of a $1.6bn donation from the industrialist Barre Seid, believed to be the biggest ever such gift, but now reportedly the subject an investigation by the attorney general of Washington DC – are many. As reported by ProPublica and Documented, Ramaswamy has spoken at retreats staged by Teneo, a group Leo chairs and which aims to connect high-powered conservatives, to “crush liberal dominance” in American life. Other Teneo speakers have reportedly included Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor polling ahead of Ramaswamy in the Republican primary, and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who trails Ramaswamy and clashed with him on stage in Milwaukee. ProPublica also linked Thiel to the genesis of the Teneo group. According to a document seen by the Guardian, Ramaswamy became a Teneo member in 2021. Elsewhere, Ramaswamy is a board member of the Philanthropy Roundtable, a group with ties to Leo, and a member of the Federalist Society, the Leo-driven group which works to stock the courts with conservatives. Ramaswamy has also spoken to and received an award from the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), a group of Republican state treasurers. In June, in South Carolina, the Post and Courier newspaper reported that last year, before launching his presidential bid, Ramaswamy attempted “to leverage his [Republican] connections to gain access [for Strive] to lucrative contracts to manage pension funds … [with] total assets of $39.6bn”. Similar pushes were mounted in Missouri and Indiana, the paper said. Curtis Loftis, the South Carolina state treasurer, told the Post and Courier there was “nothing improper” about such approaches. Asked about Ramaswamy’s claims to be an outsider in light of his links to rightwing donors, activists and establishment figures, a campaign spokesperson told the Guardian: “Vivek has lived the American dream and has had tremendous success in business. “There’s a colossal difference between someone who has friendships and business relationships with wealthy individuals and politicians who change their policies and positions to please their Super Pac donors,” they added. ••• In the Wisconsin debate, Ramaswamy flourished in the absence of Donald Trump, the former US president who faces 91 criminal charges but nonetheless leads Republican polling by huge margins. Amid speculation that Ramaswamy might end up Trump’s running mate, Reed Galen, a Republican operative turned co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, called Ramaswamy “a classic 2020s America tech bro bullshit artist … Trump for the 21st century”. Ramaswamy’s claim to be an outsider, Galen said, was part of his “fundamental understanding … that Maga [the pro-Trump Republican base] wants him to show that the rest of these people [in the primary] are politicians. He’s willing to be the showman … the outsider. Anti-establishment. ‘If anything is there, I dislike it because it’s there.’ You know, ‘I’m going to have fun with this. I’m not going to take it seriously because you’re a bunch of hacks and goons.’” But in another sense, regarding Ramaswamy’s ties to the likes of Leo and Thiel, Galen said: “I think that he’s an insider. “He walks into a room with Leonard Leo and says, ‘What do you need me to do?’ … And they’re like, ‘Here’s what we want you to do. Here’s what we need you to do.’ Right? “Do I think [Ramaswamy] cares about [issues like restricting] abortion? No, not particularly. I don’t think he has a firmly held belief on it. But if he thinks that it will help him, and in exchange for that Leonard Leo will throw a little chicken feed of the $1.6bn that old man gave him, to help him? Sure, what the hell? “He didn’t ever think he’d get this far. So now he’s just gonna push it as far as he can.” Ramaswamy, Galen said, was closely tied to a world of donors and non-profits in which Leo is “certainly at the center. And this movement only moves in one direction, and it’s toward the darkness. It’s towards authoritarianism. And it’s because it finds people like Ramaswamy. And the more that all these other candidates will now attack him, they will drive him further and further into the arms of those people.”",US elections 2024; Republicans; The far right; US politics; US news; Vivek Ramaswamy,US news
2024-06-11T07:00:37Z,World’s top banks ‘greenwashing their role in destruction of the Amazon’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/11/worlds-top-banks-greenwashing-their-role-in-destruction-of-the-amazon,"Five of the world’s biggest banks are “greenwashing” their role in the destruction of the Amazon, according to a report that indicates that their environmental and social guidelines fail to cover more than 70% of the rainforest. The institutions are alleged to have provided billions of dollars of finance to oil and gas companies involved in projects that are impacting the Amazon, destabilising the climate or impinging on the land and livelihoods of Indigenous peoples. The banks say they follow ethical policies that help to protect intact forests, biodiversity hotspots, indigenous territories and nature reserves. However, the investigation says it has found geographical and technical limitations on their ability to monitor and achieve these stated goals. The report was produced by the watchdog organisation Stand.earth and the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA). The organisations mapped the extent of the environmental and social governance (ESG) commitments of five leading funders of fossil fuel operators in the South American biome. Those banks – Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Itaú Unibanco, Santander and Bank of America – together account for more than half of the loans to companies in this sector. The analysis found that on average, 71% of the Amazon is not effectively protected by the five banks’ risk management policies for climate change, biodiversity, forest cover, and Indigenous peoples’ and local communities’ rights. The gaps ranged significantly from company to company. At one end of the spectrum is JPMorgan Chase, whose biodiversity protections, the report’s authors say, apply only to Unesco world heritage sites that cover just 2% of the Amazon and are, in any case, unlikely to be considered for oil and gas exploration. On the positive side, the study commended the British bank HSBC, which was once a major funder of destructive projects in the region but has not provided any financing since it adopted a 100% Amazon exclusion policy in December 2022. “So far, HSBC has been true to their word,” said Angeline Robertson, the lead author of the report. “This shows it can be done and has been done, even by a company that used to have a big stake” Some banks argue they play a positive role by encouraging extractive industries to adopt more responsible policies. However, according to the authors of the report, while bank loan arrangements involve long-term relationships and potential influence, the majority of financing by the big five comes in the form of syndicated general corporate purpose bonds. These bonds, which are standard practice, are for broadly defined purposes and require little or no follow-up once an agreement is signed. This potentially makes it difficult to apply due diligence guidelines on specific environmental or social concerns. The Spanish bank Santander – Europe’s largest financier of oil and gas in the Amazon and fourth largest worldwide with almost $1.4bn (£1.1bn) in direct financing between 2009 and 2023 – has one of the most extensive exclusion policies for oil and gas, covering 16% of the Amazon, but the report indicates that 85% of its transactions are in the form of syndicated bonds, which lack transparency and reduce the bank’s liability as a contributor to adverse impacts. The authors examined 560 transactions involving oil and gas activities by 280 banks over the past 20 years in the Amazon using Stand’s Amazon Banks Database, to determine whether deal structures that bypass ESG exclusions and screens are common. They found two North American banks, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, have made the most capital available – $2.43bn and $2.42bn respectively – to companies that operate oil and gas projects in the Amazon. JPMorgan Chase recently withdrew from the Equator Principles Association, which serves as a common baseline for institutions to manage environmental and social risks when financing projects. The third biggest financier over the past two decades is Itaú Unibanco of Brazil, which, the report claims, does not have any exclusions or screens that apply to oil and gas operations in the region. The database shows it has financed projects by Eneva, Frontera, Geopark, Petrobras, Petroquimica Comodoro Rivadavia and Transportadora de Gas del Perú. Fifth on the list was Bank of America. Last year, it was the number one financier of oil and gas in the Amazon and extended 99% of transactions in the form of syndicated bonds, the report says, which means these deals would not necessarily have been subjected to enhanced ESG screening. The report urges banks to adopt a geographic exclusion covering all transactions involving the oil and gas sector in the Amazon. The authors say this is essential because the rainforest is the world’s most important terrestrial carbon sink and home of biodiversity, yet it is degrading towards a point of no return. “We are literally living in a rainforest on fire, our rivers are either polluted or drying up,” said Fany Kuiru, the general coordinator of COICA. “Our fate is your fate: the Amazon is critical for the future of our planet. The banks try to wash their hands of the blame through vague policies but must be held accountable for the damage their money is causing to Amazonian Indigenous peoples and the biodiversity of the rainforest. Not a single drop of Amazon oil has been extracted with the consent of Indigenous peoples. We demand Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Itaú Unibanco, Santander and Bank of America to end oil and gas financing.” Since Stand.earth launched its Exit Amazon Oil and Gas campaign, it says several banks including BNP Paribas, Natixis, ING, and Credit Suisse have promised to end their financing of trade in oil from ports in Ecuador and Peru, which covers much of the fossil fuel trade from the Amazon. HSBC and Barclays have also applied comprehensive geographic exclusion policies. The authors say they want to work with the remaining funders of Amazon oil and gas to tighten their ESG policies and exclude petroleum projects in the rainforest from their portfolios. Robertson said the five banks have policies that “seem very token; they appear to be more about risk to reputation than risks of impacts on the ground”. But she stressed this could change. “There are lots of opportunities for banks to respond adequately and to embody environmental risk in their portfolios because that is what the future holds. With climate change and biodiversity loss looming over us, we need banks making better decision for the sake of their clients and their own business interests. This is a reckoning here and a call to responsibility. “We have tried to give a sense of the adverse effects on the ground. This is an effort not just to reveal banks’ greenwashing but to put voices front and centre of those most affected in the Amazon.” Some in the financial industry dispute the methodology of the report, saying it was not appropriate to add up multi-year financing, lines of credit, refinancing and indirect financing and then suggest this amount was funnelled to a particular group. They said general corporate purposes loans have long comprised the vast majority of the credit markets and that it would be necessary to ask specific companies whether or how this capital is used. Several banks said they apply ESG guidelines to general corporate purpose bonds. Citibank said it had a “comprehensive enterprise security risk management policy, which outlines our expectations for clients and leads us to do enhanced due diligence around activities with elevated risks related to human rights, biodiversity, Indigenous peoples, critical habitats, community conflict and/or environmental justice. We engage directly with clients to evaluate their commitment, capacity, policies, management systems and staffing to manage these specific environmental and social risks.” The company updated its agricultural risk policy in 2022. JPMorgan Chase said: “We support fundamental principles of human rights, including Indigenous peoples’ rights, across all our lines of business and in each region of the world in which we operate. Our 2023 ESG report reflects our policies and practices regarding environmental and social risks as well as human rights, including restricted activities and sensitive business activities. Client and transaction screening against our restricted activities and sensitive business activities subject to enhanced review includes GCP (general corporate purposes) financing activities. It is not limited to project finance.” Regarding JPMorgan Chase’s decision to leave the Equator Principles Association, a spokesperson added that EPA membership was “not necessary for us to independently uphold best-in-class environmental and social risk management standards”, and that the company would remain aligned to the organisation’s principles. Bank of America referred the Guardian to its environmental and social risk policy framework, which notes “enhanced due diligence for transactions in which the majority use of proceeds is attributed to identified activities that may negatively impact an area used by or traditionally claimed by an indigenous community”. A spokesperson for Santander said: “We understand fully the importance of protecting the Amazon and supporting sustainable development in the region. All financing decision are guided by a strict policy framework approved by our board of directors, and our activities align with all environmental regulations in the region. We are also actively involved in several industry initiatives to protect the region and work proactively with clients, as well as other banks, governments, regulators and other institutions to help improve practices, recognising this is a highly complex challenge that requires a multifaceted, multilateral response.” Itaú Unibanco said it operates in line with the principles of the Net Zero Banking Alliance and is working on decarbonisation targets, including for the oil and gas sector, within the scope of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. A spokesperson said: “Regarding the Amazon biome, the bank has been working to bring down deforestation in the region by monitoring environmental, social and climate risks, guided by the best practices in the international market.” Further information about the bank’s actions and commitments can be found in its ESG Report.",Amazon rainforest; Banking; Banco Santander; Citigroup; JP Morgan; Bank of America; Deforestation; Environment; Business; World news,Environment
2022-12-27T14:15:14Z,Chuka Umunna advises Czech tycoon accused of Royal Mail plot,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/27/chuka-umunna-advises-czech-tycoon-accused-of-royal-mail-plot,"The MP turned banker, Chuka Umunna, is advising a Czech tycoon who was accused by union leaders of planning a secret takeover of Royal Mail. The former Labour MP is one of a team of bankers working on Daniel Křetínský’s British business interests, many of which are held within Vesa Equity Investment, including a 23% stake in Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS). Postal workers have held a wave of strikes over the Christmas period, amid souring relations between Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union (CWU). The Czech billionaire also holds a 10% share in supermarket Sainsbury’s via Vesa, and is a part-owner of West Ham United football club. Umunna joined investment bank JP Morgan in 2021 to lead its European environmental, social and governance (ESG) work. His advisory role, first reported by the Telegraph, risks accusations of hypocrisy for the former Labour politician who was previously a fierce critic of the privatisation of Royal Mail. In 2014, Umunna told the then business secretary, Vince Cable, that the privatisation had “disgracefully shortchanged to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds”. He added: “Those [Cable] once referred to as spivs and gamblers are laughing all the way to the bank.” Umunna also stated in a blog aimed at constituents that he would pursue an “appropriate degree of price control” for Royal Mail products and services if Labour were in government. He did not respond to a request for comment. In September, Royal Mail denied suggestions by Dave Ward, head of the CWU, that it was in talks regarding a private equity takeover by Vesa. That followed a letter from Ward to then business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng suggesting that Royal Mail owner IDS was in talks with Vesa regarding a “potential takeover bid”. Křetínský, who also leads one of the biggest energy business groups in Europe, has been dubbed the “Czech sphinx” by Polish media due to his guarded approach in business and the media. The billionaire also owns UK power stations. Vesa did not respond to a request for comment. His investment outfit’s stake in Royal Mail was the subject of a national security investigation by the business department, which concluded in October. The decision to take no action allows Vesa to increase its current stake in Royal Mail above 25%. JP Morgan declined to comment on its work for Vesa or on Umunna’s team’s advisory role. FGS Global, part of the WPP group which absorbed PR company Finsbury and whose co-chairman Roland Rudd has also been linked with the Labour party, is also understood to be advising on Křetínský business interests. Křetínský’s links to Russia have been subject to intense scrutiny since the country’s violent invasion of Ukraine. Křetínský’s EP Infrastructure (EPIF) business owns a 49% holding in Eustream, which operates a system piping Russian gas to central and eastern Europe via Slovakia.

2023-06-21T06:30:05Z,Are debt-for-nature swaps the way forward for conservation?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/are-debt-for-nature-swaps-way-forward-for-conservation-aoe,"After decades in the wilderness, and familiar to only those in the know, “debt-for-nature swaps” are becoming one of the hottest things in conservation finance. Last month, Ecuador struck the biggest deal of its kind: refinancing $1.6bn (£1.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Galápagos Islands. Other nature-rich countries that are struggling to pay their debts have taken notice and deals are rumoured in Gabon and Sri Lanka. The market for debt-for-nature swaps is poised to exceed $800bn, according to Bloomberg, prompting fierce competition between banks as demand for green investments increases. Debt-for-nature swaps mean reducing a developing country’s debt burden in exchange for guaranteed finance for nature. Supporters of the concept – which has its roots in the 1980s debt crisis and an idea from the late “father of biodiversity”, Thomas Lovejoy – say it is a win-win for financiers, countries and conservationists. This week, the subject will be on the agenda at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Barbados entered into its own $150m debt-for-nature deal in 2021. “The world is facing a biodiversity, climate and debt crisis, which is even more pronounced in the developing world,” says Slav Gatchev, managing director of sustainable debt for the Nature Conservancy (TNC), which is often involved in facilitating deals. “There is an overlap between biodiversity hotspots in the tropics and excessive levels of debt,” he says. “Typically, countries approach us because they’ve seen that these deals can be done at scale. “You can move the needle in terms of financial pinch points, resolving liquidity constraints before they become solvency problems and, because of our role as a conservation organisation, we can be an honest broker when it comes to implementing these programmes on the ground.” But detractors of the deals warn of greenwashing, and have criticised agreements in which banks often take large fees with comparatively small amounts going to conservation. In a note to investors in January, Barclays questioned the green credentials of debt-for-nature swaps – often sold as ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments – because only a small fraction of the deal size ends up with conservation. This claim is strongly disputed by the banks involved. Separately, Daniel Ortega Pacheco, a former Ecuadorian environment minister, is concerned about the potential implications of the agreements for sovereignty. Last month’s Galápagos agreement requires Ecuador to provide about $18m a year to conserve waters near the islands, mostly for a new Hermandad marine reserve that hosts whale sharks, blue whales and leatherback turtles. “When you take a closer look at nature-for-debt swaps, Moody’s actually says they count as a default. [A deal] might prejudice developing countries in the long term and there are restrictions on how the money can be spent. Even after the second world war, Germany was free to decide where to invest,” he says. The concerns are echoed by Katie Kedward, a UCL research fellow, who says the agreements do not go far enough. “The pandemic has brought debt restructuring back into the conversation. In terms of sovereign debt burdens, those constraints are preventing countries from investing in conservation and adaptation to the increased risks of climate change. “I would argue that we need to go further and look at debt forgiveness. I am hugely sceptical about how debt-for-nature swaps are being implemented in practice,” she says. Gatchev says these concerns are unfounded, pointing to case studies by TNC of deals in Belize and Barbados, which he says show that the benefit accrues to the countries. The deals are specific to the requirements of each country and try to anticipate potential problems. The Belize agreement includes natural disaster insurance, intended to avoid the scenario where the country is forced to pay for conservation instead of rebuilding after a hurricane. The reasons for entering the agreements bear striking parallels to the arguments of Lovejoy in 1984, when the idea was first developed. “As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to go,” Lovejoy wrote in the New York Times at the time. “Costa Rica’s superb national park system cannot be staffed or enlarged without private donations from outside the country. “Brazil’s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency can do little more than pay the salaries of its employees; when fires recently broke out in its national park system, there were few guards around to fight them,” he said. In Paris, Mia Mottley’s Bridgetown agenda will attempt to reform global finance for the environmental crises of the modern age. For some, the nature-for-debt swap is part of the answer.

2024-02-01T14:00:25Z,Wedge issue: the fight against a 350ha freight hub in Melbourne’s green fringe ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/02/wedge-issue-the-fight-against-a-350ha-freight-hub-in-melbournes-green-fringe,"The land west of Melbourne is flat and productive. No mountain range hems in the city’s growth. Instead, the border is built by planning policy, a promise set down in the 1970s to maintain 12 “green wedges” to serve as the city’s lungs and its food bowl. Two of those green wedge zones – Western Plains South and Werribee South – sit just outside the urban growth boundary, a dotted line on the planning maps that crosses the M1 freeway just outside Werribee. They contain some of the last of Victoria’s critically endangered grasslands and are intended to be off limits to major development. So it was a shock to locals to discover the area was set to become home to a large freight hub. Merryn Pike has lived in Little River, a community on the southern edge of the Western Plains South green wedge, for 30 years. Her home is just 1km from the 550-hectare proposed site of the intermodal container terminal, which is being built by Pacific National. About 200ha of land has been set aside as a biodiversity area, with the eventual footprint of the freight hub on the remaining 350ha. The whole site, which sits between the existing interstate rail corridor and Old Melbourne Road, is designated green wedge land by the state planning department. Pike’s property is home to several threatened species, including the Growling Grass Frog and Legless Lizard. She calls it her personal wildlife sanctuary and says it’s now under threat. The risk feels particularly acute because the home was a retreat for Pike’s daughter during her lifelong battle with congenital illness, before her death last year. “If the proposal goes ahead it will be replaced by concrete, trucks, noise, light and air pollution. The township as it operates now will cease to exist,” Pike says. “When will this country stop barrelling toward the extinction of many of our unique species?” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The waterways around Little River and Werribee are recognised as biodiversity corridors, and are within the footprint of the proposed Western Grasslands reserves, a public land acquisition project that began in 2010 to preserve the critically endangered ecosystem. As of the original deadline in 2020, an auditor general’s report found just 10% of the proposed 15,000ha had been acquired. Resident Emma Sutcliffe says the proposal to build a freight hub in Little River is “an enormous slap in the face”. “Little River is surrounded by a green wedge, set aside as lungs to provide clean air and restore the city,” she says. “Concreting over it will destroy the town.” In its 2023 environmental, social and governance report, Pacific National says a “large portion of the site will be retained to support existing biodiversity”. Plans for the freight terminal to connect Melbourne’s major western freight zone to the inland rail network were made public three years ago. But Sutcliffe says the community was not properly consulted. She contacted the company and government representatives after hearing the initial reports, and says she was told there was “nothing to worry about”. “I can see the site from my office,” she says. “My home is well and truly within one kilometre. The whole town is within 10km. We will all be subject to noise, light and diesel particulate. “[It] will turn Little River from a lovely rural township with a great community to a scattered collection of properties owned by land-banking foreign companies. Plus, the thought of the environmental and climate impact on something like this is just insane.” Pacific National has invested $20m in detailed planning and design works, aiming for an 80ha intermodal terminal to be operational by 2026. It says the initial project will support more than 200 jobs. The site would later be expanded to include a logistics precinct serviced by the rail terminal as well as warehousing, cold storage, and re-fuelling facilities. At full capacity, it is expected to create 3,500 jobs. In a statement released at the project’s announcement in 2021, the Pacific National chief executive, Paul Scurrah, said the terminal in Little River would “help to shift more freight from road to rail until delivery of the western interstate freight terminal” in nearby Truganina. He emphasised the safety and environmental benefits of hauling large volumes of freight by rail. “Pacific National’s new Little River site is in a prime position on the main interstate rail line and close to the Princes Freeway, delivering efficient freight transport connectivity to nearby logistics companies, distribution centres, warehouses, shippers, and manufacturers,” he said. “By using our services, 400 Pacific National customers enjoy immediate and strong [environmental, social, and corporate governance] performance metrics and credentials, including being part of freight services, which help reduce traffic congestion, road accidents and fatalities, and vehicle emissions.” But environmental advocates say Victoria cannot afford to lose the remaining native grasslands at Little River. Dr Adrian Marshall, the facilitator of the Grassy Plains Network, says the critically endangered grasslands are “an entire ecosystem on the brink of extinction”. He says the environmental surveys conducted by the company to date are not sufficient. “The surveys Pacific National conducted were inadequate, conducted at the wrong time of year, and haven’t looked in all the places they should have,” Marshall says. Building over a section of the grasslands, as well as the increase in sound and noise pollution from the proposed freight hub, could lead to a “cascading range of impacts”, he says. “There is also a downstream risk of contamination entering the river and getting to Port Phillip Bay, its Ramsar wetlands and incredible biodiversity.” The project is now going through an environmental effects assessment process, which will include a period of public comment. Pacific National did not respond to a request for comment. Pike says any impact on the grasslands should be carefully considered. “Nature is precious, it needs protecting,” she says. “It takes years and years to build up habitat. To lose it to construction would be devastating.”",Australia news; Victoria; Rural Australia; Transport,Australia news
2023-07-29T17:01:00Z,From Brexit to Coutts – has Nigel Farage become Britain’s most influential politician? | Andrew Anthony,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/give-nigel-farage-grievance-whip-up-storm-coutts,"Who is the most consequential British politician of the 21st century? Tony Blair? David Cameron? Liz Truss? OK, the last one was a joke, but someone else who is also widely regarded as a punchline has a strong claim to the title. Whatever one thinks of Nigel Farage, back in the news for bringing about the resignation of NatWest’s chief executive Alison Rose and Coutts boss Peter Flavel, he has been instrumental in changing Britain. Few observers would argue that his campaign to remove the UK from the European Union has led to a beneficial change, but almost everyone would agree that it’s been a profound one. In Britain, where the first-past-the-post voting system neuters small parties, single-issue politics tends to be the preserve of eccentrics and obsessives, carrying about the same parliamentary influence as David Icke or the Monster Raving Loony party. The glaring exceptions are Farage’s Ukip and the Brexit party, which between them helped deliver the harshest of Brexits. An almost anachronistically English figure with his beer and blazers, his Carry On laughter and golf-club rhetoric, Farage is an easy man to underestimate. But, as his biographer Michael Crick says, he is “one of the great communicators of our age”. A virtuoso on the dog whistle, he is also a master of the tai chi strategy of using his opponent’s strength to his own advantage. He rose by encouraging dissident Tories to drag the party down to his level. Ukip was a crank outfit before he took over in 2006 and reverted to one again the moment he left, following the EU referendum, in 2016. But in between it was a crank outfit that got the Tories to dance to Farage’s Little Englander tune, eventually securing the referendum that his side won. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, confidence in globalism and political elites plummeted. Plenty of politicians on the left sought to capitalise on the discontent, but it was Farage and wealthy backers like Arron Banks who saw the opportunity for rightwing anti-elites populism. Untainted by political office – the only election Farage has ever managed to win, ironically, is to the European parliament – he was free to play the professional rabble-rouser or, as it’s also known, “man of the people”. He excelled in the role because he is a gifted blamer of others: Europeans, bureaucrats, the establishment, immigrants, Tories, Labour, anyone and everyone. As a serial loser in British politics (he stood in seven constituency elections and lost them all), what he’s never had to worry about is outcomes. His power has always been at one remove, where responsibility rests with some fool who will sooner or later be subject to Farage’s I’m-just-telling-it-like-it-is brand of scorn. He even expressed disappointment with Brexit, as if its grey reality was not of his making. In this respect, if no other, Farage is resolutely modern: a born disrupter, a habitual fomenter of grievance with zero obligation to produce results. He is the loudmouth curmudgeon, the carefree voice of old fogeyism, the bar-room bore who thrives on the national stage. But after the grim spectacle of Brexit, and his proclaimed retirement from politics, where could he go? Not to the House of Lords, because Boris Johnson, in jealous protection of his own saviour myth, had no desire to honour his progenitor. So the obvious answer was GB News, where rightwingers move to moan about the state of the nation after so many years of rightwing government. Condemned to live among the undead with Dan Wootton and Eamonn Holmes, he was rescued last month by Coutts. You don’t have to be a semiotician to see that the bank, with a background in offshore tax avoidance, was guilty of virtue-signalling when it closed his account because of his political beliefs. That error was compounded by Rose briefing a BBC journalist with false information about Farage. As a consequence, the BBC was forced to apologise, Rose lost her job and Farage found new purpose in his. He’s calling for the rest of the NatWest (of which Coutts is a subsidiary) board to resign and wants to guarantee the right to have a bank account. Some commentators wonder if this is the opening skirmish in a battle to rein in the ESG (environmental, social and governance) movement aimed at building sustainability and progressive values in corporations. For the moment, Farage is maintaining his focus on matters of individual rights, although he’s already calling it a “war on woke banks” – this weekend it emerged that Britain’s newest “consumer champion” was launching a tool to help consumers who believe they have been “debanked”. What’s not in doubt is that he is back in the headlines, and once more able to present himself as the little guy taking on the establishment – Coutts, renowned for its royal clients, is nothing if not a conspicuous emblem of elitism and entitlement. It doesn’t matter that there is little the ex-public schoolboy, one-time commodities trader and former Coutts client has in common with the average person in the street. Nor is it much of hindrance to him that his populist opinions are not that popular with the British public. The point is he makes himself a kind of lightning rod for public disaffection. There remains a huge reservoir of anger towards the banks, and he will know how to draw on it, although the libertarian friend of hedge-fund owners is unlikely to push for meaningful regulation in that regard. In the end, he is not really a politician but a consummate complainer, because his animating passion is to be against things. It led to the event by which history will remember him, Britain’s inglorious exit from the EU. But it’s essentially a destructive talent. What replaces the targets he so vociferously attacks will always be somebody else’s concern. • Andrew Anthony is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2023-08-01T10:00:33Z,‘Even more insidious than the NRA’: US gun lobby group gains in power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/01/gun-lobby-nra-national-shooting-sports-foundation,"A business trade group representing 10,000 gunmakers, dealers and other firearm firms is emerging as a rising force in the US and starting to eclipse – in some respects – the might of the powerful but scandal-plagued National Rifle Association. Meet the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry’s conservative and aggressive lobbying group. Its range of activities is broad but always geared to zealously and single-mindedly preserving and extending the power of the gun industry. It has been lobbying Congress to pass bills that would block financial institutions from using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in making investment and loan decisions to protect gun companies’ bottom lines. Meanwhile, gun manufacturers are relying on this same group to mount legal challenges to several state laws that limit the gun industry’s highly prized and unique protection from contentious liability laws enacted by Congress in 2005. During Donald Trump’s presidency, the NSSF used its lobbying muscle to help prod his administration to move regulation of gun exports from the state department to the commerce department, a shift that seems to have yielded financial dividends for gun exporters due to the department’s pro-business approach. In the past few years, as the 5-million-member NRA has been battered by financial woes, internal rifts and legal threats from the New York attorney general and private interests, the NSSF has expanded its legal and lobbying spending to fight gun-control efforts nationwide, while boosting gun rights and industry sales. “The NSSF functions as the gun industry’s voice, with a singular focus on expanding the market for all types of firearms, including assault weapons and short-barreled rifles, and is eclipsing the NRA’s lobbying power on Capitol Hill,” said Kristen Rand, a lawyer with the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy and research group. The rising clout of the NSSF is underscored in part by the group’s increased spending on lobbying, which has outpaced the NRA’s lobbying spending in recent years. For instance, in 2020 and 2021, the NSSF reported spending $4.6m and $5m respectively on federal lobbying. By contrast, the NRA spent $2.2m and $4.9m. Further, the NSSF’s legal muscle has expanded in the last year since the NSSF tapped the former solicitor general Paul Clement as an outside lawyer to fight laws in seven states that limit the protections from lawsuits that were granted by Congress. Clement has also mounted legal challenges for the NSSF against new gun-control measures in New York, New Jersey and other states that have been enacted in the wake of a supreme court decision last year against a New York law limiting concealed-carry permits to those people who can show a “proper purpose” for having such weapons outside their homes. The NSSF’s board of governors reflects the group’s financial interests and clout: the board includes top executives from major arms companies such as Daniel Defense and Smith &amp; Wesson, which made the AR-15 military-style assault rifles used in the Uvalde and Highland Park mass shootings. Little wonder the NSSF, founded in 1961 and once best known for hosting an annual and lavish “Shot” (Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade show) in Las Vegas, has become a more active and visible player waging legal and lobbying battles to boost arms company interests, say experts and gun control advocates. “The NSSF burrows in on every nook and cranny of gun regulation as it works to ensure that the gun industry’s financial interests are consistently and zealously represented – on even the most arcane issues. For NSSF, gun violence prevention legislation is literally bad for business,” said Rand. The NSSF’s growing influence is reflected in part by the group’s revenues, which soared to over $51m in fiscal year 2022, versus $36m in fiscal year 2016. The revenue hikes at NSSF have come as the group’s membership has grown in the past few years to 10,000 from 8,000, said NSSF’s general counsel and top lobbyist, Larry Keane. Keane said the NSSF has four full-time lobbyists and is recruiting a fifth for its Washington office, which opened in 2012. Overall, the American gun industry has mushroomed in recent years. Gun sales surged during the pandemic, as almost 60m guns were bought by Americans between 2020 and 2022, according to the Trace, a non-partisan news outfit that reports on gun violence. In 2008, about 8m guns were sold, but in 2016 gun sales had almost doubled to 16m. Gun experts say the NSSF has become a more prominent player in battles to benefit the gun industry’s bottom line. “The NSSF has stepped up its political activities in at least three ways: much more political lobbying and related activities in DC and elsewhere; filing lawsuits against gun laws around the country in the courts, especially after the supreme court’s 2022 Bruen decision; and promoting gun manufacturing and sales data, which is increasingly being cited in court cases by gun-rights litigants,” said Robert Spitzer, the author of several books on gun issues and an emeritus professor at Suny Cortland in New York. Spitzer added: “Unfortunately, their data is problematic, because they don’t fully reveal their methodology, and they have a vested interest in inflating their numbers to support the argument that the more guns and gun accessories in circulation, the more futile gun laws are.” NRA veterans also say the NSSF has become a more robust tool for gun interests. “Given the dumpster fires at the NRA, industry has increased its engagement at NSSF,” a former NRA board member told the Guardian. The NSSF’s key battles now range widely, from the halls of Congress to many states nationwide where legislative and legal fights have intensified. Keane said the NSSF had been working with a multi-industry coalition which includes fossil-fuel firms, dubbed the Fair Access to Banking Coalition, to push for Republican-sponsored bills in the House and the Senate that would curb financial companies from using ESG guidelines in making investment and loan decisions. Keane said that the NSSF’s push for these bills stems from gun-industry complaints about “discrimination” by financial institutions that have adopted ESG guidelines, which have led to decisions by banks and other financial firms being made for “political and not business” reasons. But Nick Suplina, a senior vice-president for law and policy with Everytown for Gun Safety said the “NSSF is riding the coattails of the fossil fuel industry in passing these bills, and made common cause, because doing what is best for society might hurt their bottom line”. He added: “As more businesses and banks recognized that customers expected them to do their part in addressing widespread social harms, big coal and the gun industry have embraced a culture-war veneer to mask their profit motive: declare war on woke corporations. “As a result, the NSSF has pressed legislation that abandons free-market principles and restricts companies’ freedom to set reasonable risk standards for doing business with the gun industry, while fossil-fuel companies try to prohibit consideration of environmental impact.” With Democrats in control of the Senate, the bill’s passage is not likely, but given that Republicans control the House, it could pass there. On another battlefront, Keane said that NSSF members are troubled about several state laws that “gut” the controversial and unique liability protections Congress granted the gun industry in 2005, and “open up the industry to new litigation”. To date, seven states including California, New York and New Jersey have passed laws that permit some litigation against gun companies, thereby undercutting the sweeping liability protections that Congress gave the industry. The NSSF has tapped Clement, the former solicitor general, to fight these state laws in court, because, Keane said, they “open up industry” to lawsuits which Congress blocked in 2005. As the NSSF has become a more robust force in pushing gun-industry priorities, gun-control advocates see similarities and differences with the NRA. “Make no mistake: the NSSF is even more insidious than the NRA with its ever-expanding lobbying operation and abnormally cozy relationship with its regulator,” said Adzi Vokhiwa, the director of federal affairs at Giffords, the gun control advocacy group. “The NSSF hides behind its public identity as a simple trade association, while aggressively working to undermine any and all attempts to slow this nation’s devastating gun violence crisis.” Vokhiwa, for instance, noted that the NSSF ran a television ad blitz, its first ever, to scuttle the Biden administration’s first nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, David Chipman, by stressing his role as a Giffords adviser after 25 years of serving as an ATF agent. “From leading dangerous smear campaigns against ATF director nominees who publicly promise to better regulate the gun industry, and bullying members of Congress to vote against even the most reasonable pieces of legislation regulating guns, the NSSF continues to value gun-industry profits more than the American people’s right to live in safe communities,” Vokhiwa said. Other gun-control advocates say the NSSF, like the NRA, has often exploited fears of gun owners and pushed conspiracy theories about “big government” efforts to undermine the second amendment, in order to rally opposition to gun-control measures. “The firearms industry was peddling anti-government conspiracies long before Trump came along talking about the ‘deep state’,” said Suplina. “That includes claiming that even modest proposals for gun-violence prevention, like requiring background checks on every gun sale, are part of a sinister government plot to disarm all Americans. “The industry seems to hope that paranoia will drive more people to purchase their products and has in fact recognized that, after mass shootings, fear of new laws drive gun sales.”",US gun control; US news; World news; NRA,US news
2023-03-20T22:38:34Z, Biden vetoes Republican effort to overturn socially conscious retirement rule,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/20/joe-biden-first-veto-republicans-retirement-investment,"Joe Biden issued the first veto of his presidency on Monday, rejecting legislation to overturn a labor department rule related to an investment strategy for Americans’ retirement plans that Republicans have derided as “woke capitalism”. “The legislation passed by the Congress would put at risk the retirement savings of individuals across the country. They couldn’t take into consideration investments that would be impacted by climate, impacted by overpaying executives,” Biden said in an Oval Office video released by the White House. “And that’s why I decided to veto it.” Republicans have railed against so-called “ESG” investing, an acronym that stands for “environmental, social and governance”, arguing that it prioritizes allocating money based on liberal political causes, such as efforts to combat climate change and divest from fossil fuels, instead of earning the best returns for retirement accounts. “In his first veto, Biden just sided with woke Wall Street over workers. Tells you exactly where his priorities lie,” the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, wrote in response. “Now – despite a bipartisan vote to block his ESG agenda – it’s clear Biden wants Wall Street to use your retirement savings to fund his far-left political causes.” Their willingness to challenge corporate America, long seen as a reliable Republican ally, is just one front in the right’s “war on wokeness” that they claim has affected schools, companies and government. The veto underscores Biden’s new, more confrontational relationship with Republicans in Congress after two years of working with Democratic majorities. Now the White House is readying for even more consequential battles in the months ahead over government spending and the nation’s debt limit. House Republicans, in turn, are using their control of the chamber to advance legislation they intend to use against Democrats in next year’s election. The White House has argued that the legislation would have made it illegal for pension fund managers to consider “risk factors Maga House Republicans don’t like” such as the climate crisis when making investment decisions. “Your plan manager should be able to protect your hard-earned savings — whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene likes it or not,” Biden said in a tweet, referring to the far-right Georgia congresswoman who has made opposition to progressive ideas her political brand. House Republicans advanced the bill after taking control of the chamber this year. And earlier this month, two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, voted with Republicans, sending the measure to Biden’s desk. Tester is running for re-election next year in states Donald Trump won handily. In a statement, Manchin called it “absolutely infuriating” that Biden had chosen to “put his administration’s progressive agenda above the wellbeing of the American people”. The coal country Democrat said the rule threatened the nation’s economic security as Americans contend with high inflation and Russia’s war in Ukraine upends energy markets. The veto, which was expected, sends the legislation back to Congress. House Republicans have scheduled a vote on Thursday in an attempt to override the veto, though to succeed would require support from at least two-thirds of each chamber, which appears unlikely. Biden’s veto in effect preserves the status quo, allowing – but not requiring – retirement fund managers to consider environmental, social and corporate governance factors when making investment decisions. The rule reversed restrictions imposed by the Trump administration that made it harder for retirement fund managers to consider such factors. Though ESG is often framed as a socially conscious way of investing, proponents say weighing a company’s working conditions, pending lawsuits or its environmental record can help uncover more stable and crucially, they argue, more profitable savings opportunities. The popular investment strategy has become a target of conservatives, with several Republican-led state legislatures passing or proposing legislation that would limit or ban their state governments from considering social or environmental impacts when making investment choices. In a formal statement notifying Congress of his veto, Biden said that the labor department rule allowed “retirement plan fiduciaries to make fully informed investment decisions by considering all relevant factors that might impact a prospective investment”. By refusing to allow these considerations, Biden said, Republicans were “disregarding the principles of free markets and jeopardizing the life savings of working families and retirees”. Following his initial veto, Biden on Monday signed into law a Republican-led resolution overruling an effort by the District of Columbia to overhaul its criminal code. The president’s support for the measure had angered many Democrats, who expected him to veto it out of respect for the federal district’s right to self-governance. But for Biden, who is expected to formally announce his intention to seek re-election in the coming weeks, the move underscores the pressure he and his party are facing from Republicans who have sought to make rising violent crime rates a political liability. Biden also signed into law a measure requiring the administration to declassify intelligence related to the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which was passed by Congress without any opposition in either chamber. Since taking over the House this year, Republicans have revived the polarizing debate over how Covid-19 emerged, with a series of hearings into the matter. Recently, the Department of Energy and the FBI indicated support for the theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory in China, though they did not release any evidence supporting their assessment. Many leading scientists and researchers believe the virus was most likely transmitted from animals to humans. In a statement, Biden said he shared Congress’s goal of understanding the origins of a virus that has killed more than 1 million Americans. “We need to get to the bottom of Covid-19’s origins to help ensure we can better prevent future pandemics,” he said in a statement.",Joe Biden; US politics; US Congress; Republicans; Democrats; US news,US news
2023-09-10T14:16:30Z,Barclays seeks climate director after protests over fossil fuel finance,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/10/barclays-seeks-climate-director-after-protests-over-fossil-fuel-finance,"Barclays has kicked off a search for a director to champion its climate efforts, after a bruising year in which the UK bank was targeted by campaigners over its environmental record. The high street lender recently closed applications for a climate communications director based in London, which is believed to be one of the most senior roles dedicated to coordinating its public response to climate pressures. The director’s responsibilities will include creating a “compelling narrative for climate transition” linked to the bank’s wider strategy, assessing “reputation and media risk” around climate issues, and working with senior stakeholders “to influence the outcome of such issues in a positive way”, according to the job posting. It comes after a challenging year for Barclays in which it was targeted by climate campaigners at its AGM in May and faced pressure over its sponsorship of Wimbledon, as well as over its ties to the National Trust. The lender has also been hit by grassroots boycotts, including by a pensioner who refused to pay her council tax because of a link to the bank. Campaigners are concerned over Barclays’ support of carbon-heavy industries, having been the top European funder of fossil fuels between 2016 and 2022, according to the Rainforest Action Network’s banking on climate chaos report. However, Barclays stressed it was working towards plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and noted that its energy sector financing had dropped by 25% since 2021. Campaigners said the creation of such a high-level climate communications role was a sign that Barclays was growing “scared” of climate activists. Joanna Warrington, at Fossil Free London, said: “In recent years we’ve seen campaigning pressure expand beyond the oil giants like Shell and Equinor, on to banks and the massive funding they provide to companies building new oil and gas projects that would be impossible without it. Barclays is clearly scared. This new PR role is just another way for it to armour itself up.” The hiring follows similar moves by lenders, including the Canadian bank RBC, which recently announced it was hiring a head of climate transition who will have responsibilities including producing “lasting responses to climate activism”. RBC said climate was a “top priority” and that it was investing in a dedicated team to ensure the bank was “best positioned to support these efforts”. The US bank Citigroup recently posted an advert for a vice-president for environmental, social and governance stakeholder engagement. The new hire will be paid up to $180,070 (£144,436) a year, and focus on environmental issues and human rights. The bank has faced criticism over its impact on indigenous rights via pipeline funding. Citigroup did not respond to a request for comment. Richard Brooks, the climate finance director at the environmental group Stand.earth, said: “Major banks hiring senior staff as spin doctors to green their bad images on climate issues rather than actually tackling their fossil fuel financing is utterly sickening, given the deaths in Hawaii, fires in Canada’s Arctic and extreme heat all over North America.” He said banks needed to step up their climate efforts rather than “attempting to squash demands of shareholders, customers and the public alike”. A Barclays spokesperson said: “Barclays has made a significant number of sustainability hires in many teams, reflecting our commitment to work with customers and clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model and our own ambition to be net zero by 2050.” The bank said it had provided £99bn in green financing since 2018, and planned to offer firms $1tn in “sustainable and transition financing” between 2023 and 2030. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Barclays was planning to cut hundreds of trading and deal-making jobs, potentially starting as early as this week, after a market lull that had hit investment banks globally.",Barclays; Banking; Business; Environment; Climate crisis; UK news; Fossil fuels,Business
2025-01-08T12:00:32Z,Six big US banks quit net zero alliance before Trump inauguration,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/08/us-banks-quit-net-zero-alliance-before-trump-inauguration,"The six biggest banks in the US have all quit the global banking industry’s net zero target-setting group, with the imminent inauguration of Donald Trump as president expected to bring political backlash against climate action. JP Morgan is the latest to withdraw from the UN-sponsored net zero banking alliance (NZBA), following Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. All six have left since the start of December. Analysts have said the withdrawals are an attempt to head off “anti-woke” attacks from rightwing US politicians, which are expected to escalate when Trump is sworn in as the country’s 47th president in just under a fortnight. Trump’s vows to deregulate the energy sector, dismantle environmental rules and “drill, baby, drill”, were a big part of his campaign platform and are expected to form a key part of his blueprint for governing the US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer. Paddy McCully, a senior analyst at the campaign group Reclaim Finance, said: “The sudden exodus of these big US banks out of the NZBA is a lily-livered effort to avoid criticism from Trump and his climate denialist cronies. “A few years ago, when climate change was at the front of the political agenda, the banks were keen to boast of their commitments to act on climate. Now that the political pendulum has swung in the other direction, suddenly acting on climate does not seem so important for the Wall Street lenders.” Convened by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative but led by banks, the NZBA commits members to align their lending, investment and capital markets activities with net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier. Citigroup was one of NZBA’s founding members. A spokesperson for the bank said Citigroup’s decision to quit would allow it to “focus on addressing barriers to mobilising capital to emerging markets in support of the low-carbon transition”. “We remain committed to reaching net zero and continue to be transparent about our progress,” the bank said. Addressing its withdrawal, JP Morgan said it would “work independently to advance the interests of our firm” and its customers and shareholders, while remaining “focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security”. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said the bank was “very focused” on increasingly stringent standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators, and insisted the bank had “made significant progress … on the firm’s net zero goals”. Wells Fargo commented only to confirm its withdrawal from the alliance, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment. Toby Kwan, a senior manager at the Carbon Trust, said the banks’ withdrawals from NZBA could give them more flexibility over which sectors they decided to include in their targets and which pathway to align with, and less stringent timeframes to work to. Financial institutions’ membership of net zero alliances has come under attack from politicians on the country’s right. In 2022 a potential anti-trust legal action led by attorneys general in Republican states had led some US banks to threaten to leave the NZBA, with withdrawals avoided after the group made changes to guidelines that could be construed as requirements to take action on fossil fuels. Then in November, a group of states led by Texas sued BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, all large asset management firms, for adopting pro-climate policies to reduce reliance on coal that the claimants alleged had pushed up energy prices. Most recently, in December, the Republican-led judiciary committee of the House of Representatives, the US Congress’s lower house, accused “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists of colluding to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. From Tuesday, after the US banks’ exodus, the NZBA still counted 141 banks among its members, including all the largest European banks. McCully said the departure of the US banks would give those remaining the opportunity to go further. He said: “By strengthening their commitments, NZBA banks can demonstrate that they have not simply used US obstructionism as an excuse to maintain the NZBA’s weak position.” Kwan said the loss of the US banks was by no means a death knell for the NZBA. “While these major financial institutions leaving the alliance raises a question mark on the future of climate action in the financial sector, the remaining NZBA members represent a significant portion of the global banking sector, controlling approximately 40% of global banking assets, or $64tn [£51tn],” she said. “This substantial influence cannot be understated, and NZBA members can drive the transition to a net zero economy.” The NZBA did not comment.",Banking; Environment; Citigroup; JP Morgan; Bank of America; Morgan Stanley; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Business; US politics; Fossil fuel divestment; Donald Trump inauguration; US news; World news; Donald Trump; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate finance,Business
2021-11-05T08:17:33Z,US bank BNY Mellon cuts ties with Adani’s Carmichael coalmine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/05/us-bank-bny-mellon-cuts-ties-with-adanis-carmichael-coalmine,"One of the world’s biggest banks has pulled out of providing financial services to Adani and its controversial Carmichael coalmine, saying the venture is incompatible with its environmental, social and governance rules. The Bank of New York Mellon’s move comes after a campaign by local Indigenous people, who have been occupying the mine site and conducting cultural ceremonies. In a statement, BNY Mellon said that it had never provided funding to the mine or a railway line and port that form part of the project. The bank said that it had provided “third-party administrative services under a small number of legacy contracts with the Adani Group in Australia, which includes acting as security trustee”. Security trustees act as representatives of groups of banks that form syndicates to provide loans to companies. It is understood BNY Mellon provided security trustee services to Adani, now known as Bravus, in relation to the coal port. “After review, BNY Mellon has decided to resign from all legacy transactions with Adani in Australia and will not pursue additional transactions with Adani in Australia,” the bank said. “BNY Mellon has determined this business is not aligned with our ESG [environmental, social and governance] principles. “Upon resigning, we are required to honour our contractual obligations during the unwind[ing] of these transactions until our roles are terminated.” It said client confidentiality rules prevented it commenting on specific customers but added: “For the avoidance of doubt, BNY Mellon is not currently entering into, and does not intend to enter into, any new contracts with Adani in Australia.” The bank’s ESG commitments include “the efficient use of natural resources, mitigating climate-related risks, and leveraging innovative energy solutions”, “effectively managing” relationships with stakeholders including “the communities in which we operate” and “operating with strong ethical business practices”. Pablo Brait, a campaigner with activist group Market Forces, said BNY Mellon was the 104th company to rule out working on the Carmichael project. “No company which claims to care about the climate can justify any involvement with a massive new thermal coalmine, its associated rail line and port, and the company building it,” he said. “The world’s banks, investors and insurers must cut ties with the Adani Group until Adani Group abandons the Carmichael project.” A Bravus spokesperson said its financing arrangements were confidential and added: “Completion of the Carmichael mine and rail project is on track to allow us to export coal to market this calendar year.” • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A group of Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners began occupying Adani’s mining lease to conduct a cultural ceremony in late August. Adani has accused the group of being “anti-fossil fuel activists” who are “trespassing under the guise of traditional activity”. However, as Guardian Australia has reported, police called by Adani refused to remove the group in early October, saying they were instead working on negotiating with the two sides towards “a peaceful and non-disruptive resolution into the future”.",Adani Group; Business; Queensland; Fossil fuels; Australia news; Banking ,Business
2023-03-16T13:36:37Z,Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it,"Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear power, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain’s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. But is it? Does Britain need nuclear power? Hunt follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain’s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France’s EDF – which operates the stations – said it had extended the life of two other plants. Proponents argue that nuclear provides a “baseload” of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also high hopes for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised. Why is nuclear being reclassified? To attract private investment. The consultation is on the “taxonomy” or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn climate subsidy package. Is Britain the first country to do this? No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a “green” investment. The EU’s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed “to boost green investments and prevent ‘greenwashing’”. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace. Will it make a difference? Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears. The government has committed £700m to the Suffolk plant, which could cost more than £30bn to build. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with delays and cost overruns. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C’s funders. The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce’s’ aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain. Is nuclear energy renewable? Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, which are expected to be around for many years. Is it really green? Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid says that the “lifecycle emissions” – emissions resulting from every stage of the production process – are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation. Hunt said on Wednesday that “increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations”. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build – Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push – it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain’s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments remains in place. Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as Sellafield, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete deep underground. It has also been argued that – as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast – rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed. That is not the only concern, is it? No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including Three Mile Island in 1979, Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, in Ukraine, has again raised concerns over a nuclear incident. .",Nuclear power; Energy; Jeremy Hunt; UK news; Environment; Politics; Energy industry; Business; Sustainable development,Environment
2024-09-29T23:01:45Z,UK business confidence dips to lowest level since general election,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/30/uk-business-confidence-dips-to-lowest-level-since-general-election,"UK business confidence has dropped to its lowest level since the general election, as firms grow more pessimistic about the economic outlook. Amid fears that the Labour government’s warnings of a tough budget in October have hurt the economy, the latest Lloyds Bank Business Barometer has found that business optimism weakened this month to its lowest level since June. Business optimism had hit eight-year highs in July and August, after solid economic growth in the first half of 2024. But Lloyds’ latest survey, carried out in the first half of September, found that confidence fell three points to 47%, a three-month low, but still above the long-term average of 29%. The decline was down to mounting concerns about the economy: while 57% of businesses felt confident, 19% were less positive. This caused a nine-point fall in the net balance of economic optimism, to 38%, the lowest since March. “Although overall confidence fell this month, that fall was from an eight-year high, and businesses remain positive about their own trading prospects,” said Hann-Ju Ho, a senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. “The more mixed picture for economic optimism points to some businesses maintaining a degree of caution. While we still expect economic expansion, it may occur at a slower rate than the first half of 2024,” Ho warned. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already said October’s budget will require “difficult decisions on tax, spending and welfare”, while also hinting last week that she could relax the government’s self-imposed fiscal rules to prioritise investment. Last week, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation reported a sharp drop in confidence among employers about hiring in August, while the British Retail Consortium found that consumer confidence fell significantly in September. A separate survey from KPMG released on Monday found that three-quarters of financial services leaders expected the budget to have at least a moderate impact on their business. More than a quarter of bosses surveyed across the banking, insurance, asset and wealth management, and private equity sectors expect a significant impact, according to KPMG’s latest UK Financial Services Sentiment Survey. Almost one-third of leaders expect the biggest impact to be sector-specific tax increases such as bank surcharges. More than a quarter expect an impact on payroll costs, while 19% say tax changes to non-doms will affect their business. “Leaders in the sector are gearing up for this budget to have a considerable impact on their business,” said Karim Haji, the global and UK head of financial services for KPMG. “While there are notable expectations about sectoral tax rises, leaders will hope for a period of stability thereafter to ensure the current tax regime for financial services remains competitive,” Haji said. British banks, which have enjoyed bumper profits in recent years thanks to higher interest rates, have been lobbying the government not to increases taxes on the sector. It emerged last week that Reeves is rethinking parts of Labour’s crackdown on super-rich non-domiciles, amid concerns inside the Treasury that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) may conclude the plans will raise no money at all and could prompt wealthy foreigners to leave the UK. KPMG found that bosses view inflation pressures as the biggest business challenge over the rest of the year, followed by interest rates. However, they remain upbeat about the prospects for business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2024. Haji said: “While leaders are also optimistic about the economic outlook, the knock-on effects of a turbulent economy continue to weigh on their businesses. “Leaders are dealing with a myriad of challenges and it’s easy to see how the more immediate, closer-to-home issues could detract from challenges that pose a greater threat to business longer term, such as ESG and technology advancements.”",Economics; Economic policy; Economic recovery; Economic growth (GDP); Politics; UK news; Financial sector; Lloyds Banking Group; Banking; Business,Business
2024-09-18T15:00:50Z,Climate Change Authority determined incoming chair Matt Kean had no conflict of interest despite advisory role,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/19/climate-change-authority-determined-incoming-chair-matt-kean-had-no-conflict-of-interest-despite-advisory-role,"The Climate Change Authority determined that its incoming chairman, Matt Kean, did not have a conflict of interest despite taking a role at a climate advisory service – but he would need to make ongoing disclosures on relevant investments by the firm. Brad Archer, the authority’s chief executive, said Kean – a former New South Wales treasurer and energy minister – had declared his position as a director of “regulatory affairs and strategic partnerships” at Wollemi Capital as “a material personal interest”, according to documents seen by Guardian Australia. “No conflict of interest currently exists between Mr Kean’s outside interests and matters under consideration by the authority,” Archer said in an accompanying letter sent to the office of opposition climate spokesman Ted O’Brien, in response to a freedom of information request. Kean was asked to “obtain further information on [Wollemi’s] investments and provide it to the [authority’s] secretariat”. He should also disclose any individual investments “that may raise material conflict issues with authority work in accordance with standard meeting procedures”, the document showed. The Albanese government’s appointment of Kean in June sparked anger by some in the federal Coalition who saw the former deputy NSW Liberal leader as a turncoat. Others welcomed the choice of the architect of the state’s renewable energy roadmap who had also advocated stronger climate change action for years. O’Brien had said the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, had “serious questions to answer” after picking Kean. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “Bowen needs to assure the Australian public that he did the appropriate checking of conflicts of interests before making this appointment,” O’Brien said, according to a Australian Financial Review report in August. Archer’s comments were provided to O’Brien’s office after it sought an explanation of how the authority would handle Kean’s role at Wollemi. That position commenced on 15 August, shortly after Kean took on the part-time role at the authority. Wollemi Capital was “a global climate specialist investment firm” and Kean’s role was advisory and relationship management for which he would receive a salary and an equity stake in the company, the document said. “He will not have a decision-making role in relation to investments,” it said. “Mr Kean’s role will be to manage key stakeholder relationships, assist in identifying potential investors, and provide strategic advice within the firm, including in relation to potential investments.” The “intersection with authority business” might come where Wollemi’s interests were “impacted by advice, particularly as it relates to specific projects and technologies in which the firm invests”, it said. A spokesperson for O’Brien said “governance matters and the Australian public deserve transparency on political appointments and actions,” and that the government was “running a closed shop”. “It has a track record of using non-disclosure agreements to hide from scrutiny, this is the same government who called for ‘greater transparency’ when in opposition,” the spokesperson said. One of the documents noted some of the interests of other authority members that had been handled by the “standard procedures”. These include those of Susie Smith, who was appointed by the Morrison government. Smith’s interests include her role as principal of ESG &amp; Carbon Services, a consultancy. Patty Akopiantz, who was appointed at the same time as Kean, was co-founder of Assembly Climate Capital, a firm that says it is “creating answers to the generation-defining challenge of climate change”. A spokesman for Bowen said the Climate Change Authority legislation envisages that its members would be across the relevant industries and sectors, and “vitally ensures that these conflicts be transparently disclosed and appropriately managed”. “This is reflected in the outgoing chair’s [Grant King’s] own external appointments being managed.” He accused O’Brien of making a political point rather than an “earnest one of transparency”.",Matt Kean; Australia news; Climate crisis; New South Wales politics; Coalition,Australia news

Today, on the eve of a parliamentary debate on the independent review of net zero, we reaffirm the widespread support for this goal. Over the past year, support for green policies in parliament has strengthened, not weakened, as the link between net zero and energy security has become ever clearer. Net zero means energy security. Net zero means clean energy. And net zero means lower bills. At the same time as reducing our reliance on volatile oil and gas, we can cut the cost of living and meet our climate targets. The environment remains a top concern of the British public, and we will continue to promote ambitious environmental leadership in parliament, so that our constituents are better off tomorrow than today.

2023-04-10T14:57:29Z,Climate emergency is the biggest health crisis of our time. Bigger than Covid |  Pascal Soriot,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/10/climate-emergency-is-the-biggest-health-crisis-of-our-time-bigger-than-covid,"The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report is a grim, yet unsurprising, reminder of the catastrophic effect global heating is having on our planet. The message from leading climate scientists is clear: action is needed now. Not tomorrow, not next year, not by the end of the decade. Even drastic carbon reduction today that limits temperature increases to the 1.5C agreed in Paris will alter the world we live in for ever. The IPCC concludes that every fraction of a degree more will edge us towards tipping points that will leave deep scars on our planet. While much has been said about the damage to weather patterns, crop yields and coral reefs, less well understood is the effect a hotter world has on our health. The reality is that the climate crisis is the biggest health crisis of our time, bigger even than Covid-19. Heat-related deaths are expected to treble by 2050. Currently 7 million people die prematurely each year from air pollution, more than the death toll during the entire pandemic. There has been a rise in chronic diseases linked to air pollution, and evidence suggests it is driving up cancer rates, too. Lung cancer and respiratory-related deaths linked to air pollution are up 160% over the past 30 years and it causes genetic mutations in some lung cancer-linked genes. The toll on loved ones, public health and the economy is large and rising. It has been estimated that poor health costs the global economy 15% of global GDP. It is not only oil companies, carmakers and airlines at fault. Healthcare alone contributes 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, up to 8% in advanced economies. Investing in greenhouse gas reduction is now proven beyond doubt, equalled or outweighed by the economic benefits of a healthier population, the IPCC says. Increasingly investors are focused on those companies that are taking bold and science-driven action to mitigate climate warming. While this is the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense. Decarbonising the economy is an opportunity and a driver of growth, which is why the backlash against environmental, social and governance focused investing is so misguided. As we saw during the pandemic, science finds a way, ingenuity triumphs and is duly rewarded. At my company, AstraZeneca, we are on track to meet our targets to: reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions – those from burning fuels and energy use – by 98% by 2026; halve our absolute total emissions across our value chain by 2030; and be net zero by 2045. In addition, we have planted millions of trees as part of a large reforestation and biodiversity restoration programme. Like it or not, regulatory requirements are moving towards stopping companies selling products that are not sustainable. In Japan we have converted paper leaflets to e-leaflets for all our products, reducing costs, simplifying operations and saving 180 tonnes of waste and 30m sheets of paper – the equivalent of 4,500 trees. But companies cannot act alone. Together we must make public health more resilient, so that it can cope with change and become truly accessible. A forum such as the Sustainable Markets Initiative established by King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, convening stakeholders from across industries, is a good example of collaboration to take shared action at scale. The toll on human health is huge and likely to get worse. Healthcare companies will do all they can to treat patients suffering from climate-related disease. Prevention, however, will have the biggest impact on health. Only by taking radical action on greenhouse gas emissions will we be able to say that we are doing everything we can for the health of humanity. • Pascal Soriot is the chief executive of the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca • This article was amended on 25 April 2023.

2022-10-04T06:00:27Z,Green your pension: how you can help the environment,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/04/green-pension-help-environment-climate-crisis,"UK pension funds are worth approximately £3tn with this huge wealth invested in assets all over the world. If you are eager to reduce your carbon footprint, making your pension “green” is 21 times more effective than giving up flying, becoming a vegetarian and changing an energy provider combined, according to the campaign group Make My Money Matter. So how can you make your pension better for the planet? What is ‘more green’ to you? Romi Savova, the chief executive of the pensions consolidator firm PensionBee, says the question you need to ask yourself is: “What does being more green mean to you?” She says: “Because the way it is expressed in the pensions industry can be very, very different, depending on the pension plan and provider.” When looking at whether your pension aligns with your values, one thing to consider is what your approach will be. “Are you looking for investments that exclude companies which contribute to environmental challenges, or do you want to be invested in a way that engages with these companies to push them to do better?” says Helen Morrissey, the senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Engagement,” Savova says, “means you continue to invest in companies that may be major fossil fuel producers, for example. “But your asset manager, or pension provider, takes an active role in engaging with those companies, to encourage them to reform, over time, and put themselves on a more sustainable trajectory for the future.” Stakeholder engagement, with the threat of divestment, is powerful, says David Macdonald, the founder of the independent financial advisers Path Financial. “If you’re an active shareholder, you’re challenging them constantly to improve standards, to make faster changes, to have more credible pledges – with the threat of divestment if they don’t,” he says. “So moving the money into a fund which takes its stakeholder responsibility seriously, and drives for the change that it’s talking about, is far more impactful than just investing in those companies passively in, say, a tracker, where nobody gives a damn about what the companies are actually doing. “If people want their invested money to have a voice, then it’s got to be somewhere where the voice can be heard. And that comes through a more active approach to being a stakeholder,” Macdonald adds. Beyond these choices, you move into actually trying to direct your money to do something genuinely positive, Savova says. “You would be making sure that money goes into renewable energy, healthcare, social bonds, as opposed to, say, government bonds.” Check a workplace pension “Your provider should be able to help you find out where it invests, and, if you already have an online account, you should be able to get details of what your pension is invested in,” Morrissey says. However, she adds: “It can be difficult to drill down and get all the data you need – you may only get the top 10 holdings, for instance, or you may find your funds are invested in other funds so you can’t immediately get the detail needed.” If you are not happy with what you find, Morrissey suggests asking your provider if they have any other funds you can switch to, that are more suitable. “Don’t just accept the default that you’re given; poke around a little bit and see what the options are,” Macdonald says. “The provider might have an ethical fund, or an environmental, social and governance (ESG) choice, which is better than the default.” It is worth noting, too, that ESG is a broad term, open to interpretation and, by unfortunate extension, greenwashing. “As responsible investing has become more high profile, it has led some managers to overstate the progress they are making in incorporating ESG factors into their strategies,” Morrissey says. “Before deciding to invest, it’s worth checking to see if they have signed up to any industry initiatives such as the UN-backed ‘principles for responsible investment’. “Managers have to commit to invest responsibly, as well as incorporate ESG issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes,” she says. “Many will also issue responsible investment reports, which you can find on their websites.” Put pressure on providers Crucially, if you are in a workplace pension, the provider will have been chosen by your employer. Simply stopping paying into that pension, and opening a new one, would mean you would lose your employer contribution. You could, instead, put pressure on pension providers from “within” to encourage them to change their investing ways. If your workplace provider doesn’t offer a fund that matches your environmental values – or even anything approaching them – Make My Money Matter has a tool on its website that allows you to select your provider and send a pre-written letter asking it to offer green pension funds. “Within the sector, we have had feedback from pension funds saying that people emailing them has actually made a difference,” says Kenneth Green, the campaigns manager at Make My Money Matter. “We have managed to help get £1.3tn in UK pension funds committed to net zero.” Transfer old pensions “A lot of people will have old pensions they’ve left behind when they’ve moved on from various jobs,” Savova says. “In the vast majority, those pensions will be invested in so-called default funds, which are chosen by the employer. And the vast majority of those will have exposure to fossil fuels, including producers like Shell and BP. “It can be a bit of a surprise to savers, who have often gone the extra mile in making their daily habits greener, to find their pension is invested directly in fossil fuels.” If you are no longer happy with the way those funds are invested, you can make changes. “Once you’ve figured out where your current pensions are invested, you can decide what to do with them,” Savova says. “Often that will mean consolidating them into a new online plan.” It is possible to do this yourself but there are a number of consolidation firms that transfer pensions into one place; some, such as PensionBee, have fossil fuel-free plans. Compare any changes carefully, and be sure there will not be negative consequences, Morrissey says: “Before deciding to transfer, it is worth checking that you won’t miss out on any potential benefits, such as guaranteed annuity rates, or incur any exit penalties.” Before making any decisions about pensions, it is wise to take professional advice. You can find a list of independent financial advisers specialising in ethical investment on the Ethical Investment Association website. Compare and contrast “Your pension is built for your retirement. It’s built for your future. You don’t want to put it in something that could be inherently risky,” Savova says. There is, of course, always a risk in investing. But how do green funds compare with those that don’t use sustainability criteria? According to Morningstar, across six different categories of fund and over a five-year period, sustainable funds consistently outperformed their standard counterparts by between 0.54 and 1.91%.",Money; Consumer affairs; Pensions; Ethical money; Environment; Green economy; Green politics; Investments; Investment funds; Ethical and green living; UK news,Money
2024-03-15T11:07:22Z,Yard Act review – a band having fun in the midst of an identity crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/15/yard-act-review-rock-city-nottingham,"‘Who prefers our earlier work?” Yard Act frontman James Smith asks the audience, and it’s a question you get the sense he has been asking himself of late too. A crowd member is brought up on stage to spin a wheel, offering a one-time-only chance to hear a randomly selected song from the band’s 2021 debut EP Dark Days. It lands on the title track and the band dutifully bash out the kind of jagged post-punk that led to their rapid ascent during lockdown. Three years on, with the band seemingly feeling restricted by their own earlier sonic template – one which they created, by their own admission, in a deliberate attempt to board the last train out of post-punksville at the end of the decade – they return with a more electronic rock-leaning sound. There are lashings of synth, blasts of sax, a new pair of backing vocalists, and basslines straight out of the ESG playbook. On new tracks such as When the Laughter Stops, they glide into LCD Soundsystem territory, stretching out pulsing beats and hypnotic rhythms into locked grooves, while Dream Job veers closer to Ian Dury with its almost pub-rock disco stomp. They then bring out Napalm Death’s Shane Embury for a cover of Motörhead’s Ace of Spades, which is riotously good fun despite the randomness of the collaboration. You can detect the band’s enthusiasm draining when playing some earlier material: Payday sounds a little tired and worn, unfolding routinely rather than with any real punch or vigour. However 100% Endurance, also from the band’s debut album, remains an arresting closer as it sputters out in a blast of discordant harmony. Right now Yard Act sound like a band wrestling with who they are. Propelled by a zeitgeist that unexpectedly blew up, they’re now asking: what do we actually want to be? A clear-cut and solid identity may still be being forged, but in the meantime they sound like they’re having fun as they move further away from their dark days and forward into the light. • Touring the UK until 27 March",Yard Act; Music; Culture; Pop and rock; Indie,Music
2022-07-26T15:25:48Z,What’s really behind the failure of green capitalism? | Adrienne Buller,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/failure-green-capitalism,"Last week, temperatures crested at 40C (104F) in England, bringing the climate crisis to the fore and spurring a fresh wave of dismay. How is it, despite a steady drumbeat of extreme weather events, a rising tide of public outcry, and growing consensus across the political spectrum, that the world remains so profoundly far from the outer limits of the climate targets considered “safe”? The answer is increasingly located not in climate denial, but in a proliferation of non-solutions advocated by policymakers and business interests with varying degrees of earnestness and good intention, under the umbrella of “green capitalism”. These are proposals sold as urgent, pragmatic tools for cutting emissions or reversing ecosystem loss, but which in fact deliver neither. Take sustainable finance. By some estimates, assets invested with some sort of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria now top $35tn, prompting enthusiastic proclamations that private investors, driven by rational self-interest, are delivering a greener future. For many, it seems one really can “do well by doing good”. Unfortunately, this sense of triumph is based on little foundation. To begin with, criticisms of “greenwashing”, in which corporations and financial firms mislead customers and clients on the ecological or social credentials of their products, abound. But the problem cuts much more deeply than a few bad actors who bend the (typically voluntary) rules. Instead, the underlying motivation of ESG investing is not necessarily to achieve the “real world” positive outcomes. Rather the goal is to minimise exposure to risks – whether climate regulation or labour disputes – that could eat into financial returns. For this reason, many ESG funds hardly differ from “mainstream” funds and indices like the S&amp;P 500 (the basket of the 500 largest US corporations). Vanguard’s flagship US ESG fund, for example, has its top holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Tesla edges in at number six, followed by two different share classes of Alphabet (Google’s parent company). It would be hard to argue that many of these would be the companies springing to mind when imagining investment in a decarbonised and ecologically thriving future. Nor do some of them have particularly sterling records when it comes to the “social” pillar of the ESG acronym, whether accusations of human rights abuses and forced labour in supply chains or allegedly illegal surveillance of workers. Moreover, while many might reasonably expect a major ESG fund to be investing in the urgent transition to renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure, instead, more than 40% of the Vanguard fund is allocated to tech and financials. Energy and utilities, occupied by many of the firms we might imagine are at the heart of decarbonisation, together make up less than 1%. Importantly, this appears to be the rule, not the exception. While some specialist firms use their shareholding position to earnestly pressure companies to change their business models or allocate capital to upstart clean energy firms, much of the industry is interested not in directly financing a sustainable future but in ensuring their portfolios are aligned with one. In this sense, ESG can be much better understood as a means of betting on the likelihood of a greener, more sustainable future, rather than helping to build it. Indeed, in one particularly striking study, researchers found the strongest trait differentiating social-themed funds from their mainstream counterparts was investment in companies with relative lack of employees. From the perspective of minimising risks to private investors, this is perfectly logical: no labourers, no labour issues. From the perspective of driving positive social outcomes, it’s hardly cause for celebration. The logic underlying sustainable finance is a problem for the argument that markets are advancing a greener, kinder capitalism. Indeed, the trouble for green capitalism is that its proposed solutions strain to force the complexity of the climate and ecological crises into the narrow frame of “the market”, irrespective of whether the market is a viable arena for confronting them. As a result, these “solutions” are increasingly proving to be anything but. The imprint of green capitalism can be seen in everything from a fixation on carbon markets to the proliferation of ideas like “ecosystem services” and “natural capital”, which seek to divide ecosystems into discrete “stocks” that provide services to the economy. By this logic, a whale is valuable insofar as it captures carbon and impresses tourists. To many, the idea might seem absurd, but with $40bn in ecosystem service trading in 2018 alone, these concepts are increasingly mainstream. Claims of the scale of finance committed to net zero are not curtailing the trillions funnelled every year to the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, despite some 23% of emissions falling under carbon pricing schemes, the impact of such schemes on overall emissions falls woefully short of IPCC targets. And despite glossy images of oil majors’ “nature-based solutions” and tens of billions in annual trading in ecosystem services, biodiversity continues to decline at staggering rates. We live in a society structured and defined by market relations, and the idea that market-based solutions are the best, most pragmatic, and often only path to resolving most problems is powerfully ingrained common sense. It is, admittedly, difficult to imagine an alternative. It is also urgent and necessary. The siren song of easy win-win solutions to unprecedentedly complex and systemic crises is powerful, but must be resisted. • Adrienne is the author The Value of a Whale: on the illusions of green capitalism, and incoming Director of Research at Common Wealth",Global economy; Business; Economics; Green economy; Environment; Green politics; Apple; Microsoft; Amazon,Opinion
2022-08-22T17:30:41Z,Anti-aircraft noise campaigners to target shareholders in bid for Brisbane airport curfew,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/anti-aircraft-noise-campaigners-to-target-shareholders-in-bid-for-brisbane-airport-curfew,"Anti-aircraft noise campaigners say they will target investors in Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) as they threaten to ramp up efforts to force a curfew and cap on flights over the city. Aircraft noise was the defining local issue at the federal election for many who live under flight paths that emerged when the Brisbane airport opened its second runway in mid-2020, playing a role in the election of Greens MPs in three inner-city seats. A sustained community campaign to address the noise led Air Services Australia to commission an independent review into the problem, whose report and recommendations were made public on Monday. The Trax report said its recommendations would see more flights descend over Moreton Bay to lessen the impact on residents, reduce the frequency and concentration of flights over communities and “optimise the performance of the wider Brisbane airspace system”. Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance’s acting chair, Marcus Foth, described the report as “vindication” that “something can be done” to reduce aircraft noise impacts despite original claims from government regulators and the Brisbane Airport Corporation to the contrary. “When communities have been complaining to Air Services [Australia], usually they get these kinds of boilerplate responses with technical language that suggests that nothing can be done,” Foth said. “And here the Trax report is actually saying the opposite – there is a list of recommendations that are feasible.” But he said the recommendations would not come soon rnough nor go far enough and that campaigners were now exploring legal options, public protests and shareholder activism to deliver solutions sooner and more comprehensively. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We’ll be targeting the owners of the Brisbane Airport Corporation,” he said, pointing out some Trax recommendations wouldn’t be operational until 2025. “If the aviation stakeholders think that another three years of noise pollution torture is palatable, they are sadly mistaken.” BAC shareholders included the publicly-owned Queensland Investment Corporation, which has a 25% stake in the airport. The Royal Schiphol Group, whose majority shareholder is the Dutch government, has a 19.6% stake in the Brisbane airport. Other major shareholders include First Sentier Investors (26.6%) and IFM Investors (20%) which manage pension, superannuation, university and foundation funds. Foth, who is also a professor of urban informatics at QUT, said activists would argue that investing in the Brisbane airport would breach the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment principles of these institutions. The Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather, who campaigned strongly on aircraft noise in his successful effort to win the federal seat of Griffith from Labor, played a key role in organising rallies last year, and said the goal was to hold “significantly larger”, more visible protests later this year or early next year. “Last time when we held rallies, most of the people that showed up told me it was the first protest action that they’d ever gone through in their life,” he said. “So it’s a big step to get a community ready to do that.” Chandler-Mather said the Trax report was “very limited in scope” but confirmed “what we already knew: something needs to change at Brisbane airport with regard to flight noise”. The chief executive of BAC, Gert-Jan de Graaff, said he welcomed the Trax report and looked forward “to working with all partners including airlines to reduce noise for residents”. “Brisbane airport wants to minimise the impact on our neighbouring communities,” he said.",Brisbane; Queensland; Australian politics; Australian Greens; Airline industry; Australia news; Business,Australia news
2023-08-04T15:19:07Z,"Childcare sector in England must not become ‘playground for private equity’, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/04/childcare-sector-england-not-playground-private-equity-experts-say,"England’s childcare sector risks becoming a “playground for private equity”, experts have said, as exclusive analysis from the Guardian reveals investment funds have more than doubled their stake in the sector in just four years. The findings come as the Treasury prepares to spend an extra £4bn a year of taxpayers’ money funding nursery places. The research prompted warnings that the increasing involvement of private equity in the sector could leave providers more vulnerable to closure and do nothing to address the shortage of places in deprived areas, where parents cannot afford to pay as much for childcare. The Guardian’s detailed analysis of Ofsted-registered nurseries reveals that in 2022 at least 1,048 were fully or partially controlled by investment companies, including private equity and venture capital firms – 7.5% of all nursery places, up from 4% in 2018. Investment funds ultimately own nearly 81,500 childcare places in England – almost double the 2018 total. The rapid growth means thousands of nurseries could be vulnerable to collapse, according to unions and experts, who say that the chaotic near-demise of Thames Water and the high-profile failures of private equity-backed firms in adult social care should act as canaries in the coalmine. A UCL report last year warned that nurseries were being snapped up by profit-focused companies that were “heavily indebted” with “risky financial operating models [that] could threaten the provision of nursery places”. The research found “market dynamics can lead to insufficient coverage in poorer, less profitable areas”. These potential risks were highlighted in the adult social care sector, with the high-profile collapse of Southern Cross in 2011 and of Four Seasons Health Care, which is operated by administrators after a previous owner, the private equity firm Terra Firma, racked up huge debts. Mike Short, the head of education at Unison, said many parents relied on privately owned nurseries for their childcare that needed to make money to survive. He said: “If these companies don’t make money, they go under. But once private equity firms become involved, the pursuit of profit is ruthless and on a whole new level. The structure of equity-funded nurseries is so complex, often with hundreds of subsidiary companies created, that it’s almost impossible to fathom where the cash is going.” The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the early-years sector needed sustainable and long-term investment – not “fly-by-night merchants looking to make a quick buck”. Joeli Brearley, chief executive of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, called on the government to intervene and put measures in place to “guard against serious profiteering”, adding that private equity should have “no place in the education and care of our children”. She said: “Placing early learning and care in the hands of private equity is to play Russian roulette with our children and the economy. Childcare mustn’t be another playground for private equity – the risks are too great.’’ Dr Antonia Simon, a leading expert in childcare sector financing at University College London (UCL), also said providers that are heavily reliant on private equity funding were more likely to have high debt, low cash reserves and be at significantly greater risk of collapse. She said: “If these nurseries collapse, as we have seen in the adult social care sector, children and families will miss out on vital and valuable early years care and many nursery staff could lose their jobs. The government must make urgent reforms to make the early years sector more transparent and accountable.” Private equity and venture capital firms have made at least 500 investments – including acquisitions, mergers and buyouts – in the UK early years and childcare sector in the last decade, with 112 of those taking place in 2022, separate Guardian analysis of the venture capital database PitchBook reveals. The data analysis does not suggest lesser quality in such facilities. Indeed some providers cited high quality ratings in their response to comments from the Guardian. Responding to the Guardian’s research, a spokesperson for the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association said: “The inferences being made here about the role of private equity don’t reflect the real world – the average private equity investment is well over five years compared with five months on the public markets. This long-term commitment from private equity investors is essential in helping companies grow in a responsible way.” The latest annual accounts of Eagle MidCo, the parent company of Busy Bees, shows that the company’s long-term debts were more than seven times higher than its pre-tax earnings, according to their latest accounts. The company disputed this ratio, saying that this figure included future commitments to pay rent. The biggest nursery chain in England, Busy Bees Nursery Group, is owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTTP). A spokesperson for Busy Bees said it had long been recognised as a leader in childcare, that 97% of its nurseries were assessed by Ofsted ratings as good or outstanding, and that “the scale and quality of our services, people and centres have further improved through considerable investment by OTPP” over the past decade. They said it invested proportionally more in its existing facilities and in opening greenfield facilities than comparable nursery chains, including investment of close to £100m in the past two years. The nurseries backed by investment companies include some of the biggest groups in England, such as Kids Planet, which was bought by the private equity firm Fremman Capital at the end of 2021. The provider, which was first backed by the private equity firm BGF, has gone on a buying spree of rival nurseries in recent years – quadrupling the number of its childcare places between 2018 and 2022, from almost 2,800 to more than 11,500. The Dutch private equity firm Waterland acquired the Partou group in May 2022 – the largest childcare provider in the Netherlands. Partou recently moved into the English market, acquiring the nursery groups All About Children and Just Childcare, among other providers. The London-based Oakley Capital bought and rebranded Bright Stars Nursery in 2021, one of the fastest-growing childcare groups. In response to the Guardian, a spokesperson for Partou said recent reports commissioned by the Dutch government showed little difference in quality between social and commercial childcare organisations in the Netherlands. They also said the current generation of private equity funds focused on quality to improve childcare organisations and professionalise the sector, and that the fears of prioritising financial returns over public interest were unfounded. They added that Partou and its holding companies were part of an environmental, social, and governance fund established by Waterland that had a focus on sustainability and responsible investing. Responding to the Guardian’s findings, Bridget Phillipson suggested that a Labour government could tighten rules around the ownership of childcare settings. The shadow education secretary said: “As part of the reformed, modern childcare system Labour will create with better support for families, we will introduce stronger regulation of providers’ financial sustainability to ensure sustainability of the sector.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We will continue to closely monitor the sufficiency of childcare places as we roll out our single biggest investment in childcare in England ever, set to save a working parent using 30 hours of childcare up to an average of £6,500 per year.” Kids Planet, Fremman Capital and Oakley Capital were approached for comment.

2023-01-30T17:00:52Z,‘I want to caress the lift!’: the eco office block miracle made entirely from wood,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/30/caress-lift-eco-office-block-miracle-wood-timber-black-white,"There is very little about most new “sustainable” office buildings that is true to the label. Through an alchemical process of validation and certification, great carbon-hungry shafts of concrete, steel and glass are magically deemed to be “zero carbon”, and adorned with the gold and platinum medals of trade associations that exist to promote their members’ interests. The inclusion of solar panels, heat pumps, low-flush toilets and numerous other bolt-on gizmos creates an impenetrable veil of green goodness that can hide a multitude of carbon sins. Just as covering concrete with plants does not make it green, filling a high-energy, high-rise glass office tower with low-energy gadgets does not make it carbon-neutral. Claims of “net zero” almost always mean that someone else is picking up the carbon tab. Swathes of rainforest are acquired on the other side of the planet, often with damaging knock-on effects for the environment and local populations. A recent investigation found that more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets approved by the world’s largest provider are largely worthless – and could actually be making global heating worse. In architecture, the focus has long been on reducing the amount of energy a building consumes once it is occupied – known as operational carbon – but the bigger factor comes much earlier in the process. Up to three-quarters of a building’s total emissions over its lifespan come not from leaving the lights on and cranking up the thermostat but from the energy consumed in the production of the materials used to build it – known as embodied carbon. That, much of the industry now finally agrees, is where efforts must be focused to avert climate catastrophe. In an unassuming alleyway in Shoreditch, east London, stands a new office block that boasts few of the shiny gimmicks of its bloated glass and steel neighbours a few streets away in the Square Mile. But building it used almost 40% less carbon than comparable structures – primarily because it’s made of wood. “I often come in and put my nose against the walls, just to smell it,” says Charlie Green, co-founder of flexible workspace provider The Office Group. He is sitting in the lobby of the Black &amp; White building, its first new-build project, where everything in sight appears to come from trees. End-grain oak setts cover the floor, like a great butcher’s block, supporting chairs of ash and walnut, stools of cork, walls of raw spruce, and columns of beech, while sun-shading louvres of tulipwood cover the glazed facade. “People come into work,” he says, “and just start touching everything.” He’s right. It is the first time I have wanted to caress a lift: the cabin is lined with sumptuous panels of cork, their richly marbled grain giving the look of travertine. The cork capsule rises inside a wooden lift shaft too, through seven floors of work space, each office exuding the smell of an alpine chalet. “We’re getting a really clear understanding of the biophilic benefits of natural environments, beyond the carbon savings,” says Andrew Waugh of Waugh Thistleton, the architects behind the project. “People sleep better in timber homes, study better in timber schools, heal faster in timber hospitals and have less stress in timber offices.” Waugh is one of the UK’s most vocal advocates for mass timber construction, having worked with wood for the last 20 years. His practice’s nine-storey Murray Grove housing scheme in Hackney, completed in 2009, was the first tall urban housing project in the world to be constructed entirely from prefabricated solid timber. Not that the client wanted to shout about it. “They said: ‘You can build it in timber, as long as you don’t tell anyone,’” Waugh recalls. Their concern was about public perception. To most people, wood is something you throw on the fire, not build towers from. “But have you ever noticed,” Waugh asks, “that when you have a campfire, the big log will still be there the next morning? The outside is charred, but it hasn’t burned through.” Such is the principle behind structural mass timber. With sheets of wood laminated together, like supersized plywood, it is designed with “sacrificial” outer layers that would char in the event of a fire, protecting the inner structural integrity. Waugh shows me a historic photograph of a fire-ravaged building, where the steel beams have melted and collapsed, drooping like spaghetti over a charred wooden beam that remains intact and structurally sound. Timber technology has come a long way since then, and even since the days of Murray Grove. Along with walls and floor slabs of cross-laminated timber (CLT), the Black &amp; White building’s structural frame of columns and beams is made from beech laminated veneer lumber (LVL), used on this scale in London for the first time. The material is created by peeling a tree (essentially putting the trunks on a giant spiralizer) rather than cutting them into planks, and gluing the thin layers together, thereby reducing waste and creating tougher, more slender components – “as strong as steel but 20% of the weight and a fraction of the carbon,” says Waugh. When I first visited the Shoreditch construction site in the summer of 2021 it was an astonishing scene, with gigantic LVL columns and beams being effortlessly bolted into place like a supersized balsa wood model (allowing for disassembly and reuse in future). But the most unusual thing was the sound – or lack of it. Where building sites are often cacophonous places of drilling and hammering, amid clouds of toxic dust, this was a serene, silent assembly line. The site manager was beaming: “We’ve had compliments from the neighbours about how quiet it is,” he told me. “The scaffolding was probably the noisiest part.” The project took around six months less to build and involved 80% fewer truck deliveries than an equivalent concrete building, reducing congestion and pollution on the city’s streets, while not a single skip went to landfill. “We drew every component on the computer and our files went straight through to be cut in the factory,” says Waugh, his eyes wide with evangelical glee. “Every piece of timber is engineered for its exact purpose, so there’s no waste. The modernists talked about ‘truth to materials’, but then they clad everything. Here, everything you see has a structural purpose – this is proper, hard-arsed modernism.” The beauty of building with wood is that it is truly renewable, and actively sequesters carbon from the atmosphere as it grows.The trees used for the project were grown in vast certified forests in Austria and Germany, where five trees were planted for every one cut down. The UK structural timber industry, however, is sadly lacking: most of our trees are simply burned to fuel power plants. “We’ve got our subsidies completely the wrong way around,” says Waugh. “If you cut down a tree and burn it, it is subsidised. If you put it in a building, it’s not.” A recent report found that the UK government subsidises logging for bioenergy by almost £2bn a year. Building regulations and insurers’ risk aversion aren’t helping either. For years, the UK was one of the world leaders in structural mass timber, even if we didn’t grow it. “In 2018, we represented 15% of the global CLT market,” says Waugh. “Now we represent less than 1%.” The reason? The backlash after the Grenfell Tower fire – even though there was no structural timber in sight. Regulations introduced in 2018 banned the use of combustible materials in external walls of buildings over 18 metres, while the mayor of London went even further, forbidding its use in the walls of any residential development wanting eligibility for affordable housing funds, regardless of height. “Our office had about 2,000 homes for housing associations and local authorities under way,” says Waugh, “which were all cancelled overnight.” Most are now being built in concrete instead. “We have a concrete industry that behaves like the tobacco industry did in the 1990s,” he says, “trying to prove that smoking is healthy. The idea of ‘green concrete’ is ridiculous.” Cement manufacturing accounts for at least 8% of global carbon emissions, and cement alternatives are a byproduct of equally polluting industries. While other countries forge ahead with residential timber buildings, in the UK it is the office market that looks likely to lead the way, being unhampered by the same rules as homes. In the commercial sector, the overwhelming incentive for low-carbon construction is not being driven by policy but by demand from tenants and funders. “The pressure is coming from occupiers and investors,” says Green. “Just being in our building ticks their ESG reporting box.” He is referring to the environmental, social and governance criteria, which have become a major priority for companies and investment funds around the world that are looking to measure value beyond financial performance alone. In 2017, the Office Group was acquired by Blackstone, the world’s biggest ever corporate landlord, which manages $951bn of assets on behalf of pension funds and institutions – and which UN advisers have accused of contributing to the global housing crisis, a claim the company vehemently denies. With environmental perception front of mind, Blackstone proudly featured the Black &amp; White building on the cover of a recent brochure, trumpeting its green credentials to its clients. “If you had asked us 10 years ago, what is going to drive sustainability, I would have assumed it would be politicians and legislation,” says Waugh. “But it’s not. It’s money. ESG is the new gamechanger for sustainability, and it’s ultimately being driven by small-time investors – the school teachers, postmen and nurses who are looking to green pension funds for their futures.” As ever in the development industry, form follows finance. Only this time, it’s keen to be seen to be green. • This article was amended on 31 January 2023.

2023-06-23T14:00:40Z,US dark-money fund spends millions to back Republican attorneys general,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/23/concord-fund-republican-attorneys-general,"An influential group of 28 Republican attorneys general has benefited mightily from at least $9.5m since 2020 from the dark-money Concord Fund, public records reveal. The Concord Fund, the top donor in 2022 and the two prior years to the Republican Attorneys General Association (Raga), boasts strong links to Federalist Society co-chairman Leonard Leo. Leo helped Donald Trump pick three conservative supreme court justices and now helps spearhead a dark money network that has secured $1.6bn from a single donor. Since its founding in 1999, Raga has raised and spent tens of millions of dollars to help elect GOP attorneys general – including many who have mounted corporate-friendly lawsuits – but has come under fire from watchdog groups and other critics of the growing role of dark money and special interest industry funding. Many Raga members have waged legal fights against climate change rules and other business regulations. Other leading donors to Raga in 2022 include an arm of the US Chamber of Commerce, energy giant Koch Industries, and tobacco behemoth Altria, according to the liberal research group the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). Raga members have been criticised as a “pay-to-play” operation for filing lawsuits in support of business interests that help fund the attorneys general group, including fossil-fuel companies opposing climate-change rules. Further, Raga sparked strong concerns during Trump’s fight to block Joe Biden from taking office when an affiliate, the Rule of Law Defense Fund, spent $150,000 on robocalls to boost attendance at Trump’s January 6 rally. Those robocalls urged “patriots” to attend the rally and said: “We will march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal.” Prior to the Trump rally, in late 2020, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed an emergency motion with the supreme court backed by 17 Raga attorneys general to overturn Joe Biden’s wins in four states, a legal stratagem that the high court quickly dismissed. Former Republican Idaho attorney general Jim Jones told the Guardian he was dismayed by Paxton’s legal challenge to the 2020 election, calling it “the highpoint of irresponsibility. They had no facts and no law.” Speaking about Raga members and their focus, Jones said: “They’ve become political operatives instead of the people in their states to safeguard the rule of law. They seem to be pandering to rightwing extremist groups to gain office in the first place and then to retain office.” Jones added that Raga “seems to be focused on culture war issues and protecting industries that cause detriment to the health of Americans, such as fossil fuels and tobacco.” Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse has also emerged as a leading critic of the increasing amounts of dark money backing Raga and the legal support that many Raga attorneys general have given to fossil fuel companies and other special interests. “I think the danger here is that [AG] offices that are putatively held for the benefit of the public interest have become law firms for private special interests,” Whitehouse, a former Rhode Island attorney general, told the Guardian. Whitehouse’s point was underscored in 2021, when Paxton and 19 other state attorneys general sued to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating power-plant carbon emissions. The legal battle culminated in a supreme court ruling last year, upholding the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate such emissions, but limiting its scope and pleasing coal company interests. Similarly, many Raga members have joined another growing legal battleground for fossil fuel interests. Earlier this year, 25 GOP attorneys general, including Paxton, sued the labor department over a new rule that allows retirement plan sponsors more leeway to consider environmental, social and governance matters when making investments. A press release from Paxton’s office in January erroneously claimed that the labor rule favoured what he dubbed “woke” investing, above retirement savings. Besides Paxton, some of Raga’s most active supporters of fossil-fuel interests include attorneys general from South Carolina, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, according to a Union of Concerned Scientists report. Paxton, who was recently impeached by the Texas house on 20 charges including bribery and other misconduct, has received more funding from fossil-fuel interests than any other sector, according to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Fossil fuel giants including Koch, ExxonMobil and Chevron since 2002 kicked in over $3.9m to his campaigns. Critics notwithstanding, Raga’s fundraising operation features wooing of corporate donors at wealthy locales, including Sea Island Georgia, where it held a “retreat” in May, and one slated for Pebble Beach, California in August that is billed as a “Victory Fund Golf Retreat”. In the 2022 election cycle, Raga raised $34.5m, according to CMD. After news broke in early 2021 about how Raga’a affiliate paid for the robocalls, some longtime corporate donors held back funding for a while. Later, most returned to the fold. Inside Raga, the robocall brouhaha quickly led to the resignation of executive director Adam Piper, who issued a statement condemning the violence at the Capitol. Although Raga tried to downplay any other ties to the Trump rally, Paxton was a speaker there. After Trump left office too, Paxton and 10 other attorneys general signed an amicus brief last September attacking the FBI raid for “ransacking” Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence to recover a large cache of classified and other documents he retained improperly, as Special Counsel Jack Smith charged in the 37-count indictment of Trump. Raga’a spending in the last elections on behalf of attorney-general candidates included almost $9m to support ones who falsely denied or questioned Trump’s loss to Biden, according to ProPublica. In an internal move that may have enhanced its ties to the Concord Fund, Peter Bisbee, who ran the Rule of Law Defense Fund that paid for the robocalls and previously worked at the Federalist Society when Leonard Leo served as executive director, was tapped in April 2021 to be Raga’s executive director The Concord Fund was formerly known as the Judicial Crisis Network, and spent tens of millions during the Trump years to help his three supreme court nominees win Congressional approval. Concord is led by Carrie Severino, who once served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas. Concord, a key group in Leo’s sprawling dark-money ecosystem, gave Raga $4m in 2022, or about 15% of its total fundraising for the year. Leo’s dark-money operations have garnered attention for notching $1.6bn in 2022 from Chicago businessman Barre Seid, as the New York Times first disclosed. Some former federal prosecutors have also voiced concerns about Raga’s large influx of dark money. “The mix of politics, secret money and attorneys general is always potentially toxic,” Paul Pelletier, former acting chief of the fraud section at Justice, told the Guardian. “Normalising such large dark money donations to Raga creates not only an unseemly perception of an attempt to use the levers of attorneys general solely for a political end but worse, may foment corruption.”",Republicans; US news; World news; US politics,US news
2022-09-15T11:51:39Z,Shell appoints Wael Sawan to replace outgoing chief Ben van Beurden,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/15/shell-appoints-wael-sawan-to-replace-outgoing-chief-ben-van-beurden,"Shell has appointed Wael Sawan, a 25-year company veteran, as successor to Ben van Beurden, the company’s longstanding chief executive. Van Beurden, who has led the energy company for almost a decade, is stepping down at the end of the year. Reports of his planned departure emerged earlier this month, and Sawan was considered then the frontrunner to take the top job. As Shell’s current head of integrated gas and renewables division, Sawan oversees its push into low-carbon energies as well as its giant gas business. “It’s been a privilege to work alongside Ben and I’m honoured to take over the leadership of this great company from him,” Sawan said. “We will be disciplined and value-focused, as we work with our customers and partners to deliver the reliable, affordable and cleaner energy the world needs.” Sawan, born in Beirut with dual Lebanese and Canadian nationality, will officially take over as chief executive from 1 January, at which point he will also join Shell’s board. “The outcome of the board’s managed succession process resulted both in the appointment of an outstanding chief executive and proved the strength and depth of Shell’s leadership talent,” said Sir Andrew Mackenzie, the chairman of Shell. The appointment of Sawan, who was reportedly one of four internal candidates in the running for the top job, is being viewed as a signal that Shell intends to increase its focus on transitioning to a renewable energy business. “For a group whose renewable strategy has been somewhat vague, though grand sounding, this is a clear marker that Shell intends to change this,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Change won’t happen overnight, but it’s reasonable to think that at least tweaks to the existing renewable strategy could be on the cards.” The company’s renewables and energy solutions division, which includes businesses such as renewable electricity generation and hydrogen, accounts for about 12% of Shell’s $23bn to $27bn capital expenditure this year. However, this division does not include other businesses such as electric vehicle charging and low carbon fuels such as biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels. Shell has said more than 35% of its operating and capital expenditure this year will be on producing low-carbon energy and non-energy products that reduce emissions – from EV charging and low carbon fuels to chemicals and lubricants – with a plan to increase that to 50% by 2025. Van Beurden, 64, who has been at Shell for almost four decades, will continue to work in an advisory role to the board until the end of June. “Ben can look back with great pride on an extraordinary 39-year Shell career, culminating in nine years as an exceptional chief executive,” Mackenzie said. “He leaves a financially strong and profitable company with a robust balance sheet, very strong cash generation capability and a compelling set of options for growth.” During his time as chief executive he oversaw one of the company’s biggest acquisitions in decades, buying BG Group for $53bn (£46bn) in 2016, which gave Shell a much bigger position in gas that has paid off handsomely as prices have soared, and recently orchestrated the relocation of the company’s headquarters from the Netherlands to London. Van Beurden has presided over two plunges in Shell’s market value – in 2014 and 2020 – related to sharp falls in the oil market. However, the energy crisis has proved a boon for oil and gas companies with Shell reporting record adjusted profits of $11.5bn in the three months to the end of June. Shell’s profits, which has a market value of more than £170bn, beat its previous high – set between January and March – by 26% and were more than double the same period last year. Van Beurden, who was paid €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021, warned in August that gas shortages in Europe would probably last several years, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing. Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said: “Van Beurden has managed to navigate the company through some uncertain times as the world went ESG-crazy [environmental, social and governance] and businesses in the oil and gas industry were viewed as toxic entities not fit for the modern world. “He has helped to steer Shell towards renewable energy while at the same time capitalising on the sudden surge in the oil price as the world emerged from the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis sent ripples through the energy sector. “His resignation comes as Shell’s share price returns to pre-pandemic levels, illustrating how he has steadied the ship and now seems as good a time as any to pass the baton to a new leader.”",Shell; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Business; World news; Oil; Commodities,Business
2022-08-30T11:33:49Z,US fossil fuel firm sues insurer for refusing to cover climate lawsuit,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/30/us-fossil-fuel-firm-aloha-petroleum-sues-insurer-aig-for-refusing-to-cover-climate-lawsuit,"A fossil fuel firm is suing its insurer for refusing to cover a climate lawsuit in a case that could affect the wider industry’s ability to defend itself from litigation. Aloha Petroleum, a subsidiary of the US-based Sunoco, filed a claim against AIG’s National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh earlier this month, arguing it had failed to protect Aloha from the mounting costs of defending climate-related claims by local governments in Hawaii. According to documents filed in the latest lawsuit, Aloha has already incurred more than $880,000 (£750,000) in defence costs, and expects these to grow significantly as litigation progresses. Its insurance company will not pay out. The lawsuit follows another, filed by the insurance company Everest in June, which is asking Massachusetts superior court to make a similar decision about whether coverage can be denied to Gulf Oil. These are some of the first disputes over insurance coverage for climate crisis litigation to be heard in the courts. Both insurance companies say climate litigation is covered by exclusions for “pollution” in their clients’ general liability policies. If they succeed, the fossil fuel firms could be on the hook for millions of dollars in legal fees, in addition to any future damages awarded in court. The only previous decision on this subject was in 2012, when the Virginia supreme court ruled that Steadfast insurance company had no duty to cover the energy firm AES Corporation in a climate lawsuit brought by the Native American village of Kivalina. The Kivalina lawsuit was unsuccessful, but in the US that usually still leaves defendants liable for their legal costs. Russell Butland, a senior associate at law firm Allen &amp; Overy who advises companies on commercial disputes, said the extent to which the latest lawsuits set a precedent for future claims would depend on the specific wording of insurance policies and the relevant laws in particular places. “However, exclusions for pollution risks are a common feature of all types of insurance, and therefore the outcome will be of real interest to all companies and individual directors seeking to manage their risks for similar litigation,” he said. The world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters are increasingly being targeted by litigation challenging their inaction on the climate emergency and attempts to spread misinformation. The lawsuits underlying Aloha’s claim were brought by local governments in Hawaii against companies including Sunoco, ExxonMobil and Shell. Honolulu’s case alleges the big oil firms “engaged in a coordinated, multifront effort” to deny the threat posed by global heating, to discredit the science of the climate crisis, and to deceive the public “about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution”. It was also one of a swathe of lawsuits given the go-ahead to be heard in a state court this year; the latest such ruling was made earlier this month in Delaware. Jason Reeves, ta partner in the London office of the law firm Zelle, said this was important because plaintiffs were more likely to succeed on their claims than in federal court and to obtain hefty judgments. Even if judgments were years away, the costs of defending the case could be high. “You will see a continued escalation of ‘parallel’ climate litigation cases between policyholders and their insurers as policyholders present claims in relation to defending these lawsuits,” he said. It is not only a risk for the fossil fuel industry. Mary Sweeters, a senior strategist for the Insure Our Future campaign, said insurers underwriting the polluters that were subject to climate litigation may face significant losses. Last year, the UN Environment Programme concluded that insurance firms were not assessing the risk of climate litigation in a rigorous way, largely because they had not yet paid out for any claims. This was echoed in the Bank of England’s first climate stress test earlier this year, which considered the growing prospect of climate-related payouts – in particular in lawsuits against company directors – and found that not all insurance companies had properly considered how this would affect their business. Nor are companies preparing properly for increasing claims for the impactsof extreme weather events. However, parts of the insurance industry are waking up. Some companies are now asking clients about their climate crisis reporting while negotiating liability coverage or providing more insurance capacity to those with high ESG (environmental, social and governance) ratings. The Lloyd’s Market Association has also published a model clause for liability policies that excludes cover for climate litigation, which insurers can use in their own documentation. Reeves said these kinds of exclusions were likely to become more common. They would not protect companies in cases such as that of Aloha Petroleum, however, where the insurance policies in question dated back to the 1980s. None of the insurers or fossil fuel companies involved in the latest lawsuits responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. But, in its latest ESG report, AIG recognised that climate lawsuits had increased in recent years. “While these kinds of actions have not resulted in material losses, AIG continues to assess the evolving norms for disclosure and expectations for corporate action around climate change, which create the potential for more climate-related litigation.” Sweeters said lawsuits such as those brought by Aloha were an indicator that pressure was mounting on insurers for underwriting fossil fuel projects. Earlier this year, AIG announced it would no longer insure new coal-fired power plants, thermal coalmines or oil sands. Sweeters said industry leaders were starting to act by restricting their portfolios – but “by and large, the industry falls far short of where it needs to be”.",Climate crisis; Insurance industry; Environment; Hawaii; US news; World news; Law; Business; AIG,Environment
2022-04-22T14:00:26Z,Can I make an ethical killing on the stock market? We ask an expert,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/ethical-killing-on-stock-market-we-ask-an-expert,"The notion of “sustainable investing” had a bumper year in 2021. Aligning investments with climate goals – no fossil fuel companies, for example – promises a good financial return, while benefiting the planet. But is it too good to be true? I asked Tariq Fancy – CEO of non-profit digital learning charity Rumie and ex-head of sustainable investing for investment company BlackRock. Last year Fancy publicly denounced sustainable investing as a “dangerous placebo that harms the public interest”. I read a claim recently – from research led by Aviva and Make My Money Matter – that turning your pension “green” is 21 times more powerful in cutting your carbon footprint than stopping flying, becoming vegetarian and moving to a renewable energy provider combined. That’s ludicrous. Our individual actions reduce real-world emissions. Selling shares in polluting companies does not – it just means someone else buys those shares and owns those emissions. But sustainable investing must be doing something good? It is, in specific corners of the market. But those aren’t corners the average person can get into, commonly with pensions. The proof is in the pudding. Green investing has increased massively, yet emissions seem to be increasing alongside it. Since the 1980s, people have been beholden to a narrative that the free market will magically self-correct. But climate change is at its core a market failure, and it requires regulation. Investing in ESG falls into that trap. ESG investing – that’s a type of sustainable investing that involves buying shares in companies with a good score for “environmental, social and governance” … ExxonMobil used to have the same ESG score as Tesla! Because the scores are a mashup of different things. ExxonMobil has good governance and a diverse board, so they’re good on “G” and “S” but terrible on “E”. So when someone is investing in ethical or sustainable funds, they may find they’re investing in companies they’d be horrified by. How can this be OK? There hasn’t been any regulation, though increasingly there is in the EU. It’s like organic fruit 30 years ago. If no one polices what it is to be organic, then someone figuring people will pay more will put the organic sticker on. Tariq, this all sounds a bit evil. The economy is structured according to what’s profitable. That’s not because people are bad, but the way the system is designed. Fund managers have a legal obligation to focus on maximising profit. And because they’re managing someone else’s money, you don’t want them thinking about values, because everyone has different values. I see why you’ve said this system is not going to save the planet. A lot of the theory comes from divestment – that if I no longer own something, I’ll make the world better. But it makes no sense in practice. I’ve met Middle Eastern ethical investors who say, “We’re against drinking, we don’t want to own alcohol companies.” But they didn’t believe that by not owning them they stop people in France drinking wine. As long as something is legal and it makes money, someone will own it. Our greatest power is not as consumers but as voters. Only the government has the power to put a price on carbon, to set vehicle emissions limits and new efficiency standards for buildings. It’s wasting time, too. The eight-year-old in Bangladesh who has no carbon footprint is going to bear the brunt while Wall Street kicks the can down the road. It’s morally unconscionable.",Ethical money; Life and style; Stock markets; Ethical business; Business; Investments; Investment funds; Consumer affairs; Money,Life and style
2024-04-11T16:29:12Z,UK startup lifts lid on plan to turn human waste into jet fuel,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/11/uk-aviation-supplier-lifts-lid-turn-human-waste-fuel-wizz-air,"Aircraft could one day take off on fuel made from human waste under plans revealed by Wizz Air and the British sustainable aviation company Firefly to build a commercial refinery in Essex. Firefly, based in Bristol, said it had developed a process to convert treated sewage into sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The low-cost airline Wizz said it was investing by placing an order – potentially worth hundreds of millions of pounds – for up to 525,000 tonnes of Firefly’s waste-based fuel over the next 15 years. Firefly has now signed agreements with industrial partners for a pilot refinery in Harwich that would take “biosolids” from Anglian Water and turn it into aircraft fuel. Airlines will have to ensure that a minimum proportion of fuel burned is certified sustainable in the coming decade, with the EU mandating at least 20% SAF by 2035, and the UK expected soon to announce a mandatory 10% by 2030. There are various ways of making SAF but most are much more expensive than normal kerosene jet fuel, with a limited supply of waste feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Firefly’s chief operations officer, Paul Hilditch, said converted sewage should be cheaper and more abundant, providing up to 5% of airlines’ fuel needs in the UK. The process uses biosolids, the water industry term for the final product in the treatment process. “It’s crumbly – like compost or wet chocolate cake,” he said. “There’s millions of tonnes of the stuff. And it has no intrinsic value.” The company has produced small test quantities of SAF that he said were “chemically indistinguishable” from jet fuel, with a residue that can be used as a soil enhancer. The fuel is still in a regulatory testing process, and Firefly is still to secure the investment it needs to build a full-scale factory. However, its chief executive, James Hygate, said it was confident it could be delivering commercial supplies of SAF by 2028-29. He said the first facility in Harwich would serve London airports and there was potential for two more in the UK. “We’re turning sewage into jet fuel and I can’t think of many things that are cooler than that,” he commented. Wizz Air’s corporate and ESG officer, Yvonne Moynihan, said: “Alongside fleet renewal and operational efficiency, SAF plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from aviation.” She said Wizz’s investment in Firefly was a “perfect pair-up for a low-cost airline” and the carrier aspired to use 10% SAF across its entire operation by 2030, although it would need “a significant ramp-up of production and deployment”. The UK government has said it expects five commercial plants to produce SAF in the UK to be under construction by 2025. However, campaigners have said even using human waste for aviation was not truly sustainable. Matt Finch, of the thinktank Transport &amp; Environment UK, said sewage could also be used to make biomethane and there was direct competition for its use: “What’s the best use of this biomass hasn’t been clarified … It’s another conundrum.” About 87% of UK water companies’ biosolids are currently spread on farmland. Cait Hewitt, of the Aviation Environment Foundation, said: “It’s not to be sniffed at, given that this is truly unavoidable waste, but not great either given it’s already in use as fertiliser.” She said any test for the carbon credentials of alternative fuels should ask: “Has the producer done something to draw down additional CO2 from the atmosphere? Otherwise it’s nothing near a net zero solution.” Hilditch said the use of biosolids for muckspreading on farms was of low value, and the residue from the sewage-to-fuel process would still be available to improve soil. Many other countries simply incinerated human waste, meaning that converting it to jet fuel could also have other benefits in terms of efficient disposal, he added. “It’s not just the UK of course. Anywhere in the world where there are people, there’s poo.”",Airline industry; Business; Airline emissions; Environment; Energy; Bristol; UK news; Air transport; Travel and transport; Travel & leisure,Business
2023-06-22T11:00:07Z,Rightwing war on ‘woke capitalism’ partly driven by fossil fuel interests and allies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/22/rightwing-war-on-woke-capitalism-industry-interests,"The American right wing’s widening fight against what it calls “woke capitalism” is partly driven by fossil fuel interests or industry allies, according to a new report published on Thursday. Conservatives often use the term “woke capitalism” to refer to environmental, social and corporate governance – or ESG – criteria used to screen investments based on their environmental and social implications. Just this year, Republican lawmakers in 37 states introduced a stunning 165 pieces of anti-ESG legislation, according to the new report from the strategic research and advisory firm Pleiades Strategy. “The trend has been rampant,” said Connor Gibson, who co-authored the report. The 165 proposals sought to employ a variety of tactics, ranging from imposing limits on public contracts and restricting pension managers to forcing disclosures and combatting federal investment rules. The researchers examined news articles, fiscal notes and statehouse testimony related to each bill. They found that the majority of them bear strong resemblances to model bills crafted or circulated by four influential rightwing thinktanks: the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Heritage Foundation, the Heartland Institute and the Foundation for Government Accountability. Each of the four organizations is affiliated with the far-right thinktank coalition State Policy Network, whose members have also fought to pass punitive anti-pipeline protest laws and which has received funding from groups linked to fossil fuel billionaires Charles and the late David Koch. Advocacy for many of the bills was also led by fossil fuel-tied groups, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), which has accepted at least $8.8m from organizations linked to the Kochs since 2012, and has also received funding from ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron. The TPPF began attacking ESG as far back as 2020 and says it was behind a pioneering anti-ESG bill passed in Texas in 2021. The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil and gas lobbying organization, has also worked to shape anti-ESG policies. And representatives from several other fossil fuel interest groups have supported the efforts as well, the researchers say. Despite their well-connected champions, just 22 of the 165 proposed anti-ESG bills progressed through statehouses, the report says. “The dark-money-funded attacks on the freedom to invest responsibly hit deep opposition from business, labor and environmental advocates in statehouses across the country this year,” said Frances Sawyer, founder of Pleiades Strategy and co-author of the report. “Our report shows that the effort to weaponize government funds, contracts and pensions to prevent companies and investors from considering real financial risks is not a winning platform.” Many of the bills that did pass were watered down before they became law, the report says. But that doesn’t mean they won’t have real negative consequences. Opponents of the successful pieces of legislation fear they could cost taxpayers millions, collectively. And the implications for climate policy could be even larger, because the legislation could have a chilling effect on future climate policy. The laws could create an environment that discourages support for shareholder resolutions that aim to lower emissions, said Sawyer. It could also make it harder for states to take advantage of the clean energy investments offered by the Inflation Reduction Act, she said, due to fears that those funds would drive competition with the industries the bills favor. “The full extent of those costs, we don’t know,” she said. Anti-ESG legislation has increasingly popped up in statehouses over the past two years. In 2021, North Dakota lawmakers passed a law calling for a study of the implications of state funds making investments “for the purpose of obtaining an effect other than a maximized return to the state”. The same year, Texas lawmakers passed a law prohibiting state funds from contracting with or investing in companies that “boycott” fossil fuel stocks, based on a policy passed four years earlier that aimed to prevent Texas from doing business with entities that support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, or BDS, movement, for Palestine. Similar legislation began to appear in statehouses across the country. Last year, Idaho, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Kentucky all passed various forms of anti-ESG legislation. The legislation is unpopular, the authors say, but they still expect to see more of it in the coming years as more policymakers take the energy transition more seriously. “We think this is the latest iteration of climate denial and obstruction and delay,” said Gibson.",Corporate social responsibility; Environment; US news; US political financing; Alec (American Legislative Exchange Council); Republicans; US politics,US news
2023-11-03T11:00:08Z,US states invest $300m in Israeli bonds since start of Israel-Hamas war,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/03/state-invest-money-israeli-bond-florida-texas-arizona,"American states have announced $300m in Israeli bond purchases in the past four weeks, throwing their financial weight behind the country’s government as its war with Hamas escalates. The majority of the money comes from states with senior financial officials who are members of a conservative group that has railed against the “politicization” of taxpayer-funded investments, the Guardian found. Fourteen states have backed Israeli investments since the Hamas attack in southern Israel on 7 October, according to official announcements and Israel Bonds, the US-based underwriter of debt securities issued by the state of Israel. Financial officials of 12 of those states are members of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), a body backed by rightwing groups and corporate interests. Israel Bonds itself was a “bronze sponsor” of SFOF as recently as last year. The SFOF has vociferously campaigned against environmental, social, governance (ESG) investment strategies. Considering factors like climate change puts “politics over returns”, it has claimed, yielding “less than optimal” profits for investment vehicles serving retirees and taxpayers. David Armiak, research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, a progressive non-profit organization that monitors corruption, argued that purchasing Israeli bonds was a political decision. “The whopping investment of taxpayer money in Israel Bonds by SFOF members – to support Israel’s war effort – screams of hypocrisy,” he said. The SFOF’s website no longer discloses its sponsors but cites the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) and the Heritage Foundation among its “educational resources”. The organization and Israel Bonds did not respond to requests for comment on whether their financial partnership remained in place. Israel Bonds, also known as the Development Corporation for Israel, raises foreign funds for the Israeli government. It launched a funding drive in the aftermath of last month’s attack by Hamas, which killed 1,400 people. The Israeli government responded by tightening its blockade and bombarding the Gaza Strip. More than 9,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to its health ministry. States have committed at least $300m to Israeli bonds since 7 October, of which $270m has been announced by Republican financial officers who are members of SFOF, according to an analysis by the Guardian. No state has pledged more than Florida, which first pledged to invest $25m into Israeli bonds, before announcing an additional $120m this week. The state’s chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, said it was seeking to “assist our allies in Israel both morally and monetarily”. Patronis, an SFOF member, has regularly attacked “woke” investments, accusing Farmers Insurance of “virtue signaling” and claiming that Wall Street “wants to cozy up to the CCP [Chinese Community party] and [trans influencer] Dylan Mulvaney!” The Indiana state treasurer, Daniel Elliott, another SFOF member, announced the purchase of $35m in Israeli bonds on Wednesday. “Israel is our most important ally in the world,” he said. The investment was criticized by Malkah Bird, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace Indiana, who described the move as “unconscionable”. Texas also moved to purchase $20m in Israeli bonds to provide the country “with the financial liquidity needed to respond to the atrocities we’ve all witnessed”, Glenn Hegar, the state’s comptroller, said in a statement announcing the decision. Hegar is also an SFOF member, and one of the anti-ESG movement’s most influential critics. Eleven states with financial officers in the SFOF have announced that they have, or will, purchase Israeli bonds since 7 October. Israel Bonds claims to have received support from another, Nevada, which did not respond to a request for comment. Two Democrats without affiliation to SFOF – Thomas DiNapoli, New York state comptroller, and Michael Frerichs, Illinois state treasurer – have also announced support. New York’s Common Retirement Fund purchased $20m in additional Israeli bonds, while Illinois invested $10m. Such donors are “investing in Israel’s strength and Israel’s future”, the Development Corporation for Israel said in a recent promotional video. It says Israeli bonds amount to a reliable investment. Its two-year jubilee bonds, for example, have an interest rate of 5.15%. On Tuesday, Patronis said Florida’s vast investment was a “prudent use of state funds”, and called on other states to follow suit. Elliott, of Indiana, claimed Israeli bonds “have provided high rates of returns for investors, even outperforming their American counterparts”. Leading credit ratings agencies have sounded a note of caution, however. Last week, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded Israel’s credit outlook from stable to negative, citing “the risk that the Israel-Hamas war could spread more widely or affect Israel’s credit metrics more negatively than we expect”. Armiak said: “SFOF and its network of operatives and members have consistently messaged that asset managers should focus on pecuniary factors when investing and not consider environmental, social or political interests, but now they make an exception to fund Israel’s war? Why?” Contacted by the Guardian about Arizona’s recent commitment to Israel Bonds, Kimberly Yee, the state treasurer, did not directly address whether SFOF played a role in the decision. She told the Guardian: “I will continue supporting Israel bonds as they provide reliable returns while contributing to Israel’s economic wellbeing.” The Alabama treasury, Arkansas treasurer’s office, Florida treasury, Georgia governor’s office, Louisiana treasury, Ohio treasury, Pennsylvania treasury and Texas comptroller of public accounts did not respond to requests for comment. Indiana’s decision was based on “historical data points and future projections”, Elliott said in a statement. Comparing support for Israel with “opposing large corporations who use ESG policies to impose their will on businesses they disagree with politically” is “morally wrong”, he told the Guardian. The Oklahoma state treasurer’s office said it had invested in a $5m bond and “is going to secure another for $10m, with plans for more”, a spokeswoman said. When asked how much the state had made on previous investments in Israeli bonds, and whether SFOF played a role in the latest decision, it did not respond. The Israel-Hamas conflict has triggered a surge in investment in Israeli bonds – not all of it at the state level. Palm Beach county, Florida, announced this week what it described as the single largest one-time investment in Israeli bonds: a $135m purchase.

2023-05-02T05:00:54Z,"Green investment funds pushing money into fossil fuel firms, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/green-investment-funds-pushing-money-into-fossil-fuel-firms-research-finds,"Investment funds branded as green or socially responsible are being used by some of the world’s largest asset managers to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in fossil fuel companies, according to a report. The research by the Common Wealth thinktank showed that the US fund managers BlackRock and State Street and the UK-based Legal &amp; General were among asset managers to use funds with an “environment, social and governance” (ESG) label to invest in fossil fuel firms. The leftwing thinktank said that despite claims that ESG funds offer a green and socially responsible option for investors, “the research shows these funds are significantly exposed to fossil fuel companies”. Between February and April this year, BlackRock, State Street and Legal &amp; General alone were found to hold $1bn (£800m) in bonds issued by fossil fuel companies in their ESG funds. Research by Sophie Flinders, a data analyst, found that more broadly ESG funds had invested more than $1.5bn in the bonds of top coal, oil and gas companies – raising questions about sustainability claims made by asset managers. ESG funds account for a small portion of the world’s assets under management, which reached $126tn in 2022, according to the data provider Morningstar. A report by the accountancy firm PwC last year said fund managers were expected to increase their ESG-related assets under management to $33.9tn by 2026, from $18.4tn in 2021. However, critics of ESG have accused the asset management industry of “greenwashing” as it seeks to attract ethical investors. Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said existing financial sector strategies failed to offer a sufficient response to the climate emergency – with the scale of investment in clean energy through ESG funds falling far short of what was needed. “The findings, though shocking, are not unexpected,” he said. “This is a feature rather than a bug from the ESG logic, which is concerned less with driving real material change in the economy, including decarbonisation, and instead is focused on managing financial risk and reducing financial impacts.” Flinders used lists of bonds compiled by the German campaign group Urgewald, before cross-checking them with data from the financial information provider Refinitiv eMaxx at a fund level to arrive at a figure for the value of ESG bonds invested in fossil fuel firms. State Street did not respond to a request for comment. BlackRock said it clearly disclosed the objectives of its funds. A spokesperson said its funds “provide investors with choice in how they make sustainable investments, whether that be in clean energy, investments that explicitly exclude fossil fuels or those that are more broadly diversified, including investments in issuers that are actively transitioning.” Legal &amp; General Investment Management said it invested in fossil fuel firms to actively encourage their transition to more sustainable energy sources. It argued that some coalmining businesses invested in renewable energy, and that with “active engagement” investors could speed up the shift away from fossil fuels. A spokesperson said: “We believe investing to support companies to make the transition to a low-carbon world will have a greater impact on real-economy emissions than simply divesting.”",Investing; Investment funds; Investments; Financial sector; Business; Money; Corporate governance; Ethical business; Ethical money; Bonds; Bonds; Fossil fuels; Environment; Oil and gas companies; Oil; Oil; Energy industry,Business
2022-10-11T05:48:58Z,ACCC begins ‘greenwashing’ crackdown on companies’ false environmental claims,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/11/accc-begins-greenwashing-crackdown-on-companies-false-environmental-claims,"The competition watchdog has begun a crackdown on “greenwashing” by Australian companies, surveying the internet for companies making false claims about environmental action after a global investigation found as many as 40% may be fraudulent. Gina Cass-Gottlieb, chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told a House of Representative hearing on Tuesday that “increasingly large proportions of consumers” were making decisions based on products’ sustainability credentials. “We do not want to see a loss of consumer and community trust in these claims because it is a critical part of the purchasing decisions of consumers,” she said, adding “we get an unfair competitive situation” if firms falsely make claims about achieving net zero carbon emissions or other environmental standards. Ensuring claims are truthful will be an enforcement priority for the ACCC this year, and an enduring one, Cass-Gottlieb said, adding international estimates from consumer protection groups put the level of false environmental claims at 40%. Staff have begun “a significant body of work here”, including a sweep of the internet starting last week to identify claims that “set off alarm bells for us”, she said. The ACCC is also planning to lay down guidelines so that companies only make statements about their products that are “clear, defined, limited in their claims, and always have strong verification materials”, Cass-Gottlieb said. “Scientific and rigorous processes” would need to be behind those claims. Scrutiny of the companies’ climate credentials, including the validity of Australian carbon credit units (Accus), is likely to intensify in coming months. The Albanese government has launched an independent review of the credits and the Clean Energy Regulator that will report by the year’s end. On Monday, it also released draft regulation that will open up a new type of credits linked to reductions of carbon emissions by industrial facilities covered by the so-called safeguard mechanism. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jerome Laxale, Labor MP for Bennelong, welcomed the ACCC’s plans to clamp down on greenwashing. “It’s a huge indicator of what tough work our regulators need to do to ensure that 40% of net zero claims here in Australia are not fraudulent,” Laxale told Guardian Australia. “We’ve got a lot of catching up to do,” Laxale said. “It’s great to start this year, but it also would have been better if they had started earlier.” “I want to ensure that when a company claims that they are net zero that either, A, they are actually reducing their emissions, or B, that the offsets that they purchase are legitimate and not junk,” he said. The ACCC has emphasised the importance of businesses using trusted certifications to make environmental claims and that it is working with other Australian regulators to address greenwashing. But what happens when these “trusted” certification schemes or regulators themselves are making misleading claims? Polly Hemming, a senior researcher at the Australia Institute, said it was “very hard to see how Australian regulators can effectively tackle greenwashing if they can’t get to the root cause”. “That is, other regulators or arms of government rubber-stamping dodgy offsets or misleading carbon neutral claims,” she said. “In Australia gas companies can literally say they are a carbon-neutral-certified organisation because they have offset the emissions from their offices.” Hemming said the 40% estimate of fraudulent claims could be higher in Australia given the relative absence of transparent climate reporting requirements and government frameworks that actually encourage businesses to offset a small fraction of their emissions while expanding emissions elsewhere in their business. Cass-Gottlieb said the ACCC’s only action to date against greenwashing, involving a company claiming its wipes were flushable, had failed. A separate case against Volkswagen for its false emissions claims, was a success. “It’s enough to say a claim is based on a standard or guidelines or some sort of certification without knowing if that standard is robust,” Hemming said. The ACCC’s action against the wipes had failed because the respondent relied on “independent” guidelines to substantiate the flushable claims. “You could see with your own eyes that these wipes were choking up sewers – they pulled seven metres of them out of a Queensland sewer,” Hemming said. “It’s absurd when physical evidence has no weight in these matters.” Laxale later pressed the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority about whether they consider companies found to be greenwashing might face legal risks. Sean Carmody, an executive director at APRA, said its emphasis had been the “consistency and clarity” of company disclosures. “Greenwashing could be one of the litigation risks,” he said. Officials said it was up the clean energy regulator to supervise the integrity of carbon credits. Officials from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) said they too were planning to step up anti-greenwashing action. “[W]e’ve got a number of investigations in relation to allegations of greenwashing and the kinds of things that we’re looking at involve potential misleading or deceptive conduct,” Sarah Court, a deputy Asic chair said. “There [are] listed entities, superfund trustees, and one managed fund responsible entity” in the early stages of investigation. “So [we’re] looking at statements like claims about wanting to achieve net zero emissions by a particular time, claims about carbon neutrality, claims about an emissions reduction strategy,” Court said, adding there was also the “broad area” of products claiming to screen out certain investments. Karen Chester, another deputy Asic chair, said that by 2025 about a third of assets under management globally, worth some $53tr, would be covered by ESG – environmental, social and governance – standards. “We’ve been calling out greenwashing for a while,” Chester said, adding that it was “a whole of Asic priority now”.",Business; Australia news; Environment; Consumer affairs; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions,Australia news
2025-02-09T12:30:49Z,Revealed: how a shadowy group of far-right donors is funding federal employee watchlists,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/09/american-accountability-foundation-project-2025,"A rightwing non-profit group that has published a “DEI Watch List” identifying federal employees allegedly “driving radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives” is bankrolled by wealthy family foundations and rightwing groups whose origins are often cloaked in a web of financial arrangements that obscure the original donors. One recent list created by the American Accountability Foundation (AAF) includes the names of mostly Black people with roles in government health alleged to have some ties to diversity initiatives. Another targets education department employees, and another calls out the “most subversive immigration bureaucrats”. The lists come amid turmoil in the US government as Donald Trump’s incoming administration, aided by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has sought to fire huge swathes of the federal government and purge it of DEI and other initiatives – such as tackling climate change – that Trump has dubbed “woke”. While the publication of the personal details of government workers – whom the website describes as “targets” – has reportedly “terrified” many in federal departments, the Guardian has discovered that some current and former employees of AAF have taken pains to conceal their affiliations with the group on LinkedIn and other public websites. One of the donors to the AAF is the Heritage Foundation, the architects of Project 2025, which has been a driving ideological force behind Trump’s re-election and first weeks in government. Heidi Beirich, the chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said: “It’s not surprising to find a vile project such as this backed by Project 2025 entities and far-right donors who have it out for public employees.” Disclosure documents show that the AAF has been closely involved in training Republican staffers in collaboration with the affiliated Conservative Partnership Institute, in sessions that promise to train rightwing operatives in skills including “open source research” and “working with outside groups”. Funding fear Significant sums come to AAF via “dark money” donor-advised funds, which obscure the original benefactors by design. In the most recent filings for large donor-advised funds, AAF received $25,000 via the Goldman Sachs Charitable Fund; $16,750 via the National Christian Charitable Fund; and $22,300 via the Fidelity Investments Charitable Gift Fund. But other donors are named private foundations, some of which also donated to affiliated organizations including the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI). In 2022, for example, the Dunn Foundation gifted $250,000 to CPI and $25,000 to AAF. In 2023, the same foundation gave AAF another $25,000 and upped its CPI donation to $2.5m. In 2023, the WL Amos Sr Foundation handed $10,000 to AAF, $55,000 to CPI-affiliated American Moment, and $300,000 to CPI, along with another $200,000 to Project 2025’s architects at the Heritage Foundation. The Guardian emailed Foundation Source, listed as the administrator of the Dunn Foundation in filings, and William Amos III, who is listed as president of the WL Amos Sr Foundation, to ask about their donations and whether they approved of AAF’s style of political advocacy. The Guardian also emailed others listed as officers or trustees of other family foundations that have made substantial donations to AAF, including Tina Kimbrough, executive director of the Nord Family Foundation; and Hallie McFetridge, a trustee of the Quinn Family Foundation. Only Quinn’s McFetridge responded, saying: “As we are a family foundation, different members of the family are able to make gifts as their conscious dictates. Another member of our family made this particular donation.” She added that she would pass the Guardian’s questions on to that person but that “I can assure you I would find this absolutely intolerable. I strongly disagree with this approach to political advocacy.” Other heavyweight conservative groups have pitched in for AAF. AAF was one of two organizations to receive direct grants in 2023 from the Club for Growth Foundation. That foundation is co-located and affiliated with a family of non-profits and political committees including Club for Growth Action and Club For Growth PAC, which channel money to conservative causes and candidates from billionaire mega-donors Jeff Yass, Richard Uihlein and their affiliates. According to tax filings, in 2023 AAF also received $50,000 from The 85 Fund, which is one among a network of organizations funded by Leonard Leo, the conservative mega-donor and Federalist Society mastermind. Although 2024 filings for AAF are not yet available, last June the organization reportedly also received $100,000 from Heritage for a project whose “goal is to post 100 names of government workers to a website this summer to show a potential new administration who might be standing in the way of a second-term Trump agenda”. ‘Incubated’ by the Conservative Partnership Institute The most crucial support for AAF, however, has come from the organization that birthed it: the CPI, which continues to have a profound influence on the Trump administration and the Republican party as a whole via its own activities and those of its flotilla of spin-off groups. AAF was founded in 2021 to “take a big handful of sand and throw it in the gears of the Biden administration”, as Tom Jones, the organization’s head, told Fox News at the time. In 2021 and 2022, however, CPI’s filings indicate that it was the “directly controlling entity” for the “related tax-exempt organization” AAF, and that CPI funded AAF to the tune of $335,100 in 2021 and $210,000 in 2022. This was the period in which a well-heeled CPI was incubating a “network of closely affiliated think tanks, legal groups, and training centers dedicated to the thorough makeover of the federal government”, according to the Nation. That network included America First Legal (AFL), the Center for Renewing America (CRA), the Electoral Integrity Project (EIP) and American Moment, along with AAF. All of these groups were on the advisory board for Project 2025, and most have placed personnel at the highest levels of the new Trump administration. AFL’s Stephen Miller is Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy; CRA’s Russell Vought is poised to be confirmed as head of the office of management and budget; and in a little-reported move, Trump placed American Moment’s founder, Saurabh Sharma, as special assistant in the presidential personnel office. Moulding Maga minds The Guardian reported last year that CPI had been cementing ties between the far right and the GOP by means of training events for Hill staffers and their bosses in Congress Many of these events were held at “Camp Rydin”, a sprawling 2,200-acre (890-hectare) property on Maryland’s eastern shore purchased after a $25m donation was made to CPI by its namesake, retired Houston software entrepreneur Mike Rydin, in the wake of January 6. Others were held at one of at least nine adjacent properties on Washington DC’s Pennsylvania Avenue purchased by CPI since 2022, in what reports described as a $41m “shopping spree” that has created a “Maga campus”. CPI literature describes the precinct as “Patriot’s Row”. Records obtained from US Senate and House ethics disclosures indicate that AAF has benefited from being front and center at many of these events. At a 29 May 2024 “Legislative Assistant Symposium” attended by staffers then working for senators including Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and JD Vance, AAF’s Jones was billed as speaking on “strategies for how Congress should approach oversight and accountability”, alongside speakers from CPI, AFL, Advancing American Freedom and anti-immigrant group NumbersUSA. A parallel event with the same line-up drew staffers for hard-right Maga representatives including Anna Paulina Luna – who recently introduced a bill that would see Trump’s face added to Mount Rushmore – and Paul Gosar, who in November invoked antisemitic conspiracy theories in a newsletter defending Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick to lead national intelligence. NumbersUSA was part of a network of groups “founded and funded” by John Tanton, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center called the “puppeteer of the nativism movement and a man with deep racist roots”. At an event held 15-17 February 2023, hosted by AAF and attended by staffers for Congress members including Luna, Ken Buck and Marjorie Taylor Greene, trainees were to learn skills including “how to effectively draft requests for information from agencies and witnesses”, “tools and techniques for conducting open source research into agencies, individuals, and organizations”, and conducting “mock interviews with reluctant / recalcitrant witnesses”. AAF’s reticent researchers Prior to AAF, Jones worked as a Capitol Hill staffer for a string of high-profile hard-right Republicans including Ron Johnson, Cruz and the former senator Jim DeMint, who headed up CPI after he was forced out in an internal power struggle at Heritage. Since opening his AAF unit, he has blooded a new generation of rightwing opposition researchers. Some of those researchers appear reluctant to publicly advertise their affiliation. On LinkedIn, four people openly flag their affiliation with AAF: Jones himself; communications manager Yitz Friedman of Brooklyn, New York; development adviser Nadeen Wincapaw of Tampa, Florida; and associate researcher Elisabeth Guinard of Helena, Montana. Search engine-cached versions of the LinkedIn page of Jerome Trankle of Washington DC, however, indicate that he is research director at AAF. Data brokers also yield an AAF-associated email address for Tankle. Trankle’s live LinkedIn profile has him doing “ESG &amp; Financial Services” research at “AAF” without using the badged – and searchable – link some of his colleagues use. The Guardian emailed the address associated with Trankle at AAF to ask why he doesn’t more clearly advertise his affiliation but received no response. Additionally, an anti-fascist research group claimed late on Wednesday to have identified additional researchers on the basis of LinkedIn profile pictures that had inadvertently been included in purposed evidentiary materials about government workers on the DEI Watch List site. The Guardian corroborated the inclusion of researchers’ profile pictures in evidence on the DEI watchlist. One of those identified, Cari Fike, is married to Hugh Fike, a senior director at CPI, and is a former lobbyist for Heritage Action, the 501(c)4 associated with the Heritage Foundation. The Guardian contacted Fike for comment on her apparent involvement in researching government workers for AAF. Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “It’s rather ironic that an organization that is targeting public officials through a watchlist that could open them up to harassment and mistreatment goes to such lengths to protect its own,” adding: “Clearly, they understand how dangerous this outing can be.” Dirt machine The dirt machine now targeted at government workers was honed on higher-profile targets during the Biden administration. Early on, AAF pointed its opposition-research machine at Biden nominees including Saule Omarova, nominated for comptroller of the currency; Sarah Bloom Raskin, nominated for vice-chair for supervision of the Federal Reserve Board, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, supreme court justice, whom the organization falsely claimed had been soft on sex offenders. In the process of “desperately seeking dirt” on the Federal Reserve nominee Lisa Cook, AAF used a customary tactic of peppering her employer, Michigan State University, with records requests. But Jones went one step further by bombarding “dozens” of her colleagues in a bid to cast doubt on her tenure promotion a decade earlier. A significant proportion of the nominees targeted by AAF – including Brown Jackson, Cook and Omarova – were women of color. The dozens of public employees whose information was collected in “dossiers” on the DEI watchlist site are overwhelmingly people of color. Of 44 profiles listed under agencies at the time of reporting, 29 were people of color, and 20 were women of color alone. Just five were white men. “The fact that many on the list are people of color just adds another layer of vileness to the project,” Beirich said. “Recent attacks by the Trump administration on public employees shows that the Maga/Project 2025 movement will go as far as possible to make life miserable for public servants.” • This article was amended on 10 February 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated that employees of Foundation Source act as trustees for the Dunn Foundation; rather Foundation Source acts as an administrator. A spokesperson said after publication that Foundation Source “does not recommend (or decide) specific organizations for its clients to fund”, and that it has no affiliation with the CPI or AAF. It also clarified that Jeff Yass and Richard Uihlein have not contributed to the Club for Growth Foundation.",US news; Trump administration; The far right; Republicans; US politics; Project 2025; Donald Trump,US news
2023-06-12T10:00:18Z,"As the US becomes more divided, companies find they can’t appeal to everyone",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/12/bud-light-target-lgbtq-pride-business,"Bud Light, Target – and now Cracker Barrel? “We take no pleasure in reporting that @CrackBarrel has fallen,” the conservative group Texas Family said in a tweet last Thursday, in response to the southern-food restaurant chain marking Pride month on social media. “A once family-friendly establishment has caved to the mob.” The conservative backlash against American brands appears to have reached new heights over the last few weeks as companies show their support for Pride month and other LGBTQ+ issues. It is part of a wider backlash against corporate involvement in social, environmental or political issues that appears to be gathering steam. Corporate celebration of Pride month over recent years has seemed less radical amid growing criticism that parades and other events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights have actually become too corporatized. Critics have also pointed out that those same businesses are more than happy to fund politicians that oppose LGBTQ+ rights when it suits them. But conservatives have put those sponsorships back in the spotlight and are now more emboldened than ever to turn their fury against them. At the political vanguard is Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, the presidential candidate who is in the middle of a legal battle with Disney after the company publicly criticized his “don’t say gay” bill to curb discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. But the attack on “woke” corporations from conservative consumers and the politicians who court their support goes far further than Pride. Multiple Republican states, including Texas, West Virginia and Florida, have divested from investment firm BlackRock for the company’s support of environmental, social and governance portfolios that focus on sustainability and environmental impact. It is a notable change for Republicans, who for decades have been the party of business and fought the idea of government interference. Their hero, Ronald Reagan, once said “man is not free unless government is limited”. But a shift has been happening. Since 2019, the percentage of Republicans who say large corporations have a positive impact has fallen by a quarter, according to a 2021 Pew poll. A Gallup poll showed a similar drop in Republicans who were happy with the “size and influence of major corporations”, dropping from 57% to 31% in a year. Much of this comes from conservative distaste of “woke capitalism”, with companies coming out in support of progressive issues, such as LGBTQ+ rights, racial equity and concern over the environment, over the last decade. The shift has a strong business case. Younger Americans, who are more diverse and also more liberal, have come of age as consumers and companies have been trying to cater to them by promoting issues they care about. That comes with a price. “Millennials and younger generations are pushing this, and they have the idea that companies have a social responsibility beyond their business,” said Amna Kirmani, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland. “Conservatives think that companies should stay out of sociopolitical issues and instead focus on their business.” In other words, companies can’t appeal to everyone in such a divisive political landscape, as they are quickly finding out. Now that two major corporations have pulled back on marketing efforts that promote LGBTQ+ issues in the face of a rightwing backlash, some experts say conservative resolve against companies promoting the issues has been strengthened. Bud Light had been trying to revive its brand to appeal to younger Americans when it turned to TikTok influencer Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender woman, for a sponsored post on social media. “Our number one job at Bud Light is to grow meaning and relevance with new drinkers – that is how we transform and really preserve this brand for the next 40 years,” Alissa Heinerscheid, the company’s vice-president of marketing, told Ad Age in September. The backlash to the brand’s partnership with Mulvaney was intense, eventually leading to sales in Bud Light dropping by at least 23% compared to last year. Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Bud Light, put Heinerscheid and another marketing executive on leave. Brendan Whitworth, chief executive of Anheuser-Busch inBev, said in a statement in April amid the boycott that the brand “never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together.” Just a few weeks later, Target announced it would remove some of its Pride month merchandise from some of its stores after a series of “volatile circumstances” in which a handful of customers confronted workers and damaged displays in stores. “It has really emboldened a lot of conservative activists to keep shouting because in these two cases, there were serious consequences,” Kirmani said. “Boycotts happen all the time, most of them are not successful.” The ire against Bud Light and Target quickly spread to Kohl’s, which received bomb threats for displaying Pride month merchandise, and Chick-fil-A, which had hired an executive to lead diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at the company. The attack on Chick-fil-A surprised many given the company’s long history of supporting rightwing causes. Backlashes also pointed to Nike, North Face, the US navy and the LA Dodgers baseball team for social media posts and campaigns that celebrated Pride month. Eric Bloem, vice-president of programs and corporate advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, said that it stresses to companies that they need to be prepared to defend their values when faced with attacks. Nike and North Face, he pointed out, stood by their decision to work with transgender models (Nike had worked with Mulvaney) after they faced backlash. Meanwhile, Bud Light and Target backed off. “The message that it sends is that it fuels extremist behavior … and that they can make Pride toxic. Once they are able to make Pride toxic for one company, they’re going to move on to the next,” Bloem said. Both Kirmani and Bloem said the conservative backlash against companies comes from a minority of people with extreme views. A survey from the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Glaad showed that 75% of participants said they are comfortable seeing LGBTQ+ people in advertising. “Let’s be clear that this is a coordinated attack against the LGBTQ+ community by a small group of extremists,” Bloem said. “There’s over 525 pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ pieces of legislation that have been pushed at the state level. These pieces of legislation are banning books, access to gender-affirming care for youth, they’re preventing trans youth from participating in sports. All of this is part of the larger context.” The wider context also suggests this fight isn’t going to end soon. The attacks on Target and Bud Light had real impact and DeSantis is not the only 2024 Republican presidential runner taking on “woke” corporations. Outlier candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur, has made his fight against corporate liberalism the centerpiece of his campaign. He is positioning his company, Strive Asset Management, as an alternative to investment firms like BlackRock. Ramaswamy may not be a frontrunner but he is gaining airtime and his message has the support of Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy and others. His views may be out of touch with younger voters, and many other Americans, but it’s one that captures an angry base that has found a cause to fight for. “Courage Is Contagious” is Ramaswamy’s campaign slogan. As corporate America is finding out, it is also going to be contentious.",Business; LGBTQ+ rights; Environment; US politics; US news,Business
2022-05-11T12:16:24Z, Lloyd’s of London attempts to shift AGM online to avoid climate protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/lloyds-of-london-attempts-to-shift-agm-online-to-avoid-climate-protesters,"Insurance market Lloyd’s of London is urging members to watch its annual general meeting from home next week, amid fears it will be the latest City event disrupted by climate protests. The chair of Lloyd’s,Bruce Carnegie-Brown, warned about the potential for disruption at the 19 May AGM back in April, but said in an updated memo that the risk of disruption had significantly increased. “To ensure the safety and security of our members and to allow the meeting to proceed in an orderly and fair manner, it is with regret that I must now strongly encourage all members attending the AGM to join virtually and not to attempt to enter the Lloyd’s Building on that day,” Brown said in a notice aimed at the market’s close to 100 syndicate members. The warning comes nearly a month after Lloyd’s was forced to close the doors of its landmark Grade I-listed building at One Lime Street, when more than 60 protesters from Extinction Rebellion (XR) used superglue, chains and bicycle locks to block workers from entering. Lloyd’s has pledged that members will phase out all existing insurance policies for fossil fuel projects by 2030, but activists say the policy does not go far enough. “We are committed to nonviolently disrupting business as usual until Lloyd’s of London ends its underwriting of fossil fuels,” a spokesperson for XR said. “Instead of trying to hide from public anger by shifting their AGM online, Lloyd’s needs to be brave, take bold action and stop insuring morally hazardous projects.” XR claimed its protests were already prompting change, with two Lloyd’s syndicates cutting ties with Canada’s controversial Trans Mountain pipeline since April. A string of City institutions, including HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered, have already had their AGMs disrupted by climate protesters in the past month. Activists at Standard Chartered’s AGM chanted and wore masks the depicting chief executive, Bill Winters, with devil horns as part of efforts to raise the alarm over the banking group’s climate track record. Meanwhile, protesters were forcibly removed from Barclays’ AGM in Manchester after gluing themselves to chairs, setting off alarms and delaying the start of the event for nearly an hour. “Lloyd’s faces a growing level of protests because, as the world’s largest insurance market, they have a responsibility to act in accordance with climate science and the recommendations of the IEA [International Energy Agency] – and they are failing to do so,” said Lindsay Keenan, European coordinator of the Insure Our Future climate campaign. “Despite what Bruce Carnegie-Brown would like you to believe, the reality is that Lloyd’s continues to provide insurance for new coal, oil and gas projects despite its supposed ESG [environmental, social and governance] policy.” Lloyd’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",Lloyd's; Extinction Rebellion; Protest; Climate crisis; Insurance industry; Business; Environment,Business
2022-02-20T16:30:08Z,From human rights to recycling bins: how can you define ‘ethical investing’?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/from-human-rights-to-recycling-bins-how-can-you-define-ethical-investing,"Companies are facing increasing consumer and shareholder pressure to ensure the investments they make are ethical. But how do they define what’s ethical? Broadly, ethical investment is on the rise. According to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA), about $1tn of the $2.24tn in managed funds is classified as responsible. That’s not just because Australians are becoming more aware of the impact their investments can have, but also because responsible or ethical investment is really starting to pay. Sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially conscious businesses are often making essential contributions to our future. Through superannuation, banking and shares, people are actively putting their funds into such ventures. Unfortunately, there’s no uniform indication of what constitutes “ethical”. There’s also no regulation to clarify what ethical investing is as a basic standard. So you need to navigate the marketing. Ethical screening is generally conducted by fund managers and financial advisers. So, for example, in the case of an ethical superannuation fund, the fund’s managers will establish their ethical expectations and screen prospective companies based on this. Similarly, an ethical financial adviser will have a broad view of what they deem ethical, while also taking their clients’ specific needs into account. If you are investing independently, it will be up to you to decide what’s non-negotiable and what’s acceptable. To give you an idea of how the big superannuation funds and ethical investment firms decide what’s ethical and what’s not, here’s a list of the ways their investments might be screened. It’s still not foolproof, but it’s a start. Negative screening The negative screening process involves putting companies through assessments to find out if they’re invested in things that people broadly deem unethical. If they produce an addictive product or service (tobacco, gambling), they’re unlikely to get over the ethical hurdle. Likewise, if they engage in poor labour practices, they can be struck off the list of potential investment. Negative screening is a good place to start when deciding what you will and won’t invest in. If you are staunchly opposed to tobacco, obviously you won’t want your investment portfolio to include a company that makes cigarettes. Positive or ‘best-in-class’ screening This involves seeking out companies that have good social and ethical values, such as a zero-carbon-emissions policy, a gender-diverse board and exemplary treatment of staff in the production of goods and services. In essence, they turn a profit by doing the right thing. Ideally, they do everything right, but depending on who’s screening, they might only need to meet one or a handful of items in the criteria to make the cut. Companies that perform well in a positive screening process often make a tangible difference to environmental or social outcomes. And, in a perfect world, they’re a good investment too. This might include sectors such as healthcare, education and renewable energy. All super funds, managed funds and exchange-traded fund managers will do a form of screening, but the screens vary and therefore you may also need to apply your own ethical lens to see if it’s a good fit. Minimum standards or ‘norms-based’ screening This approach uses the minimum standard of company, government or international standards. The minimum standards depend on which filter they’re put through. So, for example, they may be subject to assessment based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. These principles are based, in part, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles cover topics such as: • Human rights (non-compliance in human rights abuses) • Labour (recognition of the right to collective bargaining and elimination of compulsory labour and child labour; elimination of discrimination) • The environment (precautionary approaches to environmental concerns, environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies) • Anti-corruption Depending on the fund, or financial product, specific screens will be applied. For example, Verve Superannuation applies a specific gender equality screening. This might be important to you. Alternatively, if you seek vegan and animal-friendly investments, you’d be looking for a specific screen layer. Ethics are personal, and therefore no one broad screen is likely to fit your ethical goals. Sustainability investing This is a specific environmental approach, and it means actively seeking out funds or investment opportunities in clean-water programs, renewable energy, infrastructure, recycling, waste management and more. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing ESG covers environmental, social and governance screening principles. If this is the screen you’re using, you might need to dig a bit to see just how good a company’s governance is. That can mean a fair amount of time and effort on your part: reading company reports, understanding the financial situation and continuing to keep track of the company’s activity once you’ve invested. Because ESG covers these sweeping, general areas, it makes it possible for businesses to claim they’re meeting the ESG criteria when, in fact, it’s a regular business where people are paid the nominated award wages and there’s a recycling bin next to the printer. Perhaps they report on sustainability during their annual general meeting, but potentially there’s little real change being driven. That’s not to say there aren’t companies with a great commitment to ESG, but you need to be comfortable with where they sit on what is a massive spectrum. Impact investing If you choose impact investing as a key screen, you’re ultimately looking to see physical results from your investment. That might come in the form of improved transport and infrastructure, schools or hospitals. Equally, the impact might be improved social outcomes locally or internationally. Either way, you’ll seek to get a return on investment while hopefully being able to see an actual result. If you’re unsure where to start, an ethical financial adviser could help you establish a strategy. The cost of personal advice can be prohibitive, which means you may have to do your own research. The first step might be to call your superannuation fund and find out where your money is invested. If they can’t tell you, look for funds that can provide more transparency, so you can consider the contents of the portfolios and how they align with your values.

2022-11-30T14:30:19Z,‘You’ll have to talk to the UK staff’: can global water investors be held to account?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/youll-have-to-talk-to-the-uk-staff-can-global-water-investors-be-held-to-account,"Most Malaysians know the YTL Corporation. Take the high-speed train from Kuala Lumpur International airport to the centre of the capital – YTL built it. Make a phone call in the country and it could be on YTL’s network. Its subsidiaries run luxury resorts, develop land, and manufacture cement. But tell them it supplies water to south-west England and that may surprise some in the south-east Asian nation. In 2002, the bust US energy trader Enron sold 100% of Wessex Water to YTL Power International, a YTL Corp subsidiary, for about £545m plus £695m of Wessex debt. The Malaysian company saw its investment as the start of an expansion into Europe, although for its chair, Francis Yeoh, it was something more. When the then Prince Charles awarded Yeoh a knighthood in 2019, the businessman credited his time studying civil engineering at Kingston University in the late 1970s for the growth of YTL. “In Britain, there is a real premium transparent, coherent regulatory framework, where the rule of law is the order of the day,” Yeoh was quoted as saying in the 2018 book Power Talk: Insights from Asia’s Leading Entrepreneurs. At a Malaysian government forum in 2014, Yeoh explained his preference for operating in countries such as Britain, Singapore and Australia. “The good thing about these three territories, I do not have to kowtow to the prime minister before I do a deal, I do not have to see them even, even after I have won the deal,” he said. However, when the Guardian tried to reach Yeoh, 68, to ask about the pollution of English waters, his daughter Rebekah Yeoh Pei Wenn, a YTL director of corporate finance, said he was unavailable to discuss this topic “as we draw closer to our quarterly board meetings”. After making an approach by phone, the Guardian went to the YTL Power offices in Kuala Lumpur – a stone’s throw from one of YTL’s numerous hotels, the Ritz-Carlton, to ask if it would be possible to speak to anyone there about the water company. A receptionist confirmed that “YTL is the owner of Wessex Water, but the staff are based in the UK, you will have to talk to them”.When the Guardian followed up via email, it was politely but firmly told that the chairman was unavailable, adding: “We wish you all the best for the article.” Yeoh took over the running of YTL in the 1980s from his father, the late billionaire Yeoh Tiong Lay, whose initials form the company name. Forbes ranked him 17th on the list of Malaysia’s 50 richest people in 2022, with a net worth of $1.25bn (£1.04bn), which he shares with his six siblings. An evangelical Christian, his apparent Twitter account posts biblical scripture, family videos and nods to the late Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who enjoyed the Malaysian coast. In February 2021, he tweeted: “YTL listed in the KLSE [Malaysia’s stock exchange] in 1986, we had total assets of USD20m. Today we are blessed with global assets of USD20b. This is miraculous!” BlackRock: ‘We engage … but it is not the role of minority investors to direct these companies’ Every January, Larry Fink sends a letter to the world’s chief executives. Few of them can afford to ignore it. The billionaire investor is the chair and chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a company that oversees a portfolio of investments that was worth more than $10tn at the start of the year – twice the annual economic output of Japan. In recent years, Fink, 70, has been much concerned with the environment and has become, arguably, the most important proponent of “stakeholder capitalism” – the idea that a successful business must take into account all its “stakeholders” – employees, customers, partners, society and the environment, and not only this quarter’s profits. It is not that Fink sees stakeholder capitalism as antithetical to making profits – far from it. “Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke.’ It is capitalism driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism,” Fink wrote in his 2022 letter. Most of BlackRock’s equity holdings are held through funds that track stock market indexes by buying shares in the companies that make up those indices, which is how it came to be a major shareholder in the English and Welsh water utilities market. BlackRock holds significant investments in Severn Trent, which was fined £1.5m for sewage discharges last year, South West Water, which is being investigated for raw sewage dumping, and United Utilities. BlackRock does engage with the companies it invests in and publishes a report of those engagements. The report shows the investor has engaged with Severn Trent, United Utilities and Pennon, of which Bristol Water and South West Water are subsidiaries. It does not detail the specifics of those conversations but, according to its guidelines, the conversations are about “pursuing durable long-term value”. “We believe that companies that take into consideration environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities are better positioned to deliver long-term value,” the guidelines state. Asked about the worrying reports and allegations of environmental damage by its investments, a BlackRock spokesperson said: “As a minority investor on behalf of our clients, we engage with publicly listed UK water companies on governance and material sustainability risks. It is not, however, the role of minority investors to direct these companies – this role is the responsibility of their management teams with appropriate board oversight, and as determined by their regulator.” CK: No response Apart from being the richest person in Hong Kong, CK Hutchison Holdings’ former chair Li Ka-shing, 94, also enjoys a near-mythical status in the city. He is known for working his way up from a watchmaking apprenticeship to eventually owning a factory specialising in manufacturing plastic flowers and other plastic goods in the 1950s. After that, Li moved into real estate, port operations, retail and telecommunications, consolidating his position as the most influential businessman in Hong Kong over the span of decades. Li’s self-made reputation is woven into Hong Kong’s own “Lion Rock spirit” mythology, which attributes its economic growth from a coastal village to an international finance hub to perseverance. Today, Li’s businesses in Hong Kong have near-total reach in its residents’ daily lives: from the supermarket they shop in, to their cellular provider and more than 100 housing projects where they live. The tycoon’s influence is reflected in a widespread joke that says Li has the power to divert typhoons, so as to not disrupt work and production in Hong Kong. Among Hong Kong citizens, he is nicknamed “Superman”. CK Hutchison Holdings is active in about 50 countries, employing more than 300,000 people worldwide. The corporation operates in 52 ports in 26 countries, has telecom networks in Europe and interests in Australian gas and Dutch energy. Among its many interests is Northumbrian Water in England, which was fined more than £500,000 last year for sewage pollution and is being investigated by Ofwat as part of a larger look into ongoing issues in the sector. This summer, CK Infastructure sold off a 25% stake in the company, which provides water for 2.7 million people in the north-east of England, to the New York-listed private equity firm KKR for £867m. The Guardian contacted CK Infrastructure to ask why it had bought an English water company; whether it still regarded English water as a good investment, and what responsibility Li Ka-shing and CK Infrastructure felt they had for the water system in England and towards the English public? However, despite a number of approaches, there was no reply.",Water; Pollution; Utilities; Business; Environment,Environment
2022-01-19T18:57:51Z,Unilever will not increase £50bn offer for GSK consumer arm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/unilever-will-not-increase-50bn-offer-for-gsk-consumer-arm,"Unilever has said it will not increase its offer for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare division above £50bn after investors and analysts balked at the risk of it pulling off a large merger. Data shared by GSK suggested the “fundamental value” of the business was no higher than £50bn, Unilever said after the stock market closed on Wednesday. Unilever, which owns brands ranging from Hellmann’s mayonnaise to Dove soap, made three offers to GSK, the last of which was worth £50bn in cash and Unilever shares. GSK is planning to list its consumer arm, which includes brands such as Aquafresh toothpaste and Panadol, by the summer. News of the bids was leaked at the weekend, forcing Unilever to clarify its strategy. In a hastily arranged announcement its chief executive, Alan Jope, said the company was planning to focus on fast-growing health, beauty and hygiene brands and sell slower-growing operations, with parts of its vast food portfolio a key candidate. However, investors did not appear to welcome Unilever’s ambition. Its share price dropped by almost 11% on Monday and Tuesday, before rallying by 4.5% on Wednesday. The credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday said a debt-fuelled purchase of GSK consumer healthcare division could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” of Unilever’s rating, which could make borrowing much more expensive and force some investors to dump the shares. Unilever has struggled under Jope’s leadership, and shares remain almost 30% below their 2019 record high. The market value has fallen by a fifth during the last 12 months even as the FTSE 100 has gained 13%. The company was criticised by Terry Smith, a prominent fund manager, for focusing on sustainability rather than the fundamentals of the business – although Jope argues that environmental, social and governance credentials will protect it financially in the long term. Yet Unilever is also facing pressure from another front, with some shareholders keen to see it push further on improving the health of customers, adding to its ambitious goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2039. On Thursday, Unilever investors who manage $215bn (£148bn) in assets revealed they had filed a shareholder resolution urging the company to adopt ambitious targets to increase the share of healthy foods in its sales. The UK’s largest local government pension fund, the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, was among the investors backing the resolution, which will be voted on at Unilever’s next annual meeting. Other backers include the pan-European asset manager Candriam, the Dutch asset manager actiam, the US healthcare provider Trinity Health and the British asset manager CCLA. Ignacio Vazquez, a senior manager of healthy markets at ShareAction, a campaign group which helped to coordinate the resolution, said: “Unilever has long been a sustainability leader. Some even criticise it for being too focused on the environmental, social and governance [ESG] issues. Yet the health profile of the food and drink products it sells remains a blind spot. This is surprising, as the rapid growth of regulation means that health is a critical ESG issue presenting a real financial threat to its business.” In its statement on Wednesday, Unilever said: “We note the recently shared financial assumptions from the current owners of GSK consumer healthcare and have determined that it does not change our view on fundamental value. Accordingly, we will not increase our offer above £50bn.” GSK said on the weekend that the £50bn bid “fundamentally undervalued” the business, suggesting a merger with Unilever would be unlikely. Unilever added that was “committed to maintaining strict financial discipline to ensure that acquisitions create value for our shareholders”, rather than chasing market share at the expense of profitability. Jope on Monday characterised the approach as “improving the quality of Unilever, not necessarily the size of Unilever.”",Unilever; GSK; Mergers and acquisitions; Pharmaceuticals industry; Business,Business
2022-05-22T22:10:44Z,HSBC suspends head of responsible investing who called climate warnings ‘shrill’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/hsbc-suspends-head-of-responsible-investing-who-called-climate-warnings-shrill,"HSBC has suspended a senior banker after he referred to climate crisis warnings as “unsubstantiated” and “shrill” during a conference speech that has since been denounced by the lender’s chief executive. Stuart Kirk, who has been HSBC’s head of responsible investing since last July, will remain suspended until the bank completes an internal investigation into the matter. HSBC came under pressure to fire Kirk after he gave a presentation in London entitled “why investors need not worry about climate risk”, in which he made light of major flooding risks, and complained about having to spend time “looking at something that’s going to happen in 20 or 30 years”. HSBC declined to comment on Kirk’s suspension, which was first reported by the Financial Times. Kirk did not respond to requests to comment sent via LinkedIn or Twitter. Kirk’s presentation controversially included slides that said “Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong”, while referring to comments made by officials at the UN and Bank of England, who have tried to raise the alarm over global heating. “Human beings have been fantastic at adapting to change, adapting to climate emergencies, and we will continue to do so,” Kirk told attenders at the Financial Times’ Moral Money conference on Thursday. “Who cares if Miami is six metres underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that’s a really nice place.” His comments have sparked a public relations controversy for the bank, which has struggled to burnish its green credentials, despite pledges to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It prompted bosses, including HSBC’s chief executive Noel Quinn, to denounce Kirk’s comments, insisting that they did not reflect the bank’s views on the climate crisis. “I do not agree – at all – with the remarks made at last week’s FT Moral Money Summit,” Quinn said in a LinkedIn post on Saturday. “They are inconsistent with HSBC’s strategy and do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC or HSBC Asset Management. Our ambition is to be the leading bank supporting the global economy in the transition to net zero.” “We have a lot of work to do, and I am determined that our team won’t be distracted by last week’s comments,” Quinn added. Climate activists welcomed Kirk’s suspension but said HSBC had questions to answer about the extent to which Kirk’s views were known or supported within the bank. “Kirk might be on his way out, but this opens up a new can of worms for HSBC,” Beau O’Sullivan, a senior campaigner for the Bank on our Future campaign, said. “The bank must now explain how such offensive and inaccurate comments were signed off, to what extent other senior execs share Kirk’s views, and what sort of culture HSBC is breeding that allowed the comments to pass unchallenged. “More broadly, this is another massive smirch on HSBC’s reputation on climate which it’s been at pains to burnish recently,” O’Sullivan said. “Investors, customers, and regulators should rightly question and scrutinise the bank’s promises on climate, including its upcoming oil and gas policy, not forgetting that HSBC is facing potential action by the advertising regulator over greenwashing.” Kirk, a former editor of the Financial Times’s Lex column, was appointed head of responsible investing in July 2021, putting him in charge of a team responsible for analysing environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks that could affect the asset management arm’s investments. His team was also charge of helping develop new green products for customers.",Banking; Climate crisis; HSBC; Environment; Business; Miami; Miami; Flooding; World news,Business
2023-06-02T12:00:03Z,The multinational companies that industrialised the Amazon rainforest,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/02/the-multinational-companies-that-industrialised-the-amazon-rainforest,"A handful of global giants dominate the industrialisation of the Amazon rainforest, extracting tens of billions of dollars of raw materials every year, according to an analysis that highlights how much value is being sucked out of the region with relatively little going back in. But even as the pace of deforestation hits record highs while standards of living in the Amazon are among the lowest in Brazil, the true scale of extraction remains unknown, with basic details about cattle ranching, logging and mining hard to establish despite efforts to ban commodities linked to its destruction. From the world’s largest iron ore mine to a ranching industry that slaughters more than 6 million animals a year, the Guardian analysis – carried out as part of a joint project with Forbidden Stories to mark the anniversary of the killings of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips – shows how the world’s most biodiverse land is now also a home to industrial powerhouses. The firms are sources of economic growth and employment for the communities and for the country. But they are operating in an environment – the world’s largest rainforest and a critical carbon sink – that presents unusual challenges. These companies’ commitments to Amazon restoration vary enormously. If their operations can be consolidated and made more transparent and accountable, they have the financial power to be part of the solution for the rainforest, rather than the problem – as some have been until now. This is essential because the degradation of the Amazon is approaching a tipping point, after which the forest will start to dry up and lose its globally important function as a climate regulator. Using company records, financial data and scientific studies, the Guardian has tried to establish the value of goods that are commonly extracted from the Brazilian Amazon, including through gold, iron ore and bauxite mining, cattle ranching, soy farming, pulp production and the logging industry. Mining and meat In terms of revenue, one company stands head and shoulders above the others: since 2010, the Brazilian mining company Vale has extracted more than 4bn tonnes of iron ore from Carajás mine, in the state of Pará, worth $220bn (£176bn), according to the analysis. Pará is also home to Alunorte, the biggest aluminium refinery outside China, generating about $15.3bn in revenue since 2014 for the Norwegian mining firm Norsk Hydro, which is part-owned by the Norwegian government. Alcoa and MRN lag behind these vast numbers, but they too are realising large revenues. Alcoa, a Pittsburgh company that has only recently moved into the Amazon, does not release figures that are easily interpretable. MRN, a subsidiary of Vale, has produced bauxite ore worth $8.3bn since 2013 from its operation in Pará. The mining sector, by far the most financially lucrative Amazon activity, includes many small firms, with more than $4.2bn of gold extracted between 2018 and 2022 by artisan producers, according to analysis of figures provided by Refinitiv, part of the London Stock Exchange Group. But the lion’s share goes to the big companies at the top. Maurício Angelo, the founder of the Mining Observatory, notes that the area occupied by legal industrial mining in Brazil has grown sevenfold since 1985. He says this expansion brings huge environmental liabilities, including infrastructure (roads, hydroelectric plants, ports, railroads.) as well as the removal of traditional peoples, and the threat of disaster. Overall, he says, the industry has never lived up to its claims of sustainability. “Mining did not deliver the development it promised and confined cities and entire regions to underdevelopment, with very low quality of life, few and precarious jobs, with huge environmental liabilities and almost no practical return for society.” Vale says it is aware that as a company it has a responsibility to “contribute to socioeconomic development and establish relationships of respect and trust in the territories where it is present”. It says it has invested more than 1bn Brazilian reais (about $200m) over the last decade in protection, research, territorial development and cultural incentive actions in the Amazon. The beef industry is far smaller than the mining sector in terms of economic value, though not in impact and footprint. Data is hard to find, but according to the Guardian’s analysis, cattle slaughtered in the Amazon by JBS were worth about $5bn in 2016 while they were still in Brazil, while JBS’s closest competitors, Minerva and Marfrig, processed about $600m and $1bn’s worth respectively. The value fell dramatically in 2022, largely because of exchange rate fluctuations, to $3.9bn for JBS, $547m for Minerva and $709m for Marfrig. But this is just the value of the beef coming out of the slaughterhouse; far more value will be added further along the complex supply chain, and by an overwhelming margin the economic value of this industry is being realised outside Brazil, on dinner plates at restaurants in Beijing and New York. Paulo Barreto, senior researcher with the Brazilian research institute Imazon told the Guardian: “Although major beef supply companies, including meatpackers, supermarkets and financial institutions, have pledged to decouple from deforestation, the sector has not done all that it should.” He argued that the combination of irresponsible behaviour by some private companies with “the dismantling of public conservation and indigenous policies in the past four years led to a twofold increase in deforestation rates in the region compared to the previous ten years average.” Ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions after land grabbing, with which it is often closely associated. By 2018, the Brazilian Amazon had lost 741,759 sq km (about 286,000 sq miles) of its original forest cover, mainly due to agricultural expansion. This accelerated during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, when forest clearance increased by 59.5%, the fastest rate since at least 1988. More than 2bn trees were cut or burned. JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, has been urged to use its commercial strength to improve environmental and social governance in the Amazon. The last story by Phillips published in the Guardian was a report about a 65% increase in JBS profits in the last quarter of 2020. The story quoted Mauro Armelin, of Friends of the Earth, observing that the results meant the firm had “plenty of money to spend in removing illegal deforestation from its Amazon supply chain”. JBS has promised to do this by 2025, but it has made no commitment to restitution for the damage its operations have already caused. JBS disagreed with the Guardian’s analysis but declined to comment. Soya and pulp The soya sector is another powerhouse in the region. Between 2014 and 2020, five multinational food companies – Bunge, Cargill, ADM, Amaggi and Louis Dreyfus – extracted soya worth $18bn on global markets, according to the analysis. The major players have all signed a moratorium to halt deforestation. Palm oil and pulp production are also growing industries in the Brazilian Amazon. The Brazilian paper maker Suzano produced about $5bn of eucalyptus pulp between 2018 and 2022, according to the analysis. Brasil Biofuels is established entirely in the Amazon, and had revenues in 2022 of about $305m. Agropalma, another biofuel giant, operates mainly in the Amazonian state of Pará and had revenues of about $284m in 2021 and $468m in 2022, with plans to increase production by 50% by 2025. The companies involved in these activities all claim they are part of the Amazon solution because they only plant on land that was degraded more than 10 years ago. “We have a regenerative business model,” says Suzano, adding that it plants more than 1.2m trees a day and only harvests what it plants. There is plenty that it is not possible to quantify or measure. The analysis does not include the corporations providing services – the giant seed tech companies, or the construction companies building roads and houses, the hydropower companies and heavy machinery producers. Without measurable assets, it is impossible to estimate the value being produced for those companies within the legal Amazon territory. The timber and fishing industries have remained far more diversified, as have most of the crops (bananas, acai, cacao) besides the ones mentioned above. And the analysis does not include the most valuable asset of all: land, and the role that the cattle industry has played in converting forest into pasture. The Science Panel for the Amazon concluded that 15.1m hectares (37.3m acres) of public land was taken into private hands between 1995 and 2017, and noted a trend in which “cattle enterprises bought or appropriated forested land at a relatively low market price and, after ‘producing’ land without forest, transferred it at the much higher price of land covered by pasture”. These operations may have yielded $400m a year in profit for that period alone, states the report, arguing that cattle is the perfect way to transform forest into private property. One of the problems, observers say, is that an extractivist development model has prevailed in the Brazilian Amazon ever since it was opened up by the country’s military dictatorship in the 1970s. The World Bank has belatedly recognised the folly of this approach, with a recent report finding that the losses caused by clearing the Amazon, at $317bn a year, were seven times higher than the gains from commodity extraction. But the trend has been towards ever greater depletion of the forest to satisfy global markets and shareholders, encouraged by the Brazilian government which has helped things along with easily available finance, tax exemptions and hefty subsidies. Meanwhile, it is still often impossible to establish the provenance of beef, gold or other commodities from the rainforest, and global market regulators and trade institutions have been criticised for continuing to permit opaque supply chains. This logic, which has prevailed since the first European colonisers invaded South America more than 500 years ago, is now under intense scrutiny because the Amazon is so degraded that scientists warn this pillar of the global climate is close to collapse. At the very least, companies operating in this region need to be more accountable, more transparent, more efficient and more willing to pass on environmental costs to their customers and shareholders rather than nature. ‘Giving something back’ In response to the Guardian’s analysis, several of the companies said they contributed to the local economy, followed national laws and tried to minimise their environmental impact. Their responses give an idea of the varying levels of commitment to “giving something back”. Brazil Biofuels argued it should not be considered an extractive company because it only planted palm oil plantations on land degraded before 2007. “The business model recovers the Amazon biome, contributes to the balance of the forest, stocks carbon, [and] works to recompose the soil cover and the biogeochemical and hydrological cycles. In addition, by generating employment and income for needy communities, it encourages forest preservation and reduces the impact of deforestation,” it said. Similarly, the eucalyptus firm Suzano said it was a “vocal critic of the lack of action to combat deforestation in Brazil” and had a regenerative business model. “Over 40% of our land is set aside for permanent conservation (nearly 1m hectares), including significant areas in the Amazon, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes,” the company said in an email. It claimed its social programmes had helped 30,000 people out of poverty and generated R$79m of income for local people. The mining firm Vale stressed the role it plays in the local and Brazilian economy, saying the Carajas complex and other operations in the Amazon accounted for almost half of all Brazil’s mineral exports, and it protected more than 800,000 hectares (2m acres) of rainforest in the state of Pará in partnership with Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade. Vale said it “reaffirms its commitment to transparency and sustainable mining, promoting socioeconomic development and conservation in the areas where it operates”. Norsk Hydro said it had been established since 1905, with social responsibility as part of its culture. However, the move from joint venture ownerships to becoming an operator of large plants in remote areas of Brazil had been a steep learning curve. “We work closely with the communities where we operate. After the Brazil rainfall in 2018, we realised our relationship and trust from our neighbours wasn’t as good as it should have been, so we have made efforts to improve our dialogue with local communities. We focus in particular on enabling young people to get an education, and on improving and implementing new technologies in our operations to reduce our impact,” it said. Amaggi, the largest private producer of soya beans in the world, said it did not recognise the Guardian’s estimates of financial data because they were not based on a precise tool. The Brazil-based firm said it did not sell from areas deforested after 2008 in the Amazon biome, and that it ran social investment projects through foundations, including efforts to improve food security. During the pandemic, it donated more than 150,000 staple food kits. The grain trader Cargill, the biggest privately owned company in the US, said it had accelerated its commitment to eliminate deforestation in its soya supply chain in the Amazon and two other biomes by 2025. The multinational said it was investing significantly in ending deforestation in South America by running programmes and training to help farmers, increasing technology to improve traceability, and investing in teams in Brazil and throughout South America to accelerate deforestation efforts. Minerva Foods, which operates numerous slaughterhouses in the Amazon, said it monitored the land use of its direct cattle suppliers and worked to get them into a programme to measure and reduce carbon emissions. The company said it used the best available technology to ensures compliance with environmental and land tenure regulations. Marfrig told the Guardian that under a programme launched in 2020, it now monitored 100% of its direct suppliers, while for indirect suppliers the traceability rates reached 80% in the Amazon biome and 74% in the Cerrado biome. “Marfrig has been recognised as the leading animal protein company in various rankings, indices, lists and reports that serve as benchmarks for evaluating ESG [environmental, social and governance] policies and practices in recent years,” it said. Agropalma said it had a long history of preserving nature and respecting the communities close to its operations. “We are committed to zero deforestation: through a strict no-deforestation policy, since 2002, Agropalma no longer converts forests into palm plantations,” it said. It noted it also had a longstanding partnership with Conservation International to monitor the biodiversity in its forest reserves. JBS disputed the Guardian’s analysis but declined to comment further.

2022-05-02T05:00:45Z,‘A more acceptable Mike Ashley’: Sports Direct’s owner gets a new boss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/a-more-acceptable-mike-ashley-sports-directs-owner-gets-a-new-boss,"Dressed in a T-shirt and casual sweater with a tan and slicked back hair, Michael Murray is joking with the camera crew as he films a clip for social media surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass walls in the London headquarters of Frasers Group. As the 32-year-old former nightclub promoter takes the reins at the retail business that owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Flannels this week, there could not be a clearer indication of the change of image at the top of the company founded by Murray’s father-in-law to be, Mike Ashley. Ashley, Frasers’ controlling shareholder who will remain an executive director on the board, has a difficult relationship with the media, rarely giving interviews or holding press conferences. Before floating Sports Direct in 2007, he was so reclusive that the only photograph of him available was from the 1970s, when he was a county squash coach. Since then, Ashley has appeared in front of MPs and fronted annual presentations to analysts and the media, but is clearly uncomfortable in the spotlight and runs Frasers as a quasi private company under the thumb of his now 67% stake. In contrast, Murray posts updates on the business on social media, such as pictures of a meeting with Hugo Boss executives in Germany last month, and gives detailed interviews with the press outlining his thoughts on the business’s strategic direction. Eschewing the company’s cut-price heritage, Murray spent millions of pounds on a new central London headquarters and flagship for the luxury Flannels chain and funded glossy ads for Sports Direct featuring celebrity athletes, including tennis champ Emma Raducanu and footballer Jack Grealish. In his latest LinkedIn profile, Murray announces plans to “accelerate the group’s strategy” with a vision “to serve our customers with the world’s best sports, premium and luxury brands”. Murray, who has collected more than £33m in payouts over the last four years under a controversial pay scheme linked to the value he created from a string of property deals, will certainly be incentivised to do well. He is in line for a £100m bonus if he more than doubles Frasers’ share price to £15 by 2025. The new pay deal underlines a meteoric rise for Murray who began by helping Ashley with personal property deals a few years after meeting his daughter Anna on holiday in 2011. His career kicked off with running festivals and student nights while still at Reading University after attending Sedbergh private school in Cumbria. No doubt inspired by his father, a property developer who is Doncaster’s biggest landlord, he also invested in two bars while still a student. Working as a consultant to Frasers, Murray has had an important role in building Flannels from a small regional brand into a chain of about 50 stores. Those who have dealt with Murray describe him as bright with a polished manner and clear ideas about how Frasers should move forward. “He’s a more acceptable version of Mike Ashley,” says one former worker. “He’s charming and quite measured, and knows what he’s about. But this is a very big gig for him.” Another says Murray’s efforts are more about improving the surface image in a way that will appeal to brands rather than the world for workers behind the scenes. “Removing Mike Ashley is just an image thing. [Murray] is almost like a mini Mike, an apprentice. My perception was he is never calling the shots, just the one doing the grunt work.” Whoever is truly setting the strategy, Frasers has a battle on to keep brands such as Nike and Adidas happy without profits tanking. With shoppers’ spare cash potentially in short supply and inflation on pay, the cost of goods and transport, it could prove an uphill task. Most Sports Direct stores still require updating while there are also serious challenges to tackle at House of Fraser, the ailing department store Ashley snapped up in 2018 that requires big investment or more hacking back. The chain has already shrunk to less than 40 outlets from 59 on acquisition, and industry insiders say investment is on hold with more stores likely to be converted to Flannels or shelved. Its diminishing scale makes the rationale for recent acquisitions of ailing brands – which could be useful in a mid-market department store such as Jack Wills and Sofa.com – look like rather expensive diversions. In a tight labour market, Frasers has a way to go to improve its image as an employer after years of concern about low pay and accusations of maltreatment of staff in stores and at its huge Shirebrook warehouse. As well as attracting and retaining talent, it must deal with investors that have never been more concerned about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. “He has got to be a force for ESG improvement or he will find the pool of investors will shrink. It is in everybody’s interest to focus on that,” says Jonathan Pritchard, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt. Murray has certainly attempted to turn around Frasers’ image on staff relations, with a generous bonus scheme for 1,000 top staff – albeit with the rather stretching target of the group’s share price staying above £10 for 30 consecutive days in the next four years. The last time it came close to that was in 2014. Bringing about a real change in culture will require some tricky political manoeuvring to keep the benefit of Ashley’s undoubted retail expertise within a more modern environment. Pritchard says: “[Murray] has to demonstrate he can make strategic decisions of his own. I’ve no doubt he can but he has to cut the puppet strings without sacking the puppeteer.”",Frasers Group; Retail industry; Mike Ashley; Business; UK news,Business
2022-05-06T08:43:31Z,AGL reveals demerger would cost $260m as Mike Cannon-Brookes tries to block plan,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/agl-reveals-demerger-would-cost-260m-as-mike-cannon-brooks-tries-to-block-plan,"The planned split of AGL Energy that billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is trying to foil will cost $260m upfront and $35m in extra costs per year for the demerged entities, documents from the energy giant show. In separate releases to the ASX on Friday afternoon, AGL laid out its details of the demerger ahead of a 15 June vote by shareholders. As the biggest shareholder following his purchase of a 11.3% holding, Cannon-Brookes can block the move with the support of another 13.7% of share owners. The company aims to list the two separate entities by 22 June. Accel Energy would hold AGL’s electricity generation capacity, including three coal-fired power plants, while AGL Australia would contain the retailing arm and its 4.5 million energy and telecommunication customers. The scheme booklet lists advantages of the split such as the increased potential for a “change of control” through a takeover, a clearer identification of the individual value of the separate entities and a faster decarbonisation of operations. Disadvantages include a one-off transaction cost of $260m and extra corporate and operation costs of $35m a year, while “net tax inefficiencies” will add another $125m. The loss of “operational synergies” from breaking up AGL are another risk as is the potential that court and other necessary approvals won’t be secured. Grok Ventures, Cannon-Brookes’s family-owned company, revealed the share raid on Monday, with the Atlassian cofounder later saying he had received positive responses to his blocking move. “Fellow AGL shareholders only need to see that the risks and disadvantages section of the demerger booklet run as long as, and in our view, far outweigh any advantages put forward by company,” a Grok spokeswoman said. “The booklet does nothing to change our view that the demerger plan promotes a terrible outcome for shareholders, communities and the climate.” Cannon-Brookes wants to halt the demerger in order to quicken the closure of the Bayswater and Loy Yang A power plants in New South Wales and Victoria, respectively, while the third plant, NSW’s Liddell, is already scheduled to shut by next April. The bid is his second tilt at AGL in three months after the company’s board rejected a full takeover offer with Canadian asset manager Brookfield in March. For its part, AGL’s chief executive, Graeme Hunt, said the company believed the demerger was the best way to create shareholder value, noting it was also the board’s unanimous recommendation. It was also supported by Grant Samuel’s independent experts’ report. “This is a plan backed by real investment and a pipeline of real projects to lead Australia’s energy transition,” Hunt said, adding that both new entities would carry investment-grade credit ratings. “We have invested $4.8bn in renewable and firming generation in the past two decades – the largest by any ASX-listed company – and that is why today we operate the largest portfolio of renewable generation and battery assets of any ASX-listed company,” he said. However, activist groups, Greenpeace Australia and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the scheme booklets showed neither AGL Australia nor Accel Energy would operate within Paris climate targets. AGL is Australia’s biggest single polluter. Accel Energy may also be unable to access capital or insurance due to environmental, social and governance issues, Glenn Walker, a Greenpeace Australia Pacific senior campaigner, said. “AGL’s claim that the demerged AGL Australia will have ‘leading ESG credentials’ is the very definition of greenwashing, given neither AGL Australia nor Accel Energy will align with Paris climate targets,” Walker said. “This demerger is a turd rolled in glitter, but the marketing sparkle is fooling no one,” Walker said. “Shareholders and customers can smell the stench of climate and financial failure from here.” ACCR’s director of climate and environment, Dan Gocher, said AGL had ignored the majority of its shareholders by failing to set Paris-aligned targets for Accel Energy. “In the absence of further detail on AGL Australia’s scope 3 emissions, particularly its electricity off-take arrangements and upstream gas emissions, it is difficult to determine whether its targets are Paris-aligned,” he said. “Alignment with the Paris agreement across both demerged entities was a fundamental demand of a majority of AGL’s shareholders less than a year ago,” Gocher added. “We don’t expect AGL’s largest shareholders will take well to being ignored.” The company’s shares fell 0.8% on Friday to $8.35, a smaller drop than the 2.2% decline of the average of the ASX’s top 200 stocks.",Energy; AGL; Mike Cannon-Brookes; Australia news; Business,Australia news
2021-05-06T10:07:57Z,Rio Tinto defends not stripping bonuses from executives who left amid Juukan Gorge outcry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/06/rio-tinto-defends-not-stripping-bonuses-from-executives-who-left-amid-juukan-gorge-outcry,"Rio Tinto has defended its decision not to strip long-term bonuses from three executives, including the chief executive, who left the company following a community and shareholder backlash after the miner blew up 46,00-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. In a bid to stem shareholder anger, executives at the company will now earn part of their pay based on the company’s compliance with environmental, social and governance issues. The then chief executive, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, iron ore head, Chris Salisbury, and corporate affairs boss, Simone Niven, left the company in September. On Thursday, Rio senior independent director Sam Laidlaw told a meeting of shareholders it was clear many stakeholders felt the financial penalties imposed on the three “were insufficient and that to rebuild relationships with traditional owners and other stakeholders, changes of leadership were required to move the company forward”. He said the board had to balance a number of factors including that there “was no deliberate act or omission to act by the three executives” or “fraud, malfeasance or cover-up” against “a critical risk assessment failure going back many years” that could “be partially attributed to the three executives, who failed to recognise and remediate systemic weaknesses in the heritage risk management process” and “failed to apologise unconditionally, and respond with sufficient empathy towards the [traditional owners] PKKP and to recognise the gravity of what had happened within the wider societal context”. The three executives forfeited their short-term bonuses – worth more than £1.7m in Jacques’s case – and an additional £1m was stripped from Jacques’s long-term bonus, Laidlaw said. “Some have suggested that the failure of the three executives to respond appropriately should have resulted in the forfeiture of all outstanding remuneration,” he said. “The board understands this sensitivity and deeply regrets the destruction of the rock shelters and the slow and initially insufficiently sensitive response of the company. “Given these considerations, as well as various market precedents, the board concluded that it was not in a position to legally terminate the three executives for cause and forfeit all outstanding remuneration. “Instead, it was more appropriate that the three executives’ employment be terminated by mutual agreement (acknowledging the potential adverse effect that this may have on their longer-term careers).” Laidlaw said under Rio’s new pay arrangements, compliance with policy, environmental, social and governance measures would make up 15% of short-term bonuses. This will be achieved by reducing the proportion of bonuses linked to individual performance from 30% to 15%. “We have also importantly introduced a specific ability to apply malus and clawback if in the future there is a material impact on our social licence to operate,” Laidlaw said. Rio’s chairman, Simon Thompson, who did not stand for re-election at the meeting due to the Juukan Gorge scandal, and the new chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, again apologised for the decision to blow up one of Australia’s most significant archeological sites. “The work we have to do at Juukan Gorge is beyond the remediation of the site,” Thompson said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We must work in partnership with traditional owners in Australia, Native Americans in the United States, and indigenous people in Canada and elsewhere, to secure our shared future.” The company is under fire in the US over a joint copper mining venture with BHP, Resolution Copper, that is opposed by Apache people because the proposed mine sits on land containing hundreds of indigenous archaeological sites dating back 1,500 years. Transfer of the land to the joint venture has been paused by the Biden administration. At the meeting, Rio also endorsed resolutions on climate put forward by two activist shareholder groups, Market Forces and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, calling for it to set emissions targets consistent with the Paris agreement and for it to suspend membership of industry organisations that don’t have global heating policies consistent with Rio’s. Asked if the endorsement of Market Forces’ resolution meant that the company recognised its current approach was not adequate, Thompson said: “Do we need to be more ambitious? I think the whole world needs to be more ambitious in tackling climate change.”",Rio Tinto; Indigenous Australians; Australia news; Mining; Business,Business
2022-05-06T02:22:14Z,Reconciliation action plans can bring meaningful accountability to corporate Australia | Karen Mundine,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/06/reconciliation-action-plans-can-bring-meaningful-accountability-to-corporate-australia,"In 2006, it was almost unimaginable that mainstream Australian businesses would spend $2bn in goods and services with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander-owned businesses and employ close to 64,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. If in 2006, you’d told me that Reconciliation Australia’s reconciliation action plans (RAP) program would grow from the eight organisations that stepped up at the program’s launch to the more than 2,000 with active RAPs in 2022, directly reaching almost 4 million Australians, I would have applauded your optimism. But here we are. The process of launching, developing and steering a globally unique initiative that embeds reconciliation throughout an organisation’s business has involved a lot of challenging work and has been far from plain sailing. In the Australian context, recognition of the need for reconciliation and social justice is now a fundamental element of any company’s approach to measuring their social and environmental impact. A RAP is much more than ticking a box in annual reports. They are increasingly used by investors to judge corporate performance, decide who will withhold capital, and influence consumer choices unless minimum environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards are met. Reconciliation is a long journey. It takes sustained leadership for an organisation to wholeheartedly embrace its RAP and commit to long-term transformation. The danger of disconnect The times when leadership aspiration has disconnected with action, sparking well-deserved scrutiny, are worth revisiting. Telstra has been a longstanding RAP partner. Its senior management has long embraced the principles and actions embodied in their RAP. Yet they became sufficiently disengaged with the seriousness of that commitment that they allowed Telstra-branded stores to sell vulnerable First Nations customers in remote communities phone plans they could neither understand nor afford. Imposing a fine of $50m, the federal court described the conduct as “unconscionable”. In response, Reconciliation Australia revoked Telstra’s “elevate” RAP, and today Telstra is grappling with how to rebuild trust and credibility among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities – and others appalled by the behaviour. This is the power of RAPs to bring meaningful accountability. Innovate RAP partner Woolworths’ then-subsidiary Endeavour Drinks proposed to build an enormous Dan Murphy’s in Darwin on a site very close to three First Nations communities, which, at their own instigation, are “dry” communities where alcohol is both unwelcome and illegal. Aboriginal health, community and advocacy groups responded robustly to this plan, which was completely at odds with the RAP Woolworths said it valued so highly. In the face of the resulting campaign and controversy, including conversations with Reconciliation Australia, Woolworths commissioned an independent panel review. Woolworths responded to the panel’s findings by not going ahead with the store and returning the liquor licence. Reconciliation Australia continues to work with both Woolworths and Telstra, as we do with all RAP partners, to equip and challenge them to continue to grow in their reconciliation journeys. Rio Tinto was another longstanding RAP partner; working closely with us through a series of RAPs, including an elevate RAP. From being a corporate leader in reconciliation, by 2020 it would carry out the catastrophic destruction of Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Rio Tinto lost their elevate RAP and is suspended from the program. If Rio’s RAP had been truly integrated and central to its operations and decisions, it would have been easier to find the bravery to question the decision. In fact, it should not have been needed. The company should have intrinsically known what to do with a site like Juukan. In the end, it comes back to organisations to honour and deliver on their RAP. We know they don’t always get it right, but the framework enables them to measure, review, reflect and grow. The future of RAPs As we enter the next phase of the RAP program, a couple of features stand out. The first is that for our longest-standing partners, this project of national reconciliation has developed an animating, self-perpetuating life of its own. The leading 200 organisations are now fully networked among themselves, meeting quarterly to compare notes and offer advice to one another. They take this project very seriously. The second is a phrase we adopted to describe how we see the program, and reconciliation, evolving further: “Safe to brave.” It signifies organisations and employees being motivated by the true meaning of their RAP, to make risky and brave choices to advance reconciliation – thinking long-term benefit rather than short-term loss. It means taking on issues, entrenched practices – and sometimes superiors – to reinforce the commitment to reconciliation. It’s important to remember that RAPs are not the sole solution to 230 years of colonisation. Rather, they are an accessible and robust framework for organisations to commit to respectful relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and a useful starting point for organisations to embark on and measure their contributions to a more just, equitable and reconciled country. • Karen Mundine is the CEO of Reconciliation Australia",Indigenous Australians; Business; Telstra; Rio Tinto; Australia news; Woolworths,Opinion
2021-10-20T16:30:04Z,NSW government fund investing hundreds of millions in tax havens and authoritarian countries,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/21/nsw-government-fund-investing-hundreds-of-millions-in-tax-havens-and-authoritarian-countries,"A controversial New South Wales government investment fund has hundreds of millions of dollars placed in countries ranging from Angola and Russia to the Cayman Islands tax haven, according to allocations made public for the first time. The disclosures, obtained by the Labor shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, reveal that the NSW Generations Fund has 12% of its $15bn-plus investments in so-called emerging markets. The state’s new treasurer, Matt Kean, responded to questions from Guardian Australia saying he would a commission a review of the government’s managed funds to ensure they were “consistent with [environmental, social and governance] principles and in ways that build a better future”. Set up in 2018 with $10bn in seed capital by Kean’s predecessor and now premier, Dominic Perrottet, the Generations Fund was intended to be used to repay state debt. However, with the budget now deep in debt and likely to remain so for years, the fund – earmarked to expand to $90bn by 2031 – will effectively rely on borrowing to expand. Mookhey said it was illegal for superannuation fund managers to use debt to increase investments because it magnified risk. Likewise, the government should also be wary of hitching the budget’s fortunes to similar endeavours. “Mr Perrottet is racking up even more debt and lending it to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, instead of using it to build schools and hospitals in places like Parramatta and Penrith,” Mookhey said, referring to suburbs of Sydney. “Mr Perrottet might think the Cayman Islands is a premier investment destination, but NSW taxpayers would be loathe to take on that risk.” As the Guardian reported on Wednesday, NSW’s ballooning debt is on track to reach $171bn by 2025. Concerns about the state’s finances, including how it was planning to run the Generations Fund, worried investors earlier this year. For about three months, bondholders were demanding a higher repayment rate, or yield, on debt issued by the NSW government compared with other major Australian states. The additional cost was unusual for a state that considers itself the powerhouse of the national economy, accounting for about one-third of its GDP. Bond analysts such as Martin Foo, an associate director at ratings agency S&amp;P, said the distribution of investments in places such as the Cayman Islands and Saudi Arabia was not in itself a concern. “It is common for asset managers to benchmark their investment returns against a third-party index like the Morgan Stanley Capital International [gauge],” Foo said. Moreover, the fact the fund is set up for long-run returns means it would hold little cash and instead have greater exposure to riskier “growth” assets than other vehicles such as the NSW Infrastructure Future Fund. “History suggests growth assets can deliver better returns in the long run but be more volatile in the short run,” Foo said. “Ups and downs in financial markets might therefore affect NSW’s balance sheet in a pro-cyclical way”, referring to the prospect of amplifying the investment’s rise or fall. The Generations Fund has an objective to make returns of at least 4.5% over the inflation rate, giving its managers at the government’s TCorp a licence to be active if not aggressive investors. Observers such as the independent economist Saul Eslake say the fund is a surprising venture. “It’s almost as if the NSW government is running a hedge fund,” Eslake said. “Provided interest rates don’t go up very much, and all the things that they had bought with the borrowed money don’t go down very much, then it will be brilliant. But there’s obviously some risk that it will appear incredibly dumb.” Kean, who has only been treasurer for a couple of weeks, said he intended to review the Generations Fund to ensure it met the government’s principles. “Private investments in environmental, social and governance [ESG]-aligned businesses are booming and can be a good source of returns. The NSW government should be a leader in this space,” Kean said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “NSW taxpayers should not be financing activities that worsen the challenges faced by our society – we should be investing in solving them. “This is why I intend to commission a review of NSW government-managed funds to ensure that we are investing public money consistently with ESG principles and in ways that build a better future.” Any further investments into the Generations Fund would be made in the context of the upcoming half-yearly review.",New South Wales politics; Business; Dominic Perrottet; New South Wales; Australia news,Australia news
2022-06-19T08:30:03Z,"Strikes, inflation, slump... back to the 70s? More like the unwinding of Thatcherism | Will Hutton",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/19/strikes-inflation-slump-back-to-the-70s-more-like-the-unwinding-of-thatcherism,"This is not the 1970s all over again, notwithstanding the apparent similarities – oil shocks, recession, seasons of discontent, inflation. What we are living through is something more profound. It is the painful unwinding of the dysfunctional Thatcherite economic model, driven by credit, consumption and property prices, so careless of investment, productivity and good, high-performance workplaces. Its end started with the financial crisis, accelerated with Brexit and is now sealed by the economic fallout from Ukraine. What is not obvious, given the backward-looking national economic conversation dominated by Thatcherite shibboleths and myths about the horrors of public debt, is what is going to succeed it. With the right leadership, it could be a moment for developing new modes of growth, 21st-century business models and high-wage employment, an attack on regional inequality and a reframing of our relationship with Europe. What is more likely, given the directionless, principle-free Boris Johnson government, is descent into the most difficult economic circumstances since the Second World War – with unparalleled social distress, bitter division and economic stagnation. The challenges have rarely been so acute, the future never been more up for grabs. This week’s rail strikes are the latest trigger for fears that Britain is revisiting the 1970s and its trials of union power. But there is now no single industry such as coal-mining on which the country depends that can be used by a union for wage-bargaining leverage; there are no huge sites of mass employment vulnerable to strikes; above all, rates of unionisation have halved. This week will be inconvenient for many but the three strike days will resemble three miniature lockdowns rather than a three-day week with families huddling around guttering candles. Indeed, knowing that the inconvenience is survivable has meant that public support for the action is surprisingly high. People may not know the detail of the statistics – total pay growth in the public sector is running at 1.5% compared with 8% in the private sector (including bonuses) – but they smell the rank unfairness, meanness and readiness to embrace partisanship associated with everything Johnson touches. Why shouldn’t public sector workers resist swingeing cuts in real pay and large-scale job losses? This represents a wider mood swing. Whether it’s homeowners struggling to fix their mortgage rate as rates jump higher or people walking miles to a food bank because they can’t afford to drive, there is a widespread sense that not only is life suddenly tough and getting tougher but no one has our backs. The institutions that could be turned to for support have been weakened and hollowed out by 12 years of Toryism. Civil society must fight back. Sharon Graham’s election last year as general secretary of Unite, with her commitment to focus on the core of trade unionism – fighting for better pay and conditions – rather than the dead end of Corbynite politics, was a tribute to this mood. So, too, are the millions of savers insisting that they want their retirement incomes to flow from investments that make the world better: an astonishing third of all the £9tn funds under management in the UK are earmarked to be invested in properly governed companies committed to environmental and societal betterment – and growing exponentially. The over-50s resigning from the increasingly unpleasant world of high-stress work in their hundreds of thousands are yet another dimension of this quest for better. Taken together with EU nationals returning home, this means that the labour force has shrunk by nearly a million. As the Bank of England noted in the minutes of its monetary policy committee meeting last week, 1.3m unfilled vacancies broadly match the numbers unemployed, an indicator of how tight the labour market has become (accentuated by the end of free movement of labour as EU members). The Bank also noted that core goods inflation is running at 8%, more than double the rate in the euro area. Veteran members of the monetary policy committee tell me the auguries are obvious if unpalatable: public sector pay must and will rise above the 2%-3% range pencilled in last autumn’s spending review, if only to stop savage and unsustainable cuts in real pay. Against this background, if the Bank wants to be serious about getting inflation back to its target of 2% and stop inflationary expectations, already rising, from becoming embedded, it will have to raise rates close to 4% – and the sooner it acts the better. Recession, an investment strike, falling house prices, bitter pay disputes, real social distress, stubbornly high inflation and continued weakness in our trade with the EU stare us in the face – it’s what happens when an economic model implodes. But just as Thatcherism emerged out of the 1970s, a new philosophy right for our times must emerge now. Its building blocks are still hazy but already apparent. The trillions of ESG (environmental, social and governance) savings need to be mobilised in partnership with government to pursue great national missions – levelling up, rebasing our energy system and grid to achieve net zero, opening up space, transforming our cities, building in new resiliencies, backing our science. A  new ecosystem needs to be created to support the growth of our companies of tomorrow – it’s important that the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has just announced a review into just that – and 21st-century great companies in turn need to be organised around the pursuit of purpose rather than short-term profit. There must be a new settlement of rights and obligations at work, better relationships with empowered trade unions and serious commitment to developing our human capital. We need a social security system that protects us. The priority of the state must be to proactively mastermind all this, rather than the Pavlovian pursuit of tax cuts and debt reduction. There needs to be a constitutional settlement that embeds the rule of law and integrity in government and guarantees freedoms and democracy. No more ethics-free, law-breaking King Boris and his court of sycophants. There are a very rough few years ahead but those responsible for it will be punished electorally. The road is open for those who dare. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Economic policy; Conservatives; Economics; Politics; UK news; Business,Opinion
2024-05-23T11:00:07Z,Rap-rock beasts and drive-by eggings: Beastie Boys’ 20 greatest tracks – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/may/23/rap-rock-beasts-and-drive-by-eggings-beastie-boys-20-greatest-tracks-ranked,"20. Cooky Puss (1983) Pasting prank calls and garbled Steve Martin routines on to a delicious ESG-esque garage-funk of their own making, the Beasties’ first swing at hip-hop improbably got these former punk-rockers played at New York nightclubs such as Danceteria and Roxy’s. Meanwhile, a subsequent lawsuit against British Airways, which had sampled the B-side for an ad, paid for Ad-Rock’s first TR-808 drum-machine. Result! 19. (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!) (1986) Their first anthem so successfully lampooned the fratboy archetype that many mistook caricature for the truth (the group’s own offstage misbehaviour further blurred the distinction). From the numbskull riff to their palpable fury over their lost porno mags, Fight For Your Right remains stupidly brilliant pop – though the Beasties spent years trying to live it down. 18. Egg Man (1989) Inspired by Adam Yauch’s penchant for egging passersby (including the bouncer at New York nightclub Berlin, as chronicled on early thrasher Egg Raid On Mojo), this tale of “drive-by egging” was lent tension by expert samples from the scores to Superfly, Jaws and Psycho. The ever-enterprising Yauch even considered marketing a Beasties-branded “egg gun” as merch. 17. It Takes Time to Build (2004) Abandoning their usual polymorphous playfulness for a more austere tone, their sixth album, To the 5 Boroughs, found the Beasties reeling from the one-two punch of 9/11 and Dubya’s questionable election win, an uneasy mood expressed most clearly on this muscular agit-rap brawler, which took aim at the Iraq war and mankind’s addiction to oil. 16. Live at PJs (1992) After the 1989 album Paul’s Boutique stiffed, the Beasties retreated to Atwater Village, in Los Angeles, where they set up their G-Son Studios, recruited keyboard-playing carpenter “Money” Mark Nishita and restyled themselves as a live funk outfit. This infectious vamp encapsulates the joyful DIY mindset of the Check Your Head era, reinventing their paradigm while living out their Kool &amp; the Gang fantasies. 15. Remote Control (1998) Four years in the making, Hello Nasty was a neon piñata overstuffed with ideas, and it often struggled to cohere, but Remote Control found its power in booming simplicity and focus. Which was ironic, as Mike D couldn’t finish his lyric – expressing frustration at modern life’s maddening distractions – until his bandmates locked away his ever-present mobile phone. 14. Say It (2011) Pranksters til the very end, the Beasties’ final album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, attributed its samples to fake songs by nonexistent artists (all actually performed by the Beasties themselves). “We were on some new shit … it felt like 1992, creatively,” wrote Ad-Rock later. Certainly, the cut’n’paste anarchy of Say It was worthy of their early-90s peak. 13. Something’s Got to Give (1992) This mesmeric dream-funk – co-written with Nishita and channelling Riot-era Sly Stone – was an early outing for their newly evolved political consciousness, a sincere “wish for peace”, accompanied by a video depicting scenes of war and destruction. The doomy vibe built and built, until an apocalyptic, FX-laden scratch shredded speakers near the end. 12. I Don’t Know (1998) Hello Nasty’s defining ethos was: expect the unexpected. Its 70-minute smash’n’grab zipped breathlessly from Tropicalia vamp to gonzo Lee Perry collab to breathtaking ruminations on loss. But this was its most unlikely turn, Yauch’s sleepy murmur pairing perfectly with the high-register cooing of Luscious Jackson’s Jill Cunniff on this lovely, happy-sad acoustic nugget. 11. The New Style (1986) Much of debut album Licensed to Ill has aged poorly, not least its luddite beats and risible sexism. But The New Style still sounds like the future, its AC/DC power-chords falling like Roadrunner cartoon anvils, the mid-song tempo drop a flourish of genius. Lil Wayne, J Dilla, Outkast, the Pharcyde and hundreds more have since sampled Ad-Rock’s iconic bratty snarl. 10. Sure Shot (1994) Ill Communication’s opening track played like a State of the Union address, establishing the Beasties’ current canon of cool (including Lee Perry, John Woo, Vaughn Bodē) and, in Yauch’s offer of “love and respect” to womankind, explicitly repudiating their past sexism. As Ad-Rock later wrote, they could “actually change and learn from mistakes”. 9. Bodhisattva Vow (1994) Yauch’s embrace of Buddhism marked a turning point, which he celebrated in this spiritual hip-hop epic. Conjuring its heavy mood via hypnotic percussion, blasts of feedback and the chanting of monks, Bodhisattva Vow transcended the hokey psychedelic cliches of trip-hop to deliver something deeper. Yauch later launched the Milarepa Fund to promote the Free Tibet movement. 8. B-Boy Bouillabaisse (1989) Paul’s Boutique ended with hip-hop’s answer to Abbey Road’s closing medley, its kaleidoscopic 13-minute spree of song-fragments embodying the album’s restless, sticky-fingered invention. The whole was greater than the sum of its parts, for sure – but some of those parts were sublime (particularly MCA’s fiery Isleys-sampling stormer A Year and a Day). 7. Gratitude (1992) The Beasties weren’t interested in expensive gear – they preferred cheap vintage finds with personality. Such as Yauch’s Univox Super Fuzz distortion pedal, which featured on Sabotage and Pass the Mic, and made his bass sound monumental on this brilliantly Cro-Magnon funk-rap-rock beast. “When Mr Super Fuzz showed up,” wrote Ad-Rock, “shit got different.” 6. Pass the Mic (1992) Invention reigned during those long, stoned afternoons at the G-Son studio, an inspired Yauch building a vast tube of cardboard boxes around Mike D’s bass drum to achieve the colossal, John Bonham-esque beat that drove this steroidal banger. “We had time and space to get serious – that clubhouse turned us into musicians,” Ad-Rock later said. 5. Shake Your Rump (1989) LA-based producers the Dust Brothers had already composed most of the beats for Paul’s Boutique before hooking up with the Beasties, but the Boys brought sampledelic creations such as Shake Your Rump alive, breaking up the dense collages of funk, disco and pop with their relentless, anarchic wiseacre-ing, like a horny, mic-toting version of the Marx brothers. 4. Intergalactic (1998) The Beasties began their last great anthem during the Ill Communication sessions, before junking everything but the “intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic” hook and dressing it with Mussorgsky string stabs and B-movie robot voices. The video – directed by Yauch under his Nathanial Hörnblowér pseudonym, and filmed in Tokyo – parodied Japanese monster movies with an aficionado’s attention to detail. 3. Sabotage (1994) This one-chord wonder was a masterpiece of punk-rap fusion, sustaining its rage over three minutes of squalling Fugazi-esque guitar, Super Fuzzed bass and Ad-Rock railing at beloved producer Mario Caldato over some imaginary slight. Add Spike Jonze’s video, dressing the boys in fake moustaches and sideburns to parody 70s cop-show cliches, and you had a true pop-cultural moment. 2. Car Thief (1989) Dosed up on numerous intoxicants, the trio engage in vandalism and violence, pausing only to mock Def Jam boss Russell Simmons and 60s folkie Donovan, father of Ad-Rock’s then-girlfriend Ione Skye. Car Thief was a continuation of License to Ill’s bad-boy posturing, then, only sharper, funnier and – crucially – much, much funkier. 1. Get It Together (1994) By 1994, the Beasties didn’t just dominate the zeitgeist: they were the zeitgeist, a multimedia machine with their own record label, their own magazine, their own clothing line. And on this collab with Q-Tip – who Mike D said shared their “mission to make rap music as creative and free as the music we sampled” – they even held their own against their era’s primo MC. Over a brilliantly off-the-cuff jazz-hop lick, Tip and the trio celebrate New York, “the topic of lust” and their own damned selves, delivering an ineffable sliver of extemporaneous genius that captured the Beasties at their playful, inventive best. The swagger was justified: it truly felt like there was nothing they couldn’t do.",Music; Beastie Boys; Pop and rock; Rap; Hip-hop; Culture,Music
2022-12-10T07:00:57Z,The £100m Qatar whitewash: how UK advertisers put profit before protest,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/10/the-100m-qatar-world-cup-how-uk-advertisers-put-profit-before-protest,"More than £100m will be spent by brands hoping to cash-in on World Cup fever, but when it comes to taking host Qatar to task over its human rights record protest marketing has taken a back seat to sales targets. In the run-up to kick off of the football tournament in Qatar criticism of the gulf state was akin to shooting at an open goal. The singer Robbie Williams took flak for performing at the opening ceremony while former England captain David Beckham, who has historically supported gay fans and players, faced a brand backlash over a £150m deal to be an ambassador for Qatar 2022. Among the teams participating, Australia struck first, posting a video featuring 16 players raising concerns over the treatment of migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people. England and Wales made much of a plan to defy football’s world governing body Fifa by wearing the rainbow OneLove armband, a symbol of equality and LGBTQ+ rights, before backing down just before their first match after warnings players could be yellow carded for doing so. The stage was set for UK brands to use the marketing amplification provided by the world’s biggest sporting event to weigh in and affirm their ethical credentials. But it didn’t happen. Ad agencies estimate between £85m and £100m will be spent on advertising around the World Cup across all UK media during the tournament, but, like the England players, brands have shied away from confrontation with Qatar. Their silence is all the more surprising given many World Cup sponsors are usually only too keen to show their support for gay rights. Coca-Cola was an official sponsor of London and Brighton Pride 2022, Adidas has launched a range of Pride-themed products, McDonald’s and Budweiser have branded buns and beer bottles, while Hyundai released an ad earlier this year boasting the carmaker’s support for the LGBTQ+ community “not just during Pride month, but 365 days a year”. At this year’s Cannes Lions, the world’s biggest and most prestigious advertising awards, a record 27 of the 31 top prizes went to campaigns that had a social cause or injustice at its heart. “The hypocrisy is ridiculous,” says one ad industry executive. “Whether it be organic farming, saving the oceans, women’s or gay rights, mental health, knife crime etc these sorts of campaigns are everywhere. Many of the brands advertising during the World Cup are super-progressive, they have strong environmental, social and governance policies – but none of it applies when it comes to associating with, or highlighting, Qatar.” Advertising experts had certainly expected an anti-Qatar marketing drive. There were precedents – during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, some brands did make a stand. Paddy Power, for example, donated £10,000 to an LGBT-focused charity for every goal scored by Russia. “While a survey carried out by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising found that half of consumers would respect brands more for addressing issues around the World Cup being hosted in Qatar, we have seen surprisingly few brands take the opportunity to do so,” said Nick Breen, a partner at the law firm Reed Smith. “Brands want to avoid perpetuating an anti-World Cup association no matter how honourable the intentions may be. It can be difficult for brands to walk the line between standing up for their values publicly and being perceived as being the morality police by their audience.” On the field, as the goals and excitement have mounted, with the tournament offering the hope of England making a semi-final, Qatar has transitioned from being embroiled in a human rights storm to destination football, leaving advertisers to focus on selling beer, soft drinks, clothing, cars and financial services. “The reality is that fans and brands alike will acquiesce, because they always do,” says James Kirkham. “There is a certain suspended state and the world comes together. “Ad agencies would struggle to fight this sentiment. To recommend a contrary purpose-driven approach to their clients is beyond bold because it is swimming against such a tide. The strength of the swell of opinion would immediately risk ridicule or at least mean you get lost in the noisy euphoria.” The only major brand to break ranks has been BrewDog, which launched an “anti-sponsor” campaign questioning whether Qatar passes muster then North Korea could be considered as a World Cup host, prompting immediate criticism and ridicule given well-publicised allegations of poor treatment of brewer’s own staff. A total of 64 games will be played to decide the winner of this year’s World Cup, making television the biggest medium for reaching huge audiences. Fifa estimates the tournament will attract more than 5 billion viewers globally, up from 3.57 billion for Russia 2018. Brands are free to piggy back on the event with alternative messages to the official sponsors. Nike and Pepsi are both running global campaigns, the usual quadrennial gatecrash of advertising designed to undermine official sponsors Adidas and Coca-Cola. But their ads, feature global stars Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé, have steered away from any overtly ethical messaging. A spokesperson for ITV, which is jointly broadcasting the World Cup with the ad-free BBC, says that it would run TV ads critical of Qatar as long as they pass muster with the clearance body Clearcast and the UK watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority. Under the Communications Act 2003 policed by the regulator Ofcom, political advertising is banned from broadcast media, such as TV and radio, although it is allowed on nonbroadcast sites, which is why Brewdog’s posters were allowed to stay up. And UK broadcasters are free to promote upcoming shows in advertising slots, as it is deemed to be editorial content rather than commercial space. In 2014, Channel 4, which held the TV broadcast rights to the Winter Paralympics in Sochi rebranded its on-screen logo with rainbow colours and launched a TV ad campaign called “Gay Mountain” in protest at Russia’s anti-gay laws. “Channel 4’s remit is to challenge, represent and champion minorities,” says David Abraham, its chief executive at the time. “It felt as an organisation that it was the right thing for us to do independently.” However, such a bite the hand that feeds you tactic is not one that management at ITV is likely to have entertained when it developed its own World Cup promotion, with its rights relationship with Fifa likely to be worth as much as £70m in advertising across the tournament, according to a media agency estimate. But Fifa is a different organisation to the International Paralympic Committee. “The Paralympic committee and organisation were supportive,” says Abraham. “They were promoting a progressive agenda towards minorities and had an agenda around expanding accessibility and changing attitudes in society generally. It was an editorial decision we took with the full support of our board.”",Advertising; Qatar; World Cup 2022; LGBTQ+ rights; Media; Business; Football; Sport; Finances; Business; World Cup; Human rights; Middle East and north Africa; World news,Media
2022-10-18T23:01:08Z,"Coal projects outside China becoming ‘uninsurable’, says climate group",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/19/coal-projects-outside-china-becoming-uninsurable-says-climate-group,"New coal power projects are becoming “effectively uninsurable” outside China because so many insurance companies have ruled out support for them, a report has found. Recent commitments to stop underwriting coal by prominent US insurers AIG and Travelers have brought the number of coal insurance exit policies to 41, according to the latest industry scorecard by the climate campaign Insure Our Future. The scorecard ranks the top global fossil fuel insurers on the quality of their fossil fuel exclusion policies. It shows that 62% of the reinsurance market and 39% of the primary insurance market are now covered by coal exclusions, with Allianz, Axa and Axis Capital ranking top for the robustness and breadth of their policies. Many of the remaining insurers without coal exclusions are not active in the fossil fuel sector. Insure Our Future says that many of the key laggards that are continuing to underwrite new coal projects are unlikely to be able to mobilise the expertise and capacity needed to insure big, complex new coal power plants. There has also been a significant shift away from oil and gas. At the time of last year’s climate talks in Glasgow, only three companies had any restrictions on insuring conventional oil and gas projects. But in the past year, another 10 insurers have followed suit. The latest company to do so is the world’s largest reinsurer, Munich Re, which published an ambitious oil and gas exit policy earlier this month. That means more than a third of the reinsurance market is now covered by oil and gas exclusions. Peter Bosshard, who coordinates the international Insure Our Future campaign, attributes the shift largely to climate campaigning. “So far, there hasn’t been real regulatory pressure. And there hasn’t been market pressure … as in the short term, it’s still a profitable business. So we think public pressure has really made an essential difference”. He adds that insurance companies have also felt the heat from their employees. “Insurance companies have warned about climate risks for decades and have made climate action part of their public brands. So pressure from the outside I think has also triggered pressure from within.” The scorecard identifies the UK’s Lloyd’s of London, the world’s biggest market for energy insurance, as a key laggard. It notes that the organisation is one of the few remaining European insurers without an oil and gas exclusion and has criticised its 2020 coal exit policy which makes it a non-mandatory guideline for its members. Although it can be difficult to find out what insurance companies are actually underwriting, climate campaigners have succeeded in drawing attention to the industry’s role in particular high-profile projects. A total of 18 companies have now ruled out support for the east African crude oil pipeline (EACOP), including two of Australia’s biggest insurers, QBE and Suncorp, and Italy’s biggest insurer, Generali. Isobel Tarr from the UK-based Coal Action Network said the growing rejection of EACOP was a sign that the tide was turning on fossil fuel projects. “More and more insurers are weighing up the risks and can see that a mega-pipeline … threatening Lake Victoria, Africa’s largest freshwater reserve, and contributing significantly to the climate crisis, is not worth the risk.” But she noted that all of the companies that have failed to rule out insurance for EACOP have syndicates at Lloyd’s of London, “where the companies behind EACOP have reportedly been looking for insurance cover”. She said that Lloyd’s weak exclusions meant controversial coking coalmines, such as the Whitehaven mine in Cumbria, could still be insured, and called for the organisation to rule out all new fossil fuel projects. Despite the overall increase in exclusion policies, campaigners say voluntary action is not enough and are calling for greater regulation. Insure Our Future noted that the EU prohibited insurance of the transportation of Russian crude oil in June – part of the sanction regime it imposed on Russia – demonstrated “that regulators can act quickly and effectively in crisis situations”. In June, the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign made explicit for the first time that members of net zero alliances “must phase down and out all unabated fossil fuels”. But Renaud Guidée, chief risk officer of Axa and chair of the Net Zero Insurance Alliance, has resisted the call to require members to exclude coverage. A Lloyd’s spokesperson said the organisation was “committed to insuring the transition to net zero by providing the vital risk management solutions that will enable multi-sector decarbonisation, large-scale clean energy investment and expansion, together with deploying an increasing proportion of capital to support climate innovation”. Lloyd’s would not disclose how many of its syndicates have decided not to underwrite new coal projects, but said it had asked all managing agents to develop their own environmental, social and governance targets and policies for inclusion in their underwriting strategies: “While it is up to each individual managing to decide its own climate targets and policy, the corporation remains of the view that ceasing to provide new cover for these classes, and phasing out of existing cover by 2030, remains a sensible and pragmatic ambition for supporting the energy transition.”",Coal; Insurance industry; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; World news; Business,Environment
2022-03-01T19:18:07Z,"Regarding Russia, UK firms are going to need thought-out positions",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/01/regarding-russia-uk-companies-are-going-to-need-thought-out-positions,"Russia is “uninvestable for the foreseeable future”, said Stephen Bird, chief executive of Abrdn, a statement of the obvious for a fund management group. If BP and Shell can ditch long-held investments and partnerships, Abrdn can certainly wave goodbye to the 0.5% of its assets that it currently holds in Russia. The money is the customers’ anyway. The moral clarity around the moves by BP and Shell owed much, of course, to the fact that the duo were in bed in state-backed energy companies that are arms of the Kremlin – Rosneft and Gazprom, respectively. The position of Centrica, owner of British Gas, now commendably trying to extricate itself “as a matter of urgency” from gas supply agreements with Gazprom, is different. The company wasn’t compelled to do anything, but is choosing to do so. An open question, then, is how far the disinvestment principle should be pushed. Note that Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, did not distinguish between trade with Russian state-backed firms and general trade in Russia when he said on Twitter that “there is now a strong moral imperative on British companies to isolate Russia”. On that basis, he applauded Jaguar Land Rover as it followed Swedish group Volvo in halting vehicle deliveries to Russia. To pick on spirits group Diageo, its last annual report trumpeted a sales increase in eastern Europe “mainly driven by strong growth in Russia”. Should Diageo be in the business today of selling premium bottles of Johnnie Walker whisky to wealthy Russian consumers, and paying local duties to the Russian government in the process? Well, like JLR, it has paused exports, but the approach does not yet sound like a fixed policy. To be clear, non-supply of consumer inessentials is a long way down the list of voluntary sanctions that western business could adopt, or would hurt the Russian economy. And a collapsing rouble, plus the increased freight costs, may make debate redundant anyway. But shareholders and western consumers alike will expect thought-out positions sooner rather than later. Symbolism also matters. Almost everyone claims to have ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles these days; we need to know what they mean in practice. MPs should bet on regulation A glance at the 2021 numbers from Flutter, owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, might tempt one to cast cynicism aside and conclude that the gambling industry’s vows to clean up its act are getting somewhere. Safer gambling measures were estimated to have cost “in excess of £90m” in revenues last year, said Flutter, warning shareholders that “improvements we have made, and will continue to make, will impact near term growth”. Revenue from customers in the “higher value band” – the category where problem gambling is concentrated – has halved since 2019. These days the company tries to emphasise its focus on “recreational” customers, judging (surely correctly) that that is a better place to be in the long term. Investors seemed surprised. Flutter’s stiffer “play well” policies weren’t the only reason for a subdued outlook for UK growth this year (the lockdown boom in online gambling is also clearly over), but they were a factor. Flutter’s shares fell 12%, despite the group’s adventure in the liberalising US market proceeding to plan. For a wider picture on the industry’s self-reform approach, though, look at the other tale from the UK gambling sector on Tuesday: 888’s thumping £9.4m fine, the third highest from the Gambling Commission, for failings that can only be viewed as basic and glaring. In one case, 888 placed a deposit cap of £1,300 a month on the account of an NHS worker who was known to the operator to be earning £1,400 a month. In another, a customer lost £37,000 in six weeks before 888 carried out common sense affordability checks. Itai Pazner, chief executive of 888, expressed “regret” that “previous implementation of our processes failed to meet required standards in the UK” but the failures cannot be viewed as ancient history. This happened in 2020, a time when the regulator had warned the industry about heightened risks during Covid. And 888 is supposed to be a serious company: it has been allowed to buy William Hill. For MPs, who will soon be considering a government white paper on gambling reform, the moral ought to be clear: corporate expressions of good intentions are no substitute for strong and clear regulation.",Business; Aberdeen Asset Management; Diageo; Food & drink industry; Gambling; Society; William Hill; Centrica; BP; Shell; Russia; International trade; Economics; Energy industry; Oil; Global economy; Oil and gas companies,Business
2022-12-07T16:45:07Z,BlackRock CEO faces call to step down amid claims of hypocrisy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/07/blackrock-ceo-faces-call-to-step-down-amid-claims-of-hypocrisy,"Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and one of the most vocal supporters of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investment principles, is facing pressure from an activist hedge fund to step down amid claims of hypocrisy. London-based Bluebell Capital Partners, a $250m hedge fund, took aim at Fink and BlackRock on Tuesday, claiming the firm’s ESG strategy was inconsistent and had “alienated clients and attracted an undesired level of negative publicity”. “The contradictions and apparent hypocrisy of BlackRock’s actions have … politicised the ESG debate,” Bluebell wrote in a letter. “The reputational damage of being dragged into this politically charged debate, in our view, is very significant because it calls into question the independence of BlackRock as an asset manager.” According to Bluebell, which holds a 0.01% stake in BlackRock, the asset giant has not gone far enough to detach itself from fossil fuel investments in pursuit of its ESG goals, and Fink has become a target of environmental and human rights campaign groups. “Fink clearly has political ambitions because it is not his job as chief executive of BlackRock to dictate energy policy,” Bluebell chief investment officer, Giuseppe Bivona, told Reuters. Bluebell’s criticism of BlackRock focuses on commitments to invest in companies – including Glencore – that mine coal for energy production, and BlackRock’s refusal to support their campaign to prevent a Belgian chemical company called Solvay from dumping soda ash into the Mediterranean. A BlackRock spokesperson said that the company did not “support” Bluebell’s campaigns because it does “not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients”. Bluebell has been involved in previous skirmishes. Last year, it followed powerhouse investor Elliott Management in demanding that GlaxoSmithKline’s chief officer, Emma Walmsley, reapply for her job and launch a search for new leadership after taking a stake in the company. Fink has been an outspoken supporter of ESG investing, a stance that has put him and BlackRock in political cross-hairs. Over the summer, 19 conservative US state attorney generals accused Fink and BlackRock of violating their fiduciary duties and of sacrificing returns to advance the company’s net zero carbon emissions agenda. Last week, Florida said it would pull $2bn in state pension funds from the asset giant. “I think stakeholder capitalism is not political or woke – I just think it’s capitalism,” Fink told a New York Times conference last week.",Business; Hedge funds; Environment,Business
2023-07-10T12:06:00Z,‘Jo Whiley said we were laid-back – I thought “No!”’ How Hot Chip made Over and Over ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/10/jo-wiley-said-we-were-laid-back-i-thought-no-how-hot-chip-made-over-and-over,"Alexis Taylor – songwriter/producer/singer Hot Chip was just a duo in the beginning. Joe [Goddard] and I met at Elliott School in Putney in 1991, when I was 11, and bonded over making music. We performed covers – Pavement, the Velvet Underground – at school and started writing and recording our own songs on Joe’s 4-track tape recorder. We listened to alt-country artists, such as Will Oldham and Smog, and to dance music, R&amp;B and pop from the US, productions by the Neptunes and Timbaland and tried to make something of our own that was a weird hybrid. When we finished university, we carried on making music. In the evenings, I’d go to Joe’s parents’ house in Fulham. We recorded our first album, Coming on Strong, which came out in 2004 on Moshi Moshi, in Joe’s bedroom, using a computer, Cubase, a couple of keyboards, guitars and bongos. Over and Over was a song we were working on for our second album The Warning. We felt pressure because we’d signed to EMI, a major label. Joe had moved into a converted church in Camden with Felix [Martin] and they had a big open-plan living room. We used the same equipment we had for Coming on Strong – quite limited. I had a cheap pink Encore guitar that never stayed in tune. But we made do, because we were excited by making music. When you’re reaching for something at the beginning and don’t know “the rules”, you experiment and have fun. I didn’t have any words for Over and Over written in advance. Joe had the percussion loop of the song. Felix played the distorted bass line. We were jamming and my words were a response to the groove. Joy in Repetition is a Prince song so I borrowed the phrase. I’m singing about the “joy in repetition” I could sense Joe was feeling in making minimal, repetitive dance music – which was fairly new to us – and I was saying, “I’m really with you when that joy is in you.” At the time, I was frustrated that whatever we tried to do, it sounded gentle. Jo Whiley played one of our songs on the radio and said, “With chilled out, laid-back beats, it’s Hot Chip.” I thought, “No, we don’t want to sound chilled out and laid-back!” so the line in the song, “Laid-back, we’ll give you laid-back” was a tongue-in-cheek way of saying, “Here’s something a bit tougher.” We played Over and Over live for a year before it was released and it always went down well with crowds. It was a life-changing song. It didn’t do well in terms of chart positions but it always got a reaction. The NME made it Single of the Year in 2006 – we felt validated. We were definitely lifted up by its success – we were recognised by people and taken more seriously. People understood what we were trying to do. Joe Goddard – songwriter/producer/singer We were incredibly happy with our first album, but the response in the press was that we were weird white funksters making a bizarre bedroom version of R&amp;B. We were determined to step things up into something more powerful. After living with my dad in Fulham, I was super-excited to move into an amazing new place with Felix, next to the Lord Stanley pub on Camden Park Road. The landlord said “This place will be perfect for band rehearsals – look at all this space.” But after five minutes of the first rehearsal, we got a phone call from an Australian lady who lived upstairs, who had just had a baby, so that kiboshed that idea. I set my desktop computer up in a corner and that’s where I started making the music for Over and Over. I don’t think my partner, Celia, and Felix’s partner, Louise, were very happy about me constantly sitting there making what I thought were “banging beats”. It was our kitchen, sitting room and where our telly was. I was obsessed with LCD Soundsystem and ESG – that stuff was the starting point for Over and Over. The bassline’s rhythm was directly taken from Dance by ESG. We used to go to the Early Learning Centre to buy percussion instruments, like a kids’ xylophone that cost a fiver, and a kids’ set of silver cymbals, which we used as the main hi-hat on Over and Over. We used whatever was at our fingertips. Because Alexis worked at [independent record label] Domino, we’d been allowed to do a remix of Franz Ferdinand’s Take Me Out – I nicked the kick-drum sound and put it in the track. Alexis often walks in and writes words quickly over an instrumental I’ve made. He responds to the energy in the room. He wrote the lyrics in a day. I couldn’t understand his obsession with Prince to begin with, though – I just thought of Prince as a strange, sex-obsessed dwarf. We were mega-excited about the song. I played it at a DJ set in London, and I saw ears pricking up and people moving. I had a sense of “Oh my God, we’ve done something we can be proud of.” We played support tours for Mylo, Goldfrapp and some big bands, and Over and Over was always our biggest song. It’s still a set highlight. In terms of home recording, we were ahead of the curve. It was seen as strange to make pop, R&amp;B, or hip-hop-influenced music from a home computer. But that’s become the norm now. As a young musician, you think you need the seal of approval of going into a professional studio. But doing something that’s unique and a real expression of who you are is by far the most important thing in creating music. You use whatever equipment you have in an imaginative way and express yourself. That’s essential to keep hold of. Hot Chip headline the Kaleidoscope festival at Alexandra Palace in London on 15 July.

2022-08-17T19:00:24Z,Doctors for Extinction Rebellion’s protest puts MCC deals in spotlight | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/doctors-for-extinction-rebellions-protest-puts-mcc-deals-in-spotlight,"The rain came to Lord’s just after two in the afternoon. As the players walked briskly from the pitch, and the spectators popped their umbrellas or started to scurry for cover, a huge orange banner dropped down from the top tier of the Edrich Stand. “JP Morgan,” it read. “Stop bankrolling new oil and gas”. The font “JP Morgan” was written in matched the one used on the sponsored hoardings either side. The firm, which is the world’s leading investor in the exploration of new fossil fuels, has been MCC’s main corporate partner for the past decade and its branding is plastered all over the ground. It wasn’t the first time there’s been a protest at Lord’s, but it was the first in a long while when anyone has managed to smuggle a banner in past the stewards or, perhaps, been willing to pay for tickets to do it. Protesters here in recent years have tended to stay outside the gates, or in one case, in 2008, chained themselves to them. It was all very polite. The man and woman behind it, Chris Newman and Alice Clack, who are both members of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion, explained that they had timed it so it wouldn’t interrupt play, because they didn’t want to ruin everyone’s day. Which meant they were less of a nuisance than the portly MCC member sitting in front of the pavilion, who held up the game when his garish egg-and-bacon blazer distracted Ben Stokes from his batting. The stewards told him to take it off. They took the banner down too, then escorted Newman and Clack out of the ground. “They were,” Newman said, “very kind about it.” So, the banner wasn’t up long, but it didn’t need to be to embarrass MCC, who make great play of their green credentials. They released this statement later in the day: “MCC puts sustainability at the forefront of its running of the club, as conveyed within our environmental, social and governance strategy, and which has seen Lord’s operate on 100% renewable energy since 2016, amongst many other initiatives. JP Morgan is a principal partner and longstanding supporter of MCC and cricket at Lord’s and we are working with them, as we do with all of our partners, on aligning with the club’s own environmental values.” JP Morgan’s press office was on, too. Oddly, their statement didn’t mention the $81bn they invested in fossil fuels in 2020-21, or that they had increased their financing of coal production from $1.28bn to $3.8bn in that same period. “In 2021, we facilitated more than $100bn for green activities like renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation, doubled our green investment banking activity and were the largest underwriter of green bonds,” JP Morgan’s spokesman said. “These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1tn for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet. We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 …” etc and so on. So that’s probably enough of that, let’s get back to Newman and Clack. They said the people around them in the stands applauded their banner when they unfurled it, then cheered again when Clack pulled it back from the stewards after they had hauled it in. “We’re not radicals. We’re just trying to do what’s appropriate,” said Clack. “JP Morgan uses these sponsorships [and Lord’s isn’t the only one, there’s also the Commonwealth Games and the National Portrait Gallery] to sanitise their image when the reality is that they’re the world’s leading financier of the expansion of fossil fuels.” Clack compares it to the advertising money spent by the tobacco industry, and cricket, of course, has history there too, with the John Player League and the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and all the rest. “This is blood money, and we need to start calling it that.” “How do you push back against that?” Clack asked. “JP Morgan pays insane amounts of money to plaster their logo all over this ground. We don’t have hundreds of thousands of pounds to run a counter-advertising campaign. We’ve barely got the £150 to buy a ticket to come here to hang our banner up for five minutes.” They’d heard all those PR lines already. “We know they’re doing a lot of green investment,” Newman said. “Well, great, but it’s like giving someone poison and then being proud you’ve also provided a small amount of the antidote.” The same goes for MCC. They are powered entirely by wind‑generated electricity, they don’t send any waste to landfill, and their own sustainability manager, Dr Russell Seymour, contributed the foreword to the recent Hit For Six report on the impact of climate change on the game. They’re right to be proud of all that. Which shouldn’t stop them from being embarrassed about what they’ve got wrong.",England v South Africa 2022; Cricket; Sport; England cricket team; South Africa cricket team; Climate crisis,Sport
2023-09-13T17:51:06Z,BP needs a new chief executive not a slower strategy towards net zero | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/sep/13/bp-needs-a-new-chief-executive-not-a-slower-strategy-towards-net-zero,"Bernard Looney, after four years talking about orderly transitions, has made a disorderly transition out of BP. Not being fully transparent with the board of directors – whether about past personal relationships with colleagues or anything else – usually has that outcome for a chief executive. On the company’s version of events, this was clearly a resigning matter. The immediate question is succession. BP is the type of company that likes to promote from within and, with the 53-year-old Looney at the helm, the board probably thought it had a few more years to observe the internal jostling for position. Murray Auchincloss, the chief financial officer, who has got the gig on an interim basis, is the leading contender, but energy companies usually prefer their permanent chief executives to have more frontline operational experience. City analysts speculated that the chair, Helge Lund, who was chief executive of BG Group until the gas firm was bought by Shell in 2016, would fit the bill. That feels unlikely. Lund presumably wouldn’t have opted for the non-executive life post-BG if he still wished to be a day-to-day boss. As importantly, the appointment process will reignite the debate about the pace of BP’s transition towards net zero by 2050 “or sooner”. Looney himself wobbled – or so it seemed – in February when he scrapped the target of reducing hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030 and opted for 25%. On the other hand, he stuck to his original plan for BP to have 50 gigawatts of wind and solar generating capacity by 2030 while simultaneously revving up other “transition growth engines” such as biofuels, electric charging points and hydrogen. Even after the softening of hydrocarbon targets, BP is perceived within the big oil universe as a faster transitioner than Shell and positively speedy versus unashamedly oily US majors such as Chevron and ExxonMobil. But, in an age of sharply higher oil and gas prices, Exxon and Chevron shares have flown and BP’s haven’t. The stock market has rewarded purer fossil fuels producers over companies pushing into zero-carbon generation (albeit BP is still projected to have 75% of its earnings from fossil fuels in 2030). It doesn’t help that BP is perceived to have overpaid for wind leases in the UK in 2021 and Germany this year and that the shares prices of wind specialists such as Ørsted have slumped. So – in theory – if BP wished to slow its transition timetable, and be less windy and more gassy for a while, an unexpected opportunity has arisen. It is easier for a new leader to avoid the appearance of a screeching U-turn. No doubt a shift would be welcomed by a certain class of fund manager – those who aren’t convinced (whatever their ESG marketing brochures say) that renewables will earn the same long-term returns as oil and gas and would like bigger dividends now. Yet a new direction for BP would surely also be ridiculous in these circumstances. First, the current strategy was endorsed by the entire board, not just Looney. Second, the detour in February was meant to be a definitive adjustment to market conditions. Third, Joe Biden’s subsidy-heavy Inflation Reduction Act may eventually succeed in retipping the balance in favour of low-carbon investments. Lund reportedly told staff on Wednesday that BP would “hold the course” on its transition timetable, a message echoed by Auchincloss. One would expect nothing else on day one, but both men would be well advised to get out and argue their case in front of investors. BP doesn’t need to go any slower.",BP; Business; Energy industry; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Renewable energy; Commodities; Energy; Environment,Business
2022-03-01T19:05:38Z,UK firms rush to dump Russian assets amid efforts to isolate Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/uk-private-pension-scheme-russia-uss,"British firms are scrambling to dump Russian assets amid efforts by the US, EU and UK governments to deepen Moscow’s economic isolation after the invasion of Ukraine. Legal &amp; General, Abrdn and state-backed pension scheme Nest have said they will try to sell their holdings in Russian stocks, while British Gas owner Centrica on Tuesday became the third big British energy firm to cut ties with Russia within a week, echoing BP and Shell by announcing the end of its gas supply agreement with Kremlin-controlled Gazprom. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), the UK’s biggest asset manager with £1.3tn in assets under management, said it had already cut its exposure to Russian shares and bonds. It will also seek to sell its positions in sanctioned Russian companies “if and when market conditions allow” with the Moscow stock exchange closed. Turmoil is expected when Russian assets eventually trade again, as investors dump shares that could be hit by further sanctions. Future earnings of Russian companies are also likely to fall with some economists predicting Russia’s economy will collapse under the pressure. Gazprom supplies gas to Centrica, which it then sells to British households. Chris O’Shea, the Centrica chief executive, said: “We are shocked by the events unfolding in Ukraine and the needless loss of lives. “We intend to exit our gas supply agreements with Russian counterparts, principally Gazprom, as a matter of urgency.” Nest, the £23bn state-backed pension scheme, said it would “be removing all our investment in Russian government bonds and Russian companies as soon as possible”. Helen Dean, the chief executive, said Nest was making the move “in view of the situation in Ukraine”. Abrdn, which manages £542bn in assets, and the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the UK’s biggest independent pension scheme at £90bn, both also said they would reduce their investments in the country earlier on Tuesday. The managers of telecoms company BT’s pension scheme said exposure to Russia was already minimal because of “governance concerns and ownership rights associated with the region”. It has been cutting it back further “since the beginning of the year”, a spokesperson said in a statement. It holds only £30m in Russian securities, compared with £192m in December. It is understood that BP’s pension scheme is also aiming to cut its exposure. LGIM said in a statement: “The invasion of Ukraine contravenes almost every measurable environmental, social and governance (ESG) metric. LGIM has already, where possible, reduced our clients’ exposure to Russian securities.” “These are exceptional times for investors,” the company said. “This is a challenging situation for all boards with exposure to Russia.” FTSE 100 commodities company Glencore has significant stakes in two Russian-linked companies: state-controlled oil company Rosneft and FTSE 100 miner En+ Group. Glencore said on Tuesday evening it was “reviewing all our business activities in the country including our equity stakes in En+ and Rosneft”, but did not say if it would divest. The company said it “condemns the actions taken by the Russian government against the people of Ukraine” and added that the “human impact of this conflict is devastating”. Simon Pilcher, the head of the USS, said it had sold off about half of its roughly £450m in investments connected to Russia in the last few weeks. “We think there is a clear financial as well as a moral case for divestment with respect to our Russian holdings,” said Pilcher, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Morals drive finance and if you are a financial investor and you don’t think about the moral impacts of what you are doing you are both shortsighted and, dare I say it, immoral.” Investment managers have a financial incentive to sell Russian-linked assets because it could hit their returns on investment. “We will not invest in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future,” said Abrdn chief executive Stephen Bird, according to Reuters. “We have acted to reduce our holdings in Russia and Belarus.” Some other investors have already taken action. Last week, the Church of England announced it had sold all £20m of investments in Russian companies in response to what the archbishops of Canterbury and York described as Vladimir Putin’s “act of evil” in Ukraine. The Local Government Pension Scheme advisory board has told its members, the schemes for councils around Britain, to examine their portfolios for links to Russia. USS’s Pilcher said that his team at USS, which has about 500,000 pension customers, had found it extremely difficult to find buyers for its Russian assets as the country and its institutions had become toxic for traders since the invasion. “In the current environment there is very little trading,” he said. “It is exceptionally difficult to get a price on anything. We have halved our equity investments relating to Russia in the last several weeks.” On Monday, KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund, said it would sell off its 500m Norwegian kroner (£42m) of investments in 22 Russian firms including the energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft, and the banks VTB and Sberbank. The Norwegian government has also announced that its $1.3tn (£970bn) sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, would divest from Russia. • This article was amended on 2 March 2022 to clarify that Nest is state-backed rather than state-run as stated in an earlier version.",Pensions industry; Business; Pensions; Money; UK news; Ukraine; Europe; Russia; Universities; Education; Higher education; Centrica; Legal and General; Norway; Glencore; Aberdeen Asset Management; BP; Shell; Investing; Gazprom; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; BT; Financial sector,Business
2023-05-02T10:13:20Z,"20,000 Russian troops killed in eastern offensive failures, says US | First Thing",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/02/first-thing-100000-russian-troops-killed-or-injured-in-eastern-offensive-failures-says-us,"Good morning. More than 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and more than 80,000 injured in five months of fighting in Ukraine, an acceleration in already heavy losses for Moscow, US intelligence officials estimate. Most of the troops were killed in brutal trench warfare for the small eastern city of Bakhmut, which Russia has repeatedly claimed it was on the brink of capturing, White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said when he revealed the new estimate yesterday, writes Emma Graham-Harrison. “Russia’s attempt at an offensive in the Donbas, largely through Bakhmut, has failed … Russia has been unable to seize any really strategically significant territory,” Kirby said. The losses are an acceleration in Russian casualties even from the bloody first days of the war, and overshadow some of the bloodiest allied battles of the second world war, Kirby added. That includes the Guadalcanal campaign, the first major allied offensive against Japan, which also lasted five months. How were the losses calculated? Kirby did not detail how the US calculated Russia’s losses, but said about half of those who died were fighting under the Wagner mercenary group rather than with the Russian military. They were being sent into battle without proper training or leadership, he added. What’s happening on the ground in Ukraine? Ukrainian forces are still holding out in a corner of Bakhmut. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, said yesterday “the situation is quite difficult”, but Ukrainian forces are still counterattacking against Russians. ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton quits Google and warns of dangers of misinformation The man often touted as the godfather of AI has quit Google, citing concerns over the flood of fake information, videos and photos online and the possibility for AI to upend the job market. Dr Geoffrey Hinton, who with two of his students at the University of Toronto built a neural net in 2012, quit Google this week, the New York Times reported. Hinton, 75, said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field. He was brought on by Google a decade ago to help develop the company’s AI technology. Hinton’s research led the way for systems such as ChatGPT. He told the New York Times that until last year he believed Google had been a “proper steward” of the technology, but that changed once Microsoft started incorporating a chatbot into its Bing search engine, and the company began becoming concerned about the risk to its search business. Some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”, he told the BBC, warning they could become more intelligent than humans and could be exploited by “bad actors”. What else did Hinton say? “I’ve come to the conclusion that the kind of intelligence we’re developing is very different from the intelligence we have. So it’s as if you had 10,000 people and whenever one person learned something, everybody automatically knew it. And that’s how these chatbots can know so much more than any one person.” In other news … Thousands of film and television writers are to go on strike, throwing Hollywood into turmoil as the entertainment business grapples with seismic changes triggered by the global streaming TV boom. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) called its first work stoppage in 15 years, starting today. The bodies of seven people, including two missing teenagers and a convicted sex offender, were discovered in rural Oklahoma yesterday, officials confirmed. Authorities found the bodies on a property near Henryetta, where the sex offender Jesse McFadden lived. A bride leaving her wedding reception was killed moments after the ceremony when a drunk driver hit the newlywed couple’s golf cart on a South Carolina beach road, authorities said yesterday. Samantha Miller, 34, of Charlotte, North Carolina, died in the wreck, authorities said. Sudanese medics have described seeing piles of bodies in the streets of the capital, Khartoum, people drinking polluted water, and doctors working under bombardments as the battle between the country’s two warring generals continues despite a threadbare ceasefire. Stat of the day: ‘They can survive just fine’ – Bernie Sanders says income over $1bn should be taxed at 100% The US government should confiscate 100% of any money that Americans make above $999m, the leftwing independent senator Bernie Sanders said last week. Sanders expressed that belief in an exchange on Friday evening with the host of Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace? on HBO Max. Wallace had asked Sanders about the general assertion in his book It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism that billionaires should not exist. “Are you basically saying that once you get to $999m that the government should confiscate all the rest?” Matthews asked the US senator from Vermont, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats and has helped them attain their slim majority in the upper congressional chamber. “Yeah,” Sanders replied. “You may disagree with me but, fine, I think people can make it on $999m. I think that they can survive just fine.” Don’t miss this: Pearls, pregnancy reveals and Karl Lagerfeld celebrated at the Met Gala Serena Williams has confirmed she is pregnant with baby number two, telling reporters at the star-studded Met Gala in New York that there were “three of us” on the red carpet, where she arrived with her husband, Alexis Ohanian. Williams, a longtime friend of Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor-in-chief and Met Gala co-chair, is a frequent attender of the annual event to benefit the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute and on Monday donned a form-fitting black gown with a white skirt. “Was so excited when Anna Wintour invited the three of us to the Met Gala,” Williams said in a TikTok post on Monday evening. Model Karlie Kloss also announced her pregnancy while Rihanna showed off her growing bump at the Met Gala 2023. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City hosts the fashion world’s biggest night of the year. The theme is Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, in tribute to one of the longest careers in contemporary fashion history. Lagerfeld’s legacy was on abundant display. Here are some of the stars on the red carpet. Climate check: Green investment funds pushing money into fossil fuel firms, research finds Investment funds branded as green or socially responsible are being used by some of the world’s largest asset managers to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in fossil fuel companies, according to a report. The research, by the Common Wealth thinktank, showed that the US fund managers BlackRock and State Street and the UK-based Legal &amp; General were among asset managers to use funds with an “environment, social and governance” (ESG) label to invest in fossil fuel firms. The leftwing thinktank said despite claims that ESG funds offered a green and socially responsible option for investors, “the research shows these funds are significantly exposed to fossil fuel companies”. Between February and April this year, BlackRock, State Street and Legal &amp; General alone were found to hold $1bn (£800m) in bonds issued by fossil fuel companies in their ESG funds. Last Thing: Chilly willy – photo of phallic iceberg off Canadian coast prompts merriment It was a calm spring day when the Canadian photographer Ken Pretty spotted an interestingly shaped 30ft iceberg off Newfoundland’s east coast. As he flew his drone overhead, Pretty, who hails from the town of Dildo, realized the hulk of ice bore a distinct resemblance to a characteristic part of the male human anatomy. “Looking from the land, it wasn’t quite clear,” said Pretty. “But once I got the drone out there, it was unreal how much it looked like – well, you know …” Pretty’s images of the phallic berg prompted an outpouring of hilarity on Facebook, where users speculated that the iceberg would probably soon drift past Dick’s Cove, Newfoundland, or suggesting it could provide ice for the “stiffest drink”. Pretty said that the resemblance was so marked that many had presumed the image was fake. “People don’t believe it’s real. They think it’s Photoshopped and all that,” he said. “I can tell you – it’s real.” Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

2022-01-15T17:00:27Z,The week in audio: The Nolan Show; Jimmy’s Jobs of the Future; Now You’re Asking; Room 5,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/15/the-nolan-show-bbc-radio-ulster-review-sniff-test-jimmys-jobs-of-the-future-jimmy-mcloughlin-rishi-sunak-now-you-re-asking-tara-flynn-marian-keyes-room-5-helen-merriman,"The Nolan Show (BBC Radio Ulster) | BBC Sounds Jimmy’s Jobs of the Future | apple.com Now You’re Asking with Marian Keyes and Tara Flynn (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Room 5 (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds “Stephen, I use my milk until I see all the wee white bits floating around on the top of the cup,” announces Norman from Bangor. “I remember getting a packet of crisps and they were a year out of date and I ate them and they tasted as good as the crisps you’d buy tomorrow in a shop.” It’s Tuesday morning, the morning after the revelations about the No 10 bring-your-own-booze lockdown party. On Radio 4’s Today programme, on 5 live and LBC, the talk is of little else. Even Mike Graham on TalkRadio is spluttering at Johnson’s hubris: “All of you who say it doesn’t matter, move on: I’m afraid that’s not going to happen.” On LBC, James O’Brien is waxing loopily about Johnson’s psychology: “The only question is, why do people land on his hand like a little sparrow and start pecking these grains of dishonesty, what do they get in return?” But on Stephen Nolan’s mid-morning BBC Radio Ulster show, Nolan and his listeners are chatting about whether “the sniff test” can determine whether your food is edible. What about ice-cream, for instance? Does it go off? “I bought a tub of Caramel Chew Chew ice-cream,” says Nolan. “I got it on offer and I actually drove about three miles up the road to get the offer. But then I forgot about it for three days! I was raging! I didn’t touch it! The Caramel Chew Chew!” The show also discussed whether unionist politicians will refuse to go into government if Sinn Féin wins in the forthcoming assembly elections. But the sniff test chat was much more enjoyable. Speaking of No 10, which we definitely aren’t, the fourth series of the Jimmy’s Jobs of the Future podcast began last week, in which former Downing Street adviser Jimmy McLoughlin interviews “top entrepreneurs” about modern jobs. (It’s usually something disruptive in childcare, or finance, or gas and electricity.) The interviewee? Rishi Sunak. Sunak was perfectly nice, though it did seem as if he and McLoughlin were speaking from another country to, say, Nolan. “From your phone, it’s easy to look at your portfolio, make selections,” said Sunak. “If you have an interest in ESG [environmental, social and governance] investing, or net zero, or emerging markets, whatever you want to do. Make it easy, make it personalised.” As though everyone has spare money to invest, or spare time to monitor what they’re investing in. We’re too busy sniffing our food to see if it’s edible. If you’re after more cheer, and Nolan is not for you, then there’s plenty of warm-hearted joy to be found in Now You’re Asking, a new Radio 4 show in which the actor Tara Flynn and writer Marian Keyes tackle listeners’ problems, such as how to deal with a neighbour putting pink flamingos in the communal garden. Nobody thus far has a Caramel Chew Chew query, but you feel such a dilemma would be ideal for Flynn and Keyes, especially if given a personal twist, eg the ice-cream is your poorly mum’s favourite; should you refreeze and serve it to her? Their advice is funny and surprisingly touching, and the show flies by. Also on Radio 4, producer/presenter Helena Merriman has a new series, Room 5. As she made the excellent cold war investigative podcast Tunnel 29, you might expect this show to be a look at, say, an interrogation room during a war. Actually, Room 5 refers to something more personal. In 2019, in Room 5 at her doctor’s surgery, Merriman was diagnosed with a relatively rare medical problem – otosclerosis – that required a tricky operation and a long, bumpy recovery. Her life was changed forever by her diagnosis, and in this series she interviews people who’ve been through something similar. A sensitive and intelligent interviewer, Merriman is interested in what happens after the Room 5 moment. The medication, the rehabilitation, the strain. The real-life consequences of a couple of sentences said in a room. Her first interviewee was Bex, who, aged 20, suffered a rapidly worsening series of symptoms that culminated in her being in a state of almost continual psychosis. She heard voices, had seizures and believed everyone was conspiring against her. She couldn’t tell what was real. A neurologist noticed that Bex had become very attached to a toy penguin, and it reminded him of similar case he’d seen many years ago. The programme recalled Oliver Sacks’s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat – weird illnesses and how they can affect our brains – and it’s thoroughly absorbing.

2022-08-20T08:00:34Z,"Water company CEOs try to woo me, but I’ve got only one message for them: do your jobs | Feargal Sharkey",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/water-company-ceos-industry-political-failure,"It came to me while I was standing on a river bank. It was such a ridiculous, nonsensical idea that I instantly tried to dismiss it. But it was like the wiggliest of wiggly earworms that just won’t leave you alone, like a tune that just keeps boring its way into your mind. That melody was: London is running out of drinking water. Don’t take my word for it. Try the National Audit Office, which looked into the country’s looming water crisis two years ago and concluded: “If more concerted action is not taken now, parts of the south and south-east of England will run out of water within the next 20 years.” And it’s not just London – the same report warned that water shortages are an impending risk for all of the UK. Then there’s John Armitt, the chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, who just this week told the Guardian that the government’s approach to keeping our nation’s taps running amounted to nothing more than “keeping [its] fingers crossed”. And the public accounts committee, which has berated the government for allowing water companies in England to leak more than 3bn litres of water a day from their badly maintained, underinvested, creaking network of pipes. How on earth did we ever manage to get ourselves in a position where England is looking at a water shortfall of 4bn litres a day by 2050? And while I’m thinking about it, can someone please explain to me why over the past two years we have allowed water companies to spend almost 6m hours on 775,704 separate occasions dumping sewage into England’s rivers? It’s an act of environmental destruction so wide reaching that not a single river in the country is currently listed as being in “good” overall environmental health. Every single river is polluted and one of the largest sources of the pollution? The water industry. I’m afraid what you are witnessing right now is simply the physical manifestation of 30 years of underinvestment, 30 years of regulatory failure, 30 years of mismanagement and all of it topped off with 30 years of a political vacuum, devoid of oversight and scrutiny. Rather obscenely, at the same time, regulators have allowed water companies to pay out more than £72bn in dividends to shareholders, while saddling the companies with more than £50bn in debt and paying £58m to the chief executives of the dozen largest water firms in just the last three years. So, what’s to be done? From a personal perspective, the time has come for the environment secretary, George Eustice, to start behaving like the environment secretary. You see, Eustice, Ofwat and the Environment Agency between them have the ability to fix this in England with nothing more than the stroke of a pen. Ofwat, for instance, by merely issuing an “enforcement order” is instantly granted the ability to fine a water company anything up to 10% of its annual turnover for not complying with its instructions. Would losing 10% of the annual turnover, I wonder, help focus a few boardroom minds? I suspect it would. It is also time we held water company directors personally and collectively liable under the Companies Act for the devastating impact those companies’ operations are having on the environment. But there is another side to this. We, as users, are going to have to redefine and reshape our relationship with water entirely. On average in the UK we use about 142 litres per person per day; this is almost double the usage of the Baltic countries where people use between 61 and 77 litres per day. If you live in Hertfordshire, that average goes up to 174 litres per day and most, if not all of it, is coming from the chalk aquifer, the underground reservoir that should be feeding our chalk streams. Rarer than coral reefs, about 85% of the world’s total supply of these miraculous, magnificent river systems are in southern England, and we are killing each and every one them. Hertfordshire’s chalk streams are drying up, and parts of the rivers Ivel, Ver, Ash, Rib, Quin and Beane are no longer world-renowned rivers of distinction, but have been reduced to nothing more than grassy ditches running through open countryside. It may come as no surprise to hear that over the past few months I’ve had any number of invitations from water company CEOs to meet with them, to have tea, to bond as grownups, to muse over water company environmental, social and governance policies. I’ve even had the occasional invite to visit a sewage treatment works – what fun. I have declined them all. In my world, there are but two issues facing the water industry and the nation right now: water supply and water quality. In my opinion, if your annual salary is measured in multiples of millions, and your shareholders reap annual dividends measured in billions, you should be in a position to produce a plan that deals with both these issues. Just show me the plan, show me the strategy, do your job. Alarmingly, behind these words that wiggliest of wiggly earworms keeps boring into my mind. Currently, some are predicting another dry winter, like the one last year. If that happens, we will be in serious trouble by 2023. Politicians could be deciding which factory gets to have water and which doesn’t, which farmer gets to irrigate their crops and which doesn’t, and we may find ourselves waiting in a queue, bucket and saucepan in hand, for our turn at the standpipe. If that is the outcome and you happen to see me in the queue, do come and say hello. If you are a water company executive, I like my tea with milk, no sugar please.

2024-03-16T11:00:05Z,The rockers putting their Blackness at the fore of hardcore and punk,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/16/black-hardcore-punk-musicians,"Pierce Jordan’s guttural scream filled the halls of Philadelphia’s First Unitarian Church one night last October. He was surrounded on stage by other Black hardcore musicians plucking guitars, flailing their arms to the beat of the drums and diving into the crowd below. The air was heavy with body heat as attendees broke into a mosh pit and slammed into one another. As the frontman of the hardcore band Soul Glo, Jordan is part of a growing movement of rockers who are bringing Black culture and aesthetics to the forefront of a scene that has long centered whiteness. The band occasionally raps over heavy guitar riffing, “because we like rap music, but it’s also because it’s part of [Black] tradition”, Jordan said. At a Nepali restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he wore a pink sweater, a chunky gold necklace and gold grills over his teeth. “I’ve never seen anybody who’s Black in a punk band with gold teeth,” Jordan said. (While definitions vary, hardcore is a music genre and subculture that is usually slower than punk with more breaks where the tempo slows down. Some other features include do-it-yourself ethics, characterized by self-sufficiency and a rejection of mainstream culture.) Soul Glo also nods to Black culture in the cover art of its most recent album, Diaspora Problems, which Rolling Stone named metal album of 2022. The black-and-white photo of an altar features an Afro pick, along with a copy of the late writer Audre Lorde’s book I Am Your Sister. Jordan said Lorde, whose writing tackles themes of Black feminist thought, has influenced his creativity. That cross-cultural pollination is common among Black hardcore musicians today, many of whom said they incorporate Black art from other genres and mediums into their work. Even though hardcore was pioneered in the 1970s in part by Black musicians such as Bad Brains, the genre has mostly been dominated by white bands. But a new era of rockers has emerged in the past decade, and the Black hardcore scene has gained traction through festivals such as the Break Free Fest in Philadelphia and the recent releases of the books The Secret History of Black Punk: Record Zero, an illustrated archive of overlooked luminaries, and Black Punk Now, an anthology of nonfiction, illustrations and comics around Black punks. Longtime musicians are mentoring the younger generation and educating them on the Black roots of the genre. And perhaps now more than ever before, artists are using their style and lyrics to highlight their Blackness in hardcore. “I’ve been calling it the Black punk renaissance for about a decade now,” said Flora Lucini, vocalist of the Afro-progressive hardcore band Maafa. On 23 March, Lucini will host the first Black Punk Now Fest, featuring her band and others from the African diaspora, in Brooklyn, New York. “My generation [millennial] and younger have injected this new breath of life into hardcore and punk.” ‘You’re standing in a home my ancestors built’ The origins of Black hardcore are tied to spirituality, a recalling of ancestral roots and freedom of expression. In The Secret History of Black Punk: Record Zero, the author and illustrator Raeghan Buchanan attributes the beginning of rock-and-roll music to the Black musician Sister Rosetta Tharpe in the mid-20th century. With a background in gospel music, Tharpe mixed the call and response found in church services with her unique style of plucking the electric guitar. She recorded what many historians consider the first rock song, Strange Things Happening Every Day, in 1944. The book highlights other Black pioneers of punk such as the bands Death, Pure Hell and ESG, as well as Poly Styrene of the British band X-Ray Spex and Pat Smear of the Germs. Buchanan wrote that many of these musicians faced racism in a white male-dominated music industry that wanted them to conform to what they considered traditional Black genres, such as rap or funk. But hardcore and punk are also reflections of Black American musical traditions. “How can I be a guest in your house when you’re standing in a home my ancestors built?” Lucini said, referring to the predominantly white hardcore scene. The traditional hardcore breakdown, where the tempo slows into a simple rhythm, for instance, is influenced by hip-hop. Punk’s music patterns derive from gospel music. And circle pits, a form of hardcore dancing where people mosh in a circular formation, is similar to traditional African dance styles. The five-note pentatonic musical scale, which is commonly used in hardcore music, she added, originates from the Mali empire, which existed from the 13th to 17th centuries in west Africa. “Every iteration of hardcore has been propelled forward by the innovations, creations and ideas of Black music and culture,” said Lucini. The style and aesthetics known to hardcore and punk music also can be traced back to Black influences. For instance, the gauged ears seen on many hardcore show attendees have been practiced in Africa for thousands of years. Lucini, who’s based in Brooklyn, formed Maafa “to embrace the Blackness behind that music” by incorporating instruments such as the djembe and conga along with a different African rhythm in each song. Growing up as a Black queer teen in Washington DC, Lucini looked to hardcore music to help process the discrimination she experienced from the outside world and the respectability politics from within her community that told her to talk and dress a certain way. For Black youth in the scene, “hardcore was about working out your frustration of living in housing projects, being harassed by police, watching your friends die of overdose … and feeling like you’re not going anywhere because you have racist white teachers in all-Black underserved schools,” said Lucini. “Hardcore gave us a space to aggressively work out emotions that white punk wasn’t allowing us to do.” Today, she educates young Black female musicians on how to navigate the business side of the industry, such as the ins-and-outs of copyright and publishing rights, and she informs them of Black contributions to the genre. In the 2003 documentary Afro-Punk by director and novelist James Spooner, which featured Black punks throughout the nation, Brooklyn-based musician Tamar-kali said that her choices about her appearance are her “relating to traditionally African aesthetic, but it was through punk originally that I had those senses reawakened”. Spooner said that today, he’s “seeing bands that are putting their Blackness on the forefront”. When he first started going to hardcore shows in the 1990s, he said that musicians discussed animal and women’s rights, but never broached the topic of racism. He attributed a change in the past decade to the rise of Black-led festivals, beginning with Afro-Punk, which he co-founded in 2005. “Going to those shows, you’re entering a Black space, so if you are not Black … you have to meet them where they are,” he said. Paving the way for a new generation The Black musicians reclaiming the genre with their own shows and festivals hope it will pave the way for a new generation of rockers who feel at home in the hardcore scene. Scout Cartagena, the 30-year-old founder of Philadelphia’s Break Free Fest, created the hardcore and punk festival centered on Black people and people of color in 2017 to highlight underrepresented musicians. At the annual festivals, speakers discuss issues relevant to the local community, such as ending cash bail. One year, Mike Africa Jr from the Philadelphia-based communal organization Move discussed his family’s fight for Black liberation and the 1985 police bombing of the movement’s house where 11 people were killed. Cartagena makes the festival accessible for Black and other historically marginalized communities by offering free entry to those who can’t afford it. During the festival’s first year, she helped teach Black children to circle pit while they watched the all-Black band Minority Threat. “We are a family when you come to Break Free Fest,” Cartagena said. Craving a sense of belonging in the hardcore scene, many rockers have incorporated into their lyrics and aesthetics the theme of Black liberation, which Zulu frontman Anaiah Rasheed Muhammad defined as “pure freedom … for all Africans and Black people around the world”. The cover art of the Los Angeles-based band’s latest album, A New Tomorrow, by the artist Savannah Imani Wade serves as a memorial for abducted west Africans who died during the Middle Passage, with people in kente cloth dancing under a tree. “I make it a point to show people that they can embrace that side of their [Black African] lineage and still be considered hardcore,” Muhammad said. Zulu’s song Music to Driveby seamlessly blends growling vocals with a sampling from the soul musician Curtis Mayfield. But the recent rise of the Black hardcore scene has been met with backlash, including online harassment and Black musicians being removed from show lineups, said Lucini. When Zulu printed T-shirts that read Abolish White Hardcore to draw attention to the white-dominated space, hardcore fans accused them of being racist. Muhammad, 27, is unfazed by the accusations. “There’s no such thing as reverse racism,” he said. “Anyone that said it was racist does not know what racism really is.” Jordan from Soul Glo sees the backlash in the gatekeeping of hardcore music, where promoters use coded language to define who fits into the genre. “It has had a massive impact on [diversity] because it makes people feel like they can’t exist as their full selves without being judged,” Jordan said. He hopes that hardcore musicians of the future will acknowledge the contributions of Black music and culture to the genre. For his part, he shares the stage with musicians outside the genre, such as hip-hop duo Armand Hammer. “That’s how we’ll be free – if we know our history, we know our traditions and we find security in ourselves from that,” Jordan said. “And we can learn that from Audre Lorde.”",Music; Black US culture; Punk; Race; Culture; Philadelphia; Brooklyn; California; US news; West Coast,Music
2024-01-20T12:00:01Z,Revealed: far-right figures try to create Christian nationalist ‘haven’ in Kentucky,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/20/kentucky-far-right-community-real-estate-development,"A venture fund and a real estate startup – both with links to far-right organizations – are promoting a residential development in rural Kentucky as a haven for fellow rightwingers. The promoters have presented the planned development as an “aligned community” for rightwingers who want to “disappear from the cultural insanity of the broader country” and “spearhead the revival of the region”. The move is the latest effort by the far-right to establish geographical enclaves, following in the footsteps of movements like the so-called “American Redoubt”, which encourages rightwingers to engage in “political migration” to areas in the interior of the Pacific north-west. But the underlying finances of land offerings associated with the “Highland Rim Project” (HRP) in Kentucky suggest that buyers will pay a steep premium for living in a remote ideological enclave, while the scheme’s promoters are set to collect tidy profits after making few apparent improvements to the land. The development was announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, and in a special edition of the New Founding by Joshua Abbotoy, who is managing director of venture fund New Founding and principal of real estate developer Kentucky Ridge Runner LLC according to company records. Abbotoy offered few details on how the community would be run beyond saying: “Most of the leadership is going to be led by Protestant christians.” He appeared to indicate the community would seek local political influence and use that as a blueprint for state-level power. “The aspiration is that long-term down the road, 20 years from today, we continue to do this. We’re regionally focused; we can expand from there to states,” he said. The announcement was hailed on by others on the far right. But experts say that while the move reflects a longer trend of religious conservatives withdrawing from a broader society whose liberal values they reject, there may be more than meets the eye in the HRP. “Utopian communities have long been a feature of the American landscape, but this may be more of a money-driven land speculation project with a culture war angle than an effort to create a utopian project in the classic sense”, said Katherine Stewart, author of The Power Worshippers, a key book on Christian nationalism. Heidi Beirich, co-founder and chief strategy officer of the Global Project against Hate and Extremism, said the developments raised questions about just who would move there. “Is there going to be something that are along the lines of like a version of a modern day racial covenant related to this land? How are you going to impose political views on your buyers? What are the litmus tests going to be?” The Federal Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and other categories in the sale of housing. The Guardian asked Abbotoy via email whether he reserved the right to deny prospective purchasers of land intended for the “aligned community” and on what basis. He did not respond. According to its website, New Founding seeks to “build and back companies defined by American ideals and a positive national vision”, that it “explicitly oppose[s] DEI/ESG and the bureaucratization of American business culture” and targets “customers disfavored by corrosive ideologies”. New Founding is currently giving HRP top billing on its website and is described as a “real estate project developing aligned communities in Appalachia”. Kentucky Ridgerunner, meanwhile, is an LLC founded in 2022 with Abbotoy at its head according to Kentucky company records. It is the main vehicle for HRP, and owns the bulk of the land which is up for sale to buyers with rightwing sympathies. Abbotoy’s father, Mark, a real estate appraiser based in Hartsville, Tennessee, is named as managing partner on the Ridgerunner website, and Lazar Lazarovski, a Nashville-based tech entrepreneur and realtor, is marketing director. The website currently advertises two developments in the vicinity of Burkesville, a town in the so-called Eastern Pennyroyal district of southern Kentucky, around 20 miles north of the Tennessee border. One of the developments, christened “Longhollow Acres”, is described as “a rolling 550-acre farm situated six miles northeast of Burkesville, and about half a mile to the river”. The offering on the website comprises 17 lots, mostly 3-5 acres with four premium lots of between around 93 and 126 acres. Smaller lots start at $39,900, and the largest premium lot, which prospective buyers can inspect by way of drone footage,has an asking price of $399,000, according to the advertisement on Kentucky Ridgerunner’s website. The other development “the Bend at the Cumberland River”, Ridgerunner touts as having “prime building sites with views down to the Cumberland River that can be cleared (or maintained in forest) as you desire”. It is comprised mostly of smaller lots between half and three quarters of an acre, with a few larger uncleared lots advertised as “forest/prairie” properties. Most of these are priced at $45,000, with some outliers as low as $35,000 and three “premium view” lots advertised for $50,000-$60,000. Using satellite imagery, maps, and property records, The Guardian was able to identify the location, purchase details, and the potential profits that Kentucky Ridgerunner and Abbotoy will realise from the two tracts of land that have been subdivided for sale. “Longhollow Acres” is located in the hilly northeast of Cumberland County. Kentucky Ridgerunner purchased a 460 acre tract for $900,000 from a previous owner in September 2022, which was the third highest price paid for a farm tract since 2021 in a thirty mile radius, according to county property records. A comparison between satellite imagery and the advertisements on the Ridge Runner website appear to indicate that some of the land being offered has been subdivided from a neighboring property with different owners. The Guardian sought to confirm the separate ownership of some of the offering in the email to Abbotoy and by calling the owner of the neighboring property. Abbotoy did not respond to the request and the neighborhood property owner did not respond to a message left with another member of their household. The “Bend” property is located around sixteen miles southwest of that property, downstream on the Cumberland River, just inside neighboring Monroe county. There, Kentucky Ridgerunner paid almost $1.03m n to a pastoral land company for 170 acres. Monroe county property records indicate that the property was subdivided into roughly two equal halves, and the eastern half was further subdivided to include the 50 small lots being offered for sale. The pricing of lots on both developments appears to lock in significant profits for the joint venture if the land sells at asking price. At the Bend development, where one half of the land’s original 170-acre, $1.03m lot will be divided into 50 small lots, the sellers will collect $2.05m if buyers meet the asking prices currently on the website. By comparing county land records to pricing on the Ridgerunner website, the Guardian determined that while the company paid around $6,011 an acre, buyers will pay up to the equivalent of $88,500 an acre for an unimproved lot, or up to fourteen times the rate HRP paid. At the Longhollow development, sellers will collect a total of at least $2.27m on 550 acres of land they paid $900,000 for 460 acres of (one parcel which is under contract no longer displays the asking price). Kentucky Ridge Runner paid just over $1950 an acre; asking prices are up to $10,327.30 an acre. Officials at Monroe county’s assessor’s office, county clerk’s office and chief judge’s office all said that there is no zoning or permitting required for land development in the county, and therefore developers pay none of the costs associated with those processes in other jurisdictions. The Cumberland county clerk, Bryan Morgan, said that the county similarly did not require or charge for zoning or permitting. Financial matters aside, Stewart said the move tracked with the preferences of the contemporary far right. “This is typical of the far-right’s emotional need for a ‘safe space’,” she wrote. “It’s not just that some members of this extremist cohort disagree with liberals, feminists, or any number of people who don’t share their views; it’s that they really can’t stand having those people anywhere nearby,” Stewart added. “The mere existence of people not like them counts as an insult.”",Kentucky; The far right; US news,US news
2022-08-02T09:00:48Z,The Spin | Cricket must rethink sponsorship deals amid ongoing climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/cricket-dangerous-dependence-fossil-fuel-companies-climate-crisis-spin,"Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below: In 1962 the London Royal College of Physicians published an in-depth and groundbreaking report on the dangers of smoking to human health. Ten years later the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup was born – a sponsorship deal between a tobacco company and cricket that lasted 30 years. The Sunday League knockabout was sponsored by John Player between 1969 and 1986, ciggies given out willy-nilly in dressing rooms from Headingley to Hove, 1980s all-rounders battled it out for the Silk Cut Challenge, while the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups were sponsored by B&amp;H and Wills cigarettes. So it went on, in as many sports as you could mention, until a ban on tobacco sponsorship and sport kicked in UK-wide in 2002. Meanwhile, in 1958, Dr Charles David Keeling, a young geochemist, found evidence that CO2 levels in the Earth’s atmosphere were rising and attributed it to the burning of fossil fuels. By 1967 scientists had produced the first computer model of Earth’s changing climate, which predicted that a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere would raise global temperatures by two degrees centigrade, and in 1968 a glaciologist was predicting the melting of the polar ice caps. Yet in 2022, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning the world has to act “now or never” to hold off disaster and keep the rise in temperatures close to 1.5C, the UN secretary general António Guterres warning that fossil fuels companies and their financers “have humanity by the throat”, and the world on the edge of a sixth mass extinction event, fossil fuel companies are embracing sport like never before, hoping for the same glossy sportswashing effect tobacco companies so enjoyed in the 20th century. The 2021 Sweat Not Oil report found 258 sports sponsorship deals with companies promoting high-carbon products services and lifestyles. Cricket is no exception. Emirates Airlines sponsors Old Trafford; the Reliance Group, owner of the world’s largest petrol refining hub, owns the Mumbai Indians, successfully bid for one of the new South African T20 franchise teams and also popped up at the Riverside at the end of July to play a select Durham XI. But perhaps it is Lord’s, the highest-profile ground of all, that has the most throbbing sponsorship headache. The principal partner at Lord’s, and sponsor of the media centre, is JP Morgan Chase. According to a recent report by climate thinktank InfluenceMap assessing the world’s 30 largest financial institutions, JP Morgan was the biggest enabler of fossil fuel financing with $81bn in 2020-21. They are also, according to a separate study, the biggest investor in new fossil fuel exploration: something the International Energy Agency warned in 2021 had to stop immediately if the world’s temperature increase was to stay within safe limits. The partnership between JP Morgan and Lord’s, which began in 2011, is the largest sponsorship deal in the ground’s history. However, it is in direct conflict with the MCC’s own stance. The MCC chief executive, Guy Lavender, has talked about the club’s responsibility to “nurture the game for the next generation” as well as cricket being “at an existential risk from climate change”. The MCC’s environmental, social and governance report – Building a Sustainable Future – promises, among other laudable goals, to “work with commercial partners who have aligned sustainability goals and ambitions”. Lord’s is not alone in being the beneficiary of JP Morgan Chase. The group’s consumer and commercial banking arm, Chase Bank, is conspicuous at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. It was the “presenting partner” for women’s cricket, as well as cycling, the Games’ official banking partner and the official partner for Team England, Team Scotland and Team Wales. It also sponsors the British Library, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Literacy Trust and, perhaps most famously of all, hitched its britches to football’s failed European Super League in the spring of 2021, a proposal that lasted all of 48 hours before collapsing in such ignominy that the company was forced into an apology. Environmental protesters have increasingly targeted sports events, sometimes particular sponsorships, sometimes to try to engage the mass audience watching on television. This year we’ve seen Just Stop Oil at the British Grand Prix, Bundesliga and in the Premier League, and Dernière Rénovation at the French Open, where a protester tied herself to a net, and at the Tour de France where organisers were forced to spray 10,000 litres of water on to the road to stop it melting in the European heatwave. Though no one has yet superglued themselves to the Grace Gates, the MCC are finding themselves under pressure from within. An MCC member has been handing out leaflets about JP Morgan’s sponsorship to those lining up in their egg and bacon boaters and reports useful and interesting conversations in the members queue and in the pavilion. Separately, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of Lloyds of London and the MCC, has been approached by the environmental campaign group Mothers Rise Up in an attempt to put pressure on Lloyd’s over underwriting fossil fuel projects. There could soon be soft pressure from another influential quarter, as Stephen Fry takes over the MCC presidency for a year in October. Fry, who joined forces with Richard Curtis to encourage people to invest in green pension funds, released a video in June calling on the public to support Extinction Rebellion. “Disruption can be an awful thing. It can ruin the way the world is,” he said. “But there’s another form of disruption, which is to stop the world going down the wrong path, to disrupt a destructive journey.” With 2022 ushering in a lethal heatwave in Pakistan and India, described as “living in hell”, Bangladesh suffering catastrophic floods, Sydney recording record-breaking rainfall and the UK enduring its own hottest day, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter from the scalding sun at the Riverside during a one-day international match, neither cricket nor Lord’s have time on their hands.",Cricket; Sport; Climate crisis; Environment; MCC; ECB; Sport politics,Sport
2021-10-03T17:59:10Z,Labour and Lib Dems urge Morrisons owners to protect workers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/03/labour-and-lib-dems-urge-morrisons-owners-to-protect-workers,"Opposition parties have urged Morrisons’ incoming private equity owners to protect workers and ensure that the supermarket is not heaped with debt and stripped of assets as a result of the company’s pending takeover. Politicians from Labour and the Liberal Democrats have signalled that they will be keeping an eye on US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R), which over the weekend won a tense auction with a rival suitor to take control of the supermarket chain for £7.1bn. “Morrisons is a much-loved British firm which has been rooted in communities up and down the country for over 100 years,” Seema Malhotra, Labour MP and shadow minister for business and consumers, said. “The new owners must urgently deliver binding assurances for workers, pension fund holders and local people.” “We cannot see a repetition of previous cases where businesses have been loaded with debt and asset-stripped. Morrisons is a great British company, which must be safeguarded for the future,” Maholtra added. Unions and politicians have raised concerns over the wave of private equity takeovers aimed at UK firms, warning companies could be stripped of their property holdings and burdened with borrowed funds to pay off private equity backers, and that working conditions would deteriorate without binding guarantees. Sarah Olney, Lib Dem MP and the party’s spokesperson for business, said: “It would be a great shame to see local teams lose their stake in the future direction of the business. With uncertain economic times ahead, the new owners must pass the key tests of not loading the business with debt, not cutting jobs, and critically, protecting existing working conditions.” Labour has already warned it would crack down on the private equity industry if it gains power, saying it would close a loophole on carried interest, which lets private equity executives pay a lower rate of tax on their bonuses, resulting in larger payouts. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Twitter that it would “reduce some of the tax incentives leading to asset-stripping.” CD&amp;R has tried to ease politicians’ fears by confirming that there were no plans to sell off Morrisons’ attractive store estate to raise cash, and promising that the company’s head office would remain in Bradford. Morrisons – which employs about 120,000 staff in the UK – owns the freehold for 85% of its 497 stores, which has been tipped as an attractive asset for any buyer. It also prides itself on its 19 manufacturing sites including bakeries, abattoirs, fishing fleets and egg farms. But CD&amp;R has also reached a deal with pension trustees to provide additional security and support for the scheme in a move that helped the private equity firm clinch backing from the Morrisons board even before the takeover went to auction. The private equity firm, which narrowly beat the 286p offer by a consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress Investment Group with a 287p bid on Saturday, has also expressed support for Morrisons’ recent pay award of at least £10 an hour for all workers in stores and manufacturing sites. A CD&amp;R spokesperson said: “CD&amp;R values Morrisons’ distinctive business model and is committed to supporting it, including the successful ESG [environmental, social, and governance] and broader stakeholder engagement strategies of the company that are essential to its continued success.” But Maholtra said the UK government had a responsibility to hold CD&amp;R to its promises. “It must ensure that the new owners are responsible, long-term investors, seeking to build the business for the future and that decisions taken are also in the public interest.” CD&amp;R’s offer, which has been backed by the Morrisons board, will go to a shareholder vote on 19 October.",Morrisons; Supermarkets; Retail industry; Private equity; Business; UK news,Business
2023-10-02T14:00:16Z,Business chiefs who criticised Labour in 2015 turn on Sunak after green U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/02/business-chiefs-who-criticised-labour-in-2015-turn-on-rishi-sunak-green-u-turn-net-zero-policies,"Business leaders who warned against Ed Miliband in 2015 have now turned on Rishi Sunak, criticising the prime minister’s plans to roll back net zero policies. Some of Britain’s top entrepreneurs have told the Guardian that the plans have caused uncertainty for business, reduced the country’s international standing and punished investors who made early decisions on net zero based on the original timeline. During the 2015 general election campaign, when 103 business leaders wrote to the Daily Telegraph to criticise plans by Miliband, the then Labour leader, to scrap zero-hours contracts and reverse a cut to corporation tax. However, some members of the business community are increasingly frustrated with Conservatives policies including Sunak’s plans to delay the 2030 deadline for all new cars to be electricand the phase-out on installation of gas boilers by 2035, drop energy efficiency targets for landlords, and mooted proposals to scrap the Manchester leg of HS2. Leaders including a dragon from BBC One’s Dragon’s Den, a billionaire insurance mogul and the former chief executive of Boots said the plans to roll back green measures were flawed. All had signed the letter to the Telegraph in 2015. Richard Baker, a former chair of Whitbread and chief executive of Boots, said of Sunak’s plans: “It’s bad news, not only because the UK had been world leading on net zero, but because of the uncertainty it creates around investment decisions for business.” Sarah Jane Thomson, a co-founder of the cybersecurity platform ThreatAware and the founder of the consultancy firm Ebiquity, said she was “genuinely taken aback” by the announcement. She added: “It erodes both consumer and business confidence, and abrupt reversals of policy direction are rarely well-received. All businesses seek stability and predictability from the government, especially when substantial changes are on the horizon that will impact their operations. The 2030 deadline set by Boris Johnson undeniably had a significant influence on the strategies of automotive companies. These firms I’m sure made significant strategy decisions as a result of that announcement.” Thomson said the optics of Sunak’s decision in terms of Britain’s climate goals were less than encouraging. “The distinction, I think, lies in perception, particularly that of consumers. It prompts us to question whether we are a nation genuinely committed to achieving net zero emissions,” she said. “We may now be aligning with the European Union’s timeline, but we are now not forging ahead of it. Rishi Sunak’s statement implies that short-term concerns take precedence over long-term goals, which in itself is a questionable policy.” Nick Jenkins, the founder of the greetings card company Moonpig and a Dragon on Dragon’s Den, said: “I was disappointed that the government chose to push back the deadlines. The shift away from fossil fuels requires long term planning and certainty. It is unhelpful when deadlines are changed. “Every year, 1m boilers in this country are replaced by homeowners. They all need to look a few years into the future and make a balanced decision on whether or to make the shift to heat pumps. There will be landlords who have recently made significant investments in insulation and heating systems who might feel as though they have been punished for their early enthusiasm.” He added: “It would have been preferable to have a cross-party consensus on such unpopular but inevitable and important policies and an agreement to remove the temptation to trade a lighter path for short term political gain.” Jenkins said the rhetoric around costs to families was flawed, as the expense of not acting on the environment would prove far greater. “Undoubtedly there is an enormous investment to be made to achieve net zero. We need a massive upgrade of the electrical grid and a huge investment in renewable power generation. That bill will be ultimately paid by the public. This cost can be neatly quantified per household. “The cost of not doing so is undoubtedly much greater, and possibly catastrophic for our grandchildren, but far more difficult to express in pounds. Public outrage at the cost of decarbonising energy is understandable in today’s difficult economic environment but it implies that maintaining the status quo is an option. It is not.” Some said Sunak’s comments were unhelpful and position him way behind the business community, many members of which view net zero as a growth opportunity rather than a cost. Julietta Dexter, a co-founder of the communications company ScienceMagic, said: “His speech sent the wrong signals. If there was a very, very real tangible reason to push out the goals, tell us what it is. Responsible business is on a path to net zero regardless of what the government says or does. “It is unhelpful to be doing these speeches about costs. In the business community, people are no longer seeing their ESG [environmental, social, and corporate governance] strategies or decarbonisation as a sideshow – it’s core business. “It’s a contradictory message to say we are leading the world on this but we are pushing the dates out. I think there is a growing swathe of business people who have a lot of power and they are just getting on with it, and the government is going to have to catch up.” Peter Cullum, an insurance tycoon, said scrapping the Manchester leg of HS2 would be a flawed decision. “I can understand the likely decision to abandon the Birmingham to Manchester HS2 rail link on purely economic grounds, but it feels like a huge error of judgment in political terms and the Conservatives are likely to pay the price at the next election,” Cullum said. Separately, a prominent Tory donor recently said the party did not deserve to win the next election, weeks after he donated £5,000 to Labour. Lord Harris of Peckham, the founder of Carpetright, who is also known for his Harris academy schools, said he had lost faith in the Conservatives.",Green politics; Rishi Sunak; Business; Environment; Conservatives; Climate crisis; Politics; Green economy; UK news,Environment
2021-06-04T09:00:36Z,Private finance won’t decarbonise our economies – but the ‘big green state’ can | Daniela Gabor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/04/private-finance-decarbonise-economies-green-state,"The pandemic, we often hear, is forcing a rethink in economics. We are leaving behind one model: the austerity-obsessed small state that outsources the job of macroeconomic stability to unelected central banks. Central banks, in turn, worked to target inflation under a regime of benign neglect for unemployment; it was assumed, meanwhile, that the bond market should and would discipline governments into fiscal rectitude. Now, the Biden administration’s “once in a generation” spending plans suggest a paradigm shift is under way. It puts governments, through fiscal policy (taxing and spending), back in the driving seat. In this sense, macroeconomics has the potential to become more democratic. But are we celebrating too soon? The big test of the paradigm shift, possibly the fundamental test, is how we go about decarbonising our economies. There are two ways to organise the low-carbon transition: through the state itself or through the financial sector. What might be termed the “big green state” approach involves massive public investments in green infrastructure and industries. When private finance recently lamented Biden’s infrastructure plans, it was objecting to a big-state route to decarbonisation that rejects the rhetoric of public-private partnerships. Indeed, the “big finance” approach wants the state – through its fiscal and central bank arms – to simply guide the private sector by changing price signals. In this scenario, the state plays a smaller role, making carbon expensive by forcing companies to pay for polluting. For instance, Germany recently introduced a €25 (£21) tax per tonne of carbon emissions on petrol, diesel, heating oil and gas. Higher carbon prices, the wisdom goes, will incentivise producers and consumers to transition to green energy. Private finance is there to lend the money that this transition requires. The numbers behind private green investment seem to add up: there is now $30tn (£21tn) in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) assets. The green “rush” is expected to accelerate as central banks move to decarbonise their operations and reduce subsidies to carbon-intensive activities. Take the Bank of England’s plans: under its new environmental mandate, it argues that the transition to net zero must be largely financed by private finance (as opposed to the state), in an orderly fashion that requires central banks to subsidise green and only “escalate” to penalising carbon financiers if, over time, companies fail to meet commitments towards decarbonisation. The strategy of cuddling carbon financiers is at the heart of the Cop26 conference that takes place this year in Glasgow. The hot new private sector gig for high-level public employees is green finance. But the world of “green finance” has injustice and inequality built in. It reduces democratic government action to higher carbon taxes, which often place the burden of decarbonisation on the poor. Government spending is to be directed to “derisking” private infrastructure, to cover the gap between the fees paid by users of essential public services and the commercial rates of return expected by private investors. Yet having privatised public services while hiking carbon taxes on ordinary people threatens a political backlash, which will reduce politicians’ appetite for meaningful decarbonisation measures. It will also reinforce the pressures to trust global asset managers to set the pace of green investment, even though the financiers’ “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) rush is rife with greenwashing: PR exercises that stick green labels on high-carbon activities. This greenwashing is a feature, not a bug, of big finance-led decarbonisation. It allows private finance to both enjoy the green subsidies promised by central banks and to protect profits from democratic forces that may, one day, transition from cuddling to penalising carbon financiers. The big finance approach owes its political appeal to fiscal fundamentalists who point to Covid-19-related surges in public debt to argue that the state simply cannot afford to green the economy. Instead, financiers dangle trillions of ESG investments in front of politicians, seducing them into believing the market will take care of the climate crisis. This validates unambitious carbon politics, as we see all too clearly in the EU’s sustainable finance initiative, which created a green public standards system. Four years after it was launched, this classification system for “sustainable” activity is now under serious threat of greenwashing from member states that want to include natural gas and other dirty activities within its scope. In turn, European commitments to develop in parallel a system that works towards penalising dirty lending have evaporated. Surrendering to vested carbon interests is easier when politicians cannot rely on a plausible green macroeconomic paradigm; instead they are still confronted, on a daily basis, with threats that inflation-concerned central banks will withdraw their protective hand from government bond markets. Indeed, central banks worried about the inflationary pressures triggered by economies reopening are now furiously debating how quickly to allow borrowing costs to rise. Climate activists should be prepared to fight the battle against fiscal fundamentalists with a simple message: the government is not a household. It has central banks on its side, and if there is a macroeconomic lesson the pandemic has taught us, it is that central banks can do a lot. In high-income countries, central banks have bought almost all debt issued by governments in 2020. They can and should continue to work closely with governments to accelerate decarbonisation. We cannot rely on private finance to lead us out of a climate crisis it has systematically contributed to. We have to disempower carbon financiers, and we do that by making the democratic state – not investors – lead the way forward.

2022-03-03T15:38:29Z,‘Money’s all belief’: the docuseries unravelling the GameStop chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/03/gaming-wall-street-hbo-series-gamestop,"“Money in, money out,” is how Tobias Deml, creator of the new HBO Max documentary miniseries Gaming Wall Street, explains the common perception of the stock market while on Zoom with the Guardian. “It’s got to come from somewhere, right? But it’s all based on belief in the future. Money’s all belief. We believe in the government, borders, lots of things that aren’t materially real, but nonetheless exist in our shared imagination. The history of humanity is driven by these beliefs.” Stocks are fake, is what he’s saying, as in not real – “fairy dust”, to borrow a term from Matthew McConaughey’s coke-huffing trader in The Wolf of Wall Street, one of the many pop culture figures that zips by in the rapid-fire torrent of memes frenetically edited into Gaming Wall St. Shares of a company are an intangible concept that nonetheless have physical, real-world consequences in their regular minting of princes and paupers. This alchemy has long been the sole purview of high-finance types, professionals who’d have us believe that their business school educations and sophisticated Bloomberg Terminals make them masters of financial systems too hopelessly complex for us knuckle-draggers to comprehend. But in an era when a degree’s worth of knowledge sits waiting on the internet, it was only a matter of time until some normal folks realized that everyone’s making it up as they go. “Anyone who claims to know everything about how the market works is lying to you,” Deml says. The inevitable came to pass when Reddit users posting on the board r/wallstreetbets turned their plugged-in access and organization into power, an unprecedented episode on which Deml plants his focus. You may recall buzzing about GameStop last January, as the brick-and-mortar video game retailer’s lagging stock soared out of nowhere. Banded together for strength in numbers, the Redditors were pulling off a daring “short squeeze”, buying up shares of GME en masse to pump up the value before selling them back to big Wall Street firms who’d have to eat the difference. A high-risk, high-reward maneuver liable to fluctuate wildly over the course of a single day, it made millions for a select few and left many others in destitution. For better or worse, their stand blew up the toll booth barring ordinary folks from one of the fastest pathways to wealth. We are all day traders now. Deml grew up on the outside of high finance looking in. His father has been an ESG investor for more than 30 years, evaluating the “environmental, social and governance” factor of each stock to weigh conscience against profitability in his buying. “I’ve watched my father be so knowledgable about all this stuff, and I always felt kind of dumb,” he says. “I didn’t understand his job, and didn’t think I could teach myself, and didn’t even know what questions to ask him. So I remained kind of oblivious to this world for my whole life, until the pandemic hit and I had all this spare time. That’s when I found r/wallstreetbets. Things that seemed scary and complicated to comprehend weren’t just easier to get, but funny and crazy and wild. I finally saw what fascinated my dad in all this.” While finding his way around the no-fee investment app Robinhood, he became obsessed with big-fish frauds like Enron, and “how people deceive each other to make more money than they deserve to”. In the curious case of GameStop, he saw a David and Goliath narrative pitting a band of eccentric nerds against one-percenters perched comfortably in the highest halls of influence. His fascination wasn’t just in this unlikely uprising, however, but in its outrageous outcomes. Just as it seemed like the rabblerousers on r/wallstreetbets had the fatcats at Citadel Securities poised to take a big hit, Robinhood put the kibosh on the whole operation by halting all buying of GME and other so-called “meme stocks”. App users cried foul, and upon learning that Citadel Securities pays Robinhood for its order flow, directed those complaints into a class-action lawsuit on charges of market manipulation. The lawsuit was later dismissed and the SEC’s official report into the matter contained no evidence to support the claim. As Deml puts it, how any of this is allowed to happen represents “a tough question with a layered answer”. Much of the documentary is devoted to explaining the arcane physics of the market and unpacking its jargon, often through slick animated visual aids and voiceover from Kieran Culkin (practically in character as Succession’s smarmy Roman Roy). For three and a half months straight, six or seven days a week, Deml and his producer Tessa Byford spent 14 to 16 hours on the “brutal” post-production process required to render these lessons layperson-friendly without losing their nuance. “The big thing for me is that I didn’t want to dumb anything down,” Deml says. “There have been other documentaries about similar subjects before, where they’d equate short selling to borrowing a pen from somebody and then you have to give them their pen back, which don’t really teach you much of anything. Let’s stick with the real world, let’s stick with stocks, but use simple words. We had a dictionary to teach the audience, who we assume has a level of intelligence. The goal for me was to go from someone who has no knowledge of the stock market, and make them into someone who has knowledge that people working as brokers for decades still can’t see.” Down to some pretty granular specifics, we come to learn how moneyed giants can work an odious practice called “naked short-selling” to their advantage. It boils down to firms selling stocks that may or may not exist in order to magic the money insiders call “free cheddar” out of thin air. It’s a dirty trick that gives an unfair edge to those already holding most of the capital, a loophole that most amateur traders can’t wriggle through. “Naked short-selling has diminished over the years as laws have gotten stricter, but it’s still hard to track in the first place,” Deml says. “When you don’t know someone’s doing something, how are you going to punish them for it? If there’s anything to be learned from the GameStop affair, it’s that a leveling of the playing field is the only hope to start reshaping the landscape of America’s economy. The series begins as education and ends as activism, equipping the audience with knowhow and then urging the legislators to allow them an honest shot to use it. While Deml’s skeptical about whether the vampire squids of capitalism can ever be bested, he’s confident that the craftiness of smaller players on the margins will only continue growing. “One thing I learned making this is that in the world of finance, the word ‘crime’ is very rare,” Deml says. “Bernie Madoff, he committed an outright crime, but everyone else does ‘violations’. For a lot of the firms, it’s a balancing of legal risk versus monetary risk. I can make free money, but I might risk the regulator getting on my radar. You can kill that one mechanism – you make a perfect world where anyone caught naked short-selling goes to jail, and no one does it – but someone will find the next scheme. At the end of the documentary, we say that Wall Street has already come up with its next con. It’ll just keep on metastasizing.” Gaming Wall Street is now available on HBO Max with a UK date to be announced This article was amended on 3 March.

2022-08-19T11:00:09Z,How a top US business lobby promised climate action – but worked to block efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable,"Three years ago today, in a statement that would be described as “historic”, “monumental” and “revolutionary”, America’s most powerful and politically connected corporations promised to “protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses”. The “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation” came from the Business Roundtable, an influential Washington DC lobbying group whose 200-plus members include the chief executives of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple, Pepsi, Walmart and Google. Today, on the statement’s third anniversary, the Business Roundtable and its member CEOs continue to issue earnest statements about the climate crisis. But the organization is also working diligently – and spending liberally – to weaken efforts that would enable investors to hold companies accountable for their climate promises. An analysis by the Guardian found the lobby group has worked hard to protect a status quo in which corporations: Generate goodwill and positive PR by publishing bold climate goals, with little fear of being held accountable or legally liable for achieving those goals. Can choose to selectively disclose certain parts of their carbon footprint, or none at all. Are not required to reveal the greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout their supply chains – which, for most companies, make up the majority of their emissions. Make high-profile pledges to fight climate change, while paying to maintain memberships in the Business Roundtable and other trade associations that spend millions of dollars to lobby governments against meaningful climate action. In public the Business Roundtable’s leaders are still committed to change. Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart and previous chair of the Business Roundtable, has called the climate crisis “one of the greatest challenges facing the planet today”. In a statement on the group’s website, Mary Barra, the CEO of GM and the Roundtable’s current chair, declared that “we must act” to tackle climate change. “Meeting the scope of this challenge will require collective global action – business and government,” Barra said. The challenge “isn’t the lack of business commitment” said Johnson Controls CEO George Oliver in a video published by the Business Roundtable in January. “What we need is to be aligned with the public sector to make sure that we’ve got the proper policies in place that will enable us to do what we do so well.” Yet when the US government has tried to put the “proper policies” in place, the Business Roundtable has worked to undermine those efforts. In 2021, the organization spent millions of dollars to stop the Biden administration’s Build Back Better agenda, which included significant efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy. And this year, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed a long-anticipated rule that would require publicly held companies to disclose their carbon emissions and the risks that climate change poses to their business models, the Business Roundtable declared its opposition to central aspects of the SEC proposal, including provisions that experts say are vital for the rule to give investors comparable and consistent information about corporations’ climate risks. Before releasing the proposed rules in March, the SEC had asked the public what such rules might look like. In its response, the Business Roundtable acknowledged that “climate challenges are creating growing risks in many parts of the economy” and deemed it “appropriate” for the SEC to regulate climate disclosures. The group noted that the present system of corporate climate reporting, in which some companies issue voluntary climate-related disclosures, has proven inadequate. “There are many conflicting demands on companies to provide disclosures under different frameworks, which is unnecessarily costly and time-consuming for companies,” the Business Roundtable’s comments read. But when the SEC shifted from requesting voluntary input to proposing mandatory requirements for climate disclosures, the organization appeared to change its tune. In a 17-page letter, the CEO lobby announced its opposition to the proposal and asked the commission to “revise and repropose the rule.” In an email to the Guardian, the Business Roundtable denied that its perspective had changed. “[Business Roundtable] members are committed to combating climate change and are supportive of a rulemaking. Our goal is for a pragmatic, attainable, and successful rule,” the group said. “Our members believe it is worth the extra time on the front end to repropose the rule.” Since April 2021, according to meeting memoranda published by the SEC, the Business Roundtable has met at least three times with the SEC about climate disclosures. (GM’s Barra, the chair of the Business Roundtable, also met separately with SEC chair Gary Gensler.) In the first half of this year, the group spent more than $9.1m lobbying the federal government directly, according to reports compiled by Open Secrets. In its public disclosures, the Roundtable reported lobbying Congress, the White House and the SEC about the climate disclosure proposal. (In an email, the Business Roundtable said it “met with the SEC to directly communicate our concerns” and “shared our point of view with members of Congress and administration officials.”) Despite asking for a new, and thus delayed, proposal, the organization’s own members continue to assure the public that they see the climate crisis as an urgent challenge. “We’re out of time,” Cummins CEO and Business Roundtable member Tom Linebarger said in the organization’s January climate video. “We’re getting ready, to get ready, to get ready to do things. And the problem is that we have to move now.” But “now”, it seems, does not mean now. One provision the Business Roundtable has rejected as “unworkable” is a requirement for companies to measure and report the greenhouse gas emissions generated by suppliers and customers throughout their supply chains, or what are known as “Scope 3” emissions. The provision would apply only to companies that have published emissions targets that include Scope 3, or for which supply-chain emissions are considered “material”. Scope 3 includes all greenhouse gas emissions that companies neither generate directly (Scope 1) nor purchase for their own energy needs (Scope 2), which means everything from the raw materials that go into creating a product to the transportation that delivers that product to a consumer. For most companies, Scope 3 emissions represent the majority of their carbon output. As Addisu Lashitew, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has pointed out, more than three-quarters of Amazon’s 2021 emissions were considered Scope 3. The Business Roundtable supports mandating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosures, and many companies already report them, in part because these direct emissions are easier to calculate and easier to reduce (sometimes through the purchase of dubious carbon “offsets”). Perhaps more importantly, however, because most firms’ emissions are primarily Scope 3, limiting their reporting to Scopes 1 and 2 makes them appear greener. In its comments to the SEC, the Business Roundtable called the proposal to require companies to measure and report Scope 3 emissions “overly burdensome” because “many companies still have limited systems in place to identify and disclose Scope 3 emissions” and some aspects of reporting value-chain emissions “remain[] challenging”. But “if you don’t have Scope 3 as a requirement, then what you have effectively done is cut out most of the emissions from the top-emitting industries,” Allison Herren Lee, the former acting chair and commissioner of the SEC, told the Guardian. “With emissions arguably being the most important item of disclosure for investors, how is a rule without Scope 3 going to achieve what investors need?” “There is an inherent degree of uncertainty in some of the data the proposal would require companies to disclose, and much of it is largely outside their control,” the Business Roundtable said in an email. A number of experts familiar with the SEC’s climate disclosure rulemaking acknowledged that tracking and reporting Scope 3 emissions could indeed be difficult for some companies, or at least more difficult than not doing so. But they suggested that the more fundamental question was not whether complying with the SEC’s rules would be more difficult than doing nothing, but rather if doing so would provide investors with information that they have requested and that would help them make more informed investment decisions. This argument would appear to align with the stated position of the Business Roundtable, which has repeatedly expressed its support for “market-based” efforts to address climate change, a view it reiterated in its comments to the SEC. “Information is the lifeblood of the capital markets, and capital markets are a central institution of a capitalist market economy,” George S Georgiev, a professor at Emory University and an expert on securities law, told the Guardian. “Climate-related financial information is demanded by investors, not by environmentalists.” Moreover, “there is no unanimity that Scope 3 reporting is problematic”, Georgiev said, noting that Apple, whose CEO, Tim Cook, sits on the Business Roundtable’s board of directors, is among the companies that have endorsed the SEC’s Scope 3 requirement. Apple’s existing reporting “attest[s] to the feasibility of reasonably modeling, measuring, and reporting on all three scopes of emissions, including scope 3 emissions,” the company told the Commission. In its comments, the Business Roundtable said that its member companies had already set a “high bar…for voluntary ESG [environmental, social and governance] disclosures,” and that a voluntary approach to climate reporting was already “providing more valuable information for investors”. But many investors, analysts, academics, voters and experts – even companies themselves – disagree. “There is near-universal agreement among scholars that voluntary disclosure rules alone are not sufficient,” Emory’s Georgiev said. “The same logic applies to climate rules.” “Climate is one of the most significant risks facing companies and investors,” said Danielle Fugere, the president and chief counsel of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy nonprofit. “For companies to say that it is too costly to gather Scope 1 through 3 data, we simply think that it shows signs of weak management.” In a March letter, a group of investors managing nearly $5tn of assets warned that failing to require companies to disclose their Scope 3 emissions would render the SEC rules doubly ineffective: insufficient for addressing the climate emergency, and inadequate for providing investors with useful information, because voluntary figures allow companies to publish only the information that paints them in the best light. “There is a great amount of confusion,” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said in a speech last year. “If we are really going to tackle this, if we want to have 100% participation, the easiest way you could do that is having unified standards.” Fink is also a member of the Business Roundtable. In an email, the Roundtable said it was “unlikely” that the proposed Scope 3 disclosure provisions “would result in comparable, investor-useful information”. The group “believes it’s important to have reliable climate risk and emissions data, and our companies are leaders when it comes to transparency.” The group’s objections to the SEC’s Scope 3 requirements are only one aspect of its multi-tiered opposition to the proposed climate disclosure rules. And its opposition to the proposed rules is, similarly, only one example of many in which it has rejected efforts to hold its member companies accountable for their social and environmental pledges. In the three years since the organization released the “purpose of a corporation” statement, a number of studies have shown that Business Roundtable companies have failed to follow through on their “fundamental commitment to all of [their] stakeholders”. One analysis from London Business School and Columbia Business School found that companies whose CEOs signed the 2019 statement subsequently received more federal environmental infractions and had higher carbon emissions than similar firms that did not sign the statement. In another study, two Harvard Law School professors reviewed more than 600 public documents filed by Business Roundtable companies since the statement’s publication. Time and time again, the researchers found that when firms were presented with an opportunity to formalize the pledge in their corporate governance, they declined. In addition, by advocating and lobbying against government action on issues like climate change, the Business Roundtable gives its members space to publicly endorse (and claim credit for endorsing) legislative and regulatory action – such as Apple’s support for mandatory Scope 3 reporting, or Cummins and GM’s support for Build Back Better –all while knowing that the Roundtable will work behind the scenes in opposition. “Some individual companies aren’t going to write in and rage against the proposal because they know that will raise concerns with their investors, so they let some of the trade groups do that work for them,” said Allison Herren Lee, the SEC’s former acting chair and commissioner. In its comments to the SEC, the Business Roundtable urged lawmakers to take the lead on tackling the climate crisis, arguing that “although important, disclosures simply will not solve the problem”. “These are complex issues that need to be solved through the legislative process,” the group wrote. But the Business Roundtable continues to oppose efforts to address the climate emergency through the legislative process. The latest effort to tackle the climate crisis, the Inflation Reduction Act, includes billions of dollars in clean energy tax incentives, paid for in part by making sure corporations pay at least a 15% tax rate on profits. The bill could cut America’s carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. Yet on 6 August, just shy of the third anniversary of the statement in which Business Roundtable CEOs committed to “protect[ing] the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses”, the group declared its opposition to the bill, citing “tax provisions that would undermine American economic growth and competitiveness”. “I’m just so worried that our planet can no longer suffer from us debating and debating and debating,” said Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger, who, like all the CEOs named in this article, signed the 2019 statement. “It’s the existential crisis of our time.”",Climate crisis; Business; US news; Apple; Pepsico; Google; US politics; Environment,Environment
2021-08-17T12:08:43Z,Glencore stake boosts Britishvolt’s £4bn plans for battery factory,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/17/glencore-stake-boosts-britishvolt-4bn-plans-for-battery-factory,"Mining giant Glencore has agreed to buy a stake in Britishvolt, the startup with plans to invest £4bn building the UK’s first large-scale battery factory to help accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles. Glencore said it had made an undisclosed investment in the company as part of a long-term strategic partnership with Britishvolt to supply cobalt to its pioneering battery “gigafactory” in Northumberland. Glencore is one of the world’s biggest producers of cobalt, a byproduct of its copper mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its nickel mining in Australia and Canada. It is also a key material used in manufacturing the batteries found in electric vehicles. Britishvolt chief executive, Orral Nadjari, who founded the company in 2019, said the partnership was “a huge step in the right direction” which would help to lock in its supply of cobalt and lower the risks for the multibillion pound project. The former investment banker has already won backing from investors in the Middle East and Scandinavia but Glencore is the first major strategic investor to take a stake in the company. Britishvolt’s battery factory is under construction on the site of a decommissioned coal-fired power plant in Blyth in north-east England where it will initially employ 1,000 people, rising to 3,000 once the gigafactory is at full capacity. Once complete Britishvolt expects the plant to produce enough battery cells for about 300,000 electric vehicle battery packs a year, which will mainly supply the UK’s automotive industry. David Brocas, Glencore’s head cobalt trader, said the miner’s commitment to supporting Britishvolt was key to underpinning the long-term cobalt supply deal. “As the mobility and energy transition accelerates, so does future demand for battery metals such as cobalt, copper and nickel. Glencore is already a leading producer and supplier of these metals, helping to underpin our ambition of achieving net zero total emissions by 2050,” he said. The deal is likely to reignite concerns over the ethical procurement of cobalt to meet the world’s rising demand for electric vehicles, and Glencore’s activities in the DRC. Glencore is under investigation by authorities in the UK, US and Switzerland, where the company is based, over alleged corruption. The UK’s Serious Fraud Office in late 2019 opened an investigation into Glencore relating to “suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business”. The company also faces a criminal investigation by the Swiss government over its alleged failure to prevent corruption in the DRC. The company says it is working with Cobalt industry groups in Congo, which produces 70% of the world’s supply, to improve transparency around the production process, and progress ethical business practices and standards. Nadjari said: “Knowing that we are being supplied with ethically produced, low-carbon cobalt is a signal to the market that we are living by our values. “This strategic partnership aligns perfectly with our world-class ESG [environmental, social, and governance] principles, including applying best practice wherever possible as well as assessing labour, human rights and ethical procurement performance of our suppliers.”","Glencore; Mining; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Greenhouse gas emissions; Commodities; Business; Environment; UK news",Business
2022-01-04T08:10:40Z,Can London stock market shake off dinosaur image to boldly go?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/can-london-stock-market-shake-off-dinosaur-image-to-boldly-go,"London’s stock market is facing a barrage of criticism, with global investors likening it to a “global backwater” struggling to attract and retain growth companies that excite investors and are building the 21st-century economy. However, after a surge of stock flotations in 2021, including cutting-edge firms such as Oxford Nanopore, and new listing rules, London’s status as a global financial centre could brighten in 2022. Currently, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies looks dated. Technology only makes up about 2% of the London market, compared with 20% across global markets. “That means London is tenfold underweight in the part of the economy growing faster, and which is attracting high valuations,” says Simon French, the chief economist of Panmure Gordon. “If you’re an investor looking to invest in growth, you haven’t got a lot of options on the UK public market, with the greatest respect to Sage and Micro Focus.” Paul Marshall, the boss of the £40m ($55bn) hedge fund Marshall Wace, wrote in the Financial Times that the City of London risked becoming “a sort of Jurassic Park”, and that fund managers were content to collect dividends from ponderous old economy players rather than encouraging and rewarding innovation. French points out that in the US market, liquidity has doubled since the financial crisis, but on the FTSE All-Share it has more than halved, putting some fund managers off investing in London. “Performance begets liquidity begets performance, so London’s underperformance can lead to a vicious circle,” French explains. He fears that recent reviews of the UK’s listing regime have failed to tackle this liquidity issue. James Anderson, the joint manager of Baillie Gifford’s Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust and an early investor in major US tech stocks such as Tesla, has compared the FTSE 100 to a 19th-century stock market – heavy with banks and oil stocks, but sadly lacking in real innovation. It will take time for London to shake off this image, French says. “You don’t go from a 19th-century stock exchange, or a Jurassic Park one, to a Star Trek exchange overnight.” There are signs that London is beaming up some fast-growing companies, with Oxford Nanopore, Deliveroo and Darktrace coming to market. In total, 122 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange last year, raising more than £16.8bn – the biggest initial public offering pot since 2007. But the journey has been shaky: Deliveroo tumbled by 30% on its debut in March, and is languishing at record lows, while Darktrace was ejected from the FTSE 100 after its initial share surge faded. Others have done better, such as the consumer review site Trustpilot, which has gained 25% since floating. “For every Deliveroo or Darktrace, there is a Trustpilot or Auction Technologies out there,” says French. High valuations on the other side of the Atlantic also hurt London – they mean firms don’t have to sell as much of their company on the Nasdaq, tor example, to raise the same money. London’s new listing rules mean private firms needn’t sell as much stock to go public. They also allow firms with dual-class share structures popular with entrepreneurs and founders on to the FTSE 100 and the 250 index of smaller firms. Marshall, though, says London needs to move “faster and harder still” to lure growth companies, close the gap with New York and become a more attractive place to list and raise capital than the EU and Asia. “London is also the natural home for ESG [environmental, social and governance] winners, emerging market winners and digital assets. To capitalise on these advantages, we need to encourage asset managers to invest in these assets and develop a wider culture of growth-oriented investing,” he insists. The move towards ESG investing had counted against London, with fund managers shunning polluting industries such as fossil fuel producers and mining companies. London’s problem in 2021 was retaining companies as much as attracting new ones. A string of listed companies became takeover targets,, such as the defence firm Meggitt and UK tech firm Blue Prism, with speculation BT could be next. The weaker pound also left some growth companies as sitting ducks – chip designer ARM, the crown jewel of UK tech, was snaffled by SoftBank just after the Brexit vote in 2016. US private equity firms have also taken advantage of depressed valuations. This hoovering up of British tech firms by US investors is worrying MPs, with 130 UK tech firms reportedly acquired by American companies between January and mid-December 2021. “We need to recognise the impact this is having on our own capabilities and sovereign strength,” Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the parliamentary defence select committee, told the Daily Telegraph. “It goes against the grain of the government’s wise long-term ambition of becoming a high-tech superpower.” David Miller, an executive director of Quilter Cheviot, pushes back on the idea that the City of London itself risks becoming a backwater. “In many ways it remains an ideal location for investment managers, with its time zone, language, huge infrastructure and the right attitude. London has always been good at global investment, it’s always looked out, not in, and that makes London the best place for global investment,” says Miller. The UK broker AJ Bell estimates that the FTSE 100 will pay out £81.8bn in dividends in 2021, a 32% increase compared with 2020 when the pandemic forced firms to cut or suspend payments. The mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP Group, oil firm Shell and tobacco company BAT will dole out the most, highlighting the City’s dilemma – owning these “sin stocks” can generate a healthy income, vital for pension funds and income funds. Miller can’t see a world in which a balanced portfolio doesn’t have dividend payers as part of the mix; not paying a dividend shouldn’t see a company excluded if its prospects are good. The balance between growth and value stocks today is different than before the dotcom crash two decades ago. “In 1999, people sold dividend-paying firms to buy firms that just evaporated,” Miller says. There’s also a different mindset to investing across the Atlantic. “Investors in the US want the companies they invest in to grow market share – market share really excites US fund managers,” Miller says. In the UK and Europe there’s much more focus on profitability. “If a company isn’t profitable now, we want to know when it will be profitable.” In the short term, the FTSE 100 could benefit if the pandemic eases in 2022, lifting banks, mining firms, oil companies, travel and hospitality firms. JPMorgan recently upgraded its rating on UK stocks to “overweight”, pointing out that British equity markets are now trading at a “record discount”. Matt Weller, the global head of research at Forex.com and City Index, agrees that much of the FTSE’s underperformance comes down to sector weightings. “The FTSE’s heavy allocation to the underperforming consumer staple and financial sectors (both near 20% weighting) dwarf the index’s minuscule (under 2%) exposure to technology stocks, exactly the inverse of the allocation that you’d create with the benefit of hindsight,” says Weller. “Of course, markets are highly cyclical, and the recent uptick in inflation and interest rates could be the catalyst to shift sector performance in favor of the FTSE’s weights in the coming quarters.” London has also lost out to Amsterdam in the race to attract “blank-cheque” companies, big on Wall Street, which seek out a fledgling business to acquire. London’s first special purpose acquisition company (Spac) launched at the end of November, by which time Amsterdam had already racked up 13. In the long run, local exchanges could be pushed further to the margins. 24 Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto and foreign exchange trading platform, is planning to bring in around-the-clock stock trading, which is already possible with cryptocurrencies. Miller says the general idea of 24-hour trading is not a “totally ridiculous” one. “The transition from floor trading to where we are now isn’t going to stop where it is now.” To an extent there is already 24-hour trading through the working week, with bourses in Asia-Pacific markets, Europe and New York together covering most time zones. But many stocks are only listed on one exchange, and liquidity in individual companies is better when their local exchange is open. Non-stop trading could be gruelling for equities traders, although nothing that other industries don’t handle. “If the car industry can work on three shifts per day, why can’t traders?” Miller points out.",Stock markets; London Stock Exchange; London; UK news; IPOs; Business; FTSE,Business
2023-10-03T13:00:14Z,On the cards: Amex UK boss on plans for BNPL and keeping BA tie-up despite climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/03/cardsamex-uk-buy-now-pay-later-ba-hannah-lewis,"For a company so closely tied to the business travel elite, the Covid lockdown orders issued in March 2020 were particularly troubling for American Express. With shops shut, borders closed and its cohort of jetsetting business customers suddenly chained to their kitchen tables, the credit card company was hit with an immediate drop in consumer spending. Compounded by the $1.7bn (£1.4bn) put aside by the end of March to cover potential defaults – by Amex customers financially squeezed by illness, layoffs, or new caring responsibilities – the pandemic quickly took its toll. Profits plunged 76% to just $367m in the first three months of the year, and took another 85% year-on-year tumble in the second quarter. “It was probably one of the most challenging periods for anyone in the past 20 years,” says Hannah Lewis. The 44-year-old, who was appointed head of Amex UK in 2022 after 14 years at the company, says the pandemic sparked some soul-searching for the business, which has relied heavily on travel ever since it was founded as an express shipping company in 1850. With housebound customers unable to use its inhouse travel agency, and no longer attracted to its famous travel reward perks, the company known for prestigious partnerships with airlines including British Airways, Emirates and Etihad was forced to change direction. “We were all locked in our homes. So we made a very deliberate decision at that point to invest in non-travel benefits,” she says. That included online workshops – ranging from in-depth courses on classic cars to home cooking – digital BFI screenings, and doubling down on its “shop small” campaign, which encouraged customers to use their Amex cards at local stores. That campaign, Lewis says, also helped challenge what she says is the “outdated” claim that Amex is rarely accepted on the high street – because of the supposedly high transaction fees for retailers compared with those levied by rivals such as Visa and Mastercard. Lewis refuses to discuss fees, but suggests the fact that Amex is now accepted at the likes of Homebase, Aldi and Lidl proves its cards are increasingly used by ordinary, if slightly more affluent, customers. Ultimately, pandemic-era default fears proved to be overblown. Thanks to Covid payment holidays, as well as the relative wealth of its customers, Amex was able to release $674m of the funds it had put aside at the end of 2020. And earlier this year, the company – which does not break out its UK results – said customers had spent a record $426bn in the second quarter, helping push profits up 11% to $2.2bn, despite the cost of living crisis. “We’re seeing a strong desire [from customers] to continue to get out there and enjoy life,” Lewis says. The UK boss is not planning to get in the way of that momentum. She says Amex has no plans to row back on partnerships with the likes of British Airways any time soon, despite growing public concern over the impact of air travel’s carbon emissions on the climate crisis. “It’s a partnership that our customers really value,” Lewis says. “We are certainly are very committed to our ESG [environment, sustainability and governance] goals … we feel pretty good about how we’re making progress with that. And I don’t see that changing our relationship with British Airways in any way.” The Yorkshire-born boss does not come across as someone willing to rock the boat. Born in Halifax to two teachers, Lewis says she was a determined and competitive child, whose love for maths and sciences led her to an engineering degree in metallurgy at Oxford. But a postgraduate stint at Boston Consulting Group helped her realise her problem-solving skills were better applied to the business world, which was heavily male-dominated when she joined the workforce in 2002. “I certainly had client environments during my consulting days where I remember walking into one office and hearing apologies about them having [the Sun’s] Page 3 posters on the wall. There was a lot of that kind of thing, where it was clear you’re the first female who has been in this room for a long time.” While Lewis says she did not experience overt sexism as she climbed the corporate ladder, she did have to shrug off unhelpful tropes of what it meant to be a woman in power. “I probably had an image of what a senior female financial services leader might look like. It probably involved heels … shoulder pads and power suits, and I quickly learned that that wasn’t actually the right perception.” Those cliches certainly did not resonate for long with the relatively reserved Lewis, who seems far more at ease in a casual uniform of blazer, jeans and trainers. “I realised quickly that I was going to be much better at being me than trying to be some sort of stereotyped image of a powerful senior leader.” She insists that stereotypes about the typical Amex customer being a “white middle-aged businessman” are wrong, saying the company continues to draw millennial and gen Z borrowers interested in perks and rewards. That is despite the controversial rise in unregulated buy now, pay later (BNPL) products, which charge retailers, rather than shoppers, for the privilege of splitting purchases into smaller, monthly payments – often without interest. The Amex UK boss says she does not expect BNPL to displace the credit card market, but her company is clearly not above jumping on the bandwagon. In 2017, roughly two years after BNPL giant Klarna entered the American market, Amex’s US business introduced its own “Plan It” product, allowing customers to make monthly payments on a large purchase for a fixed fee, with interest, while still earning rewards. It would be no surprise if Amex decided to offer the same to UK customers. But Lewis, for now, is keeping her cards close to her chest. “Watch this space,” she says.

2022-01-20T16:04:22Z,Top investor castigates Unilever after failed £50bn bid for GSK arm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/top-investor-castigates-unilever-after-failed-pounds-50bn-bid-for-gsk-arm-terry-smith,"A leading Unilever shareholder has called the company’s failed £50bn offer for GSK’s consumer healthcare division a “near-death experience” and said management should focus on improving its core business – or step down. Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, lambasted Unilever in a “postmortem” letter to investors in his £29bn asset management business. The letter comes a day after Unilever said it would not increase its bid for a fourth time, leaving GSK free to float its consumer arm as planned this summer. “[This is] about a near death experience as it now appears that Unilever’s attempt to purchase the GSK consumer business is now thankfully dead rather than the value of our investment in Unilever,” said the letter, which was co-written by Fundsmith’s head of research, Julian Robins. Fundsmith is the seventh largest active shareholder in Unilever, the owner of numerous household brands, including Marmite and Dove soap. In a wide-ranging critique of Unilever and its management, Smith and Robins attacked the company’s long-term performance, accused it of not engaging with shareholders, having a flawed mergers and acquisitions strategy, as well as a “penchant for corporate gobbledegook”. “Unilever’s performance has been poor,” the letter said. “It is the worst performer by a considerable margin amongst the multinational FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] companies we have owned and not just in terms of share price but also in terms of sales growth.” The credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday said a debt-fuelled purchase of the GSK consumer healthcare division could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” of Unilever’s rating, which could make it more expensive for the company to borrow and force some investors to dump the shares. Unilever’s share price has lagged rivals in recent years and are down 30% since 2019, when Alan Jope took over as chief executive. Its market value has fallen by a fifth during the last 12 months, even as the FTSE 100 has gained 13%. “It seems to us that Unilever management’s response to its poor performance has been to utter meaningless platitudes to which it has now attempted to add major M&amp;A activity,” the letter said. “What could possibly go wrong.” Last week, Smith, whose fund holds a position worth more than £800m in Unilever, used his annual letter to clients to attack the Jope’s strategy of boosting the environmental, social and governance credentials of the company rather than focusing on core business performance. Smith said on Thursday: “We believe Unilever management – or someone else if they don’t want the job – should surely focus on getting the operating performance of the existing business to the level it should before taking on anymore challenges.” Fundsmith said Unilever investors should just wait to buy a piece of GSK Consumer Healthcare when it floats, rather than own the business outright by paying a higher price through a takeover.",Unilever; GSK; Mergers and acquisitions; Business,Business
2022-02-10T15:21:32Z,Ben & Jerry’s Ukraine tweet gets frosty reception from Unilever boss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/ben-jerrys-ukraine-tweet-gets-frosty-reception-from-unilever-boss,"The chief executive of Ben &amp; Jerry’s parent company, Unilever, has criticised the ice-cream maker’s controversial tweet about the Ukraine crisis, saying it should stay away from issues where it does not have “expertise or credibility”. The ice-cream company, which drew fire with a decision to stop selling its products in occupied Palestinian territories last year, caused a social media storm on Friday by calling on Biden to not send more troops to Europe, saying he risked “fanning the flames of war”. Unilever boss Alan Jope was asked about the company’s reaction to the tweet during a press call about his company’s annual results on Thursday. The consumer goods giant acquired Ben &amp; Jerry’s more than 20 years ago in a move that many predicted would dilute the counter-culture ethos of a company founded in 1970s Burlington, Vermont. But the ice-cream maker has continued to speak out on issues such as equality and the climate crisis. “It is a great brand, most of the time they get it right,” said Jope. “They have a great track record campaigning on important issues. But [on] subjects where Unilever brands don’t have expertise or credibility it is best to stay out of the debate.” Jope pointed out that the views held by subsidiaries are not those of the company. Unilever is unable to muzzle Ben &amp; Jerry’s, as under the terms of its takeover in 2000 the ice-cream company has its own independent board of directors free to take their own political stance. The company’s decision to stop selling ice-cream in occupied Palestinian territories last summer was highlighted by the leading Unilever shareholder, Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, as the most obvious example of what he feels is Unilever’s obsession with public image and building environmental, social and governance credentials over business performance. Jope said that Ben &amp; Jerry’s showed strong 9% growth last year, becoming one of 13 Unilever brands to be worth 1bn-plus euros, and said that a new sales “arrangement” in Israel would come into force in 2023. He said that the Twitter posts on Israel and Ukraine were not responsible for driving ice-cream sales. “I definitely would not make a connection between those statements and sales growth,” he said. “Growth is driven much more by innovation.” Jope also reiterated that he believes the company is on the right track in pushing sustainability and purpose across its 400 brand portfolio. “Our brands that have sustainability as part of their proposition are growing faster,” he said. “I still believe it will be absolutely critical for successful businesses of the future. It is the icing on the cake, not the cake [itself]. It comes on top of getting the basics right.” Calls from investors to consider splitting the business, and a restructure of Unilever’s business units, has raised questions of a potential sale of operations including its ice-cream and nutrition businesses. “Both are great businesses,” said Jope. “They have some of the strongest brands that can thrive within Unilever. I see a bright future ahead for both the nutrition and ice-cream businesses inside Unilever.” • This article was amended on 10 February 2022 because an earlier version referred to Ben &amp; Jerry’s being founded in San Francisco whereas it was started in Burlington, Vermont.",Unilever; UK news; Business; Ukraine; Europe; US news; World news,Business
2022-06-02T15:00:04Z,Here’s how rocketing rents and unaffordable house prices can be fixed | Leilani Farha,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/02/rocketing-rents-unaffordable-house-prices-fixed,"Two years ago, when Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, I had a strange sense of optimism. I wondered if this crisis might be one of opportunity, rather than opportunism. When the pandemic struck, another global crisis was already raging. In cities around the world, housing affordability had become an acute problem. The cost of housing had risen far beyond the rate of incomes. As the former UN special rapporteur on the right to housing, I had seen how tenants were struggling to pay rent, often falling into arrears and facing eviction. These conditions were partly the result of the 2008 financial crisis, which provided fertile ground for investors to mine residential real estate and extract unprecedented profits. This “financialisation” of housing unleashed a new business model. Investors would buy “undervalued” and “distressed” homes, undertake renovations and raise rents to increase a property’s valuation – maximising their investment returns in the process. I was convinced that during a global health crisis when people were instructed to stay home, governments would harness all their resources to do whatever was necessary to ensure everyone had a decent home – if for no other reason than to prevent the spread of a deadly virus. At first, my optimism seemed well-placed. With economies at a standstill, governments around the world quickly recognised that tenants needed help. Many jurisdictions passed financial aid and eviction moratoriums to help tenants pay the rent and remain housed. For example, in England the government’s Everyone In scheme housed rough sleepers in hotels. But in most cases, attempts to help tenants were limited to emergency programmes, leaving the underlying causes of the global housing crisis untouched. Meanwhile, governments and central banks enacted a series of fiscal and monetary policies (such as lowering interest rates and engaging in quantitative easing) making it cheaper to borrow capital. This all but ensured that once tenants emerged from the pandemic, they would be left to face a deepening housing crisis. Indeed, since the pandemic, rents have rocketed. These policies were a boon to investors. Last year, buoyed by investments from US public pension funds, the private equity company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co closed four residential real estate deals through its investment fund, including one in Germany, which encompassed 7,500 homes. Meanwhile, the CEO of Blackstone, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, boasted the company had achieved “the most remarkable results … on virtually every metric” in its history. The company’s stock soared in 2021. Success was attributed, in large part, to “inflation-proof” residential real estate holdings, as rents rose at two to three times the rate of the consumer prices index. The top priority of these corporate landlords is pleasing their shareholders. Left unchallenged, the financialisation of housing could make cities affordable only for the affluent. While housing becomes more and more unaffordable, lower-income households will suffer further socio-economic deprivation. It’s clear we need a paradigm shift. There is a growing consensus that embracing housing as a human right is key to solving the housing crisis. The proof is The Shift Directives, which I am launching today in the European parliament. These are the world’s first set of international recommendations that challenge the financialisation of housing head on, using human rights standards to lead the way forward. Drafted in consultation with leading experts, the directives guide governments and investors on timely issues such as short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, student housing, the banking sector, and “renovictions” – the process of renovating a property in order to raise the rent. The Shift Directives draw inspiration from places and movements that are already rejecting the financialisation of housing and embracing a human rights framework. In Chile, the Pinochet-era constitution is being reformed to include the right to housing. Last year, Singapore imposed significant taxes on the purchase of investment properties to cool its heating market. Catalonia recently passed a sweeping housing bill to protect residents and dissuade corporate landlords from amassing homes in cities such as Barcelona by requiring large property holders to offer genuinely affordable rent proposals to vulnerable households before serving eviction notices. Property owners who leave their homes vacant for more than two years can also face hefty fines or even expropriation. Likewise, grassroots tenants movements in cities such as Amsterdam, Madrid, Berlin, and Toronto are demanding an end to the financialisation of their homes, and winning. In New York, for example, a feisty group of tenants banded together and secured the chance to buy the apartments they were renting from their landlord, who was threatening to raise their rents. Even some American banks have pledged to stop lending to abusive landlords. Meanwhile, the rising tide of investor interest in environmental, social and governance criteria is an acknowledgment that corporations need to do better. Faced with rocketing rents and house prices, the housing crisis can seem inevitable. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Land trusts and housing cooperatives have already shown that there are viable alternatives to the extractive model of housing investment that turns our homes into financial assets. But these types of hopeful initiatives will remain small-scale unless governments recognise two things: first, that the current system is broken, and second, that those who contributed to the crisis are not the best placed to solve it. We have an unprecedented opportunity to guarantee the human right to housing through regulatory changes that would obligate investors to play a positive role in society, rather than a real-life game of monopoly. The Shift Directives provide governments and institutional investors with precisely what they need to seize this opportunity, to ensure that housing systems are based on equality, security, and dignity – the foundational principles of human rights.

2023-05-30T13:00:02Z, Delta Air Lines faces lawsuit over $1bn carbon neutrality claim,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/delta-air-lines-lawsuit-carbon-neutrality-aoe,"Delta Air Lines is facing a lawsuit over its $1bn carbon neutrality claim which plaintiffs say is “false and misleading” as it relies on offsets that do little to mitigate global heating. In February 2020, the US airline announced plans to go carbon neutral, pledging $1bn to mitigate all greenhouse gas emissions from its business worldwide over the next decade. It included plans to purchase carbon credits generated from conserving rainforest, wetlands and grasslands along with decreasing the use of jet fuel and increasing plane efficiency. The new legal action, filed in California on Tuesday, targets Delta’s statement that it is “the world’s first carbon-neutral airline”, a claim it has made in adverts, LinkedIn posts, in-flight napkins and comments by company executives, according to the lawsuit. The class-action lawsuit says Delta’s carbon neutrality claim is demonstrably false as it heavily relies on junk offsets that do nothing to counteract the climate crisis. It alleges that customers would have purchased Delta tickets believing they had no impact on the environment and many would not have bought them without the carbon neutrality claim. A Delta spokesperson said: “This lawsuit is without legal merit. Delta is a vigorous advocate for more sustainable aviation, adopting industry-leading climate goals as we work towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Delta committed to carbon neutrality in March 2020, and since 31 March 2022, has fully transitioned its focus away from carbon offsets toward decarbonisation of our operations, focusing our efforts on investing in sustainable aviation fuel, renewing our fleet for more fuel-efficient aircraft and implementing operational efficiencies.” “The language carbon neutral is so provocative,” says Krikor Kouyoumdjian, a partner with the legal firm Haderlein and Kouyoumdjian LLP which is bringing the case. “When companies say: ‘Don’t worry about our emissions, they’re sorted,’ they are communicating complacency. They are letting consumers pay to feel better and not have to worry about the impact of their consumption. But that is counterfactual to reality. It is not something that you can pay away. “When I hear ‘carbon neutral’, I think you’re not doing anything wrong, you’re not hurting the environment in any way. It’s like you don’t exist. That’s what the words mean to any rational person: that we can participate in your business without any guilt. Most of us who care about the environment walk around with this giant cloud of guilt that our very existence hurts the environment in a bunch of ways.” The case argues that there is a market premium for green products and that Delta has profited from a misleading environmental claim. It cites scientific and journalistic evidence that there are deep flaws with carbon credits from the unregulated voluntary market that Delta has purchased for its environmental claims. In January, a nine-month investigation by the Guardian, the German weekly Die Zeit and the investigative group SourceMaterial found Verra rainforest credits used by Disney, Shell, Gucci and other big corporations were largely worthless, often based on stopping the destruction of rainforests that were not threatened, according to independent studies. The lawsuit against Delta mentions the investigation. Verra strongly disputed the findings. Haderlein and Kouyoumdjian said they wanted the company to drop the carbon neutrality claim and explain the full scale of the pollution that their business causes. “The voluntary carbon offset market cannot meaningfully guarantee carbon neutrality from a company in the way it’s currently being operated. The market is replete with severe methodological errors that appear both intentional and unintentional. In our opinion, it’s frankly reckless to predicate a company’s ESG strategy on climate change on the basis of the purchase of these offsets,” says attorney Jonathan Haderlein. “This is more than a climate change case. This is also a business case. People are paying more for these greener products. If a company like Delta is raking that premium in by claiming they do it first and then doing a huge advertising blitz to try to get people flying again, we think that’s unfair to other companies that are buying higher-quality offsets or doing far better sustainability. And frankly, unfair to consumers.” At the time Delta launched its plans to go carbon neutral in 2020, its chief executive, Ed Bastian, said: “There’s no challenge we face that is in greater need of innovation than environmental sustainability, and we know there is no single solution. We are digging deep into the issues, examining every corner of our business, engaging experts, building coalitions, fostering partnerships and driving innovation.” The new lawsuit comes amid a wider regulatory crackdown on green claims in the UK and Europe. In New York, Evian is being sued over its carbon neutrality claim which relies on offsets. Danone, who own the water brand, has argued it should be thrown out and say the case “defies science and common sense”. A judge will now decide whether or not to progress the case.

2020-06-19T09:04:14Z,Adani mine: fourth major insurer declines to renew policies with coal project,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/19/adani-mine-fourth-major-insurer-declines-to-renew-policies-with-coal-project,"Another major insurer that was providing cover for the Adani Carmichael coalmine project in Queensland has said it will not be renewing policies with the coal project. Aspen Insurance is the fourth of Adani’s underwriters to walk away from the major mine and export rail project currently being constructed in the Galilee basin. Last week, three former insurers – AXA XL, Liberty Mutual and HDI – all confirmed they would not continue previous insurance policies on the project. In a statement, Aspen Insurance said: “Aspen can confirm that it will not be renewing any insurance policies associated with the Adani Carmichael mine. “As a business, Aspen understands the importance of environmental, social, and governance issues and we review our underwriting approach on an ongoing basis as part of this.” Aspen would not produce any further details on the nature of the policies it had provided or any expiry dates. Guardian Australia understands Aspen’s business with Adani had been under review sometime after the ownership of the business changed hands in February 2019. The spokesperson said Aspen had joined a voluntary United Nations initiative “for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices” and was taking steps as a business to cut its carbon footprint. Aspen is the fourth former Adani insurer to distance itself from the project and cite concerns over climate change as part of their decision. The Adani mine has faced relentless pressure from campaigners. Companies associated with the project have been targeted by groups who say associating with the coalmine risks causing “reputational damage” because of the contribution of burning coal to the climate crisis. The mine and railway is the first project to target the massive but as-yet untapped coal reserves in the Galilee Basin. Campaigners fear the Carmichael mine, approved by the state and federal governments, will be the first of several coal mines to develop the region. Last week Adani said details of its insurance providers were “commercial in confidence” but said “we have the requisite insurance requirements in place”. In January, the Australian coach company Greyhound cut ties with a contractor building the Adani mine railway after Guardian Australia revealed its association with the coal project.",Adani Group; Queensland; Business; Australia news,Business
2022-01-03T06:00:38Z,"UK’s late payment ‘crisis’ risks future of 440,000 small firms",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/uks-late-payment-crisis-risks-future-of-440000-small-firms,"More than 440,000 small firms could be forced out of business by the late payment “crisis”, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, which has called for urgent government intervention to improve the way firms are paid. Almost a third of small businesses (30%) surveyed told the FSB that they had seen the late payment of invoices increase over the last three months, with at least 8% warning that the problem has become so bad that it was threatening the viability of their business. For years the problem of late payments – often by big FTSE firms – has dogged the small business sector. Firms are often forced to pay their suppliers, wages and other bills on time, but face long waits to be paid themselves. The FSB said more than 400,000 small firms have shut down since the start of the pandemic for various reasons, and that the future of a similar number is now threatened by this problem alone. “Late payment was destroying thousands of small businesses even before the pandemic hit – the pandemic has made matters worse,” said the FSB national chair, Mike Cherry. “In the past, the government has rightly identified greater board accountability as key to spurring change in this area, but delivery has been slow.” Cherry said small firms, which employ more than 13 million workers in the UK, are facing battles on almost every front, including new customs checks on imports from the EU and a looming energy cost crisis. “Today, it’s a fresh wave of admin for importers and exporters – in three months’ time it will be a hike to the jobs tax, that is national insurance contributions, a rise in dividend taxation, business rates bills and an increase in the national living wage. On top of that, operating costs are surging – many will soon be trying to strike energy deals without the clout of big corporates or the protections afforded to consumers.” The FSB has said every big business and government organisation should be abiding by the prompt payment code arguing that 30-day payment terms should be “the norm for those who are committed to environmental, social and governance best practice”. It wants every big UK corporation to have a non-executive director on its board with direct responsibility for payment culture. The other findings of the FSB survey of more than 1,200 members will concern ministers. More small firms now expect their performance to worsen over the coming three months than expect an improvement. Pessimism is especially pronounced in the retail, accommodation and food industries, as many UK consumers adopted self-imposed lockdowns in the face of Omicron. Pictures of deserted high streets in the run-up to Christmas, fears over spiralling energy costs and concerns that staff will not be able return to work on Tuesday have not helped matters. Spiralling energy bills have already forced some firms to close. Businesses are not protected by the price cap imposed by the regulator Ofgem. Companies importing goods from the EU also now face new, onerous paperwork. Regulations require businesses (in most cases those receiving goods in the UK, but in some those sending them to the UK) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to Great Britain from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021 but now apply for the first time. A government spokesperson said: “The government is making significant reforms to help small businesses get paid on time, including halving the payment period in the prompt payment code and consulting on fines and other new powers for the Small Business Commissioner.” “There is plenty of support available to ensure small businesses are well positioned to comply with UK border processes, including one-to-one advice through the Export Support Service.”",Small business; Bankruptcy and IVAs; UK news; Business,Business
2023-04-11T15:24:53Z,The ‘reformed economist’: who is the new chief tasked with saving the CBI?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/11/cbi-new-boss-need-show-bring-fresh-leadership-rain-newton-smith,"She’s the woman with the unenviable task of assuming the leadership of Britain’s largest business group after a misconduct scandal. Rain Newton-Smith has been appointed director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Her predecessor, Tony Danker, was sacked after an independent investigation into his workplace conduct. Newton-Smith will be familiar to the CBI’s employees, and to the 190,000 British businesses it claims to represent. The 47-year-old was the group’s long-serving chief economist, from August 2014 until March this year, when she left to join the lender Barclays as a managing director, responsible for strategy and policy, sustainability and environment, social and governance (ESG). Just a month ago, Newton-Smith expressed her excitement at her new role on the professional networking site LinkedIn, thanking Barclays for the “opportunity to combine personal and professional passions at a great institution”. This appeared a good fit for someone whose Twitter profile says she is “passionate about things climate and biodiversity”. However, in a what is likely to be a blow for her new employer, itself a CBI member, Newton-Smith is heading straight back out of the door after being asked to lead the business group at a critical time. The CBI’s decision to task someone with such a longstanding connection to the organisation with revamping its culture may raise eyebrows. The Guardian understands that she has been appointed to the top job without a formal recruitment process, and will face a daunting in-tray once she returns to the organisation. The independent inquiry into allegations of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI, first reported by the Guardian, has not ended with Danker’s departure, and other employees remain suspended while other allegations are investigated. Newton-Smith will have to decide how to reform the organisation and try to rehabilitate its reputation once the inquiry has concluded. A vocal commentator on the struggles faced by businesses after the pandemic, she will also have to choose the CBI’s stance in the run-up to the next general election, at a time when the group’s members are being squeezed by rising costs and concerned about the economic outlook. Like a raft of former prime ministers, high-profile economists and other members of Britain’s elite, Newton-Smith gained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Oxford University, before completing a master’s at the London School of Economics. She may describe herself on Twitter as a “reformed chief economist” – and a “mother of four inquiring minds” – but Newton-Smith had a notable career in economics, including her first job at the Bank of England, where she was a economist and research adviser to the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) unit. Stints followed advising the UK executive director at the International Monetary Fund, and more than five years as the head of emerging markets at the forecaster Oxford Economics. Indeed, she was previously named as a possible candidate for the role of an external member of the MPC at the Bank when the job became available in 2021, and at a time when the organisation was coming in for criticism over a lack of diversity and failure to appoint more women. While she was not ultimately appointed to the job making decisions on UK interest rates, Newton-Smith clearly enjoys the respect of several City grandees. Her appointment as director general was welcomed by Mike Rake, a former CBI president and former chair of FTSE 100 companies including BT and easyJet. Rake described Newton-Smith on Twitter as “an excellent and important choice for the CBI and the importance of the role it fulfils”. Paul Dreschler, another erstwhile CBI president and former FTSE chairman, called her an “excellent appointment” during “tough times” for the CBI. When she returns to the CBI’s City headquarters, Newton-Smith will have to persuade the group’s membership that an old face can bring fresh leadership. She will probably also have her work cut out convincing British businesses to stick with the organisation as it attempts to recover from a scandal which has damaged its reputation among businesses and politicians alike.",Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Business; UK news; Corporate governance,Business
2021-08-17T10:53:03Z,BHP to shift oil and gas assets into Woodside Petroleum as part of major overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/17/bhp-to-shift-oil-and-gas-assets-into-woodside-petroleum-as-part-of-major-overhaul,"Global miner BHP is planning a major overhaul, simplifying its company structure and dumping its oil and gas assets into Woodside Petroleum, creating one of the biggest energy producers in the world. BHP on Tuesday declared a bumper profit due to high iron ore prices, as it announced it will bring together its Australian and UK arms into one company and leave the London Stock Exchange, which could have ramifications for investors. BHP’s profit soared 42% to reach $US11.3bn in the year to the end of June, driven by record margins of 64% on iron ore from its mines in the Pilbara. However, the company’s Mt Arthur coalmine in New South Wales is also now a $200m liability after dramatically collapsing in value over the past year amid a gloomy outlook for fossil fuels due to increasing competition from cheap renewable energy. Outlining its plans to tip its oil and gas assets into Perth-based Woodside as early as mid-next year, the BHP chief executive, Mike Henry, insisted it was “not at all” related to BHP’s ambitious target to reduce carbon emissions by 30%. Shares in the newly enlarged Woodside, which BHP says will rank among the top 10 oil and gas producers in the world, will then be distributed to BHP’s shareholders. This means shareholders will be able to sell their shares if they want to reduce their exposure to fossil fuel assets. BHP currently operates as two separate companies, BHP Group Ltd, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, and BHP Group Plc, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The structure, a legacy of BHP’s 2001 takeover of UK-listed Billiton, has been criticised by some shareholders because of the extra costs it imposes and the difficulties it causes in allowing investors to benefit from franking credits on their dividends. BHP plans to retain a listing in London but collapsing the existing structure may make it more difficult for UK-based institutional investors to justify holding BHP shares, with Henry saying current rules meant the company would be kicked out of key index the FTSE 100. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If shareholders approve, BHP expects unification to occur some time in the first six months of next year with the changes involving Woodside Petroleum to follow. BHP is also a year into a two-year effort to sell its thermal coal assets, although it plans to retain coking coal, which is used to make steel. It sold its Colombian coal assets to Glencore in June but has so far been unable to find a buyer for Mt Arthur, in NSW’s Hunter Valley. The mine was worth $2bn less than two years ago but in January its value was cut by $1.5bn, to between $325m and $455m, and it was slashed again on Tuesday to become a $200m liability. “We now actually have a negative value on the books for NSW energy coal, which is reflective of the rehab and restoration side of things that we need to reflect,” the chief financial officer, David Lamont, said. Asked if BHP had left it too late to sell Mt Arthur and might instead have to shut it down, Henry said the company had given itself two years to offload the mine. “We are where we are,” he said. “All options remain open for consideration.” BHP also took an additional US$1.2bn hit over the 2015 Samarco dam disaster, which continues to plague the miner. Michael Allen, an accountant and former mining executive who is now treasurer of advocacy group Sustainable Energy Now, said ditching oil and gas was a good move for BHP. “The world’s biggest mining company should really get rid of oil and gas, just to make their policy on carbon reduction acceptable,” he said. He said BHP should also get on with selling its thermal coal assets. “The fact is coal assets, especially east coast, are worth less every day,” Allen said. He said distributing Woodside shares to BHP investors gave them options. “You’d expect the green shareholders to dump them and the non-green shareholders to hug them to their chests,” he said. He said that on its own Woodside was struggling because it had no expansion plans apart from Scarborough, a gas field off the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia that is heavily opposed by environmentalists. “Woodside has had a strategic problem for a while, because their future’s looking grim,” he said. But the BHP deal would give Woodside $15bn of operating assets that it could make money from in the short term. “It’s one thing to have a project that’s in operation now, it’s another thing to go off to people who believe in ESG [environmental, social and governance] and ask them to invest in this project that’s going to destroy the world,” he said.",Business; BHP; London; Australia news; Business; Mining; Oil; Gas; Coal; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Environment; Woodside,Australia news
2021-05-05T19:16:07Z,Indivior’s UK shareholders have chance to put teeth into clawback clauses | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/05/indivior-uk-shareholders-have-chance-to-put-teeth-into-clawback-clauses-shaun-thaxter,"“We recognise that our remuneration structure is different in some respects from a typical UK package,” said Daniel Phelan, the chair of Indivior’s remuneration committee, in the company’s annual report. You bet. The difference isn’t only the size of the rewards that executives can be paid at the London-listed but US-focused drugs company spun out of Reckitt Benckiser in 2014. It is also the fact that a chief executive can be sent to prison for six months and still be regarded as a “good leaver” for bonus purposes. That probably wouldn’t happen at a “typical” UK company. As Phelan’s committee viewed things, the critical factor in the case of Shaun Thaxter was the lack of findings of “personal wrongdoing or malfeasance” against him in a case involving false and misleading statements about the safety of Suboxone Film, an opioid addiction treatment. Instead, the former chief executive pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour under the US “responsible corporate officer doctrine”, which can hold executives accountable for the actions of others in an organisation. Come on, though, Indivior itself paid $600m (£430m) to settle investigations into mis-selling Suboxone Film. That bill alone, you would think, would cause a pay committee to cancel incentive shares for executives under clawback clauses in contracts. Instead, Thaxter was allowed to keep all outstanding awards, worth about $1.65m, and the board paid tribute to “leadership that produced years of positive operational performance” before all the trouble. Maybe this is the American way, but there’s no reason why UK shareholders should go along with it. They vote on Thursday on the pay report. A thumbs up would send a message that clawback provisions are essentially meaningless. Mean and green Tesco? “Is Tesco going green by being mean?,” asks Simon Laffin, a veteran of Flybe, Mitchells &amp; Butlers and many other boardrooms, in his blog. It’s a good question because Tesco’s boast last week that it has become “the first UK retailer to offer sustainability-linked supply chain finance” reads oddly. Tesco’s pitch to suppliers is they can have “a preferential financing rate” via Santander if they sign up to, and meet, targets to reduce carbon emissions. The programme “will help embed sustainability goals throughout our supply chain”, said Ashwin Prasad, Tesco’s chief product officer. Put like that, the innovation may sound warm, virtuous and ESG (environmental, social and governance) friendly. But don’t lose sight of the context. This is supply chain finance – in other words, suppliers are waiting for Tesco to pay its bills, and funding themselves by borrowing against the sums owed. “If you are a Tesco supplier, you might think that its ethical ESG agenda might be better served simply by paying quicker, rather than making you jump through a green reporting hoop in order to pay less for the privilege of waiting to be paid,” wrote Laffin. Fair point. For its part, Tesco says it pays small suppliers within 14 days and has improved terms during the Covid pandemic. Very good, but that rather dodges the argument about mixing two unrelated concerns. Tesco could simply set standards for suppliers on emissions if it wished. And it could reduce the need for supply chain finance by speeding up payment further. Boohoo’s old brands home Boohoo, when it wasn’t tackling allegations of shoddy working practices among its suppliers in Leicester, spent last year buying up the high street’s off-casts. Oasis, Warehouse, Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton arrived as brands to be reinvented in online-only form. That’s quite a collection of old retailing names, but their second acts do not look set for starring roles. Boohoo said it expects the bundle to add only five percentage points to overall growth in revenues this year. In hard numbers, that equates to roughly £90m, which doesn’t feel much. Boohoo’s combined purchase price for the whole lot was also about £90m, so the mopping-up operation still represents a low-risk piece of business. But, in the context of a group with £1.7bn of sales, the main attractions will still be Boohoo, PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal for years to come. Yet the creation of a retirement home service for old brands could yet prove a distraction.",Pharmaceuticals industry; Business; Reckitt Benckiser; Healthcare industry; Tesco; Supermarkets; Boohoo; Retail industry,Business
2021-07-05T18:40:51Z,Morrisons talks up ‘responsible’ buyers – but how sincere is it? | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/jul/05/morrisons-talks-up-responsible-buyers-but-how-sincere-is-it,"How much weight does the board of Morrisons truly attach to selling the company only to a “responsible” owner? A lot, one assumes, because the chairman, Andrew Higginson, used three of his four paragraphs of commentary on the Fortress-led consortium’s £6.3bn offer to heap praise on the would-be owners. Morrisons’ board studied the “overall suitability” of Fortress, the Canadian pension fund CPP and Koch Industries to own “a unique British food-maker and shopkeeper with over 110,000 colleagues and an important role in British production and farming” and decided the combo came up trumps. The bidders had a “full understanding and appreciation of the fundamental character of Morrisons” and had “strong track records and a long-term approach to investing”. There is, perhaps, a slice of hopeful thinking in that analysis. Fortress is not running a charity; it’s managing pools of private capital, just like the potential gatecrashers, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice (CD&amp;R) and Apollo. And note that Fortress’s commitments to good behaviour, covering industry-beating pay rates for staff and so on, were “statements of intention” rather than binding “post-offer undertakings” that can be enforced through the courts by the Takeover Panel, the City policeman on bids. Never mind the small print, though. Morrisons’ board clearly heard enough to be convinced. It raises the intriguing question of what it would do if, after a few more rounds of action, the position came down to this: a pledge-heavy offer – say at 280p a share – from the Fortress consortium versus 290p from CD&amp;R or Apollo with zero promises on debt, sale-and-leasebacks, pensions and pay. Would Morrisons’ board recommend the lower offer, in effect asking shareholders to leave a few pennies on the table for the sake of the workers? The situation may never arise, but the underlying tension clearly exists. Indeed, Fortress may have hyped its commitments in the hope of deterring other bids. CD&amp;R or Apollo could match some, but it’s hard to see how either could credibly meet the Morrisons board’s apparent wish for a “long-term” owner. On day one, they will be committed to selling within five years or so because that’s their purer private equity model. Alternatively, Morrisons’ board could do the traditional thing reluctantly: forget the behavioural stuff, plead fiduciary duty and back the highest cash bid. In that case, it would have to explain why it bothered gushing over Fortress in the first place. Or it could fudge the question by saying shareholders should decide. It could hold two votes if necessary, with the cuddlier one given first shot. There have been occasions in the past when boards have recommended lower offers but it has invariably been for financial reasons – doubts over a bidder’s financing, for example. An invitation to think of the workers would be a genuine novelty. One rather hopes we get that far. We would all benefit from an insight into whether the City’s newly acquired rhetoric on ESG (environmental, social and governance) is mostly marketing or is firmly held belief. Either way, Morrisons’ board, having raised the responsibility question, cannot easily make it disappear. The point about principles is that you’re meant to stick to them. Property the key to Morrisons’ true value And here comes Legal &amp; General Investment Management, one self-styled “responsible steward of capital”, making a different point about the battle for Morrisons. “The company has thus far disclosed little information about the current value of its properties, both the retail stores and the distribution assets,” says the fund manager Andrew Koch. That’s true, and Morrisons ought to rectify the situation. About 90% of City analysts’ debate about the value of supermarket business relates to exciting short-term factors such as sales, profit margins and market shares. The duller part that gets far less attention is the property holdings. Morrisons’ assets have stopped falling in value, according to the last update that put the freehold property at £5.8bn, but what’s the outlook if stores can now double up as picking centres for online deliveries? And what’s the long-term view on those Morrisons farms? The company should show its hand more fully. Yes, Fortress’s 254p looks pretty against the old share price, but shareholders only get to sell their company once. A detailed look at the property portfolio is essential. The bidders, you can be sure, will have done their own homework.",Business; Morrisons; Retail industry; Supermarkets; Mergers and acquisitions,Business
2021-09-18T12:00:06Z,The computer chip industry has a dirty climate secret,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/18/semiconductor-silicon-chips-carbon-footprint-climate,"The semiconductor industry has a problem. Demand is booming for silicon chips, which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines, but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint. The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will, in part, rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles, solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant, or fab, can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste. As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight, it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest chipmaker, which supplies chips to Apple, pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability”, said the TSMC chairman, Mark Lui. But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge. TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity, according to figures from Greenpeace, predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022, and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year, the country’s worst in a half century, which pitted chipmakers against farmers. In the US, a single fab, Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo, Arizona, produced nearly 15,000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year, about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water, enough to fill about 1,400 Olympic swimming pools, and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy. Chip manufacturing, rather than energy consumption or hardware use, “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices, the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper. A global shortage of high-end chips, as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs, has increased focus on the industry. In a tight market, automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue, far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple, who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones, laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month, while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September. In an attempt to increase production, many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry. The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week. These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030, and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows, so too will its carbon footprint. However, amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers, the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint. “Recently, I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront,” said Sohini Dasgupta, principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors. Two years ago, she said, the industry “was sitting on the fence, in the middle of the pack, saying: ‘Yes, sustainability is important, but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails, what our company’s doing, what other companies are doing,” she said. The rise of ethical investing has helped, according to Mark Li, a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years, the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before,” Li said. Ultimately, this changes how companies behave, he added. Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, as did TSMC, but with a deadline of 2050. Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions, said a company spokesperson, Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted, buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait. The deal, which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement, has benefits for TSMC, said Shashi Barla, renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply, it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks, “killing two birds with one stone”, he said. TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry, said Clifton Fonstad, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”. As well as switching to renewables, chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs, said Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain &amp; Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside”, he said, and to cut emissions, “the easy part is the facility itself”. Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature, humidity, and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure, and another lower, using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure. They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used, said Huili Grace Xing, an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials. There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process, many of which have a significant climate impact. TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing, said Michael Pittroff, a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals. In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients, Pittroff said, he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine, with a lower global warming impact. Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide, for example, has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts. But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer, such as an etching gas, is really hard to alter once a fab is operating, said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it, you basically never want to change it”, Hanbury said. Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases, especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches, I am sure the others will,” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t, then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.” To some observers of the chip business, the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals, said Li. “They have very good margins, and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost, they can afford it. And increasingly, customers are willing to pay more for a greener device,” he said.",Environment; Business; Electrocomponents; Renewable energy; Energy; Taiwan; Greenhouse gas emissions,Environment
2023-07-18T20:24:54Z,Commonwealth Games crisis shows model for hosting big events is broken | Cath Bishop,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jul/18/commonwealth-games-crisis-shows-model-for-hosting-big-events-is-broken,"The decision by Victoria’s government to pull out of hosting the Commonwealth Games issues a broader challenge to sports leaders, governments, but also athletes and citizens around the world. This crisis goes beyond the growing indifference to the purpose of the event, originally founded as the Empire Games in 1930. The Olympics faces a similar struggle with just two bids for the 2024 Summer Games, with Paris and Los Angeles awarded 2024 and 2028 respectively, and only Brisbane bidding for 2032. In the race for the 2022 Winter Olympics, at least five potential host cities, all western democracies, withdrew from the bidding process after voter referendums or public polling indicated a lack of local support, leaving only Beijing and Almaty in the running. The old model for hosting major events is broken and a new one is needed. The costs of the original model are simply too high. This isn’t just about the financial costs alone any more, despite the Victoria government’s rationale and the consistently woeful history of budget overruns and poor budget management of sporting events for decades. We are now aware of other costs that matter, barely visible when these sports events were first set up. Financial costs can no longer be calculated in isolation without reckoning the social value, environmental impact and governance of these events. Just as businesses now justify and measure their performance in the areas of ESG (environmental, social, governance) impact, so sport needs to create ways to embed these beyond PR and rhetoric. While recent hosting bids include sections on sustainability and legacy, giving a nod to the changing priorities of our world, these have been add‑ons rather than the driving force of the bid. The game to win hosting rights has been as much about pleasing the respective awarding international bodies as about providing what the citizens of the host city need. This balance clearly has to change. Questions of social value force us to ask: who benefits from hosting these events? A litany of stories of negative experiences of local residents from Montreal to Rio de Janeiro has shown how much of an afterthought this has been. How far the London 2012 Olympics actually brought positive regeneration to east London remains hotly debated over a decade later. Qatar brought a whole new level of human cost with the atrocious conditions for the construction workers leading up to the World Cup. But it’s harder to cover up these human costs now and western audiences are using their voices to reject being part of this. Added to this, large-scale negative environmental impacts from sport question the very future of international sporting events. Just as the music industry is considering whether mega world tours of superstars are environmentally sustainable in the future, so the sports world needs to find a way to justify the international travel and environmental destruction associated with major events. Many athletes are increasingly environmentally conscious, with the Olympic canoeing gold medallist Etienne Stott setting up and leading Champions for Earth to engage athletes in growing awareness and activism on climate issues. More and more athletes want to decrease how much they travel, as unease grows about the ethics of the environmental footprint left by sport. There needs to be a serious forum for this debate to connect athletes, governments and citizens to find better solutions. The climate itself is already starting to play a role. With the rate of temperature increase, fewer locations are becoming viable. I found it plenty hot enough competing at the Athens Olympics in 2004, when temperatures were in the 30s – it’s hard to imagine competing at an Olympics in Athens again with temperatures regularly over 40C. The experience of Qatar with its air-conditioned stadiums at excruciating financial and environmental cost is not an attractive one to repeat. Although there are examples of governments invested in sportswashing at any cost in order to project themselves on a global scale, with Beijing, Sochi and Qatar looming large in our memories, the urgent question is whether we can create any viable alternative? Not just massaging the old model with some good PR, but actually changing the purpose, values, experience and impact of sporting events. The fact that citizens are speaking up could be a positive. People care about sport, it has always had the power to engage individuals and communities and create powerful moments of change. Recently in Boston and Vancouver, citizens demanded or voted that their governments pull out of the race to host the Olympics. Although this sounds a death knell to the existing approach, it could also signal an opportunity and desire to do things differently. What would a bid look like if local citizens were part of it (not just part of a glitzy parade or token aspect), if they got to determine how it could support their communities? What if they were part of decision-making from the start? The use of open source platforms has shown how groups such as the Climate Assembly UK can be used to achieve consensus on difficult topics across the political and social spectrum. The digital space is increasingly used by regional mayors and governments, from the Better Reykjavik project to the Taiwanese government, to enable civic participation, dialogue and consensus-building. When Birmingham stepped in to take on the 2022 Commonwealth Games, after the South African city of Durban failed to meet the Commonwealth Games Federation standards, it did so fully conscious of the responsibility and opportunity to reimagine and reinvent the event. Birmingham deliberately placed the Commonwealth Games within a wider sporting and cultural programme. With sports events throughout 2023 from cricket to the Harlem Globetrotters to the IBSA World Games (for blind and partially sighted athletes) and a six-month long arts festival, sports and political leaders tried to connect more deeply than with previous rotating circus-style visits. In contrast to the International Olympic Committee’s “rule 50”, competitors were allowed to use their platform publicly to highlight issues such as race, sexual orientation or social injustice. On the field of play, the Commonwealth Games is the only major international competition that features athletes with a disability alongside able-bodied athletes. The Australian swimmer Rowan Crothers spoke out publicly after the announcement from Victoria that this is a blow to inclusion, saying: “For some athletes, a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games means more than a gold medal at the Paralympics … recognition and equality can mean more than achievement.” This has been a way in which the Commonwealth Games has sought to change the values and what it represents to offer more to those watching, taking part and hosting. There’s no doubt that Games remain deeply important to the athletes that compete. For many sports, like netball, it is the pinnacle of their competition, and there is no doubt that many athletes are feeling disappointed reading the decision taken by Victoria’s leaders. Multisport events are a crucial opportunity to learn on a bigger stage, for some, a milestone on the way to preparing for an Olympics, for others, the biggest event they’ll experience. Athletes need to be part of discussions around reimagining and recreating a sustainable future for sporting events. It’s clear that outside authoritarian regimes, hosting international sporting events can no longer be imposed on local populations. We need to avoid a world where we find the Olympics and World Cups rotating around Moscow, Beijing and Dubai. Citizens need to be involved from the start, designing how any sports event complements and fits in with their economic, social and environmental vision for their city or state. We shouldn’t ask citizens simply to “back the bid” but to join in and “build the bid”.",Commonwealth Games; Commonwealth Games 2022; International Olympic Committee; Olympic Games; Winter Olympics; Sport politics; Victoria; Sport,Sport
2021-02-10T14:31:42Z,JP Morgan hires Chuka Umunna for senior sustainability role,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/10/jp-morgan-hires-chuka-umunna-for-senior-sustainability-role,"The former high-profile Labour politician Chuka Umunna has been hired by the US bank JP Morgan to lead its European environmental, social and governance (ESG) work. Umunna, 42, who was an employment lawyer before becoming a Labour MP in 2010, follows in the footsteps of other former UK lawmakers who have entered top finance jobs after leaving politics. His appointment, first reported by the Financial Times, was announced to staff via a memo on Wednesday morning. The son of a Nigerian businessman and an Irish-English mother, in his new role Umunna becomes one of Britain’s most senior black bankers. As a full-time employee, Umunna will advise JP Morgan’s corporate clients on how to make their investments, takeover deals and fundraising more sustainable and socially responsible. Demand for ESG advisory services has grown, as asset managers such as Legal &amp; General and BlackRock heap pressure on companies that fail to address the climate crisis. Umunna moves to JP Morgan from the communications company Edelman, which he joined last July to become head of its ESG consultancy team. He will drop a string of non-executive director roles to take the job at the Wall Street company, stepping down from companies including software firm Vista Equity Partners and UK fintech firm Digital Identity Net UK. JP Morgan has not revealed the value of Umunna’s financial package. The former politician was the Labour MP for Streatham in south London for nine years until 2019. Although Umunna was never in government, during his political career he rose to become a well-known figure in the shadow cabinet and served as the shadow business secretary. Umunna briefly entered the race to become Labour leader in 2015 but withdrew from the leadership contest, citing the impact the increased level of attention would have on him and his family. He left the Labour party, then led by Jeremy Corbyn, along with a group of other breakaway MPs to join the short-lived Change UK party in 2019. Umunna’s political career came to an end after he joined the Liberal Democrats, vacated his south London seat and unsuccessfully contested the Cities of London and Westminster constituency in the 2019 general election. Several other former senior British politicians have entered top finance roles after leaving frontbench politics. The former Conservative chancellor Sajid Javid was hired as a senior adviser to JP Morgan in 2020, in a return to his previous career in banking, although he remains an MP. The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair was hired as a global adviser at the Wall Street bank in 2008. George Osborne, Conservative chancellor from 2010 to 2016 and known for having a portfolio of jobs since leaving office, took up a full-time role earlier this month as a partner at the London-based boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw.

2022-11-24T19:21:03Z,Adidas to investigate claims Kanye West showed pornography to staff,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/24/adidas-kanye-west-investigation,"The sportswear giant Adidas is to launch an independent investigation into allegations of misconduct made this week against the US rapper and fashion designer Kanye West, including that he showed pornography to staff at company meetings. The claims by unidentified staff at Yeezy and Adidas, which surfaced in a Rolling Stone article on Tuesday, included allegations that the musician, who has changed his name to Ye, showed an intimate picture of his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, in job interviews, and that his “problematic behavior” was overlooked by Adidas management. Staff allegations included in a letter to Adidas obtained by the outlet included claims that Adidas “turned their moral compass off” and failed to protect employees from “years of verbal abuse, vulgar tirades and bullying attacks”. Adidas said in a statement on Thursday that “it is currently not clear whether the accusations made in an anonymous letter are true” but that it took the claims “very seriously” and had “taken the decision to launch an independent investigation of the matter immediately to address the allegations”. The sportswear brand initially said it would not “discuss private conversations, details or events that lead to our decision to terminate the Adidas Yeezy partnership” but it had “been and continue[d] to be actively engaged in conversations with our employees about the events that led to our decision to end the partnership”. In one alleged 2017 incident, Ye yelled at a senior female member of the design team that a Yeezy sneaker was not up to standards. West reportedly looked down at his foot, and up at the employee, and said: “I want you to make me a shoe I can fuck.” Analysts estimate that the Yeezy partnership accounts for 7% of the group’s revenue. Adidas has said it believes losing Yeezy will halve its expected profits this year. It is not yet clear if Adidas will continue to sell the designs, which the company owns, without Yeezy’s logo, which it does not. The decision to launch an inquiry comes after one of Adidas’ largest shareholders, Union Investment, demanded clarity about the alleged incidents. Last month Adidas abandoned a licensing and design contract with Ye after he made antisemitic threats. Janne Werning, head of ESG capital markets and stewardship at Union Investment, which holds a 1% stake in Adidas, told the Financial Times: “Adidas needs to disclose when the management and the supervisory board was first informed about the internal allegations.”",Kanye West; Music; Fashion; Life and style,Music
2023-02-02T19:30:53Z,Shell’s lack of ambition is maddening: it’s time to speed up transition to renewables,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/feb/02/shell-renewables-transition,"The chief executive has changed at Shell but the song remains the same. The energy transition will be “balanced” and “we intend to remain disciplined while delivering compelling shareholder returns,” declared Wael Sawan. Translation: the company will not use the sudden arrival of spectacular financial riches to boost spending on renewables. Being “disciplined” is, of course, an admirable ambition when presented starkly and without context. No chief executive of any company is ever likely to tell investors that the plan is to take wild punts on projects with little prospect of a decent return. But there is a world of nuance between the extremes. The infuriating thing about Shell, after a year in which profits reached almost $40bn (£32bn), is the refusal to contemplate even a modest course-correction in favour of a faster energy transition. Distributions to shareholders via dividends and buy-backs were cranked up to $26bn last year, but spending on the renewables and energy solutions division was just $3.5bn within the overall capital expenditure outlay of $24.8bn. The bald capex figures are misleading, argued Shell, because much of the low- and zero-carbon spending falls under operating expenditure or within other divisions. OK, but even on the company’s broader metric, the greener stuff came out at only one-third of the whole – and, critically, exactly the same ratio is pencilled in for this year. The disinclination to pick up the pace on low-carbon is a stronger complaint than the one about the rate of windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas profits. On the tax front, there is a fair argument that the UK government, at its second attempt, landed in roughly the right zone. An effective headline tax rate of 75% is one of the highest in the world and Norway – the example usually cited by those arguing for a “proper” formula – is only slightly higher at 78%. Yes, Shell’s $134m UK tax liability for 2022 was tiny in the context of its worldwide tax bill of $13bn and even the projected $500m-plus for the UK in 2023 is modest. But, even if the investment allowances within the North Sea energy profits levy were scrapped overnight (which would not be a risk-free policy given the need for secure supplies, particularly of gas, for some time yet), the Treasury would not suddenly be swimming in extra billions courtesy of Shell. The hard fact is that the company generates less than 5% of its revenues in the UK. Thus the lack of greater ambition of renewables is the maddening bit. The company can – and did – point to things it is doing: $2bn spent on a Danish biofuels business; an acquisition in India; a solar expansion in the US; a big windfarm in Scotland. But one still comes back to the unchanged ratio of one-third of overall expenditure. One shouldn’t be naive about the pressures on Sawan from shareholders. Even as they trot out their ESG (environment, social and governance) marketing spiel, many investors are delighted that they can tick the “transition” box at Shell while collecting bumper distributions. They wouldn’t change a thing. Indeed, the grumble from a few City analysts was that the current quarter’s buy-back wasn’t more than $4bn. When Sawan talks about being a “compelling” investment, he’s nodding to that audience – the one that points out that the shares of true transition laggards such as ExxonMobil are more highly rated. Even so, it was striking that Sawan sounded only mildly excited by the green subsidies on offer in the US under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Some potential projects may become more attractive, he said, and it was “definitely an interesting stimulus”. Only interesting? The rest of the world sees the subsidies as lavish and an open goal for ambitious companies. Sawan is obviously right that governments also need to move faster in practical ways. His grumble about the slowness of planning and permitting processes on renewables infrastructure is echoed by others. But it is also fair to expect companies that claim to be in the “transition” business to raise their own sights when given the financial resources to do so. The world has changed.

2023-02-26T09:00:18Z,Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton review – the root of all evil,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/26/birnam-wood-by-eleanor-catton-review-the-root-of-all-evil-luminaries-booker-prize,"In his great critical work The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode wrote about the end-directedness of fiction, the way that novels rehearse and forestall their endings – a process he called peripeteia. One thing he doesn’t discuss in that book is what happens when an ending entirely alters your understanding of the text. There are numerous examples of tricksy plot twists – think Fingersmith or Fight Club – but I’m not sure I’ve read a novel whose ending so brilliantly and brutally changes our perception of what has gone before as Birnam Wood, Eleanor Catton’s follow-up to her Booker-winning The Luminaries. For nine-tenths of its 400 pages, Birnam Wood comes across as a Kiwi Jonathan Franzen – a smart, satirical novel about the clash between a gardening collective and a scheming tech billionaire. There are numerous Franzen tropes here – countercultural/capitalist discord; the striving for ideological purity; the relentless and vampiric march of big business; environmental crisis. There’s even a rare bird – here it’s an orange-fronted parakeet. Birnam Wood is like a Franzen greatest hits album until its glorious, apocalyptic final pages enlarge and complicate our understanding of its message. Mira Bunting is one of the principal figures in Birnam Wood, founder of a group of guerrilla gardeners who tend 18 plots of vacant land around Christchurch and dream of self-sufficiency, which they describe as “breaking good”. Mira is 29 but, like many of her friends, appears trapped in an extended adolescence. She lives with Shelley Noakes, her “sensible, predictable, dependable sidekick”. Birnam Wood has grown into a thriving (if still decidedly loss-making) project, whose aims are to grow food and flowers while operating “as much as possible outside a capitalist framework”. Already, though, capitalism has sought to subsume projects like theirs. “Birnam Wood was now a startup, a pop-up, the brainchild of ‘creatives’; it was organic, it was local; it was a bit like Uber; it was a bit like Airbnb.” Mira and Shelley are resistant to this linguistic colonisation of their world, although they also recognise the need to make the project financially viable. That wish seems suddenly to be granted with the arrival of the charismatic, tracksuited billionaire Robert Lemoine. Lemoine’s company, Autonomo, builds drones and has recently embarked on a joint venture with a New Zealand pest control entrepreneur, Sir Owen Darvish. Lemoine has also bought the Darvish family home in Thorndike, a (fictional) mountain village in the (also fictional) Korowai national park. Lemoine claims that he’s just another “doomsteader” buying up a New Zealand bolthole. Instead, we learn that he has discovered rare earth minerals in the park and has begun mining them, a process that has already unleashed environmental devastation. Lemoine meets Mira as she’s out scouting for potential Birnam Wood planting sites. He offers her land and cash – the dream of “breaking good” seems to have arrived. Only Tony Gallo seems sceptical of the collective’s sudden good fortune. Tony, a co-founder of Birnam Wood who has been away travelling for several years, is horrified to find that capitalism has taken hold of the gardening project. He makes an impassioned speech at the group’s hui (meet-up) and is shown the door. The rage that energises him here, which he sums up later as anger “at the sheer inexorability of late-capitalist degradation not just of the environment, not just of civic institutions, not just of intellectual and political ideals, but worse, of his own expectations, of what he even felt was possible any more…” is the sustaining rage of the novel. Mira, Shelley and the rest of Birnam Wood (and, by extension, the reader) initially see Tony as a throwback, his views as incompatible with the new spirit of the collective. In fact, the events of the novel seem designed to assert definitively that there can be no accommodation between capitalism and projects that seek to deliver benefits that are communal, cooperative and non-financial. We are living in the age of the B Corp and caring capitalism, of ESG and green investment. Birnam Wood’s message, underlined in blood-red ink by its extraordinary conclusion, is that these attempts to shape a gentler form of capitalism are doomed to failure. Greed is not only not good, it is actively evil and aggressively expansionist. As Birnam Wood’s benevolent beginnings are warped and tainted by their association with big tech, we recognise that only by reclaiming the purity and radicalism of the group’s origins can Mira, Shelley and Tony hope to rescue it. Birnam Wood is a dark and brilliant novel about the violence and tawdriness of late capitalism. Its ending, though, propels it from a merely very good book into a truly great one.

2021-02-22T17:39:16Z,G4S set for takeover by Allied Universal Security Services,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/g4s-set-for-38bn-takeover-by-allied-universal-security-services,"Security outsourcing firm G4S looks set to be taken over by Allied Universal Security Services, after rival Canadian suitor GardaWorld said it would not be increasing its existing bid to trump the US firm’s £3.8bn offer. G4S, which operates services including running four British prisons and managing 21 UK Covid-19 test centres, saw its stock jump as the long-running bidding war between GardaWorld and Allied Universal intensified. However, on Monday GardaWorld said that it would not be increasing its 235p-a-share offer, which valued G4S at £3.68bn (£2.61bn), bringing to an end the auction process called by the UK Takeover Panel. The company said that while it believes there is “no better” owner for G4S, it would not overpay for a company facing environmental, social and governance scandals. “We are disciplined buyers and we will not overpay for a company with systemic [environmental, social and governance] issues that continue to come to light,” said Stéphan Crétier, founder and chairman of GardaWorld. “There are better and less risky opportunities available to GardaWorld.” G4S has faced heavy criticism after being stripped of several government contracts, including running HMP Birmingham, but most of its work is in the corporate sector. G4S runs cash-handling services and provides security operations for clients including the new Hinckley Point C nuclear power station. GardaWorld’s final offer falls short of American rival Allied Universal’s 245p-a-share bid lodged in December, which the board of G4S recommended shareholders vote to accept. G4S employs 533,000 staff across 85 countries, with its biggest business in North America. The directors of Allied Universal and G4S said the combined company would create a “world-leading integrated security business with revenues of approximately $18bn [£12.8bn at today’s conversion rate]”. The company’s share price closed down nearly 10% at 243p, just below the level of Allied Universal’s offer per share.",G4S; Business; Mergers and acquisitions; UK news,Business
2022-04-08T14:09:45Z,Paypal founder launches tirade against ‘gerontocracy’ over bitcoin,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/08/peter-thiel-paypal-founder-tirade-gerontocracy-bitcoin,"Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a Donald Trump ally, has accused a “finance gerontocracy” including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon of hindering bitcoin’s progress. The outspoken libertarian tech investor described multibillionaire Buffett, the world’s richest investor, as the “sociopathic grandpa from Omaha” in a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami on Thursday. Thiel’s address began with an analysis of the investment merits of cryptocurrencies but soon escalated into a tirade against the financial establishment, including “bankrupt” central banks and the “hate factory” of ESG – which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance and is a cornerstone of responsible investing principles. “It’s a movement, and it’s a political question, whether this movement is going to succeed, or whether the enemies of a movement are going to succeed in stopping us,” he said, shortly before naming Buffett as “enemy number one”. In a speech that also cited JP Morgan’s chief executive Dimon and Larry Fink, the chair of investment group BlackRock, he said institutions run by a “finance gerontocracy” were hindering the cryptocurrency. Thiel said choosing not to invest in bitcoin was a “deeply political choice” and the financial establishment should be told “you have to get onboard on this”. Thiel added that the $830bn (£638bn) bitcoin market could rival the global equities market, worth more than $100tn. Comparing bitcoin with conventional capitalism, he said, to applause: “Woke companies are sort of quasi-controlled by the government in a way that bitcoin never will be.” Thiel, 54, is the most high profile Trump supporter in the tech industry, having donated millions of dollars to Trump’s 2016 campaign and served on the ex-president’s transition team. Casting the progress of bitcoin in political terms, Thiel rounded off his speech with a libertarian rallying cry depicting cryptocurrency’s progress as a battle between ESG and a “revolutionary youth movement”. “If we had to summarise this in one frame, it is … the finance gerontocracy that runs the country through whatever silly virtue signalling, hate factory term like ESG they have versus what I would … think of as a revolutionary youth movement.” He added: “We have to just go out from this conference and take over the world.” Thiel announced in February that he was stepping down as a board director at Facebook’s parent, Meta. Thiel has been on the Meta board since 2005 and is a confidant of Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.",Peter Thiel; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Warren Buffett; Jamie Dimon; PayPal; E-commerce; Technology; Business,Technology
2021-11-29T16:30:06Z,‘Right to know’: critics blast Coalition attempt to shield Future Fund from FOI laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/30/right-to-know-critics-blast-coalition-attempt-to-shield-future-fund-from-foi-laws,"Legislation scheduled to be debated in federal parliament this week would shield Australia’s Future Fund from freedom of information requests such as the one that revealed the sovereign wealth fund is investing in weapons manufacturers that sell arms to the Myanmar military. The Australian government’s Future Fund has more than $157m invested with 14 publicly traded companies that have done business with the sanctioned Myanmar military, which has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Australia has investments with Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a Chinese state-owned weapons manufacturer that has sold combat aircraft to the Myanmar military, and Bharat Electronics, an Indian government-controlled company which has sold radar and sonar equipment to the regime. The Coalition’s Investment Funds Legislation Amendment Bill 2021 is slated to be debated in the Senate on Wednesday, the penultimate parliamentary sitting day of this year and possibly of this parliament. The proposed law would exempt the Future Fund from releasing any details about its investments under FOI laws, including, as the department of finance confirmed to a Senate inquiry, information about which companies the fund has invested in and how much. Greens senator Nick McKim has tabled amendments that would remove the Future Fund’s FOI exemption and require the fund to publicly report its investments every six months. The Future Fund, which controls nearly $250bn in funds and has 182 employees, has previously said the 10 to 20 freedom of information requests it receives each year are “administratively burdensome”. McKim told the Guardian it was “grossly inappropriate” Australia’s sovereign wealth fund was investing public money in arms manufacturing, “let alone in Chinese state-owned corporations supplying weapons to Myanmar’s military regime”. He said the fund should immediately divest its investments in arms manufacturers, and argued the proposed government legislation was unjustified and unnecessary. “Rather than more secrecy, we need far greater scrutiny of their investments,” McKim said. “Under the government’s proposal, we would never have found out about the Future Fund’s investments in companies linked to the Myanmar military. The Australian people have a right to know how their money is being invested and into which companies.” Introducing the bill into parliament in August, the employment minister, Stuart Robert, said having Future Fund investments subject to the scrutiny of the FOI regime presented an “investment and governance risk”. “The exemption under FOI laws will increase confidence in the operation of the law and allow important engagement with investment managers to successfully invest … on behalf of the government where returns benefit all Australians,” he said. Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, has faced international condemnation over its 2017 “clearance operations” – executed with “genocidal intent” according to UN investigators – against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state, which included mass killings, including of children, as well as gang rapes, arson and torture. More than 25,000 Rohingya were killed, and 700,000 driven over Myanmar’s border into Bangladesh. The Tatmadaw, which has ruled Myanmar for much of its independent history, forcibly took control of the country in a coup in February and has since killed more than 1,200 civilians in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The chief executive of Save the Children, Paul Ronalds, said Australia’s Future Fund was established for the benefit of future generations, not to fund companies that provide weapons used by regimes accused of committing mass violence against children in conflict. “The information uncovered highlights the need for greater transparency of Australia’s investment in weapons manufacturers with the Australian public.” Rawan Arraf, the executive director at the Australian Centre for International Justice, said FOI laws had exposed the Future Fund’s “astonishingly inadequate” environmental, social and corporate governance, and responsible investment policy. “If it wasn’t for access to freedom of information, we wouldn’t know just how bad these investment activities are. Now, that mechanism is at serious risk. These investments should be reviewed and scrutinised by the public.” Arraf said Australian taxpayer funds should be invested ethically. Clancy Moore, the Australian director at Publish What You Pay, said “transparency means Australians now know that our sovereign wealth fund is invested in weapons companies and big gas companies, like Total and Chevron”. “The proposed change would keep these investments secret from Australians.” Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung said: “It is deplorable that Australia’s Future Fund is seeking to profit from companies arming the Myanmar military and effectively financing its campaign of terror.” The Future Fund did not answer questions about its investments in companies linked to the Tatmadaw. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “In line with its mandate from government, the Future Fund has built a broadly diversified portfolio which includes passive investments through external investment managers in thousands of entities globally. “The fund has a well-established policy on environmental, social and governance matters and exclusions which takes account of its objectives, legislation, investment strategy, Australian law and the treaties that the Australian government has entered and ratified.” Neither the Aviation Industry Corporation of China nor Bharat Electronics responded to questions from the Guardian.",Australia news; Australian politics; Canberra; Coalition,Australia news
2023-02-21T19:18:41Z,US supreme court lets Arkansas law penalising Israel boycotts stand,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/feb/21/us-supreme-court-arkansas-anti-boycott-israel-law,"The US supreme court has let stand an Arkansas law penalising boycotts of Israel that has provided the model for a proliferation of similar legislation to protect oil companies, gun makers and other contentious industries from political protest movements. The supreme court declined to hear an appeal from the editor of the Arkansas Times, Alan Leveritt, after a federal court upheld a law requiring him to sign a commitment not to boycott Israel in order to receive advertising contracts from the state. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) asked the supreme court to overturn the Arkansas law on the grounds it is in conflict with the court’s own ruling 40 years ago that popular boycotts have a long tradition in American history and are protected speech under the first amendment. The law is one of more than 30 passed by states in recent years, backed by both Republicans and Democrats, that require individuals or companies to pledge not to boycott Israel or its settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in order to do business with the state. The laws, pushed by groups such as American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) and the American Jewish Committee with the backing of the Israeli government, are primarily aimed at the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. But they have also provided the template for legislation to curb boycotts of companies over the climate crisis, gun control, factory farming and others issues. Leveritt said he had no intention of boycotting Israel, with which his newspaper does no business, but he refused to sign the commitment because it “requires the Arkansas Times to take a political position in return for advertising”. The editor said he was disappointed that the supreme court declined to take the case but it will not change his position. “We’re not going to sign any political pledges in return for advertising. The supreme court can ignore our our first amendment rights but we’ll continue to exercise them vigorously,” he said. Although a federal court upheld the Arkansas legislation, courts in other jurisdictions have ruled against similar laws and forced some states to weaken their provisions. Kansas revised its law in 2018 in the face of a lawsuit by a Wichita teacher told to sign a pledge not to boycott Israel in order to keep her job. Texas narrowed its law to exclude individuals, and to apply only to larger companies, after a school speech pathologist sued when she lost her contract for refusing to sign a similar commitment. The ACLU and other groups also won judgements in Arizona and Georgia that anti-boycott laws intruded on free speech rights. Leveritt warned that letting the Arkansas law stand will lead to further supression of legitimate political protest against corporate interests. “This is simply a template. It doesn’t stop here. We now have in the Arkansas legislature bills introduced to deny state contracts to financial and banking institutions that have ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) policies that prohibit them from investing in fossil fuels or firearms companies,” he said. “In other states they’ve introduced laws to deny state contracts to any company that subsidises their employees transportation costs if they go out of state for an abortion. So this is just going to be used time after time after time, eventually, the supreme court is going to have to deal with it, or else it’s going to be open season on the first amendment.” Several states have passed the the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act to shield big oil from share selloffs and other measures to protest against the fossil fuel industry’s role in the climate crisis. Other legislation is designed to prevent banks from “denying financing to creditworthy companies solely for the purpose of marketing their environmental or social justice credentials”. The ACLU’s chief litigator in the case, Brian Hauss, described the supreme court’s decision not to take up the case as a “missed opportunity” to clarify the law. “From the Boston tea party to the Montgomery bus boycott to the boycott of apartheid South Africa, Americans have proudly exercised that right to make their voices heard. But if states can suppress boycotts of Israel, then they can suppress boycotts of the National Rifle Association or Planned Parenthood. While we are disappointed with the result in this case, the ACLU will continue to defend the right to boycott in courts and legislatures throughout the country,” he said. Hauss said that given the conflicting rulings from different jurisdictions over the legality of the anti-boycott legislation, he believes the supreme court will have to confront the issue eventually. “Sooner or later they are going to have to address this because already the anti-boycott statutes are proliferating, and I’m sure that is going to continue over the next several years,” he said.",US supreme court; Arkansas; Law (US); Israel; US news,US news
2023-03-17T15:14:33Z,Why did the $212bn tech-lender Silicon Valley bank abruptly collapse?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail,"The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank continues to reverberate, hitting bank stocks, revealing hidden stresses, knocking on to Credit Suisse, and setting off a political blame-game. Why the $212bn tech-lender abruptly collapsed, triggering the most significant financial crisis since 2008, has no single answer. Was it, as some argue, the result of Trump-era regulation rollbacks, risk mismanagement at the bank, sharp interest rate rises after a decade of ultra-low borrowing costs, or perhaps a combination of all three? Federal investigations have begun and lawsuits have been filed and no doubt new issues at the bank will emerge. But for now, here are the main reasons experts believed SVB failed. Trump rollbacks The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders argues that the culprit was an “absurd” 2018 law, supported by Congress and signed by Donald Trump, that undid some of the credit requirements imposed under the Dodd-Frank banking legislation brought in after the 2008 banking crisis. Dodd-Frank required that banks with at least $50bn in assets – banks considered “systemically important” – undergo an annual Federal Reserve “stress test” and maintain certain levels of capital as well as plans for a living will if they failed. SVB’s chief executive, Greg Becker, argued before Congress in 2015 that the $50bn threshold (SVB held $40bn at the time) was unnecessary and his bank, like other “mid-sized” or regional banks, “does not present systemic risks”. Trump said the new bill went a “long way toward fixing” Dodd-Frank, which he called a “job-killer”. But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned before the bill passed that raising the threshold would “increase the likelihood that a large financial firm with assets of between $100bn and $250bn would fail.” Joe Biden says he wants Trump’s rollbacks reversed. SVB’s management The bank didn’t have a chief risk officer (CRO) for some of 2022, a situation that’s now being looked at by the Federal Reserve, according to reports. SVB’s previous CRO, Laura Izurieta, left the company in October but stopped performing the role in April. Another was appointed in December. Early SVB shareholder lawsuits are said to be looking at the key vacancy, especially as the board’s risk committee was meeting frequently before the bank collapsed. “It means perhaps management was hiding something or didn’t want to disclose something, or had disagreements over the risks it was taking,” said Reed Kathrein, a lawyer specializing in shareholder lawsuits, to Bloomberg. “This isn’t greed, necessarily, at the bank level,” said Danny Moses, an investor who predicted the 2008 financial crisis in the book and movie The Big Short. “It’s just bad risk management. It was complete and utter bad risk management on the part of SVB.” SVB and Signature, the second mid-size bank to fail last week, have also been accused of prioritizing social justice over financial management. The Republican House oversight committee chairman, James Comer, called SVB “one of the most woke banks”. The narrative fed into a larger conflict over ESG, or environmental, social and corporate governance-driven investing, that has become a target of conservatives. But the bank’s loans to community and environmental projects were not central to its collapse nor are its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies dissimilar to other banks. The argument also fails to take into account all the banks that existed in 2008, before DEI or “woke” became a part of corporate or political discourse. Nevertheless the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, continued on that theme, telling Fox News, that SVB was “so concerned with DEI and politics and all kinds of stuff. I think that really diverted from them focusing on their core mission.” Inflation and interest rates SVB had benefited from from more than a decade of “zero money” interest rates as billions poured into the bank via tech venture capital. Looking for some kind of a return, it put the money into long-term US treasury bonds. But when interest rates started sharply rising last year, and depositors demanded higher returns, the bank was forced to sell some of those bonds at a loss. When news of that hit social media, tech investors panicked, triggering a classic bank run. From there, it took 36 hours for the second-biggest bank failure in US history to materialize. Before the collapses, investors had been expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a quarter or half a percentage point when the governors meet next week. Now central bankers are in a bind: continue raising rates to tame inflation still running at 6% and risk another break in the financial system, or continue tightening money supply. The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, gave a hint on Thursday when she told the Senate finance committee that “more work needs to be done” on inflation. What happens next? Financial jitters eased on Thursday after Wall Street rode to the rescue and propped up First Republic, another mid-sized bank whose customers were fleeing. But the respite may be brief. Goldman Sachs has raised its prediction for a recession in the next year to 35%, partly as a result of lending drops by regional banks. In the meantime it seems clear that investigators are likely to uncover more problems at the banks as their inquiries continue. Those revelations may trigger more concerns from depositors and investors. On Thursday, the Republican house financial services chairman, Patrick McHenry, said people should hold off on assigning blame for the collapse of SVB and Signature while Congress and watchdogs investigate. “When people jump to these conclusions at this stage of the game – a week in on this really stressed moment for our banking system – it’s unhelpful and quite politically hackish,” McHenry told Bloomberg.",Silicon Valley Bank; Business; Donald Trump; Biden administration; US news; US politics; US economy; Economics; Global economy,Business
2021-11-28T19:00:34Z,Australia’s Future Fund invested in weapons manufacturers that have sold arms to Myanmar military,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/29/australias-future-fund-invested-in-weapons-manufacturers-that-have-sold-arms-to-myanmar-military,"Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, has invested in a Chinese state-controlled weapons manufacturer that has sold combat aircraft to the Myanmar military, which is accused of crimes against humanity. A weapons company controlled by India is also among companies the fund has invested in that are linked with the Myanmar military, documents released under freedom of information laws show. Myanmar’s military seized control of the country in a coup in February and has since killed more than 1,200 civilians in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests. In total, Australia’s Future Fund has invested $157m in 14 publicly traded companies that have done business with the Myanmar military. The fund’s holdings include $4.9m invested in five subsidiaries of the Chinese arms conglomerate Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). It also has $17.8m invested in Bharat Electronics, a company controlled by the Indian government that has supplied materiel to the Myanmar military and was sanctioned between 1998 and 2001 by the US over allegations it was involved in developing nuclear weapons. The sanctions were lifted in 2001 due to India’s cooperation with the US in an anti-terrorism campaign. The Future Fund holds about $200bn in investments made on behalf of the Australian government. It is overseen by a board of guardians chaired by Peter Costello, who was treasurer in the Howard government. Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, has faced international condemnation over its 2017 “clearance operations” – executed with “genocidal intent”, according to UN investigators – against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state, which included mass killings, including of children, as well as gang rapes, arson and torture. More than 25,000 Rohingya were killed, and 700,000 driven over Myanmar’s border into Bangladesh. In 2019, a UN fact-finding mission said China was breaching international humanitarian law because of AVIC’s transfers of military supplies to the Tatmadaw. The bulk of Australia’s investment in AVIC is through subsidiary AviChina, in which it has invested $3.2m. AviChina manufactures the K-8 light combat aircraft, which have been used in military operations in the state of Kachin in Myanmar. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In 2015, the Myanmar military ordered 16 JF-17M combat aircraft from AVIC under a US$560m contract. The first four planes were commissioned in 2018, a year after the Myanmar military’s genocidal campaign against the Rohingya. AVIC also delivered 40 short-range PL-5E missiles and 24 longer-range PL-12 missiles, both of which can be fitted to the JF-17M aircraft, to the Myanmar military in 2018-19, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Arms Transfers Database. Bharat Electronics has continued to sell military supplies to the Tatmadaw since the coup. The company has supplied the Tatmadaw with radar, sonar, a coastal surveillance system and a remote-controlled weapons station, according to export data. The Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung said that since the 1 February coup, the military had killed more than 1,200 civilians, including children, had tortured thousands, committed rape, torched villages and launched indiscriminate airstrikes on homes. “It is deplorable that Australia’s Future Fund is seeking to profit from companies arming the Myanmar military and effectively financing its campaign of terror. “In the name of Australia’s ‘future’, taxpayer funds are being invested in companies that supply the Myanmar military with fighter jets, missiles, radar and provide millions in annual revenue to war criminals. It is time Australia stops profiting at the expense of the lives of Myanmar people and Myanmar’s future.” Other companies in which the Future Fund has investments that have links to the regime include Sinotruk, which makes trucks used by the Tatmadaw but has denied selling the vehicles to the military. The fund has invested $4.4m in Sinotruk, which did not respond to Guardian Australia’s questions. The Future Fund’s largest Tatmadaw-linked investment is in Korean steel giant Posco, which operators the Shwe gas project, a major revenue earner for the Myanmar military. A Posco subsidiary also brokered the sale of a warship for the Myanmar navy. Posco has not responded to questions from the Guardian but Jeong Joon-sung, a Posco director, has previously said: “We don’t think that the gas field business is connected to the military junta.” The Future Fund has also invested $33m in Kirin, which is in joint venture with a Tatmadaw-controlled company in a brewery business in Myanmar. After the coup, Kirin suspended dividend payments to the Tatmadaw company, MEHL, and promised it would stop doing business with it. It has not yet done so and earlier this month MEHL applied to the courts in Myanmar to have the joint venture liquidated – a move Kirin said it opposed “because of doubts about the fairness and appropriateness of the liquidation process”. A Kirin spokesperson, Russell Roll, said the company “has made every effort to negotiate the termination of the joint venture with MEHL”. “However, MEHL has been uncooperative in the negotiations, effectively rejecting our proposals,” he said. “We have been and continue to be deeply concerned by the recent actions of the military in Myanmar, which are against our standards and human rights policy.” The Future Fund did not answer questions about its investments in companies linked to the Tatmadaw. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “In line with its mandate from government, the Future Fund has built a broadly diversified portfolio which includes passive investments through external investment managers in thousands of entities globally. “The fund has a well-established policy on environmental, social and governance matters and exclusions which takes account of its objectives, legislation, investment strategy, Australian law and the treaties that the Australian government has entered and ratified.”",Australia news; Myanmar; World news; Australian economy; Australian foreign policy; Business,Australia news
2020-08-26T17:22:39Z,Mark Carney takes on new job in Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/26/former-bank-of-england-governor-takes-on-new-job-in-canada,"The former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has returned to his roots as an investment banker with a job spearheading environmental and social investing for a Toronto-based asset manager. Carney will join Brookfield Asset Management, which ranks as the world’s second-largest investor in climate-friendly businesses behind the US firm Blackstone with about $550bn in assets under management. Bruce Flatt, Brookfield’s chief executive, said Carney would join the firm as vice-chairman and steer its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment strategy, with the task of marrying double-digit returns with positive social and environmental outcomes. A Canadian who also holds Irish and British citizenships, Carney left the Bank of England in March just before the Covid-19 crisis hit the UK and the government forced the economy into lockdown. City analysts expected him to be courted by the world’s largest investment firms after a lifetime building up one of the most extensive contacts books in the finance industry. Blackrock, which employs the former chancellor George Osborne, was known to be interested. Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker who was governor of Canada’s central bank for five years until 2013 when he took over at Threadneedle Street, was also the head of the G20’s financial stability board for eight years from 2011, which put him in touch with a wide range of finance ministers, central bank governors and sovereign wealth fund bosses. He moved back to Ottawa, Canada’s capital city, fuelling speculation that he planned to go into politics. In January Boris Johnson appointed Carney his finance adviser for the flagship COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow, but this was delayed by a year due to the Covid crisis. Carney is also a UN special envoy for climate and finance. “Based on our fundraising capacity, the operating businesses and background that we have, and Mark’s relationships and strategic knowledge of this area, I think we can become a category killer in ESG investing,” Flatt said. It is not known how much Carney will be paid at Brookfield, but while at the Bank, Carney was one of the world’s best-paid central bankers with remuneration of £882,885 including pension benefits and a housing allowance during the last financial year. He said last year in an interview: “The question particularly for asset owners, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and others is: How are you oriented? Are you on the right side, or the wrong side, of history?” He added: “I didn’t want to just go back into the private sector, to straight commercial life. Having something where I could see the potential impact and the marrying of the commercial with the purpose was pretty important to me.”",Mark Carney; Business; Bank of England; Banking; Canada; Financial sector,World news
2021-04-19T16:51:28Z,EU ‘reflecting’ on conflict of interest rules after BlackRock controversy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/eu-reflecting-conflict-of-interest-rules-blackrock-controversy,"The EU is considering introducing new conflict of interest rules after it was criticised for hiring BlackRock, a major manager of oil company and financial shares, to work on new environmental rules for banks. The European ombudsman found in November found that the European commission, the EU’s executive arm, had not properly considered conflicts of interest when awarding the contract to BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor. The ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, also said the commission should strengthen its conflict of interest rules. The commission said it was “reflecting on possible clarifications relevant to the procedure to follow when a professional conflicting interest may be at stake in a procurement procedure”, according to its response to the ombudsman, published on Monday. It said it would include updates to its financial regulation on conflicts of interest in a public consultation. The campaign group Urgewald raised concerns about BlackRock’s alleged conflict of interest, first reported by the Guardian in April 2020. While BlackRock has taken steps in recent years to tighten its policies on the active allocation of money, its role as the world’s biggest provider of passive investments means it holds shares worth billions of dollars in oil companies and banks. Katrin Ganswindt, a finance campaigner at Urgewald, said: “It is good that the EU commission is considering providing clearer guidelines on possible conflict of interest. This should be a given. “In the case of BlackRock, the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels, it is unfortunately already too late. The fact that the asset manager is also a leading shareholder in the banks for which it is advising environmental social and governance regulation, shows how we would have needed these guidelines before BlackRock was awarded the tender.” Rasmus Andresen, an MEP with the Greens/European Free Alliance group, said he welcomed the commission’s response, but added “everything depends on the details and the implementation of this revision”. Andresen was among a group of MEPs who wrote to the commission with concerns over the contract. “The only question of importance is if the financial regulation at the end will prevent BlackRock and others from getting a leading advising role on policy they have a financial interest in,” Andresen told the Guardian. “The commission should come up with a concrete proposal and formulate the revision in close cooperation with the European parliament as budgetary authority.” BlackRock declined to comment. It has previously said its bid for the banking rules work was accepted because the commission found it offered the best quality for the lowest price.",European Union; Oil; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Business; Commodities; Energy; Energy industry; Environment; Fossil fuels; Banking; World news; Europe,World news

He was just a humble banker, obeying the rules in Hong Kong, even the draconian ones imposed by Beijing that stamp out the last knockings of democracy. “It’s not my position to make moral or political judgments on these matters,” he told the foreign affairs select committee. “I have to comply with law.” One matter in question was HSBC’s freezing of the bank account of pro-democracy activist Ted Hui. It was the Hong Kong police that told HSBC to act, said Quinn, and any bank would have to do the same. Not complying, he argued repeatedly, could ultimately mean losing the licence to operate. This straight-bat defence was what you’d expect, of course, and Quinn only looked discomforted when invited to defend the decision of Peter Wong, HSBC’s top executive in Asia, to sign a petition last year supporting China’s new powers for Hong Kong. Quinn argued that Wong was merely signing as a citizen of Hong Kong and, absurdly, that the act was not political. “I think our definition of what is political may be slightly different,” replied committee chair Tom Tugendhat. Quite. An hour of questioning by MPs is the least of HSBC’s troubles, however. The wider question is whether a 150-year-old institution can maintain its double life as a UK-regulated bank that makes most of its money in Hong Kong. “I do not see a point where we will have to split the institution into two,” said Quinn. Again, he’s bound to say that – appearances must be maintained. But, come on, it’s easy to imagine circumstances in which a split could become necessary. For starters, US-China relations could deteriorate further, making the bank an even bigger political football. Remember, HSBC also needs a licence to clear US dollars. The other important party is the shareholders. It is hard to judge the degree of “Hong Kong discount” in HSBC’s share price, but it’s not nil. If a split comes to be seen as a way to restore value, there will be pressure. Quinn can opine unconvincingly about staying out of politics, but it’s really not that simple. BlackRock talk the talk It was good news, of course, when BlackRock finally started talking seriously about climate risks a year ago – even if the world’s biggest fund manager was years behind most big European rivals in doing so. The company, with an astonishing $8.7tn under management, is still not at the radical end of the spectrum but it has moved. There is a greater willingness these days to side with activists on shareholder-led climate proposals, for example. Chief executive Larry Fink’s latest annual “dear CEO” letter contained two new ideas. First, BlackRock will push companies harder to commit to business plans that align with net zero emissions by 2050. And, in its actively managed funds, the firm is threatening to dump the worst polluters. The second proposal is more interesting but needs to be seen in context. BlackRock is predominately an index-tracking operation – that is where 90% of its equities are held. Thus divestment is not an option for that portion, even if clients can be encouraged to switch into passively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) overlays. But the actively managed funds are still big in their own right, and some holdings in polluters will be so significant that BlackRock’s departure could affect the price at which those companies can raise capital. But, to be taken seriously, the weapon has to be used occasionally. The divestment threat was merely a couple of lines in Fink’s letter. Let’s see if he really means it. Saga’s all at sea There is “pent-up demand for cruises among our guests who will benefit from the first round of vaccine rollout,” says Saga. It wants to get them at sea as early as May. The timetable looks ambitious since it surely depends not only on the punters’ willingness to travel but also on other countries’ willingness to let them land to inspect the local sites. If destinations are still locked-down, a boatload of UK tourists, even ones waving vaccination certificates, may not get a welcome. Still, if Saga is right about pent-up demand, it sends a bullish signal for the rest of the travel market. Cruise ships, as floating super-spreaders, did not have a good press during the early stage of the pandemic. If the passengers are undeterred, budget airlines can expect a boom.",HSBC; China; US news; Cruises; Banking; Business; Environment; Asia Pacific; Fossil fuel divestment; Financial sector; Travel & leisure,Business
2021-08-30T13:53:25Z,City veteran Simon Laffin on the challenges posed by controversial takeovers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/30/city-veteran-simon-laffin-on-the-challenges-posed-by-controversial-takeovers-morrisons-meggitt,"Responsible business is all the rage in the City but you wouldn’t necessarily know it: a healthcare company that makes inhalers to treat lung diseases is being sold to big tobacco and Bradford awaits its fate as the homegrown chain Morrisons is circled by US private equity. To some non-City observers the decisions look wrongheaded and, amid a wave of other takeovers including the sale of the defence contractors Ultra Electronics and Meggitt, suggest that while boards and shareholders talk about their good environmental, social and governance principles, money still talks. So what is going on? “Generally if you’re a public company, and somebody comes to you with an offer that is a 30% premium [to the share price], it’s really quite tough to tell them just go away,” says Simon Laffin, a veteran City chairman and non-executive director, whose CV includes the Safeway-Morrisons merger, the Northern Rock rescue team and being ousted as the chairman of the pub group Mitchells &amp; Butlers by a shareholder cabal led by the billionaire investor Joe Lewis. “Ten years ago you’d have said a board was responsible for managing the value for shareholders,” he says. “You always had to take the interests of other stakeholders into account but people didn’t really take it very seriously. Now boards are taking it very seriously but nobody has been specific how you balance these competing interests.” The board of the inhaler maker Vectura has recommended shareholders accept a £1.1bn offer from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes despite objections from health charities, who have asked shareholders to consider the “moral conflict” of the proposed takeover. At Morrisons, the trustees of its pension schemes warned last week that the proposed £7bn private equity takeover could “materially weaken” its financial position, and it needed extra security over some of the supermarket’s assets. “When I’ve had takeover approaches the attitude of shareholders has been: ‘If a big offer comes in, I want to have the say on it, not you,’” Laffin says. “What really pisses them off is if a board turns down a big premium without consulting them. “Institutional shareholders, too, must think about the environmental and social implications, as they, not the board, make the final decision on any takeover. If the board gets a reputable offer the pressure is extremely high to put it to a shareholder vote. “The problem is that the board can’t just ring a shareholder up and ask: ‘What do you think?’ before any deal is public because that’s inside information and then they couldn’t trade your stock for possibly some time. “When it is still secret the board is negotiating with the bidder. Once it’s public, it’s the shareholders negotiating, as they are the decision-makers. They don’t need to talk directly to the bidder – they can tell the media that the offer is inadequate. “It’s as tough for institutional shareholders as it is for the board because in the end they’re not investing their own money, they are investing our money. Would you take a 5% return, instead of a 7% return if the fund manager only voted and invested on a tight ethical and social agenda? You might think: my pension isn’t going to be huge and I’d rather they gave me the extra money, and I can give it to Oxfam if I want to. “That’s the conundrum institutional shareholders have. If they’re going to take a detailed environmental and social stance on every one of their companies that they invest in – some may hold 1,000 or more stocks – they’d need to employ a lot more people and that would affect their returns.” The battle for control of Morrisons, which has more than 110,000 employees, has revived concerns about private equity ownership of large companies. Laffin, who has worked for listed companies as well as the buyout firm CVC, suggests that billionaires can make for tricky shareholders. “If you are a billionaire, you don’t care about the next five or 10 million quid,” he says. “You care about people doing what you tell them to do. “One of the reasons a lot of managers like working for public companies is the shareholders don’t generally interfere,” he says. “In private equity they are always activist. If things go well, they’ll leave management alone but if things go badly they’ll intervene.” Laffin, whose new guide to the boardroom, Behind Closed Doors, is published on 2 September, says he hopes the book will help would-be directors get a job at a time when women and ethnic minorities are still struggling to reach the top of business. “Being a board director is a closed door to executives below board level, politicians, and even many regulators,” he says. “Opening it up so that more people understand what happens there is incredibly important for society; it offers the opportunity to understand what boards can and can’t do. “People criticised the Morrisons board for recommending the initial Fortress offer for 254p as too low but this simply put the company into play. Now the board is described as flip-flopping in switching to recommend the CD&amp;R bid of 285p. “I imagine that shareholders will be delighted, however, that the board has secured a 60% premium to the share price. The question remains, however, how the other promises being made to employees, suppliers and pensioners can be enforced.”",Mergers and acquisitions; Business; Private equity; Morrisons; Ultra Electronics; Meggitt; Retail industry; Supermarkets; Financial sector; UK news; Healthcare industry; Philip Morris International,Business
2020-11-09T19:35:35Z,‘A great day for humanity’ – and not bad for the stock market either | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/nov/09/a-great-day-for-humanity-and-not-bad-for-the-stock-market-either,"“A great day for science and humanity,” said the Pfizer chief executive, Albert Bourla. It was a decent one for stock markets too. The FTSE 100 index rose almost 5% as the US firm and its German partner, BioNTech, reported promising initial results from their Covid vaccine trial. There is an obvious danger of getting carried away – of assuming that rapid vaccine development is now a breeze – but the strong market reaction makes sense. For starters, though the tone around the Pfizer-BioNTech trial has been bullish for weeks, the first batch of data was far better than hoped. A 90% efficacy rate is a very strong number in any phase 3 clinical trial. Second, the stock market response was concentrated in a few sectors – those that have been clobbered by Covid since February. This was not an indiscriminate rally. Can Rolls-Royce really be worth 44% more than it was last Friday? Does it make sense that IAG, the owner of British Airways, should be up by a quarter? Actually, one can make a case. Life may still never be the same again for the aviation industry, but, if the risk of multi-year collapse has reduced, that’s a material development. Caution should be neon-lit, of course. The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine is merely a candidate for approval, and the next set of data may not be as good. A trial of 46,000 people cannot be expected to catch 1-in-100,000 safety events. We don’t know if the immune response is different between the young and the old. Viruses evolve. More than one Covid vaccine will be required, scientists have warned consistently. Those are all reasons to think stock markets will remain volatile – and it’s jarring to see the S&amp;P 500, the main US index, at an all-time high. But science offered the surest path for economic recovery, and there may be progress. A calm view of the housing market the chancellor should heed Here’s a refreshing sight: a housebuilder declining to lobby the government for more support. The chancellor should allocate resources to where they are most most needed, says the Taylor Wimpey chief executive, Pete Redfern, “and, at the moment, that is not our sector”. Well said. Taylor Wimpey’s update on Monday was an account of how much is going right. “The trading backdrop remains resilient and the quick recovery of the housing market is testament to the underlying strength of demand and supportive lending backdrop,” said the firm. It expects its profits next year to be “materially beyond” current City forecasts, implying a figure of £700m-ish – so not so far from the £850m seen in 2019. Other housebuilders in recent weeks have also reported strong order books. Unlike Redfern and Taylor Wimpey, however, they’ve usually then tried to frighten the chancellor with visions of fragility. The Redrow chairman, John Tutte, fretted about “a hiatus in the market” next March when the current sub-£500,000 stamp duty holiday comes to an end, just as restrictions on help to buy are due to kick in. John Allan, his counterpart at Barratt Developments, thought more needs to done to help first-time buyers now that lenders have withdrawn high loan-to-value mortgages. Redfern’s calmer analysis is the one that Rishi Sunak should heed. There’s no sign – at least, not yet – of a hiatus next spring in Taylor Wimpey’s outlook. “On many sites, we are selling today for completions in the second quarter of 2021 and beyond,” it said. As for lending conditions, it points to low interest rates as the most helpful factor for buyers. Many industries, such as events and hospitality, are in genuine distress. The big housebuilders, who can glimpse their 20%-plus profit margins again, are not among them. There is no need for Sunak to intervene. Mandatory, standardised ESG reporting is a step towards sanity Corporate reporting on climate risks, as with reporting on ESG (environmental, social and governance) matters, is confusing. There are too many versions out there. It’s hard to tell who is selecting yardsticks to suit their own narrative. Mandatory reporting to a common standard, as the government is now promising from 2025 for large UK companies and financial institutions, therefore represents a step towards sanity and understanding. Reporting standards must be high, obviously, but the principle of forcing companies to cough up comparable climate numbers is excellent.",Medical research; Pfizer; Coronavirus; Construction industry; Business; UK news,Business
2021-04-21T15:17:26Z,JP Morgan given lower sustainability rating after funding failed European Super League,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/21/jp-morgan-chase-gets-sustainability-downgrade-standard-ethics-after-funding-failed-super-league,"A sustainability rating agency has downgraded JP Morgan Chase after the US bank was revealed to be funding the failed European Super League (ESL) breakaway attempt. Six of England’s richest clubs, including Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, were among the 12 European teams that hoped to gain permanent membership of a new tournament. However, the project collapsed in disarray this week after a backlash from fans to heads of government across the UK and Europe. Standard Ethics, which grades corporations on their sustainability and is modelled on credit-ratings agencies, criticised the clubs as well as the bank. “Standard Ethics judges both the orientations shown by the football clubs involved in the project and those of the US bank to be contrary to sustainability best practices, which are defined by the agency according to UN, OECD and European Union guidelines, and take into account the interests of the stakeholders,” it said. It downgraded JP Morgan from an “adequate” rating to “non-compliant” in light of the ESL. Standard Ethics charges a fee to some companies to rate them based on environmental, social and governance performance, although JP Morgan’s rating was unsolicited. The ESL plan was announced late on Sunday night after secret negotiations between clubs. The “founder” clubs – entitled to a permanent spot in what might have been a lucrative league – were Italy’s AC Milan, Internazionale Milan and Juventus, Spain’s Atlético de Madrid, Barcelona, and Real Madrid, as well as England’s Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. JP Morgan’s investment bankers reportedly committed €3.25bn (£2.8bn) to the ESL plan, mainly for a payment of between €200m and €300m to each team. The league’s proponents argued that the new tournament would have strengthened football. A person with knowledge of the league plans said the deal would have included financing for grassroots sport and community projects. JP Morgan did not have control of the league’s strategy. On Wednesday the ESL’s founder, the Juventus chair, Andrea Agnelli, said the competition could not go ahead after the withdrawal of multiple clubs. Standard Ethics highlighted the “serious negative effects” of the plan flagged by critics including the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi. Many critics highlighted the lack of engagement with fans. The agency’s previous assessment of JP Morgan highlighted concerns about its attitude to fair competition, following US antitrust fines and taxation. JP Morgan’s boss, Jamie Dimon, wrote at great length of the importance of “community” to the company, in his annual letter to shareholders published earlier this month. He even made reference to the importance of local sports teams to communities. “To a good company, its reputation is everything,” Dimon wrote. “That reputation is earned day in and day out with every interaction with customers and communities. “When I hear examples of people doing something that is wrong because they could be paid more, it makes my blood boil – and I don’t want them working here.” JP Morgan Chase declined to comment.",JP Morgan; European Super League; Banking; Business; Football; Football politics; Sport; UK news; US news; World news,Business
2020-11-25T09:00:23Z,EU 'did not properly consider conflicts of interest' over BlackRock contract,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/25/eu-did-not-properly-consider-conflicts-of-interest-over-blackrock-contract,"The EU did not properly consider conflicts of interest when it hired the US investment manager BlackRock to advise on environmental regulation for banks, an influential watchdog has said. The European ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, said the European commission, the EU’s executive arm, should strengthen its conflict of interest rules in light of the findings, in a judgment published on Wednesday. BlackRock, the world’s largest investor, had $7.8tn (£5.8tn) in assets under management at the end of September. In March, it won a tender from the EU to advise on how to integrate ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues into banking regulation. BlackRock has already carried out much of the work required under the contract. The contract prompted heavy criticism from campaigners over a potential conflict of interest, given BlackRock’s status as the world’s largest manager of shares in fossil fuel extractors, as well as being a major investor in most of the world’s biggest banks. The ombudsman said “there is a clear risk that those interests may influence the outcome of its work in its own favour”. BlackRock, which has recently acted to improve its reputation on environmental issues, was the only large investment manager out of nine bidders. Members of the European parliament wrote to the commission expressing their concerns and the EU ombudsman announced it would launch an investigation in July after a complaint by two MEPs and Change Finance, a network of non-governmental institutions. The bid from BlackRock “should have resulted in significantly more critical scrutiny”, O’Reilly said. Her report cleared the commission of maladministration but O’Reilly said this was only because the EU’s conflict of interest rules were too vague to be of use. “The risk of conflicts of interest when it comes to awarding contracts related to EU policy needs to be considered much more robustly both in EU law and among officials who take these decisions,” O’Reilly said. The campaigners who brought the complaint said the commission must withdraw the contract. Kenneth Haar, a campaigner at the Corporate Europe Observatory, a member of Change Finance, said: “Looking at this case, it is hard to come by more glaring conflicts of interest in one go. By choosing BlackRock, the commission basically handed big finance the steering wheel for the implementation phase of its action plan on sustainable finance.” The ombudsman drew particular attention to an “exceptionally low financial offer” from BlackRock. The investment manager offered €280,000 (£249,000) for the work, although the European commission’s suggested fee was €550,000. The ombudsman said the low price “could be perceived as an attempt to assert influence over an investment area of relevance to its clients”, although she did not make a judgment as to whether that was the case. The rebuke by the ombudsman is a blow to Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission’s powerful executive vice-president, who wrote that the award to BlackRock “followed scrupulously the rules of the Financial Regulation” after concerns were raised. Rasmus Andresen, a German MEP in the Greens/European Free Alliance, said the commission’s answers on the conflict of interest concerns had not been satisfactory. “The commission must update its public procurement guidelines and carefully choose its contractors,” he said. “BlackRock was an abnormally low bidder because it wanted to weasel its way into European law-making. For me, this is unacceptable.” A BlackRock spokesman said: “The European commission has already publicly stated that the technical quality of [BlackRock]’s proposal was the basis for their decision in awarding the mandate. [BlackRock] has taken a wide-ranging and inclusive approach, including academia, civil society, banks, supervisors and market practitioners, and looks forward to completing its work and delivering its final report to the commission.” A European commission spokesman welcomed the finding that there was no maladministration, saying it showed “we applied the rules fully and fairly”. The spokesman said the “commission is committed to transparency” and that it would respond to the ombudsman’s suggestions and publish BlackRock’s work.",Banking; Business; European Union; Environment; Europe; European Commission; Fossil fuels; Energy; World news,Business
2023-06-08T12:00:30Z,Alarm at rightwing push to reverse clean-energy success in Texas and beyond,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/rightwing-backlash-reverse-clean-energy-success-texas,"In the scramble before the end of Texas’s legislative session last week, a must-pass bill was amended to impose new costs upon renewable energy. This came amid a barrage of anti-solar and wind power measures pushed forward by Republicans to reshape a state that has become the US’s powerhouse of clean energy. But the conservative lawmakers had help. Sections of the bill that impose new burdens upon clean energy providers were directly crafted and edited by the Texas Public Policy Foundation (or TPPF), a conservative group that has led the backlash to renewables and to make what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, according to a copy of the draft language seen by the Guardian. Several dozen edits were made to the bill’s amendments by Brent Bennett, a TPPF policy staffer, the document shows, and Texas lawmakers subsequently passed parts of this language along with the key TPPF desires – to impose new transmission costs on renewables and require them to source fossil fuel “backup” power when the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing. The passage of the bill, which funds the ongoing operation of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, was the flagship victory for TPPF even as a raft of other Republican bills that would have “shut down the renewable energy industry in Texas”, as energy analyst Doug Lewin put it, faltered. The burgeoning influence of TPPF, an organization substantially funded by fossil fuel interests and publicly lauded by Greg Abbott, Texas’s Republican governor, is the catalyst to a rightwing attempt to crimp the stunning progress of renewable energy in the state, which now produces more than a quarter of all wind-powered electricity in the US. The group’s agenda is now extending far beyond Texas, bankrolling efforts to halt offshore wind turbines in Massachusetts and to prop up coal power on native American land in Arizona while spearheading efforts to crack down on sustainable finance in energy-producing states like West Virginia. “We are very influential, we are meeting with policymakers to share recommendations and we’re having success around the country,” said Jason Isaac, a former state representative and now director of TPPF’s energy initiatives. Isaac said that TPFF regularly helped craft “certain aspects” of bills in Texas related to the state’s electricity grid or environmental, social, and corporate governance (or ESG) issues. “I think conservatives are slowly but surely moving away from variable generation and towards reliable generation,” he said of the group’s quest against renewables. Isaac claimed renewables have been unfairly propped up by a “cult-like fascination” among politicians who have pursued what he called a “dangerous and deadly” agenda to reduce planet-heating emissions. The aggressive push against renewables in Texas has alarmed environmentalists who fret it will undermine the state’s nation-leading wind industry and threaten the revenues solar and wind generates for local communities and farmers. More broadly, the template used by TPPF in Texas could hobble efforts by Joe Biden’s administration to tackle the climate crisis. “We are seeing a rush of these bills attempting to wind the clock back on renewables and TPPF really are at the point of the spear on this,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “They are transparent advocates for the fossil fuel industry and I think they pose an incredible threat to renewables. TPPF have gained incredible traction, they really are shifting the narrative in Texas. “They’ve won over the top politicians in the state, which is very dangerous. Texas is going to be critical if the US going to get to net zero emissions, so we should take this threat seriously.” TPPF’s impact can now be found thousands of miles from its base in Austin, Texas, with the group filing a lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of six east coast fishing businesses – collectively called Nantucket Residents Against Turbines – targeting a major windfarm currently under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. Slated to come online by the end of the year, Vineyard Wind will be the first major offshore wind project to be built off the US east coast. The lawsuit claimed federal agencies did not sufficiently analyze how the project, which is set to deliver enough electricity to power 400,000 homes, would affect wildlife – specifically the endangered North Atlantic right whale – and thereby violated the Endangered Species Act and slew of other environmental policies. Meghan Lapp, a seafood dealer and longtime offshore wind critic who was a plaintiff in the suit, told Reuters in 2021 that TPPF got involved in the suit at her request. As it announced its involvement in the case, the thinktank also took the unusual step of releasing a trailer called “A Heavy Wind”. The case was ultimately unsuccessful after a federal judge dismissed it last month, but the idea that wind turbines kill whales has been seized upon by conservatives, especially since December, when dozens of whales began washing up on the Atlantic coast in what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) calls an “unusual mortality event”. Noaa has said there is no evidence that offshore wind power is killing off whales, with fishing practices, boat strikes and the climate crisis among the primary dangers to marine mammals, but congressional Republicans have called on the White House to pause offshore wind development, while Tucker Carlson, then of Fox News, aired a critical series of segments called “The Biden Whale Extinction”. The assault on renewables by TPPF and its Republican allies has stunned conservatives who remain supportive of the longstanding bipartisan enthusiasm for clean energy. The reversal has been particularly stark for Texas which, blessed with the capacious, flat terrain and amenable climate for abundant wind and solar energy, was championed as a bastion for renewables by previous Republican governors George W Bush and Rick Perry, even as they embraced the ubiquitous oil industry. More than 40% of Texas’s electricity came from carbon-free sources last year, with the state now producing more wind and solar than the next three states – California, Iowa and Oklahoma – combined. This imperious status now seems uncertain. “I don’t recognize the state sometimes any more from our elected leaders. It’s like we are in a twilight zone where up is down and day is night,” said Matt Welch, state director of Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation. “I fear we’re losing our lead in the nation and the world as the source for clean energy advancement. It’s just amazing we’ve rolled up the welcome mat and told wind and solar operators they’re just not welcome here any more.” The Texas Public Policy Foundation was founded in 1989 by James R Leininger, a San Antonio-based physician who made his fortune selling hospital beds, and initially focused on the issue of charter schools before branching out into other topics such as energy. The thinktank is a member of the State Policy Network, a network of far-right non-profits across the country that fight climate-focused legislation. In 2021, the most recent year for which records are available, donations for the thinktank totaled $25.6m. Publicly available data shows that – like many State Policy Network affiliates – its largest known funder is Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist who made his fortune from fossil fuels. Entities tied to Koch have contributed at least $8.8m to the group since 2012, according to an analysis by researcher Connor Gibson. Tax filings show that the group has received donations from fossil fuel companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, but, as a non-profit, the full extent of TPPF’s fossil fuel funding is unknown. Issac said, however, it has been “many years” since large oil firms such as Exxon have donated to TPPF as these companies now ostensibly support decarbonization and environmentally responsible corporate governance, which conflicts with the foundation. He insisted that the foundation is committed to “free enterprise and individual liberty” and the eradication of “market distorting” subsidies, not just for renewables but also fossil fuels. But Welch said that Republican lawmakers, backed by TPPF, have ditched any ideological consistency by heaping onerous restrictions on renewable energy development on private property, in some cases attempting to impose requirements absent from oil and gas drilling, and trying to slash subsidies for the industry at the same time as offering state support for the buildout of new gas plants. One proposed bill that didn’t get sufficient backing in the latest Texas legislative session would have placed stringent new rules for wind and solar projects, including written permissions from neighboring property owners and setbacks of up to half a mile from the edge of a property for wind turbines. Another would have cut all subsidies for renewable energy. “On a Tuesday these lawmakers will be adamantly for private property rights, but on a Thursday they will want to stop the growth of renewable energy even though it’s on somebody’s private land,” Welch said, adding that TPPF was once full of “mini Milton Friedmans for years until recently, and now all of a sudden they throw that out the window. “It’s been a shocker. It’s so hypocritical,” he said. “I used to be an acolyte of TPPF but they are now driven by oil and gas billionaires who want to stop alternative forms of energy to benefit their own bottom line. They’ve sold their soul to the almighty dollar.” Renewable energy remains broadly popular with the Texas public for delivering cheap, clean power along with an injection of cash for entities such as school districts, but affection has somewhat curdled among some of the state’s Republican leadership. A devastating winter storm in 2021, which left millions of Texans without power and led to several hundred deaths, was a major accelerant of this trend. In the days following the crippling event, known as winter storm Uri, Abbott and other leading Republicans pushed the blame for the power blackouts upon renewable energy, with misleading pictures of frozen wind turbines from Europe quickly circulating social media as the supposed cause of the grid’s breakdown. Subsequent studies have made clear the primary cause of the blackouts were frozen gas pipelines and a lack of infrastructure resiliency to extreme weather, rather than renewables per se, but the perception of faulty wind and solar has stuck, eagerly fanned by TPPF. “I still believe [renewables] deserve a lot of the blame,” said Isaac. “The storm was helpful in educating people who just assumed when they flip a switch the lights come on that there are issues with grid reliability, that solar panels covered in snow don’t produce electricity.” Isaac said the foundation accepts that the climate is changing but disputes that this is harmful to people, claiming that the benefits of burning of fossil fuels “far outweighs” any negatives, including deadly air pollution, which he asserts isn’t an issue for the US and its “near natural” air quality. Scientists have, in fact, found that the climate crisis poses huge and growing risks to humanity, with airborne pollutants from burning coal, oil and gas linked to an array of different health problems. While the most severe of the anti-renewables bills pushed forward in Texas didn’t pass the legislature this year, Isaac said that TPPF remains undaunted and will continue to agitate against what he called “the false panacea of variable power”. Supporters of clean energy said they expect further battles ahead to prevent Texas’s progress in solar and wind from being unwound. “With the growth trajectory of renewable energy, TPPF can either get on the train or lay down in front of the tracks,” said Welch. “I suspect they won’t rest on their laurels. They’re going to come for renewables again and again and again.”",US news; US politics; Republicans; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment,US news
2020-12-17T11:00:19Z,Flemmich Webb obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/17/flemmich-webb-obituary,"The environmentalist and journalist Flemmich Webb, who has died aged 49, was a key driver behind Lloyd’s of London’s new sustainability strategy that includes fundamental changes to their insurance policies concerning the Arctic. His passion for conservation and concern for the planet led him to work for many years in environmental journalism, reporting for the Guardian, Independent and Evening Standard. In 2009 he settled in Brighton, East Sussex, where he was a reporter and newsreader for Latest TV (his wit and one-liners were a feature of the bulletins) and became chair of Brighton and Hove 10:10, a not-for-profit organisation working to reduce carbon emissions. Flemmich had visited some of the most remote parts of the planet, climbing mountains on five continents. But it was a north pole expedition in 2009 and his first-hand encounter with the effects of climate change that had a profound effect on the rest of his life – and inspired his push to change Lloyd’s policies. In 2015 he joined Lloyd’s, as an in-house writer and editor, because of its potential to bring change on a global scale. He wrote speeches for the chairman and chief executive, and became increasingly involved in developing environmental, social and governance strategy. He argued that good insurance modelling should make sense commercially and environmentally, and helped convince Lloyd’s that new drilling for hydrocarbons in the Arctic should no longer be underwritten. Flemmich worked tirelessly with colleagues on the Lloyd’s environmental, social and governance report released today. “This will be a fitting and long-lasting legacy for a deeply respected colleague,” the company said. Flemmich was born in London, the eldest of four children of Tony Webb, an accountant, and Zara (nee Le Roy-Lewis), and elder brother to Christian, Saskia and Theo. He grew up near Sevenoaks, Kent, and attended New Beacon school before winning an academic scholarship to the King’s school, Canterbury, where he excelled at sport and academia and honed an extraordinary skill for building lifelong friendships. He studied English literature at Leeds University, where he combined study, sport and social life, becoming a well-recognised figure on the dance scene. Whether playing football, cricket, tennis, golf, or just throwing paper into a bin, he was ruthlessly competitive. After leaving university in 1993 he travelled with friends to Canada, working in sustainable farming. When he returned, he joined a community theatre co-operative in Dorset, travelling around the UK and Europe performing “instant theatre”, before deciding to pursue journalism. He was editor of Environment Business magazine 2000-03, then worked as a freelance until joining Lloyd’s. Flemmich had a rare talent for making everyone he met feel welcome and special. He was best man at six weddings, including mine, a beloved uncle to seven nephews and a niece, and godfather to six children. He had a strong connection to all those children, immersing himself in their world by taking the time to understand what sparked their curiosity. With his energy, enthusiasm, emotion and sense of purpose, he made the world better, more welcoming and exciting. He was as engaging a raconteur as he was engaged when listening. But as comfortable and confident as he felt in the world, he acted on a pressing desire to change it for the better. Flemmich had been due to marry his long-term partner, Kate Henry, a cook and caterer, on Saturday 19 December – his 50th birthday. He collapsed while running on the South Downs last month, near where he lived with Kate and her daughter, Eloise, and did not recover. Kate placed Flemmich’s wedding ring on his finger before he died. He is survived by Kate and Eloise, and his parents and siblings.",Lloyd's; Environment; Arctic; Climate crisis,Business

2021-05-01T23:05:15Z,Boohoo is ready to party but investors may not be as keen,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/02/boohoo-ready-to-party-investors-may-not-be-as-keen,"It speaks to the privations of the past year that Boohoo has a tab on its website called “plans”, where shoppers can filter its vampy outfits based on their suitability for a “picnic”, “beer garden” or even better, “21 June”, a red-letter day when it hopes the country will say: “See ya, lockdown.” With social lives on hold for more than 12 months, there has been little call for the party dresses sold under its Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing (PLT) labels, sometimes for as little as a fiver. But that has not stopped sales at the Manchester-based group powering ahead as it quickly switched to selling joggers and hoodies emblazoned with slogans such as “staycation”, for lounging around at home. On Wednesday, its chief executive, John Lyttle, is expected to report a near-40% jump in annual sales to £1.7bn, after the web-only group became one of the beneficiaries of the huge growth in online shopping seen over the past year. Profits are expected to be up by more than a third at £147m in the year to the end of February. Current trading will also have been boosted by resurgent demand for going-out clothes as the nation enjoys new freedoms. But while shoppers remain enthusiastic buyers of Boohoo’s inexpensive clothing, investors are more circumspect about its shares after revelations last summer linked it to factories with poor working conditions here and overseas. The share price, which touched 415p in June 2020, almost halved in the wake of the scandal, with Aberdeen Standard Investments, one of its biggest shareholders, dumping most of its stake and bemoaning Boohoo’s inadequate response. Fast-forward nine months and the company is jumping through hoops to show the world it has changed. The retired judge Sir Brian Leveson is overseeing an overhaul of its supply chain and work done so far has included severing ties with hundreds of companies and a ban on subcontracting by its main suppliers. Mahmud Kamani, Boohoo’s chairman, also recently told MPs on the environmental audit committee, who have been highly critical of the company, that the board was considering linking management bonuses to progress made on improvements to its environmental, social and governance credentials. How Boohoo behaves matters more than ever now that it has hoovered up struggling high street names including, most recently, the Debenhams brands; with a market value of £4.2bn, Boohoo is already worth £1bn more than Marks &amp; Spencer. Lyttle is expected to elaborate on the company’s plans for the Debenhams website, which it has quietly relaunched, having vowed to make it the UK’s biggest online marketplace for fashion, beauty, sport and homewares. Boohoo also acquired Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton from the wreckage of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia. A recent deal struck for a new warehouse in Daventry, Northamptonshire, signals the scale of its ambitions. The site will eventually give the group the firepower to handle annual sales of £4bn, more than double the current level. Today its shares are back at 337p but despite the positive financial performance, many investors are reluctant to get involved until they are sure there are no skeletons left in the closet. So while Boohoo, like other fashion chains, stands to benefit from the return of socialising and the resurgent demand for party dresses, shirts and jeans, it has more to do than just make the right calls on this season’s trends. Analysts at the investment bank Berenberg predict Boohoo will be a beneficiary of the easing of lockdown measures: its largest brands, Boohoo and PLT, have historically enjoyed strong sales of going-out clobber. However its actions on social and environmental matters will be key to the shares’ performance, they say. “While coming from a low base, on the balance of what we have seen so far, we are encouraged by the progress Boohoo is making.”",Boohoo; Retail industry; Online shopping; Fashion industry; Garment workers; Business; UK news,Business
2021-03-30T07:00:36Z,"Green investing 'is definitely not going to work’, says ex-BlackRock executive",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/30/tariq-fancy-environmentally-friendly-green-investing,"From his desk in midtown Manhattan Tariq Fancy once oversaw the beginning of arguably the biggest, most ambitious, effort ever to turn Wall Street “green”. Now, as environmentally friendly investing grows at an exponential rate, Fancy has come to a stark conclusion: “This is definitely not going to work.” As the former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, Fancy was charged with embedding environmental, social and governance (ESG) corporate policies across the investment giant’s portfolio. Fancy was a leader in a movement that has given many people, including investors, activists and academics, hope that after years of backing polluters, Wall Street was finally stepping up to confront the climate crisis. “I have looked inside the machine and I can tell you business does not have this,” Tariq told the Guardian. “Not because these are bad people but because they run for-profit machines that will operate exactly as you would expect them to do,” said Fancy. Fancy, 42, worked for BlackRock between 2018 and 2019 and was the investor’s chief investment officer for sustainable investing at a time when BlackRock was preparing to announce a major shift in strategy. “The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance,” the BlackRock chairman, Larry Fink, wrote in his highly influential annual letter to CEOs in 2020, shortly after Fancy’s departure. “In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital.” In future, Fink said, BlackRock would transition away from investments in companies that “present a high sustainability-related risk”. BlackRock manages about $7tn in assets and, with one of Wall Street’s biggest voices sounding the alarm about the need to deal with the climate crisis, the news was viewed as a pivotal moment for the financial community. But for Fancy, who now runs the digital learning non-profit Rumie in Toronto, Canada, BlackRock’s move, and the ones it has inspired, contain a fundamental flaw: the climate crisis can never be solved by today’s free markets. “It’s not because they are evil, it’s because the system is built to extract profits,” he said. Investors have a fiduciary duty to maximise returns to their clients and as long as there is money to be made in activities that contribute to global warming, no amount of rhetoric about the need for sustainable investing will change that, he believes. “In many cases it’s cheaper and easier to market yourself as green rather than do the long tail work of actually improving your sustainability profile. That’s expensive and if there is no penalty from the government, in the form of a carbon tax or anything else, then this market failure is going to persist,” said Fancy, a former investment banker who now leads an initiative to bring affordable digital education to underserved communities worldwide. The amount of money that poured into sustainable investment through vehicles like exchange traded funds (ETFs) hit record levels last year. It’s a trend Fancy believes could continue for years and still have zero impact on climate change because “there is no connection between the two things”. Moving money to green investments doesn’t mean polluters will no longer find backers. The argument is similar to that of divestment, another strategy Fancy says doesn’t work. “If you sell your stock in a company that has a high emissions footprint, it doesn’t matter. The company still exists, the only difference is that you don’t own them. The company is going to keep on going the way they were and there are 20 hedge funds who will buy that stock overnight. The market is the market. “I don’t think the public realizes we are not talking about stopping climate change,” he said. “We are literally talking about selling assets so we don’t get caught up in the damage when it hits.” Business knows this, Fancy said, and it also knows the solution – it just doesn’t like it. He compared the business communities reaction to the coronavirus pandemic to its views on climate change. “Science shows us that Covid-19 is a systemic problem for which we all need to bend down a curve, the infections curve.” As the crisis escalated business leaders were immediately supportive of government-led initiatives to restrict travel, close venues and shutter the economy. “The Business Roundtable [the US’s most powerful business lobby] said we should make mask-wearing mandatory. They were right about all those things,” he said. The world needed government to use its extraordinary powers “because if you left it to the free market everything would have been open in the US and we would have lost millions of people, it wouldn’t have been half a million”. Climate change too is a problem science says is systemic and one where we have to bend down the curve. “The difference is the incubation period. It’s not a few weeks, it’s a few decades. For that they are still saying we should rely on the free market. That’s where I have a problem.” A survey of 250 senior executives supports Fancy’s point. About 64% of the executives surveyed in a recent poll commissioned by British lender Standard Chartered said they “believe the economics of operating as a net-zero [carbon emissions] organization do not stack up for their company”. And 79% of senior executives said short-term CEO tenure made it harder for companies to transition to net zero. Under the current system the costs, says Fancy, are simply too high and the benefits of conducting business as usual are too great. A 2019 Morgan Stanley study found that getting to net zero by 2050 will cost $50tn. “The reality is that their incentives are very short-term,” he said. “My concern is that when it comes to climate change, it’s actually expensive. It’s like saying when it comes for Covid-19 that’s a crisis and an opportunity. Well yeah, it’s an opportunity for Zoom, it’s not an opportunity for society.” There is a solution, said Fancy, and it’s the one that business leaders embraced in the coronavirus crisis: government intervention. But – given the long time line for climate change – it’s one that business leaders don’t like. What would work is a change in government policy that made it more expensive to pollute, such as a carbon tax, because that would change the corporate world and Wall Street’s incentives. “If you put a tax on carbon, every single portfolio manager would adjust their portfolio,” he said. BlackRock disputes Fancy’s analysis. In a statement the company said: “Sustainable investing can deliver strong investment returns while also helping to address urgent social and environmental concerns.” The company added that it believes greenwashing “is a risk to investors and detrimental to the asset management industry’s credibility, which is why we strongly support regulatory initiatives to set consistent standards and increase transparency for sustainable portfolios”. But for Fancy the overarching point is that real change has to be led by government, not Wall Street. “If I was on a panel and someone asked me what’s the best way to tackle climate change? Should I buy an ETF or should I call my congressperson and demand legislation and a price on carbon? The truth is someone is better off calling their congressperson.”",Investing; Environment; Business; US news; World news,Business
2021-04-03T23:05:51Z,Grovelling apologies fail to get Rio Tinto out of a hole,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/04/grovelling-apologies-fail-to-get-rio-tinto-out-of-a-hole,"As acts of corporate vandalism go, Rio Tinto’s obliteration of a sacred site in Western Australia is right up there. The expansion of an iron ore mine knowingly destroyed a cave containing 46,000 years of human history. It had yielded a 4,000-year-old hair plait that showed a direct genetic link with living descendants. The scandal has already cost Rio Tinto a chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and other bosses, but the backlash from the destruction of the Juukan Gorge is still reverberating, as the remaining executives at the FTSE 100 miner will find at its annual meeting on Friday. Shareholders appear to be rallying to give Rio Tinto another bloody nose. Hefty executive payoffs are particularly in the spotlight. Glass Lewis, Institutional Shareholder Services and Pirc have all advised their big investor clients to vote down Rio Tinto’s remuneration reports because of the payouts awarded to Jacques. ISS said Rio Tinto should use its power to claw back more of Jacques’s bonuses. He still held on to shares worth £27m, ISS said, despite having had £2.7m taken away last summer. Rio Tinto has spent the last few months doing its best impression of a grovelling corporate apology in an effort to convince angry investors that the company does in fact care about traditional owners of the Australian lands it wants to mine. Last week it held “cultural heritage” seminars and belatedly appointed an indigenous advisory group. The annual meeting could yield more changes. Revolts over pay are not a new phenomenon (even if fitful hopes that “shareholder springs” will result in meaningful executive pay cuts have so far proved false), but a newer trend will also be evident on Friday: increased pressure for climate action. Investors are likely to back a shareholder resolution calling for emissions-cuts targets as well as an advisory resolution that says the company should suspend membership of lobby groups whose policies contradict the Paris climate goals. Rio’s under-pressure board has given the climate resolutions its backing – although it has said it will not set gold-standard science-based targets. Experts are generally sceptical of corporate promises to cut carbon emissions if they are not science-based. The latest resolutions may not be the most onerous for the company, but they will give it fewer hiding places in future as pressure for actual emissions cuts ramps up. Polling by Interactive Investor, an online platform, last week showed that 70% of 1,000 retail investors surveyed said they would back a greater emphasis on climate concerns. Those measures would include adding climate metrics to bonus calculations, as well as targets on “cultural heritage management”. An identical proportion of the surveyed investors said that they believed company chairs and chief executives should be held to account on environmental, social and governance issues, Interactive Investor said. Retail investors may rarely tip the scales in company votes, given the size of big institutional shareholdings, but the scale of unease shows that executives cannot just tuck away environmental or social concerns in bland sustainability reports buried on their websites. Rio Tinto’s replacement chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, struck a philosophical tone last week on the Juukan Gorge debacle, commenting on the temporary nature of human existence. But there are signs that tougher scrutiny of environmental or social debacles might be here to stay.",Rio Tinto; Mining; Corporate governance; Executive pay and bonuses; Business; Corporate social responsibility; Environment,Business
2022-12-20T06:00:39Z,‘It’s just not tenable’: cost of living crisis hits sustainability sector,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/20/its-just-not-tenable-cost-of-living-crisis-hits-sustainability-sector,"With just one week left until Christmas, shoppers are hurrying to choose their final presents – and retailers are vying for much-needed year-end custom. For many of the UK’s small businesses, the cost of living crisis has hit profits. For those whose mission is sustainability, the knock-on effect has been dramatic. The independent sustainable products retail sector enjoyed rapid growth during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, with entrepreneurs launching start-ups from home and a boom in online shopping. However, the economic weather has changed dramatically since last Christmas, with many shoppers prioritising cheaper gifts rather than sustainable ones. Add in the disruption to supply chains and increased cost of doing business caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and in some cases Brexit – and the result is hundreds of independent businesses closing this year, while many more are struggling to stay afloat. Fay Watts, director of The Dispensary, in Salford, is preparing for her last few days of trading before she reluctantly closes her doors for good. At her high street store, she offered a refills service for household products, and for a while, business was booming. “We opened in 2019 and business was good throughout the pandemic,” she says. “But the last six months have been extremely difficult and I have not been able to pay myself a wage for a year.” Watts adds that her mental health has suffered as the business struggled and debts mounted. “I never really understood the ‘death of the high street’ before I had a bricks and mortar store. But it’s incredibly difficult to change consumer habits and tough to compete with the convenience offered by supermarkets.” Zero Waste Path, which started life in an Edinburgh flat in 2018, has been forced to close its EU operation, and the future of its UK business hangs in the balance. Its co-founder, Giulio Corsi, says the sustainability sector boomed for a couple of years but in 2022 “demand has dropped dramatically”, resulting in a 40% loss in sales compared with 2021. “Add to that a rent increase, energy bills at an all-time high, and the escalating cost of ingredients … it’s just not tenable any more.” Anni Kriesche, founder of London-based company Funky Soap, says 2022 has been the toughest year since her company began trading a decade ago, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine having a major impact. “As soon as the war started, a lot of our ingredients doubled in price, seemingly overnight,” Kriesche says. Many suppliers folded and by July she was struggling to pay her staff and discussed liquidating the business with her accountant – “a really low point”. However, a re-structuring has provided a much-needed boost and helped her to seize the opportunity to try new approaches. Kriesche says: “We have started to look at every ingredient and work out how we can buy it in bulk and cheaper. We have also focused a lot more on gifts and personalisation. We’ve come this far and we’re not giving up.” Manchester-based sisters Trina and Charlie Gill run Life Before Plastic, an online shop for sustainable products made by independent zero-waste retailers. The idea came from a trip to Nepal in 2018 and for three years the business grew steadily. However, as the cost of living crisis has taken hold, the number of suppliers has dwindled dramatically, the Gills say. They cite several, including Naked Necessities, The Kind Store and The Beeswax Wrap Co, that have folded in 2022, with further closures coming almost daily. In the past half year 20 of their 100 suppliers have gone under. November turnover was down more than 50% year-on-year. “For us, it means less choice and fewer makers to support,” says Trina. “We’re in the gifting season now, and you can really see the drop-off.” The cost of sales has also risen with the sisters having to incentivise customers with discounts or free gifts. “This is pressure that comes from big companies who can afford to have sales. For us, ultimately, it is coming out of our pocket.” Trina explains that although zero-waste products usually last longer than cheaper alternatives, the higher price tag makes them prohibitively expensive for those living paycheck to paycheck. Brexit has also had a knock-on effect. “It became prohibitively expensive to sell to Europe because customers had to pay postage as well as customs and VAT,” says Charlie. “We made the decision to stop shipping internationally, which cost us 20% of our customer base pretty much overnight.” Colette Webb, founding owner of another online sustainable products retailer, Vera-Bee, has also experienced a “definite downturn” in recent months, saying revenues are down by about 30-35% year-on-year. Webb’s business was founded in 2019 in her studio in West Sussex, stockinghandmade, plastic-free items made by other small UK businesses. As the enterprise prospered she rented a larger commercial unit but has now moved back to her studio to save money. “Attracting new business is very hard at the moment. Vera-Bee is my only source of income so I have had to tighten my belt.” However, Webb remains quietly optimistic. “Loyal customers that we’ve had for two to three years are staying; they understand what we’re doing.” Dean Harries, co-founder of sustainable shaving products brand Shoreline, says the seasonal boost in retail sales from Christmas shopping has started a month later this year, “towards the end of November”. Harries says: “People visibly had less money to spend after that first energy bill landed on the doormat … a lot of people have had to deprioritise sustainability.” He plans to adapt to the harsher economic realities by moving Shoreline away from wholesale and towards retail, at a time when bulk orders and repeat customers are hard won. Shelley Brown, founder of The Good Life, which has two stores in Stockport, also says trade has “drastically dropped” this year and her focus has shifted to “just surviving”. Brown says many of her regulars are having to return to supermarket shopping. She has adapted by selling online but admits it has been “extremely challenging and stressful”. Trina and Charlie Gill are also adapting in order to survive the year ahead, offering corporate gifting and training for firms who want to improve their ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) credentials. Trina says: “The cost of living crisis has been the nail in the coffin for lots of small businesses who are often not doing it for profit, but because they care.

2021-12-17T19:00:38Z,Adani is poised to ship its first coal – is this failure for Australia’s defining climate campaign?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/18/adani-is-poised-to-ship-its-first-coal-is-this-failure-for-australias-defining-climate-campaign,"In 2010, an Indian mining company bought some tenements over a giant and untapped coal basin in the west of Queensland. That purchase, by the conglomerate Adani Group, kickstarted one of the most controversial and politically divisive resource projects in Australia’s history – the Carmichael coalmine and rail project. Before the year is out, and about eight years behind schedule, Adani says it will finally export its first coal, destined to be burned in a power station. The moment will be celebrated as a victory by its supporters, including many regional Queensland MPs and senators and conservative commentators. Australia’s resources minister, Keith Pitt, was at the mine site in October – about 300km west of Mackay – to record a video celebrating the first coal being dug. It would mean jobs and prosperity, he said. Earlier this week, Adani Australia chief executive Lucas Dow told the ABC that coal had already been delivered to the company’s port at Abbot Point as the company runs tests of new trains along 200km of new railway lines. “We’re very excited as the project is nearing completion,” he said. But for its opponents, including climate change activists and some traditional owners, the Carmichael project always meant danger and it became the focus of a campaign with an uncompromising two-word slogan: Stop Adani. So as the first coal waits to wind its way through the Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, what now for that campaign? “We would prefer to have stopped Adani when it went through approvals, or when it was looking for financing and then in construction. If we have to wait until the project is moving coal, then that’s what we’ll do,” says Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces, a campaign group that has worked to remove Adani’s opportunities to finance and insure the mine. “There’s no asterisk or caveat or fine print. There’s no conditions. It’s just Stop Adani,” he says. Carbon bomb The Galilee basin has an estimated 23bn tonnes of coal. When the first mine was proposed in 2012, Adani was one of about nine projects targeting the basin. At the time, Greenpeace estimated if all the mines went ahead, the burning of the coal would release about 700m tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere – almost one-and-a-half times Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. But while Adani wasn’t the first company to declare an interest, it is the only one to dig coal from the massive Galilee basin. Success for Adani could mean opening up the entire basin for coal development. Initial plans for the mine were to dig about 60m tonnes of coal a year, making it the biggest coalmine in Australia and one of the largest in the world. After almost a decade – and an almost eight-year delay to the initial schedule for extracting coal – the company now says it has downscaled the project to about 10m tonnes. But Adani still holds approvals for those higher levels. In some narratives, the Adani mine helped tipped the balance at the 2019 federal election. Final approvals from the state government were pending and Adani launched an advertising and letterboxing campaign criticising the Labor state government over its handling of the project. Central and north Queensland marginal seats swung heavily to the Coalition and within days of the election, state Labor moved to hand Adani its required approvals, in some cases despite concerns from the government’s own experts about threatened species management plans. Susan Harris Rimmer, the director of the Policy Innovation Hub at Griffith University, says the mine became emblematic of a broader debate about jobs and climate action in regional Queensland. “Politicians up there use strong binary language,” she said. “They’ll keep doing it, because it worked. It’s the same with immigration or terrorism. It works [as a political strategy] so people will fall back on it. There is a playbook, they’ll try it again.” Harris Rimmer said the anti-Adani convoy, led by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, became a flashpoint and helped spread “us and them” rhetoric in parts of Queensland. “I think that convoy became an image of people from the south, who lose nothing, making us [in regional Queensland] look like the villains. “That’s what it looked like, I’m sure that’s not the way it was meant, but it looked like [people] coming to tell this stupid community not to do this.” ‘A crap moment’ In 2020, the Adani Group started to remove its own name from its Australian operations. First, the company renamed its Adani mining operations to Bravus. Then it changed the name of the Adani Abbot Point Terminal, north of Bowen, to North Queensland Export Terminal (the words Adani and coal don’t appear on the corporate website). “That name change definitely gave the impression the name Adani was becoming an impediment,” says Vincent. “If you’re confident in your brand you don’t change it to something else.” Vincent says the campaign has had other knock-on effects well away from the Adani mine. “It’s been the catalyst for dozens of financial institutions around the world to rule out thermal coal projects,” he says. “The risk of being associated with large [coal] projects has become reputational kryptonite.” In May, fossil fuel producers complained to a parliamentary inquiry that campaigns against the industry were now making it harder to finance and insure major projects. Adani told the inquiry it had been refused loans and insurance, and contractors and business partners had walked away. In a submission, the company said “the boycotting of Australia’s thermal coal industry by Australian banks and insurance companies is misconceived and indifferent to the manifest damage their decisions will have on the industry’s ability to remain globally competitive” and it would impact Australia’s economy. Vincent says while the first coal being shipped is “a crap moment for the campaign”, major financial groups continue to distance themselves from the project, joining scores of others. Last month one of the world’s biggest banks cut ties with the project saying the venture is incompatible with its environmental, social and governance rules. Activists continue to target the project – locking themselves on to rail lines and rolling stock and suspending themselves from cranes at the company’s port. Two protesters clambered aboard one of the project’s trains this week and spent a day allegedly shovelling coal over the side. Separately, some Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners have long opposed the project, saying it will destroy their cultural lands and risk the sacred Doongmabulla springs. The miner has a formal land-use agreement with the Wangan and Jagalingou people but the agreement is opposed by some traditional owners. Traditional owners have been carrying out continuous cultural ceremonies on the mining lease for more than 90 days. Adrian Burragubba, a traditional owner who has battled Adani for years, says Adani “should not be celebrating”. His family and other traditional owners are concerned cultural sites with “literally thousands of artefacts” are being disturbed. Burragubba says his son Coedy McAvoy has been on the land since 28 August performing ceremonies. “He declares he’ll remain there,” says Burragubba. “It’s our duty to take care of the land and monitor what the mining company is doing.” Adani has been calling for the police to step in to remove McAvoy, as well as to take stronger action against different protesters targeting the railway. In October, police told McAvoy and others camped on the company’s mining lease they would not remove them “at this time”. Litmus test The Australian Conservation Foundation, a member of the Stop Adani Alliance, successfully overturned federal approval for the mine’s water scheme earlier this year, with the issue still unresolved. The ACF chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said the campaign still had much to achieve. As insurers, financiers and contractors walked away, there were “still questions about the viability” of the project. She says the group will work “incredibly hard” to stop the Galilee basin opening, but Stop Adani is a defining climate campaign. “Your position on Adani indicated your position on climate, particularly politically. It became a litmus test. “ACF has been switching the focus to escalating the clean future and we couldn’t have got people interested in that unless there was an end to coal and gas. I think we’ve won the public argument on that.” Since the campaign against Adani began, the world’s financial markets have shifted away from coal. At the Glasgow climate summit, more than 40 countries agreed to phase out coal power. “If we decide that in 2021 we cannot be adding more coal to the global market, then that’s a decision we have to hold ourselves to,” Vincent says. Over the course of the campaign, there have been scores of other fossil fuel projects that have been announced, developed and approved. Did the focus on Adani shift the campaigns – and the eyes of the public – to just one spot in north Queensland? “Even a dark firmament needs its darkest stars,” says David Ritter, the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. “The scale of the Galilee Basin demanded that attention. “But the campaign drew attention to the overall issue and hopefully generated the kind of community enthusiasm to oppose [fossil fuel projects] everywhere else in Australia, not just at the Adani mine.” The Guardian asked Adani Australia when it expected to export its first coal from the Carmichael mine and requested an interview with its chief executive, Lucas Dow. A spokeswoman sent a short statement, saying: “The Carmichael Mine is on track to export coal in 2021.”",Carmichael coalmine; Adani Group; Queensland; Coal; Environment; Australia news,Environment
2022-11-12T11:00:39Z,Revealed: UK local councils deposit taxpayers’ cash in Qatar state bank ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/12/uk-local-councils-deposit-taxpayer-cash-qatar-bank-lgbt-rights,"The rainbow flag flew above the Bourne Corn Exchange as South Kesteven council embraced LGBT history month. A year after voting against such a gesture the Lincolnshire local authority declared itself pleased “to celebrate and recognise the […] rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people”, hoisting the flag outside its headquarters in 2019. Across Britain, many other councils regularly follow suit, showing solidarity with their LGBT residents through their support of events such as Pride marches. Yet, as a Guardian investigation reveals, at least 28 councils – including South Kesteven – have been quietly depositing more than £1bn of taxpayers’ money into accounts at Qatar National Bank (QNB), the state lender in a country where fans who display rainbow flags at next month’s World Cup may have them confiscated “for their own protection”. The investments pose a moral dilemma for western institutions dealing with the tiny, gas-rich Gulf emirate – whether to prize financial returns over principles. Some councils have pulled money out of QNB due to ethical concerns about Qatar, which has said it will welcome LGBT fans but where homosexuality is illegal, women are second-class citizens and migrant workers have died in their thousands. But others have carried on with the investments, described by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell as “shocking”. Investment firms, including Halifax and Hargreaves Lansdown, that flaunt their credentials on diversity, inclusion and labour rights, have also poured cash into accounts with the lender. Halifax does not appear to disclose this publicly. The investments take the form of funds deposited with QNB, which is 50%-owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the $450bn sovereign wealth fund of the gas-rich emirate. Amid mounting criticism of Qatar’s record on human rights, the World Cup offers an opportunity for the emirate’s ruling elite to secure their place at the top table of global culture, politics and business. Qatar National Bank has played a key role in laying the groundwork for the sporting extravaganza. During the event itself, QNB will be the sole provider of cash machines at games in stadiums. More importantly, QNB helped fund the estimated $220bn of the tournament. According to its annual reports, the bank financed the Education City stadium, where nine matches will be played, as well as infrastructure projects to ensure everything goes off without a hitch. Few people in the UK will suspect that, in paying their council tax, they may have indirectly helped QNB bankroll these investments. Yet freedom of information requests to every local authority in the UK show that at least 27 have invested more than a combined £1bn with QNB since 2017. They do so as part of “treasury management” – effectively the storage of council tax money due to be spent on crucial public services. Their deposits at QNB, which has just one branch in central London, reflect the search for yield that more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates has foisted on investors, from local authorities to high street banks. QNB pays a healthy rate of interest – nearly 4% in some cases, according to council disclosures – a useful return for councils struggling with cuts to central funding. Most told the Guardian that this was in line with their investment strategy. But not everyone in local government appears to agree that depositing cash with QNB is appropriate. Spokespeople for Trafford and Blaby, both of which have invested in QNB in the past, told the Guardian that they had stopped doing so, citing their ethical investment policies. Ryedale said it did not have an alternative at the time it did deposit cash with QNB but admitted that the investment had been a “mistake” and said it would not do so in the future for ethical reasons. In Reading, the Green party councillor Josh Williams raised an objection to the council’s investments in a country with a “lamentable” human rights record, warning that Reading citizens might draw the conclusion that the council was “happy to invest millions of pounds in a country that would imprison homosexual men”. Reading’s last investment was in July 2022. It says QNB’s sustainability policy means it meets the council’s investment criteria but that it has suspended further investments. Councils that still had millions invested with QNB as of October 2022 include South Kesteven, Argyll and Bute, Swindon and Portsmouth. “It’s shocking to learn that local authorities are depositing council taxpayers’ money with a state-controlled bank in such a homophobic country as Qatar,” said Tatchell. “Through these deposits, local authorities are supporting a bank that funds the World Cup and sustain a regime that stands accused of human rights abuses against LGBT people, women and migrant workers.” Anyone who invests in shares may also have unwittingly contributed to the volume of cash deposited at QNB. The Financial Conduct Authority’s client assets sourcebook regime (Cass) requires stockbrokers to deposit customer money with a panel of major banks, to ensure that funds could be recovered if the brokerage went bust. The banks receiving the deposits typically include well-known UK lenders but some share-dealing brands, including firms that publicly support LGBTQ+ rights, use QNB. Earlier this year, Halifax won praise when it gave staff the option to display pronouns on their name badges and told customers who objected to the move that they should close their accounts. The bank also espouses its commitment to gender equality. But the Guardian understands that the lender’s share dealing arm, which manages £1.5bn of money on behalf of its clients, has more than £300m with QNB. Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited under Qatar’s 2004 penal code, which criminalises acts of “sodomy” and “sexual intercourse” between people of the same sex. Women must obtain permission from a male “guardian” in order to make key decisions about their lives, such as reproductive healthcare or overseas travel, according to a 2021 report by Human Rights Watch. By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown sponsors Bristol Pride and has won awards at the event thanks to its credentials as an LGBT employer. Yet the company, which also boasts that it is a living wage employer, deposits up to 8% of clients’ cash – suggesting a maximum of £1.5bn – with QNB. Fellow stockbroker AJ Bell also lists QNB among the banks it uses, with a maximum of 35% of client money helped there, implying up to £34m. Not all stockbrokers publish the panel of banks they use to store clients’ cash, meaning many more may have deposited funds with QNB. QNB did not answer requests for comment. Hargreaves Lansdown and Halifax declined to comment. A spokesperson for AJ Bell said: “We evaluate and monitor a number of factors when assessing which banks to use to hold cash,” adding that this “includes a bank’s independently assessed ESG or ethical rating”.",Ethical business; Investing; Qatar; World Cup 2022; LGBTQ+ rights; Financial sector; Business; Middle East and north Africa; World Cup; UK news; Lloyds Banking Group; Hargreaves Lansdown; Banking; Local government; Politics; Football; Sport; World news,Business
2022-03-27T10:00:22Z,May I have a word about… sleepwalking into cliche | Jonathan Bouquet,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/mar/27/may-i-have-a-word-about-sleepwalking-into-cliche,"Did you realise that we are a becoming a nation of somnambulists? No, really we are. The latest expert on our night-time habits is Richard Buxton of Jupiter Asset Management, who last week declaimed: “I’ve been warning for months the net-zero ESG dash for renewables and dissing of hydrocarbons was sleepwalking us into an energy crisis and here we are.” Mr Buxton is in good company. In recent weeks, we have been sleepwalking into climate catastrophe, a financial disaster, into war, a relegation dogfight, a China-style credit system and bond sell-offs. And that’s just a small sample of the online headlines employing this chilling imagery. I find this phrase just a little bit hysterical and horribly overused. Couldn’t we relax and just say “nearing” or “approaching” and put this cliche to bed, as it were? And so to the weather, one of my favourite topics, what with its hyperbolic terms such as thunder snow and explosive cyclogenesis. So much more portentous and threatening than spits and spots, dribs and drabs. To the pantheon of meteorological cataclysm can now be added “imminent pollen apocalypse”. I’ve seen it used a couple of times and I haven’t a clue what it means, but I’m certain it’s going to crop up more and more as we approach the hay fever season, so I suggest that if you are a sufferer – thankfully I’m not – you should arm yourself immediately with a stout hanky and healthy dose of scepticism. As it is Mother’s Day today, could I address the voiceover artist on the Marks and Sparks ad for the occasion? The word for a bunch of flowers is not pronounced beaukay, it is pronounced bookeh. Just for once, I of all people can claim to know best on this particular subject. • Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",Language,From the Observer
2021-03-17T16:27:54Z,Insurer AIA agrees to pull out of all coal investments by 2028,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/17/insurer-aia-agrees-pull-out-all-coal-investments-2028,"The Hong Kong-based insurance company AIA, whose logo features on Tottenham Hotspur shirts, has bowed to pressure from campaigners and announced it will pull out of all coal investments by 2028. AIA, the largest independent, publicly listed pan-Asian life insurance group, made the pledge in its environmental, social and governance report released this week. It is the first major insurance company in Asia to promise such a move. AIA has $326bn of funds under management and is estimated to hold up to $6bn in coal and coal-fired power assets, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Campaigners had attacked the insurer’s climate credentials as a “dirty secret” that stained the shirt of Tottenham, worn by Harry Kane, Hugo Lloris and teammates since 2013. The football-themed push, branded AIA Kick Out Coal, was led by the divestment groups Insure Our Future and SumOfUs. Peter Bosshard, the global coordinator of the Insure Our Future network, said: “As it divests from coal, AIA is aligning its investment portfolio with its public brand and is removing a stain from the Spurs shirts.” A Tottenham spokesperson said: “AIA has shared with us the significant strides it has already made to address the carbon intensity of its investments and the planned action to reinforce their efforts as a result of the threat posed by climate change.” For its directly managed funds, AIA said it would withdraw from all shareholdings in coalmining and coal-fired power businesses by the end of this year, and for bond investments by 2028. It will not permit any new investments in companies that are involved directly in mining coal or generating electricity from coal. Last year AIA, which was set up in Shanghai in 1919, committed to pulling out of equity investments in companies that generate more than 30% of their revenues from coalmining and coal-fired power. Its new approach will apply to all investments in the sector, “regardless of revenue and coal capacity”. It said these criteria would also be applied to its dealings with third-party investment managers. Lucie Pinson, the executive director of the Paris-based NGO Reclaim Finance, said: “If the approach is as comprehensive as it sounds, we will celebrate it as a bold signal to Asian institutional investors. Coal constitutes a plague for the climate and for public health – it’s high time for Asian financial institutions to catch up with their international peers, ditch coal and drive the transition towards a sustainable future.” Last August the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the coal business was “going up in smoke”. Most European and Australian insurers no longer provide cover for new coal projects, while others are becoming more cautious, according to the 2020 report from Insure Our Future. Controversial projects such as the Adani Group’s planned Carmichael coalmine in Australia are struggling to obtain insurance cover. However, the report also found that major companies in the US and east Asia and within the London-based Lloyd’s market were still insuring coal, and the global insurance industry had failed to take comprehensive action on oil and gas.",Insurance industry; Fossil fuel divestment; Tottenham Hotspur; Hong Kong; Fossil fuels; Asia Pacific; Energy; Environment; World news; Coal; Business,Business
2022-06-08T06:15:15Z,Fast-fashion giant Shein pledges $15m for textile waste workers in Ghana,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jun/08/fast-fashion-giant-shein-pledges-15m-for-textile-waste-workers-in-ghana,"Chinese fashion behemoth Shein might be the organisation least expected to win applause at an international conference on fashion sustainability, but that’s what happened at this week’s global fashion summit in Copenhagen. The industry’s largest forum for sustainable progress saw the ultra-fast fashion brand praised for making a donation of $15m (£12m) over three years to a charity working at Kantamanto in Accra, the world’s largest secondhand clothing market. Liz Ricketts, director of the Or Foundation, a Ghana- and US-based not-for-profit working with Accra’s textile waste workers, announced the fund, tearfully telling the audience that the workers are doing “backbreaking” work. “They are economic migrants from north Ghana, and are often women and children, some as young as six. They’re carrying clothing bales on their heads which weigh 55kg, being paid a dollar a trip, and coming home to sleep on concrete floors. “Some carry their babies on their back. Sometimes they fall backwards because of the weight of the bales, and their children are killed [underneath them].” Ricketts said that 15m secondhand garments arrive in Ghana every week, 40% of them waste. “Ghana doesn’t have landfill or incinerators,” she said. “The clothing enters the environment; some of it goes into the oceans – there are millions of garments on the ocean floor, and the currents push the garments on to the beach. “There’s a narrative in sustainable fashion that says: ‘There is no ‘away’’. This is the ‘away’.” Not everyone was convinced by the gesture. “This was public greenwashing,” said one attendee who asked to remain anonymous but echoed the sentiment of several at the summit who believe reduced production of fast fashion is the answer. “This is too easy for Shein; it’s too soon to call them a leader here. They have been valued at $100bn [£80bn] – they have millions to spare. They should be addressing the root cause of the problem.” The Or Foundation runs a weekly clinic for waste workers in Ghana, assessing the physical damage done by carrying these heavy clothing bales. “We can see the harm this work is doing to their bodies but we can’t do anything to help them,” said Ricketts. She said the Shein fund was not a substitute for responsible behaviour, but part of its extended producer responsibility. The money promised is from a $50m pot that the firm says is intended to address the ecological and social problems of the global clothing trade. The foundation says the money will fund an apprenticeship programme for Kantamanto women, help community businesses recycle textile waste and improve working conditions at the market. Ricketts called on other brands to be honest about their involvement in the waste crisis: “We have been calling on brands to pay the bill that is due to the communities who have been managing their waste, and this is a significant step towards accountability. “What we see as truly revolutionary is Shein’s acknowledgment that their clothing may be ending up in Kantamanto, a simple fact no other major fashion brand has been willing to state as yet.” Adam Whinston, head of ESG at Shein, said the company had an “ambitious” impact agenda. “Addressing secondhand waste is an important part of the fashion ecosystem that is often overlooked. We have an opportunity to make change in this space, and we look forward to working with the Or Foundation on this first-of-its-kind effort.”",Global development; Fashion; Ghana; Africa; World news; Fashion industry; Landfill; Environmental activism; Environment; Waste; Recycling; Ethical and green living; Shein,Global development
2021-05-26T05:19:55Z,UK banks’ support for deforestation firms topped £900m last year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/26/uk-banks-deforestation-environment-bill-supply-chains,"British banks provided at least £900m in finance last year to companies involved in deforestation overseas, research has shown, putting pressure on the government to include financial institutions in plans to force companies to root out illegal deforestation from their supply chains. The environment bill will be debated in parliament on Wednesday and will include requirements for consumer goods companies to carry out due diligence on their suppliers, to ensure they are not selling goods linked to deforestation overseas. The requirement is one of the main provisions of the wide-ranging bill, which will also include restrictions on exporting plastic waste, action on tree-planting, a new legally binding target on species abundance for 2030, and measures to restore peatland and other habitats. The environment bill has been delayed several times since it was brought forward by then environment secretary Michael Gove in 2018, owing to a lack of parliamentary time because of Brexit, the 2019 general election and the Covid-19 pandemic. Ministers are confident it will pass this time, before the UK’s presidency of the Cop26 UN climate talks in Glasgow in November. Rebecca Pow, the environment minister, said: “As we build back greener from the pandemic, it is vital that we address the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, and protect and improve the environment for future generations. “The environment bill will ensure we deliver the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on Earth, which is why it is essential that we complete its passage into law as soon as possible.” There are likely to be several amendments that ministers are not likely to support. One of these covers due diligence requirements and would include banks in rules that penalise companies for allowing goods that result from illegal deforestation overseas to enter their supply chains. The NGO Global Witness analysed 2020 data on 300 companies involved in deforestation for soy, palm oil and other commodities. It found that more than £900m in financing came from UK-based financial institutions. Under the environment bill, as it stands, these banks would face no restrictions on providing similar finance in future, as only the companies involved in supplying commodities, such as food and cosmetics producers, are covered. This is a significant failing, according to Jo Blackman, the head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness. “Supply chains are only one way in which the UK contributes to deforestation – finance is also a huge part,” she said. “Finance is a crucial lifeline to keep these [deforesting] companies going.” The UK is one of the biggest sources of finance to companies linked to deforestation, Global Witness research suggests. Neil Parish, the Conservative MP who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, has tabled an amendment that would close the loophole and force banks to conduct the same due diligence when supplying finance as companies dealing with “forest-risk commodities”. The pension fund for MPs is also invested in companies linked to deforestation. According to research by the NGO Feedback, published on Wednesday, the parliamentary contributory pension fund holds shares in JBS, a meat producer that has been linked to deforestation in the Amazon. Parish said: “It is unacceptable that while MPs vote on this bill, our pension pots are being invested in companies fuelling deforestation. All pension funds should check where their money is being invested, and parliament should be leading by example. This new evidence shows exactly why the bill must be toughened to include financial institutions in the due diligence obligation.” Blackman called on the government to accept the amendment, to show leadership on deforestation before Cop26 and the UK’s presidency of the G7 group of rich countries next month. She pointed out that the EU was also considering similar legislation, which could cover banks. “Banks will continue to invest until there is a cost to doing so – they will respond to regulation,” she said. A spokesperson for JBS said: “JBS upholds high environmental, social and governance standards and implements concrete environmental actions throughout our value chain in line with global standards. This includes our dedication to the elimination of illegal deforestation and tackling the complex issues relating to traceability of the full supply chain in Brazil.” The Labour party also plans to table a separate amendment to the bill, on tree-planting, arguing that the government’s proposals are inadequate. The amendment would require a further 30,000 hectares of woodland. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “The environment bill goes nowhere near far enough to match the scale of the crisis facing us. We need more trees and better protections to restore our most vulnerable habitats.” Labour has estimated that at current rates of tree-planting, by 2050 the UK will have less than 15% tree cover, compared with the 17% minimum called for by the Committee on Climate Change.",Deforestation; Banking; Banking reform; Business; Conservation; Environment; Climate crisis; Politics; Financial sector; Trees and forests,Environment
2020-04-12T13:50:12Z,BlackRock to advise EU on environmental rules for banks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/blackrock-eu-environmental-rules-for-banks,"BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investors in banks and fossil fuel companies, has been hired by the EU to work on potential new environmental rules for banks. Campaigners raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given BlackRock’s widespread financial interests in sectors that could be directly impacted by new environmental rules. The European commission, the EU’s executive arm, said this week that BlackRock had beaten eight other bidders on a contract to study how the EU could best integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its banking supervision. BlackRock is the world’s largest investment manager, with $7.43tn (£5.97tn) in assets under management on 31 December, before the coronavirus pandemic caused a global market rout. The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world’s biggest companies. Analysis by InfluenceMap for the Guardian found that BlackRock in October controlled shares in fossil fuel companies worth $87.3bn that held 3.27bn barrels of fossil fuel reserves. BlackRock is a top-three investor in all eight of the world’s largest oil companies, and a top-10 investor in the 12 most systemically important banks in the world. Katrin Ganswindt, a climate and energy campaigner at Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said: “Appointing BlackRock as advisor to the European commission on environmental, social and governance factors seems a bit like letting the fox guard the henhouse. On top of being the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels, they are also among the leading global financiers of the weapons industry. “We are baffled as to why the European commission didn’t think there would be a massive conflict of interest with this choice.” The commission will pay BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) arm €280,000 (£244,000) for the study, according to a contract award notice published on the commission’s website – equating to only 1.3% of the $24m pay given to the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, in 2018, or 0.007% of the company’s $4.5bn operating profits in 2019. However, decisions made by European banking regulators on ESG issues could have significant financial effects on the companies whose shares BlackRock holds. For instance, looser restrictions on bank lending to companies fuelling the climate crisis could profit both oil companies and lenders. BlackRock itself has been strongly criticised for blocking progress on environmental issues. Guardian analysis of data from ProxyInsight found that BlackRock opposed or abstained on 82% of climate-related shareholder resolutions at the companies whose shares it managed between 2015 and 2019, far lower than many rivals. However, in 2020 the company has taken significant steps to make environmental sustainability a core part of its business. In January it said it would divest from companies that made 25% or more of their revenues from coal, as well as pledging to start using its voting power to force companies to disclose climate risks. A European commission spokesman said contract was awarded “in full and strict compliance with the applicable EU procurement rules, including those on the eligibility of tenderers and the prevention of any potential conflict of interest”. BlackRock’s tender was better than competitors, and it will form only one input in the EU’s policymaking, the spokesman added. A spokesman for BlackRock said its FMA arm functioned separately to the investment management unit. He said: “We are honoured that BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory has been selected to perform an analysis to inform the European commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, deploying our expertise and capabilities in advising public-sector clients on structural trends, including the transition to a low-carbon future.” • This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the European commission’s suggested fee of €550,000.

2020-05-17T23:00:12Z,"Investing in firms with better record on social issues pays, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/18/investing-in-firms-with-better-record-on-social-issues-pays-study-finds,"Investing in companies with better records on social issues and good governance pays according to the world’s largest asset manager, with those investments having proved to be more financially resilient during the coronavirus market crash. Investment funds tracking the performance of companies with better ratings on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues lost less money than those including worse performers in 94% of cases during the crisis, according to analysis by BlackRock, the US investment manager which managed $6.5tn (£5.3tn) in assets at the end of March. The coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns of the world’s largest economies caused chaos on financial markets, costing investors trillions of pounds as stock markets tumbled. The S&amp;P 500, the US benchmark stock index, fell by more than 30% from the start of 2020 to its lowest point in March. BlackRock’s analysis, co-authored by the company’s vice-chairman Philipp Hildebrand, suggested that companies with stronger “social” scores on factors such as better customer relations and better workforce management did better in the turmoil, as did those whose boards were judged to be more effective and independent. “Companies with strong profiles on material sustainability issues have potential to outperform those with poor profiles,” the report said. “In particular, we believe companies managed with a focus on sustainability should be better positioned versus their less sustainable peers to weather adverse conditions while still benefiting from positive market environments.” However, environmental factors – the focus of much ESG investment – were not responsible for outperformance. Neither was the relative lack of oil companies in ESG funds behind the outperformance, the report said, despite the collapse in oil prices weighing heavily on fossil fuel producers’ shares. BlackRock said sustainable indices outperformed standard indices in market downturns in 2015-16 and in 2018. The outperformance also lasted through the market recovery, with 88% of sustainable funds losing less than their non-sustainable counterparts in the year to 30 April. The outperformance of higher-ESG-rated companies was evident across stocks and bonds. The data suggests that sustainable investments can also be financially rewarding for investors – contrary to the common perception that investors in sustainable companies will pay a price for more “moral” investments. Despite the crisis, investors have poured more money into sustainable investments during 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, global sustainable mutual funds and exchange-traded funds brought in $40.5bn in new assets, a 41% increase year-on-year, according to BlackRock calculations. Separate data from Morningstar showed that the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 set consecutive records for inflows into US sustainable funds. BlackRock has itself been responsible for much of the recent growth in ESG investing. In January it launched a raft of ESG products as it battles persistent criticisms of its role as the world’s largest owner of oil companies amid a global climate crisis. It also pledged to exclude companies who make more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal from its portfolios on climate grounds. The investor has faced strident criticism from activists for being a relative laggard in relation to other investors when voting on environmental issues at companies, although it says it focuses on engagement with company bosses rather than using its votes to force changes. Less than $500bn of BlackRock’s assets have some element of screening out companies on various criteria, such as moral or religious reasons, but only about $100bn of that is managed according to full ESG criteria. BlackRock has an ambition to increase that to $1tn by 2030. In a separate report, the asset manager Janus Henderson said global dividends paid out this year could fall by up to 35% to $933bn, as the coronavirus pandemic hits company profits. Europe and the UK are likely to see bigger falls than the US, the company said, with banks, discretionary consumer sectors and economically sensitive industrial companies most affected.",Ethical business; Investing; Coronavirus; Market turmoil; Business; World news; Corporate governance; Global economy; Stock markets,Business
2022-05-25T22:51:44Z,Amazon shareholders reject 15 motions on worker rights and environment,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/25/amazon-shareholder-proposal-worker-health-safety,"Amazon shareholders have rejected 15 resolutions brought forward by investors in a push to influence the company’s environmental impact and treatment of workers. Shareholders voted on Wednesday against all the resolutions, most of which focused on worker rights and other social issues. The resolutions included calls for the company to report on worker health and safety and the treatment of its warehouse workers, and a review of Amazon’s use of plastic and changes to the company’s process for board nominations. Amazon’s board had recommended that its shareholders vote against all resolutions, arguing in its proxy statement that it has already acted to address the underlying concerns of many of the proposals. Historically shareholders have voted with the board’s recommendations. Jeff Bezos, the company’s executive chairman, controls 12.7% of the overall vote. While the resolutions are non-binding, companies often take some form of action if they receive the backing of 30% to 40% of votes. While the activist resolutions were shut down, investors approved executive compensation, board members and a stock split. A proposal from the activist investor group Tulipshare called on Amazon to conduct an independent audit of warehouse workers’ wages and working conditions. Though the vote did not pass, the group plans to resubmit the motion next year. “Whilst we are disappointed that our proposal did not pass today, this vote was just the beginning in the fight for workers’ rights,” said Antoine Argouges, CEO and founder of Tulipshare, adding that Amazon had not yet disclosed the full outcome of the vote, or by what percentage the proposal was rejected. “Based on the positive conversations we have had with major shareholders this week, we have every reason to believe our proposal received strong backing,” Argouges said. “Once the results are published, we will consider our options for continuing the fight for better working conditions at Amazon.” The increase in the number of resolutions underscores the rise of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG)-based investing, which is spurring more shareholders to push for corporate accountability. It also reflects changes under securities regulators appointed by Joe Biden that have made it easier for investors to file proposals and more difficult for companies to convince regulators that these resolutions should not go to a shareholder vote. The record of 15 resolutions is already expected to be surpassed next week, when Google’s parent company, Alphabet, faces 17 social-justice-minded proposals on 1 June, said the research firm Insightia, the most since it began tracking them comprehensively in 2014. At its shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Facebook’s corporate parent, Meta Platforms, faced heated criticism from shareholders. The fusillade targeted Facebook algorithms, slipshod controls over misinformation and hateful content that unhappy shareholders contended have undermined democracy, provoked murder and mayhem and had a corrosive effect on children. The discontent inspired a series of proposals seeking to require Meta to submit to more independent oversight of Facebook, Instagram and its other products while lessening the power of Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. His controlling stake in the company prompted one outraged shareholder to lambast him as an “elitist oligarch” during the 70-minute meeting. But none of the 12 proposals received more than 30% support, based on the preliminary results announced on Wednesday. The lopsided outcome largely reflects the ironclad grip that Zuckerberg holds through his majority stake in the company. Zuckerberg and the company’s other eight directors on the board also received more than 90% backing to continue in their roles. The resounding support came just days after a major New York pension fund that owns Meta stock said it would vote against the directors in protest.

2020-10-19T15:58:51Z,Interested in a green job? How do you measure a company’s credentials?,https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/interested-in-a-green-job-how-do-you-measure-a-companys-credentials,"When it comes to getting a job that leaves your conscience clear, a recommendation straight from a trusted source – a friend or contact at the company, for example – can’t be topped. But only the most avid networkers have fingers in so many pies. For the rest of us, ethical certifications, such as B Corporation, can help sort the genuinely responsible companies from the greenwashers. What is B Corporation? Certified B Corporations must meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. “It took six months for us to be fully certified,” says Emilie Vanpoperinghe, co-founder of Oddbox, a certified B Corporation that distributes boxes of surplus and odd-shaped vegetables directly to your door. “It started with a detailed questionnaire – more than 200 questions on governance, workers, community, environment and customers.” Have any companies I’ve heard of signed up? Well, there’s the Guardian, for starters. Also The Big Issue, the bamboo toilet paper evangelists Who Gives a Crap and the clothing company Patagonia. But it’s not just the usual suspects: construction companies, insurance companies and a clutch of the food giant Danone’s subsidiaries are on the roster too, as well as five Unilever companies. Certification isn’t so niche then? It’s becoming ever more mainstream. There are now more than 3,500 B Corporations worldwide, with about 400 in the UK – nearly 300 of which have signed up since the beginning of last year – and the movement has lofty ambitions: “We believe at a fairly fundamental level that business needs to be a force for good in the world,” says Chris Turner, executive director of B Lab UK, a non-profit organisation supporting the B Corporation movement. “Because of the current structure of our system, business has been largely responsible for the climate emergency, social challenges and inequity. We want to fix that.” How can B Corporations help fix the planet? First comes the assessment, then the legal “mission lock” – what Turner calls the movement’s “special sauce”. In the UK, that’s a legal change to a company’s articles of association, so they “reflect the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit”. In other words, making money isn’t a B Corporation’s only goal. How will the shareholders react to this? It’s a little too early to tell. Any listed company would need to ask its shareholders to forgo their right to profit at all costs, so there’s a little education needed there about having a longer-term view. But Lisa Stonestreet, head of communications and charity impact at the Eiris Foundation – a registered charity working to increase the positive impact of responsible investment – believes the momentum is there. “More and more, people are looking around and saying: ‘If our investment decisions are having a negative impact on the environment and on society, what kind of world will I be retiring into?’” Are there any listed B Corporations? There are a few – the Brazilian cosmetics company Natura, which owns The Body Shop and employs more than 2 million people, for one. “They’ve had that difficult conversation with their shareholders,” says Turner. “We’re also talking to a lot of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies about certification. It’s one of those things: who’s going to be the first? We hope after that the floodgates will open.” He also has an ace up his sleeve: “We’re pushing hard for the mandatory legal change B Corporations make to be an amendment to the Companies Act, so that the people, planet and profit triple bottom line applies to every business in the UK by default.” So is it all about getting the badge? Not necessarily. For every company that goes through the full assessment in the UK, there are about 25 using the tool simply to measure their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, says Turner. Companies that might not previously have engaged with the subject are now taking it seriously. “Some people are scathing whenever a large corporation starts talking about sustainability or stewardship,” says Stonestreet. “But these companies need to know they can have constructive conversations about this if they’re to adjust.” Does that mean all companies are thinking about these issues? Maybe not all. Clare Reilly, head of corporate development at PensionBee, says that despite Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg forcing us to ask ourselves questions, the pensions world is slow to change. “Your pension is probably still invested in oil. Maybe tobacco too.” So we’re not quite there yet? Not yet – but we’re making good progress. Let’s just say this radical and necessary transformation of corporate behaviour is a work-in-progress, but with 72% of people wanting businesses to have a legal responsibility to people and the planet, according to a B Labs poll in May, now is the time for change.

2021-03-18T00:01:14Z,Bonus reforms 'biggest shake-up of UK corporate governance in years',https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/18/bonus-reforms-biggest-shake-up-of-uk-corporate-governance-in-years,"The government plans to make it easier to claw back bonuses paid to executives of failed companies in what is being billed as the biggest shake-up of Britain’s corporate governance rules in decades, with ministers vowing to target negligent auditors and rogue directors. Part of a sweeping series of reforms designed to break the dominance of the big four accounting firms, the new measures were outlined by the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in a consultation launched on Thursday. If adopted the changes would represent the culmination of years scrutiny of the UK’s rules on financial reporting and corporate governance after the failures of BHS, the department store sold off by Sir Philip Green, outsourced services company Carillion, and Thomas Cook, the tour operator that collapsed after 178 years in business. Kwarteng said the changes were “sensible, proportionate reforms”. Lord Callanan, the government minister for corporate responsibility, said the reforms would hit “auditors and rogue directors who have been asleep at the wheel”. The UK’s corporate governance rules will be updated to ensure that directors’ contracts include provisions, already in place in banks, to claw back past bonuses and stop future payouts if companies collapse or serious failings are identified. They would force bigger companies to make annual “resilience statements” detailing risks to the business, including climate risks. Directors would also have to disclose more justification for dividend payments or big executive bonuses. Ministers want to widen the net of companies affected by corporate governance standards to include the largest privately owned companies and bigger companies that now enjoy lighter disclosure requirements on the Alternative Investment Market. The consultation, which will run for 16 weeks, will also move forward previous proposals to overhaul the auditing sector, which failed to protect against bankruptcies. Large companies will be forced to hand part of their work to smaller auditors outside the “big four” accountants under proposals by the government. Those auditors – Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – could also face a cap on their market share among FTSE 350 audits “if competition in the sector does not improve”, the government said. However, the ministers have stopped short of requiring joint audits by two auditors for large companies, a key recommendation from a review by the Competition and Markets Authority. They said smaller companies would not have the resources to audit the biggest firms. The proposals will provide tougher legal powers to the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga), a new regulator first announced two years ago to replace the much-criticised Financial Reporting Council. Arga will have the power to force accountants to split their audit and non-audit functions, force companies to correct errors in their accounts, and investigate directors themselves for financial reporting failures. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business secretary, welcomed the tougher rules for directors, but questioned whether the audit reforms went far enough. “It is regrettable that on the crucial issue of competition in the audit sector, the package waters down some of the independent recommendations for reform, including on mandatory joint audits between the big four and challenger firms,” he said. “The option of a structural split between the audit and non-audit parts of business practices must be kept on the table.” The Confederation of British Industry, the biggest business lobby group, said it had concerns on both the audit proposals and the changes for directors. Matthew Fell, the group’s chief policy director, said: “Many businesses are still to be convinced that mandating shared audits will get to the heart of the issues around rigour and quality, not just add complexity.” He praised the government for avoiding the “more burdensome aspects” of US rules for directors, but said “these measures will require careful implementation to be meaningful without stifling entrepreneurial spirits”. Accountants broadly welcomed the reforms. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, a membership body, said the establishment of ARGA should be the top priority for government implementation. Jon Holt, head of audit at KPMG UK, said the proposals were a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” for reform and that the resilience statement was “one of the most important innovations in meaningful corporate reporting in decades”. Hywel Ball, the UK chair of EY, said the scope of audit responsibilities needs to be expanded and clarified on areas such as environmental, social and governance reporting, and fraud. He added that the value of more accountability for company directors “far outweighs the cost of additional regulation”.",Executive pay and bonuses; Banking reform; Deloitte; KPMG; PwC; EY; Financial sector; Business,Business
2020-04-22T08:19:24Z,Legal & General warns firms to act fairly during coronavirus crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/legal-general-warns-firms-act-fairly-during-coronavirus-crisis,"One of the world’s largest fund managers, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, has warned companies it will take action if they fail to show good corporate practice during the coronavirus crisis. The UK’s largest asset manager, which has more than £1.1tn in assets, is expected to take a tough stance against company directors who mistreat employees and suppliers during the pandemic, after opposing the re-election of 4,000 directors at annual meetings last year. “I worry that the industry could fall short at this juncture,” said Sacha Sadan, LGIM’s director of investment stewardship. “Sustainability, good governance, and fair treatment of employees will be the building blocks of a better future. LGIM will continue to support and hold companies to account for their stakeholder responsibilities.” The nationwide coronavirus lockdown has shut swathes of the economy, from the high street to the travel industry, financially crippling businesses across the UK. How businesses react, such as directors sacrificing salaries and bonuses and staff being treated fairly, will be put under the spotlight when corporations face investors at annual meetings. LGIM’s ninth annual “active ownership” report, which charts the action it took against companies over environmental, social and governance issues (ESG) last year, shows the company opposed 35% of pay packages globally. And in the UK, LGIM voted against 17 chairs of remuneration committees at companies in which it holds a stake on behalf of clients. “The industry needs to show investors and regulators what it has achieved on ESG issues, not what it thinks is important,” said Sadan. “I hope this ninth report demonstrates how serious we at LGIM are about all these issues and the actions we take on them.” LGIM said climate change was the leading topic of engagement it had with companies last year. The company said it had taken sanctions against 11 companies named as “laggards” for failing to take sufficient action on climate change, including ExxonMobil. During 2019, LGIM said it most frequently engaged with companies including BP, Ford, Shell, HSBC and Amazon. The company co-filed its first ever shareholder resolution, targeting BP, which led to the oil giant pledging to reduce its carbon footprint to net zero. As well as the response to coronavirus, LGIM said it planned to focus on key corporate governance areas such as diversity, employee pay and data privacy. “Everyone has a policy on diversity – but what have they actually done?” said Sadan. “We also plan to focus on financial inequality, from executive pensions to the living wage and gender pay gap. Other areas we are going to look at include privacy and security, not least what companies do with their customers’ data.”",Corporate governance; Legal and General; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Coronavirus; Environment; UK news,Business
2023-10-21T09:00:43Z,"Cracked tiles, wonky gutters, leaning walls – why are Britain’s new houses so rubbish?",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/21/cracked-tiles-wonky-gutters-leaning-walls-why-are-britains-new-houses-so-rubbish,"In a new-build housing estate on the edge of Peterborough, where rows of identical redbrick homes march along a freshly tarmacked street, Orlando Murphy stands outside a house wielding a long telescopic pole with a camera on the end. A few doors down, builders in hi-vis vests look on with expressions of concern, as he casts his camera across the roof and points it towards the gutters, like a metal detectorist looking for treasure. The bounty he is seeking is not golden coins, but evidence of bodging. “Cracked tiles, guttering on the wonk, pooling water, dodgy fascia boards,” Murphy says, reeling off the common issues. “The things they get away with are absolutely shocking.” When Murphy turns up with his spirit levels and telescopic pole, the nation’s housebuilders start to worry. Over the last few years, he has gained a reputation in the industry for exposing the atrocious construction quality of so many new-build homes, posting viral musical videos on TikTok and Instagram that reveal builders’ shoddy shortcuts with glee. One minute he finds wonky brick walls, cracked window frames and woodwork that looks as if it was nibbled by a beaver. The next he discovers garden turf laid straight over rubble, doors that don’t close and screws sticking out of cupboards (“the porcupine finish”), along with sewage bubbling up into a bathtub – under which an electrical socket lies exposed, next to a leaking pipe. That’s before he gets to the fake weep vents, crooked floors and globs of mastic splurged along windowsills with the crazed abandon of a toddler icing a cake. Roaming the country in his van like a bounty hunter of bodgers, Murphy is part of New Home Quality Control (NHQC), a professional snagging company dedicated to pursuing cowboy builders up and down the land. His videos, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of followers, are like an apocalyptic version of Through the Keyhole, presenting rapid-fire litanies of domestic disasters. There is no mouldy crevice left unprobed, no botched tiling unridiculed, as he calls out the “wood butchers” and “winkle spanners” of the volume housebuilding trade. Murphy and his fellow inspectors know exactly what to look for – because they used to be forced to cover up this kind of slapdash work themselves. “I woke up one morning and decided I couldn’t live with myself,” says John Cooper, who co-founded NHQC in 2018 with colleague Lee Challenger. “I had been a site manager on a housing job in Pembrokeshire and my boss told me to hide a serious roof problem from a customer. I knew it would cause leaks further down the line, but he insisted we cover it up.” Four days later, Cooper quit. “I decided I had to make a change in the industry,” he says. “We need to highlight the dreadful things that are happening and begin to change builders’ mindsets. There’s just no pride in the job any more. It’s all about shortcuts to get everything done as quickly as possible.” NHQC is not alone. Over the last few years, the appalling standard of residential construction in the UK has spawned an entire industry of “professional snaggers”, companies that are called in by disgruntled housebuyers who pay them several hundred pounds to inspect their homes and produce detailed reports, providing ammunition against the builders. And they’ve got no shortage of potential clients. There are countless Facebook groups such as Taylor Wimpey – Unhappy Customers, DO NOT BUY a Persimmon Home and David Wilson Homes Hell, where buyers share their horror stories. They are full of tragic tales of families who saved for years for their dream homes, only to move in and be greeted with gruesome evidence of bodging, corner-cutting and dangerously shoddy construction. The plague has even spawned dedicated social media accounts, including Newbuild Hate (131k followers), showcasing bleak worlds of windowless facades, misaligned balconies and rows of prison-like gardens. As quality sinks ever lower, the big housebuilders’ profits continue to soar. A 2021 study by Tom Archer and Ian Cole at Sheffield Hallam University found that, before the 2008 financial crisis, an average home built by one of the nine biggest UK housebuilders netted a pre-tax profit of around £30,000. By 2017, that had doubled to more than £62,000, with shareholder dividends rising from £400m to more than £1.8bn. “This was more than just ‘recovery’ after the financial crisis,” Archer says. “It was a catalyst for absolutely gigantic profit-making in the following years, with dividend payments rising to unprecedented levels.” Profit before volume became the mantra of the housebuilders. “They didn’t even have to increase their output,” he adds, “as they were making so much more money on each home.” A recent survey of the top 50 builders by Building magazine found turnover increased by an average of more than 25% in 2021, taking revenue well above pre-pandemic levels, while operating profits increased by a third – with the highest earning company, Persimmon, boasting profits of over £1bn. Housing analyst Neal Hudson has tracked the big builders’ profits and costs over the last decade and found that, while costs have increased marginally, profits have ballooned. From 2010 to 2022, Persimmon’s total costs per plot increased by just 17%, while its profit almost quadrupled. But the bumper rewards for shareholders and boardroom bosses is no reflection of the quality of their product. “Persimmon is on another level of diabolical,” says Amanda McGahan, who moved into one of the company’s developments in Rainham, Essex, in January. She had saved for over a decade to put down a deposit on a two-bedroom flat, assisted by the government’s help-to-buy scheme, and moved from her council flat in Barking, only to find a plethora of problems with her new home. There was missing flooring, a broken window, doors that didn’t close and a big tear in the bedroom carpet. They had even forgotten to install the shower. “The whole process has been so disheartening,” she says. “I was so excited to move in, feeling I had finally made it, then it was just like: ‘Oh. Is this it?’” She had been warned by other buyers to expect the worst, so she organised a professional snagging survey before she even moved in. “They came on day two and found 125 snags, in a two-bed flat,” she says. “Why weren’t these things picked up? It’s like no one had even bothered to check the place.” Karl Jennings bought a Persimmon home two years ago in Paignton, Devon, and immediately noticed things were wrong. “I spotted a big dark patch on the kitchen floor,” he says. “The sales rep said it was just a shadow. But then it started spreading into the lounge and hallway.” After they had been pestered for months, Persimmon finally agreed to come and investigate, and found the whole ground floor was completely wet. “They still don’t know how to fix it,” Jennings says. “They took the flooring up, so we’ve been living with raw concrete floors covered in black mould for 18 months.” Soon after discovering the damp issue, Jennings realised the brick walls of the house didn’t look right either, appearing to bulge out as they rose. He took a plumb line and found the walls deviated by up to 120mm in places. The maximum tolerance allowed by building regulations is just 8mm over one storey. Persimmon has now rebuilt the entire back of his house, along with three-quarters of the side and a quarter of the front. Jennings and his wife had to live in the property the whole time. “The builders who came to fix it couldn’t believe the state of it,” he says. “They said the brickie must have been blind, pissed, or both.” Bowed walls in the hallway have been rebuilt twice, ceilings have been taken down, the kitchen refitted and Jennings says he’s now on his fourth front door, after the last three warped and wouldn’t shut. “Each time they came back they made it worse,” he says. “They just bodge it and leg it. It has been a nightmare from start to finish.” In response to these stories, a spokesperson for Persimmon said the company “is committed to building right, first time, every time and are sorry when our customers face any problems. Some of the issues identified were not, we believe, caused by us but we have sought to rectify them to support these customers. We are sorry for the inconvenience these customers have faced and will continue to work with them to resolve their concerns.” * * * How did it come to this? Why should it be that buying a brand new home in Britain, and usually paying a 10% premium for the pleasure, is more likely to result in hidden horrors than would be the case with a house that has been around for decades, or even a century or two? Imagine buying a new car, then having to pay for a professional inspector to check that it had been properly manufactured, before you dared take it out on the road. The car industry would collapse, damned as unfit for purpose. Yet the housebuilders continue to produce substandard products year in year out, penalty-free. Speaking to industry insiders, a picture emerges of a system that is broken at every level. From the virtual monopoly of the few big housebuilders, and their iron grip over the limited supply of land, to the combative, buck-passing nature of procurement – laid out with such tragic clarity during the Grenfell Tower inquiry – to the lack of proper supervision on site, to the rapidly declining skilled workforce, a perfect storm has been created for a crisis of crap homes. The problems are not new. For decades, independent government reviews and all-party parliamentary groups have lamented the state of housebuilding and the focus on profit over product. The 1994 Latham report, Constructing the Team, condemned the industry as adversarial, fragmented, incapable of delivering for its clients and lacking respect for its employees. Four years later, another report recorded similar failings, finding the industry crippled by an ageing workforce and a crisis of training. Two decades on, Modernise or Die was the appropriately blunt title of the 2016 Farmer review. Mark Farmer, a consultant with 30 years’ experience in the construction sector, diagnosed that the industry faced “inexorable decline”, caused by dysfunctional training, a lack of innovation and collaboration, and nonexistent research and development. Farmer believes little has changed since then. He thinks the problems begin with the culture on site, and the atomised, fractured way buildings are made. “Visit an average housebuilding site in this country,” he says, “and you’ll find no one is taking responsibility for the end outcome. Almost half the workforce is made up of hired guns who turn up, do stuff for a day rate, then disappear. That’s not conducive to having pride in your work, or a joined-up approach to producing a quality result. There’s a culture of: ‘If the other guy damages my work, it’s not my problem.’” His opinion chimes with McGahan’s experience in Rainham. She found that, beyond the sloppy culture, the workmen who came to fix some of her snags were simply not given enough time to do their work to a decent standard. “They said, ‘I know I’m not doing it correctly, but I just can’t do the job properly – I have to go and fix the issues on another plot,’” she says. “I’ve had to get them to come back so many times.” The situation has been exacerbated by the chronic decline in skilled workers over the last few years. In 2020, towards the end of the Brexit transition period, the UK construction sector lost more than a quarter of its EU-born workforce. The following year, the number of construction vacancies increased by more than 200%, while job applications dropped by more than half. As Gaelle Blake, director at recruitment firm Hays, told Building magazine last year: “We all know how good a lot of the EU workers were, particularly on the construction side … Now places like Germany are paying better and there are fewer restrictions on working.” When Polish builder Sebastian Przetakowski needed additional help, he used to be able to just get a cousin over for a few months, which is now all but impossible. “We’re going to need a solution from the government,” he says. “The construction industry urgently needs temporary workers from the EU; this is a must.” His carpenter brother went to work in Germany, where he can drive back to see his family every two weeks. “He’s much happier there than he was here.” Turning off the tap of skilled migrant labour has exposed the disjointed muddle of UK training routes for new builders. “There’s a natural aversion to investing in training,” Farmer says, “because we operate in such a cyclical industry. In an economic downturn, it’s one of the first things to be dumped.” Why is it so hard to attract fresh young talent into the industry? Brian Berry, chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), thinks a big reason is the lingering stigma around manual trades. “Learning a trade should be a very respectable, rewarding, satisfying career for young people,” he says. “But at the moment it’s such a confusing landscape, with apprenticeships, T-levels, boot camps and more.” Berry points to the German example, where the nationally certified “master craftsperson” qualification, equivalent to an undergraduate degree, is required to start a business in the trades. The system was reintroduced in 2019, after deregulation in the early 2000s saw such rules watered down in the interests of competition – which had a noticeable impact on quality. The FMB has been calling for a proper certification process for UK construction firms for years. “Unlike the gas and electrical trades, anyone can call themselves a builder,” Berry says. “There’s a total absence of checks and balances.” In 2018, the FMB called for a national licensing scheme, with enforcement powers and penalties to “tackle the rogue traders who blight the domestic market”, and ensure high quality workmanship. Such schemes already exist in several US states, as well as Australia, Germany and Denmark. The issue has been debated in the House of Commons, but hasn’t received much support: already suffering from a shortage of labour, there’s precious little appetite from the influential housebuilders’ lobbying groups to see such a scheme introduced. At a time when 10% of Tory party donations come from the property industry, it is the builders who are calling the shots. There has been a recent government push to encourage apprenticeships but, once again, there is a lack of oversight to how they operate in practice. John Cooper of NHQC cites the case of a young man he knows who is working as an apprentice carpenter. “It’s basically a training in sloppy shortcuts,” he says. “He tells me what he’s doing, and it’s just techniques to get things done as quickly as possible and move on. Apprentices these days are often being used as dogsbodies, not being taught the trade. He’s been on site for the last week, just being asked to sweep up rubbish – that’s not going to make him a good carpenter.” If building sites are so rife with shortcuts and bodging, surely there’s an inspection regime that should catch such issues before they get buried behind the wonky fascia boards or swept under the badly fitted carpets? Building control is the statutory mechanism to ensure compliance with regulations, with inspectors responsible for certifying the safety of structures, but it has little capacity to monitor quality of workmanship. “It’s a spot-check overview,” Farmer says. “The inspectors can’t take responsibility for actually checking what’s going on, on a day-to-day basis.” On an average housing site, they will visit at various stages to check a couple of plots, but not every single home. Building control used to be run by local authorities but, like so many other public services, it has been progressively privatised since the 80s. As the Grenfell inquiry heard from expert witness Luke Bisby, professor of fire and structures at the University of Edinburgh, the privatisation of the system has continuously eroded its independence and rigour. His report explained how, between 1984 and 2017, a culture shift occurred, from one of inspectors “policing” developers to one of them “working with clients” under commercial duress, resulting in a “race to the bottom” in practices within the construction industry. Architects talk of encountering inspectors who are happy to sign off stages of work without even visiting the site, basing their judgment on a few photos – which could be of anywhere. One said they witnessed a clearly non-compliant project being awarded a building control certificate before the correct fire seals had been fitted because the contractor “promised they would finish it”. “As the architects, we tried to stall the issue of the certificate,” they said, “as we could see the contractors would stop all momentum. The lack of diligence was nauseating.” Paula Higgins used to work for the civil service, in the Department for Communities and Local Government, on a review of building control. In all of the discussions around improving the quality of construction and reforming the inspection system, she realised the voice of the homeowner was almost entirely absent. “We’ve all heard the horror stories for years,” she says, “but the balance of power is completely one-sided. With everyday products covered by consumer legislation, you have the right to send something back if it’s faulty. Yet with the most expensive purchase of your life, you can’t return it if it’s badly built. People have more rights if they buy a toaster than if they buy a house.” The lopsided situation prompted Higgins to set up the HomeOwners Alliance in 2012, to champion the interests of buyers and campaign for better quality new-builds. One of its suggestions, a new-builds ombudsman, was finally taken up in 2022, but many are cynical about its impact. In May, having been established for over a year, the ombudsman service said it had received only one eligible complaint. * * * So why do the big housebuilders appear to care so little for the quality of what they are selling? Perhaps because they don’t have to. There is hardly an incentive for them to do any better when there is so little competition. In 1960, the 10 biggest housebuilders built just 9% of all homes. Now, that share has mushroomed to more than half. “Local builders have been squeezed out of the market,” Berry says. “We know that consumer satisfaction is higher for smaller housebuilders, because their reputation depends on building quality homes. The volume builders just turn up, build, then move on.” With such a hold over the market, the big builders are free to focus on their duties not to homeowners but to shareholders. Architect Nicholas Lobo Brennan worked in Switzerland before returning to the UK to co-found the practice Apparata in 2015 – shortlisted for this year’s Stirling prize and the winner of the Neave Brown housing award for their radical low-cost housing project in Barking, east London. It was a shock to find an industry in which the priorities were so upside down. “The shareholder is the real customer. In the current climate, there’s less room to make this gross amount of money, so they have to cut costs wherever they can, like using inferior adhesive to glue tiles on, or hiring cheaper workers.” Persimmon’s half-year financial report this summer highlighted that its approach to “smart” savings included buying cheaper materials and cutting subcontractors’ prices, in the face of rising construction costs. Archer and Cole’s study examined the influence shareholders have over the industry. Their analysis revealed that just three big investment managers (Legal &amp; General, Norges and Vanguard Group) were the largest shareholders in eight of the nine biggest housebuilders, allowing them to exert heavy influence. “They could assert their demand for maximising shareholder value in eight different boardrooms,” they write, “knowing what the ramifications of selling their shares would be for wider confidence in the firm and its stock price.” Such abstract decisions taken in the boardroom have an inevitable impact on the quality of the homes – they stand as cost-saving spreadsheets come home to roost in uneven bricks and hastily splattered mortar. A spokesperson for Legal &amp; General Investment Management says, “As an asset owner, we engage with companies in the housebuilding sector on issues from executive pay to reducing their environmental impact. As a developer, we also aim to ensure that the housing supply we create is built to a high standard. We are committed to using our scale and influence to encourage companies in which we invest to improve their management of key shareholder and ESG issues. As such we have dedicated significant resources to our stewardship obligations.” Norge and Vanguard Group declined to comment. Back in Peterborough, after several hours up and down ladders, Murphy concludes that the house in question is one of the better ones of the more than 2,500 he has examined. It’s not surprising, as the homeowner was already content – he just wanted the inspection for peace of mind. Nonetheless, this comparatively well-finished home still had corners chipped off the reconstituted stone windowsills, a cracked brick, excess mortar smeared on the walls, missing mastic seals around the porch, plastic wrapping on an upstairs window, trash left under the bathtub, a boiler flue collar not fitted properly and a fire door with a wide gap around it, so it might not be effective in the event of a fire. “I’ve noticed the mentality is changing a bit,” Murphy says. “The developers are always nice to us when we show up and they take our reports seriously – there’s a fear factor now.” There is a risk, after all, that they might end up as the punchline in his next viral song.",Homes; Construction industry; Property; House prices; Life and style,Life and style
2020-12-17T00:01:23Z,Lloyd's market to quit fossil fuel insurance by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/17/lloyds-market-to-quit-fossil-fuel-insurance-by-2030,"Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, has bowed to pressure from environmental campaigners and set a market-wide policy to stop new insurance cover for coal, oil sands and Arctic energy projects by January 2022, and to pull out of the business altogether by 2030. In its first environmental, social and governance report, Lloyd’s, which has been criticised for being slow to exit fossil fuel underwriting and investment, said the 90 insurance syndicates that make up the market would phase out all existing insurance policies for fossil fuel projects in 10 years’ time. Less than 5% of the market’s £35bn annual premiums comes from insurance policies in this area. “We want to align ourselves with the UN sustainability development goals and the principles in the Paris [climate] agreement,” said the Lloyd’s chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown. “A lot of syndicates are already doing some of the things we are setting out here but we are trying to create a more comprehensive framework for the whole market.” The Lloyd’s market will also end new investments in coal-fired power plants, coalmines, oil sands and Arctic energy exploration by 1 January 2022, and phase out existing investments in companies that derive 30% or more of their revenues from this area by the end of 2025. Carnegie-Brown defended the 2030 target date for ending fossil fuel insurance. “We want to try to support our customers in the transition and we don’t want to create cliff edges for them,” he said. “Oil is too fundamental an energy supply source for the world today and it would be impossible to get out of that without creating real dislocation to our customers. It’s an issue of calibration over time.” Lindsay Keenan, European coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign, which has pressured many insurers globally into divesting from coal, said: “It’s a good step forward but it’s clearly not ambitious enough. The 2030 deadline is hard to justify given the science.” He voiced concerns about two controversial projects: the Trans Mountain tar sands oil pipeline extension in Canada, which is partly underwritten by Lloyd’s insurers, and Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Australia, where Lloyd’s insurers have also been involved. Lloyd’s declined to comment on those two projects. Lloyd’s also committed itself to having women in 35% of leadership positions across the insurance market – board level and the two layers below the board – by the end of 2023. At the moment, women make up less than 25% of leadership roles. The firm will also set targets for black, Asian and minority ethnic representation next year, once it has collected more data from its members. The environmentalist and journalist Flemmich Webb, who died in November aged 49, worked tirelessly with colleagues on the Lloyd’s sustainability report released on Thursday. “This will be a fitting and long-lasting legacy for a deeply respected colleague,” the company said in a statement.",Lloyd's; Fossil fuel divestment; Insurance industry; Women in the boardroom; Environment; Business,Business
2020-06-12T23:01:00Z,Ethical investments are outperforming traditional funds,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/13/ethical-investments-are-outperforming-traditional-funds,"Environmentalists cheered by huge improvements in air quality during the lockdown – and the collapse in coal power generation – have another reason to celebrate. Even the stock market has gone in their favour. A detailed number-crunching of environmentally sustainable funds has revealed that they have outperformed traditional funds across the board – beating them during the pandemic as well as during the 10 years up to and including the coronavirus sell-off. The data, from the global research agency Morningstar, comes amid growing evidence that environmentally focused investing – once pigeonholed by City traditionalists as only for a vegan/hippy minority – is becoming mainstream. This week, Vanguard, one of the world’s biggest fund managers, launched two ethical index funds aimed at UK investors, while Aviva, Britain’s biggest insurer, unveiled a “climate transition” fund. Morningstar examined 745 sustainable funds and compared them against 4,150 traditional funds, and found they matched or beat returns in all categories – whether bonds or shares, UK or abroad. “Average returns and success rates for sustainable funds suggest that there is no performance trade-off associated with sustainable funds. In fact, a majority of sustainable funds have outperformed their traditional peers over multiple time horizons,” it says. Over 10 years, the average annual return for a sustainable fund invested in large global companies has been 6.9% a year, while a traditionally invested fund has made 6.3% a year. The outperformance continued during the coronavirus crisis. “In all but one category considered in the study, sustainable funds outperformed, with average excess returns in Q12020 ranging between 0.09% and 1.83% across categories,” Morningstar says. One reason may be that many US tech stocks, popular among environmental investors, have soared during the crisis, while shares in oil, gas and coal companies have plummeted. The Nasdaq index of US tech stocks has recovered completely from the coronavirus crisis, reaching new highs this week, while the oil giant ExxonMobil is trading at $53 compared with $70 before the lockdown. The Morningstar researchers noted that sustainable funds are longer-lasting than their peers. One of the tricks of the asset management industry is that funds that do badly are quietly removed – usually by merging them with another, better-performing fund. This has the effect of flattering the overall performance figures, suggesting that investors are doing better over the longer term than they really are. Morningstar found that three-quarters of sustainable funds lasted 10 years or more, compared with less than half of traditional funds. Campaigners welcomed the confirmation that sustainable funds are better. Michael Kind of ShareAction – a charity and company that promotes responsible investment – says: “It’s very positive, but also not surprising, to see that funds with robust environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies are overall better performers financially. We hear from savers very often that one of the biggest barriers to action is that there is a perception that you will lose out financially if you switch to investing responsibly. “But is this enough? No … we would expect more ambitious and authentic ESG funds to deliver better outcomes for stakeholders and the environment but not inevitably to deliver investors more money every time.” ShareAction’s checklist for making your money more socially responsible Research what funds your pension/Isa/investment provider offers you. Look into the holdings and stewardship/investment policies of your funds, or those you are considering putting money in. These policies show how your asset manager will invest your money and try to influence companies on your behalf. You can either do this on your own or ask your investment (or pension) provider/employer/financial adviser for this information. It is important to see how your investment provider votes at the world’s largest companies’ AGMs. Are they voting for climate action and supporting human rights? ShareAction recently produced an independent global ranking of the most responsible asset managers across many topics. Use it to make an informed decision when selecting a manager.

2021-02-20T08:00:27Z,‘Absolutely ridiculous’: top scientist slams UK government over coalmine,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/20/absolutely-ridiculous-top-scientist-slams-uk-government-over-coalmine,"One of the UK’s most eminent environmental scientists has called the government’s failure to block a new coalmine in Cumbria “absolutely ridiculous”. Prof Sir Robert Watson said the UK’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis was “wonderful”, but that there had to be a focus on immediate actions. The UK is hosting a UN climate summit, Cop26, in November and Boris Johnson has pledged to lead a green industrial revolution. “The British government says, ‘We’re going to lead Cop26 in Glasgow, we really care about climate change. But, by the way, we won’t override the council in Cumbria, and we’ll have a new coalmine.’ Absolutely ridiculous!” Watson said. “You get these wonderful statements by governments and then they have an action that goes completely against it.” Watson has led the UN’s scientific organisations for climate and biodiversity, is a former chief scientific adviser at the UK’s environment department and worked for Bill Clinton when he was US president. He has also held senior positions at Nasa and the World Bank. The underground mine would be the UK’s first in 30 years. Critics, including the government’s official climate advisers, say it seriously undermines Johnson’s ability to lead a successful UN summit, which is seen as vital in averting the worst impacts of global heating. Ministers have repeatedly said the decision on the mine is a local one. Supporters of the £165m mine say it would provide 500 jobs in an area which is among the most deprived in the country. On Thursday, 40 Conservative MPs wrote to the leader of Cumbria county council warning that stopping the mine would “represent a serious risk to Cumbria’s economic growth”. The council approved the mine in October and communities and the local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, chose not to “call in” the plan for a central government decision, which is allowed if a project conflicts with national policy. Amid growing controversy, the council said earlier in February that it would reconsider the decision to take into account climate advice published in December by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). Watson said decisions to stop carbon emissions were needed immediately: “We need action now. A lot of governments have said, ‘We’ll be zero carbon by 2050’. That’s wonderful [but] it’s 30 years away. The key message on climate is we need to have a 50% reduction of emissions by 2030. We’ve got to focus on short-term actions, not [just] long-term targets and goals.” Other leading scientists have criticised the mine. Prof James Hansen, who has been called the “godfather of climate change”, told Johnson his “actions and decisions now will either establish or undermine your claim to climate leadership”. Prof Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, said the mine “is a big mistake”. The mine would produce 2.7m tonnes a year of coking coal, which is used in steel-making rather than burned in power stations. About 85% of the coal from the mine is planned for export, although there is no shortage of such coal globally. The mine has planning permission to 2049 but the CCC has said “there may be no domestic use [for coking coal] after 2035”. Green experts say steelmakers will have to deploy new technology to reduce their emissions under the UK’s net zero targets and that green industries provide more secure jobs. Cumbria council has yet to set a date for its planning committee to meet and reconsider the mine application, but it is expected before council elections in May. It is thought locally that the council is unlikely to overturn the original backing for the mine, but Jenrick could yet call in the decision. Earlier in February, the website Responsible Investor revealed that EMR Capital, the firm financing the mine, is a signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, which requires “incorporating environmental, social, and governance issues into decision-making processes”. The UK has cut emissions faster than any other rich nation in recent decades by phasing out coal burning for electricity, as well as with the closure of much of the country’s heavy industry and importing more manufactured goods from overseas. But ministers are being criticised over a series of decisions that run counter to cutting emissions, including backing a gas-fired power station that would be the biggest in Europe, a third runway at Heathrow airport and committing £27bn to new roads, a policy now under legal challenge. It was also reported last week that one of Johnson’s flagship green policies, a £1.5bn green homes grant scheme, is likely to be scrapped having reached just 4% of the homes intended.",Coal; Climate crisis; Energy; Steel industry; Cop26; UK news; Environment; Fossil fuels,Environment
2020-08-06T17:30:14Z,"Expansion of Pilbara mine threatens 60,000-year-old sacred site, inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/07/expansion-of-twiggys-pilbara-mine-threatens-60000-year-old-sacred-site-inquiry-hears,"Traditional owners in the Pilbara, whose lands are near those destroyed by Rio Tinto’s blast at Juukan Gorge in May, say two ancient rock shelters – one of which is estimated to be at least 60,000 years old – are under threat at a site where Fortescue mining is planning expansion permitted under Western Australia’s Aboriginal heritage laws. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into Juukan Gorge, which will hold its first public hearing on Friday, the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation (WGAC) said the two rock shelters contain evidence of use and occupation by humans dating back 47,800 years in one, and 60,000 years in the second. “A third site contains petroglyphs – engraved rock art on a series of five stone panels – that depict animal and human figures, animal tracks and geometric motifs,” WGAC said. Eastern Guruma traditional owners describe the petroglyphs as the Guruma “sacred text” because figures representing the major dreaming narratives in the area are all contained within the same site. “These highly significant sites have not had the benefit of years of excavation and study, like Juukan Gorge,” the WGAC submission, prepared by heritage manager Dr Kathryn Przywolnik said. WGAC represents the Eastern Guruma people, whose native title over 6,000 sq km of the Hamersley Range was the first claim to be finalised in the Pilbara, in 2007. Mining tenements cover 93% of Eastern Guruma country, WGAC said. There are currently seven mines and three rail lines operating on their lands, with new ones under construction. “It is in this environment of expansion, heavy industry and unprecedented cultural losses that WGAC has made major and significant discoveries about its heritage in recent years, pushing the oldest dates for occupation of the Hamersley Range further and further back into the deep Pleistocene past,” WGAC said. It said a recent review found at least 434 heritage sites have been destroyed, a further 285 are “very close” to current mining operations and more than 20,000 drill holes have been made. “Within two generations, Eastern Guruma people have seen their country change from a remote place teeming with wildlife, fresh water and unbroken sacred narratives that networked through the Pilbara, to a heavily industrialised mining hub, now dissected by railways, dry and devoid of animals,” WGAC said. It had particular concerns about a site west of Spear Hill called Weelumurra, where there are dozens of rock shelters, stone structures, camping sites and painted and engraved rock art. Fortescue Mining Group (FMG), owned by Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, had sought approval under s18 of WA’s Aboriginal Heritage Act to destroy the first batch of several sites in the area to expand its operations. But Fortescue CEO, Elizabeth Gaines said the WA Government has agreed to pause consideration of the s18 AHA application for two months, so additional consultation can occur. Gaines said the company had previously agreed on a boundary around Spear Hill after working with Eastern Guruma people and Aboriginal heritage professionals nominated by WGAC, and “consequently designed our mining operations to stay outside of the agreed boundary”. WGAC was critical of the WA Aboriginal heritage act, which it said makes it “all too easy” for the minister to make “poor decisions” in approving s18 applications, to rely on “work-arounds and compromises” and give mining companies “a disproportionate degree of discretion in whether to preserve cultural sites”. “The minister’s decision is a high stakes one, in the sense that once destroyed a culturally important site cannot be restored, reinstated or recreated,” WGAC said. Since 2017, WGAC said it has responded to 15 applications for mining by Rio Tinto and FMG in Eastern Guruma country. Of 123 sites affected, 12 sites were identified by Eastern Guruma people to be of great cultural importance, “being sites where customary law originated, birthing places, rock shelters dating back to earlier than 40,000 years ago, ceremonial sites, sites for storing sacred objects and rock art sites”. WGAC’s native title agreement with Rio Tinto, signed in 2007, is confidential and traditional owners are unable to discuss its specifics. WGAC said the Eastern Guruma people are in a similar situation to others in the Pilbara, who “also find themselves with tightly contained agency, unable to object to or seek recourse on heritage or tenure decisions.” WGAC said they are “relying upon Rio Tinto’s better nature” to not impact sites. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which monitors the environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices of Australian-listed companies, and is a shareholder in Rio Tinto, said the Juukan Gorge destruction was a “textbook case” of the materialising of serious ESG risk. “Human rights abuses are generally classified as ‘S’ risk, and failures of leadership or non-application of company commitments are generally classified as ‘G’ risk. This case has both elements,” the ACCR said. Since the blast, the ACCR said it has been involved in briefing institutional investors accounting for well over $20tn in assets under management. “It is difficult to imagine more compelling evidence of severe corporate reputational damage than being compared to the Taliban, as Rio Tinto was by multiple commentators, and on social media, following the blast.” The Northern Australia Committee, which is conducting the inquiry, will hear from Rio Tinto on Friday, as well as the federal and WA governments. Committee Chair, Warren Entsch said it was important to find out what happened at Juukan Gorge and find ways to prevent such incidents occurring again. “We will be holding extensive consultations with Indigenous stakeholders during the course of the inquiry, and expect to visit the affected sites,” Entsch said.",Indigenous Australians; Rio Tinto; Indigenous art; Australia news; Mining; Andrew Forrest; Environment; Heritage; Business,Australia news
2021-02-10T20:02:29Z,The BoE governor makes sense about the EU but are politicians listening?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/feb/10/the-boe-governor-makes-sense-about-the-eu-but-are-politicians-listening,"Andrew Bailey, taking a day off from quarrelling with Dame Elizabeth Gloster over London Capital &amp; Finance, gave a long list of reasons on Wednesday for why, in a rational world, it would be straightforward for the UK and the European Union to cooperate on financial services. This is important territory. Arrangements on financial services, which were excluded from last December’s Brexit trade deal, could dictate the future of the City for a decade. First, said the Bank of England governor in his speech at Mansion House, regional disagreements don’t make sense in a financial world that increasingly runs on global rules overseen by global bodies. Second, the UK’s standards already look more equivalent to the EU’s than those of Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Brazil, countries that have been awarded “equivalence” gold stars by Brussels. Third, it’s nonsense to expect equivalent to mean identical. The UK’s rules must govern a financial system 10 times the size of UK GDP, so local differences are to be expected – indeed, are essential. Fourth, the UK isn’t interested in creating “a low regulation, high risk, anything goes” financial system, so the EU shouldn’t worry about importing instability. They’re all fine arguments and Brussels clearly implicitly accepts a few. Temporary equivalence was granted last year in some areas for reasons of financial safety. If a deal – or even the memorandum of understanding due next month – was solely in the hands of financial technocrats, the temporary might become permanent. The problem, of course, is that politicians will decide. The big unknown is the EU’s appetite for cutting the City down to size, which is mostly about the ambitions of Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Bailey’s logic was impeccable. But, if the EU wants to insist that euro-denominated financial deals are cleared within the eurozone, that is now its call. No, a £40m CEO bonus isn’t OK Now we know: a £40m bonus for the chief executive of a FTSE 250 company is fine, or so most big shareholders in Future, the publishing house behind PC Gamer, Real Homes and Horse &amp; Hound, believe. The contentious proposal to crank up potential rewards met a 36% rebellion, but a majority is a majority. Future’s plea that it is a special case worked. The company’s argument was that Zillah Byng-Thorne, the chief executive who will receive the splendid sum if five-year targets are achieved, has already overseen Future’s transformation from stock market straggler to £2bn operation. The company also congratulated itself that the rest of workforce, unusually, will be offered mini-jackpots. Fine, but almost every company can plead its position is exceptional in some way. The Restaurant Group, owner of Wagamama, thought its executives needed new incentives after the trading whack from lockdowns. At Cineworld, the cinema chain, it was a case of a show of force: the two brothers in charge were backed by a 20% family holding. Future’s proposal is less objectionable in the sense that the company is not starting with a battered share price, as conceded here last week. But Byng-Thorne’s package still equates to £8m a year at the maximum, a sum one used only to associate with companies halfway up the FTSE 100 ladder. This is boardroom pay inflation in action. And the timing – in the middle of an income-destroying (for some) pandemic – looks terrible. At least Chuka Umunna isn’t still an MP now he’s a banker Chuka Umunna will lead JP Morgan’s environmental, social and governance work in Europe, which sounds like a proper job, as opposed to the advisory gigs the Wall Street bank has handed out to Sajid Javid and Tony Blair. All the same, the appointment represents yet another trip down the well-travelled road between Westminster and the City. The regularity of such journeys feels unhealthy. Banking is a political business. A decade ago, the state was bailing out banks and introducing regulatory reforms. Soon the issue will be how hard lenders should chase the repayment of Covid loans – those underwritten by taxpayers and those where the banks are on the hook. In an ideal world, there’d be an unbridgeable career gap between lawmakers and banks. In practice, it’s probably impossible to place limits on where former politicians can work once they’ve left Westminster – and, at the age of 42, Umunna has to do something. Rather, the appointment that should have created a stink is Javid’s, since the former chancellor is still an MP. That arrangement ought to be strictly off-limits.",Business; Andrew Bailey; Bank of England; Europe; World news; UK news; Financial sector; Banking; Newspapers & magazines; Media; JP Morgan; Chuka Umunna,Business
2020-12-20T06:55:34Z,Trickle-down economics  is dead. It’s time to tax the rich harder,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/20/trickle-down-economics-is-dead-its-time-to-tax-the-rich-harder,"Pressure is building on Rishi Sunak to tax the City financiers and business owners that conventional Tory thinking states will quit Britain – or, less theatrically, restrain their entrepreneurial instincts – if they are forced to contribute more to the communal pot. Study after study shows that the tenets of free-market thinking are deeply flawed and that nations that follow a tax-cutting agenda do nothing for the underlying strength of their economies. The latest examination of the subject comes from the London School of Economics. It studied fiscal policies in 18 countries over 50 years and concluded that tax cuts for the rich have never trickled down and only really benefit those individuals who are directly affected. The paper found that cutting the top rates of tax filled the pockets of higher earners and increased inequality. It did little, if anything, to stimulate business investment. This might seem obvious to anyone on the left of the political spectrum, who will have long since dismissed the trickle-down theory of economics. But it is a mantra on the right and remains a cornerstone of the argument for tax cuts. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, took pains to say goodbye to Donald Trump with a list of achievements over the last four years. One that made him particularly proud was the economic boom that was kicked off by the biggest tax cuts for the rich since Ronald Reagan’s time in the Oval Office. This, he argued, had given rise to pay rises across the board, and especially for low-income workers. And he is not the only rightwing politician or thinktank economist in the US to credit the cuts with a boost to investment and wages. What he failed to mention is that individual states have spent the past four years increasing their minimum wage rates following years of stagnation, sometimes by almost double. Nothing to do with Trump. Back in the UK, George Osborne cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in 2012 with the support of business leaders and economists, including two former members of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, DeAnne Julius and Sushil Wadhwani, who said the higher rate he inherited from Labour “punished” entrepreneurship. Several years later, Osborne hailed the move as a money-spinner. He said Britain’s highest earners had generated so much extra income, encouraged by the tax benefit, that they had paid £8bn in extra tax to the exchequer. But what Osborne failed to say was that tax payments were held back in the year before his policy came into effect and then paid the following year at the lower rate. This deferral was a sleight of hand, a distortion, and, in the end, supported an economic fallacy. Meanwhile, if anyone needed persuading that the problem of runaway boardroom pay is acute in the UK, a report last week by the High Pay Centre does the trick. The study reveals that Ocado’s chief executive, Tim Steiner, was paid £58.7m last year – a sum that is 2,605 times the £22,500 paid to the online grocery delivery company’s staff on average. Retailer JD Sports paid its chief executive, Peter Cowgill, £5.6m. This was 310 times the average £18,300 paid to staff. Executive pay is one way to remunerate corporate bosses. More lucrative are the share options that are taxed as capital gains, at a much lower rate. Some campaigners say the best way to tackle the problem is to empower companies’ shareholders, who will then impose strict limits on executive pay. Others say workers on boards would take the campaign into the boardroom, with radical results. The German experience suggests that putting workers on boards has done little to limit soaring pay at the top. Likewise, shareholders have occasionally slapped the wrists of executives, but not much else. Higher taxes are the only way. And they cause no harm, except to the bank balances of those they target. Sobered-up Britain leaves pubs and bars heading for last orders It’s no secret that bar and pubs are in trouble, with thousands at risk of permanent closure. Early data on annual alcohol sales, revealed in Saturday’s Guardian, underline the scale of the problem. The prevailing narrative has been that lockdown is driving us to drink. It seems to make sense, after all, what else is there to do? But while there’s evidence to support an alarming rise in excess drinking among certain cohorts, the overall picture is very different. Supermarkets, free to trade throughout the pandemic, have been making out like bandits when it comes to alcohol sales. The flipside of that coin, indeed the reason for it, is that tens of thousands of hospitality venues have been shuttered for much of 2020. December sales, which can account for a quarter of venues’ annual profit, are predicted to be 90% down on last year, a hit of £650m. The dynamics are pretty clear: those who can’t drink on a night out with friends or colleagues are doing so at home instead. However, the two trends do not cancel each other out. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association reports a 10% fall in beer sales and 5% fall in wine. Even gin’s winning streak is over, with overall sales down from £2.6bn to £2.2bn. On balance, Britain is more sober than it was in 2019. This may deliver public health benefits but for hospitality venues – singled out at as high-risk even as shopping centres throng with Christmas bargain-hunters - it’s a slow-motion tragedy. Those who don’t serve food got nothing out of VAT relief or “eat out to help out”. The £1,000 grants on offer in tier 3 are laughably small, less than a night’s takings in some cases. Pubs and bars are drifting towards the point of no return, with thousands destined to be converted into posh flats or offices for a lucrative property investment. The question now is whether the government is as comfortable with that prospect as it seems to be. Unilever’s green conversation with investors is not just for show Here’s a shareholder vote that the board of Unilever should find easier to win than the one it held a couple of years ago on the madcap plan (which was eventually dropped) to move the company’s domicile to the Netherlands: do you like our climate commitments or not? Any Unilever shareholder who is unaware that the company nowadays preaches a gospel of sustainable capitalism must be living under a rock, so a roar of approval is the way to bet. In any case, the result of the vote will not be binding on the board. That advisory feature prompts a different question: what’s the point of it? Is this an exercise in virtue signalling, or is there a serious purpose? It’s the latter. One goal is transparency – always an advantage. Another is setting visible short-term targets to be met on the way to reaching Unilever’s long-term aims, such as “net zero emissions from sourcing to the point of sale, by 2039”. Votes like this one will happen every three years, starting at next May’s shareholder meeting, and the board will report on progress against the plan annually. The company’s climate commitments “are only as good as our delivery against them,” says the chief executive, Alan Jope. Unilever is not quite the first company to put its climate transition plans to a regular vote – Aena, the Spanish airport-management company, got there in October – but it is a large multinational with significant influence. One suspects that this might be the start of a trend. ESG – or environmental, social and governance – investing is the biggest growth area in town, but conversations between shareholders and boards can often feel unstructured. A detailed set of climate policies, capable of being voted on and capable of being measured, provides focus. This is a smart move by Unilever.",Executive pay and bonuses; Corporate governance; Economic policy; Rishi Sunak; Conservatives; Business; Politics,Business
2022-08-04T15:51:15Z,Hot Chip: ‘Joe once hit Alexis with a baseball bat!’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/04/hot-chip-joe-once-hit-alexis-with-a-baseball-bat,"So how did you write Over and Over, the greatest song of all time? laurasnapes Joe Goddard Me and Felix [Martin, drum machines] lived in an old converted church in Camden. I was trying to copy the bassline from Dance by ESG. Everyone added parts and Alexis [Taylor, lead vocals, guitar, keyboards] wrote the lyrics – “the joy of repetition really is in you” etc – referring to how Felix and I kept playing this bass groove over and over. I remember looking around the church with the estate agent going: “This’ll be perfect for your band practices. Sign here!” Then as soon as we started playing, the lady upstairs phoned, saying: “I’ve just had a baby. What are you doing?!” What are your favourite Hot Chip deep cuts? I’m a massive fan of Ends of the Earth and Dark and Stormy. Lorence_G Al Doyle (guitar/synth) Those are good ones. Also a B-side called The Girl in Me – and I really like Let There Be Him, because audiences would chant it. Goddard I recently opened a laptop folder with about 50 demos from the year 2000, which were either amusing or incredibly embarrassing. We made a whole unreleased album called Felix in the Factory in 1998, which was not good. So for me those are deep cuts. Which songs off the new album, Freakout/Release, are you most excited to have everyone hear? htowunivorn Goddard Probably the title track, because when you’ve been a band for a long time it feels exciting to do something so different. It’s pared back, angrier, then goes almost techno punk. Also The Evil That Men Do. Alexis wrote the lyrics when there was all that bullshit directed at “wokeism”. The Colston statue had been pulled down in Bristol and we wanted to align ourselves with that. Britain’s colonial past has left this trauma in the British psyche that gets brushed under the carpet. Did you consider any other names before arriving at Hot Chip? wenders14 Goddard No. Alexis and I came up with that name in about 1995 when we were at school. We played our first gigs at the “performance centres” there, where you’d have arty stuff like Kieran [Hebden] from Four Tet doing guitar improvisation, or my mate Dan DJing jungle records while someone did mountain-bike tricks. Doyle We used to say we chose the name so we could be next to Hot Chocolate in the record racks, which was utterly untrue. What’s the best thing to put on hot chips? Ketchup, mayonnaise or curry sauce? TopTramp Doyle I’m from up north [Leeds] so should say curry sauce, but I’m a mayonnaise man. Goddard In Amsterdam once I had Thai peanut sauce on chips. It was great, but I was a bit stoned. Al, how do you manage to be in Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem at the same time? thsafc Doyle It’s been absolute blind luck over the years that when one band’s been off, the other’s been on. There was one year when I couldn’t do LCD so they got an amazing guy called Dave Scott Stone from the Melvins. Major rehearsals take six weeks so I decamp to the States. It’s been very busy this year but a nice problem to have. You have been responsible for some cracking remixes, such as Kids With Guns by Gorillaz. How much involvement does the original artist have when you remix their song? VerulamiumParkRanger Goddard It varies between being completely left to our own devices, someone giving us some pointers, or us going: “Would you like a house remix, sir?” It’s mostly plain sailing, like with Gorillaz. But occasionally it can really go to shit if they say: “But you haven’t included my guitar solo!” When Alexis and I did one for Kraftwerk we thought it would be cool to put distorted guitar on, but they sent it back with those sections removed. And vice versa – do you have a favourite remix of Hot Chip? qbflestrin Doyle Getting the Carl Craig remix of One Life Stand was amazing, and hearing other DJs playing it in clubs was incredible. Goddard I really like Detroit producer Osborne’s remix of Take It In and the remix of No Fit State by Audion from a few years ago, a big hit in the clubs. Doyle [laughs] Goddard It was! How did you get to work with Jarvis Cocker and how did the collaboration go down in person? laurasnapes Goddard We’ve got a mutual DJ friend in Paris, so we started going to dinner, which was very exciting because Pulp’s His ’n’ Hers was a huge record for me. I think Alexis suggested Jarvis for our song Straight to the Morning. He was fantastic. He just came into the studio and became Jarvis! With the moves and everything. Doyle It’s like when we did a thing with Peter Gabriel. We thought, “Blimey. He sounds like Peter Gabriel. How has your approach to playing live changed over time? qbflestrin Doyle The big change was getting a drummer, which started in New York when Felix was ill so couldn’t operate the drum machine. We knew the LCD guys a bit so asked Pat Mahoney to play with us. He listened to three or four songs in the dressing room, set up and did the gig. We were blown away. I remember seeing you playing at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in about 2001, playing acoustic guitars. A couple of you were with a friend of mine called Kate. One of the songs had a refrain about taking a beating. Have I imagined all this? Manofthesouth Goddard We played a couple of Cambridge balls. Very drunken affairs, but we did actually have a song called Taking a Beating. Doyle And we do have a friend called Kate! I saw her very recently in the Lake District, so it’s all true. As an older fan, Hot Chip are my “new” New Order. Is there any comment or storyline you can offer about their influence or otherwise? Joanne Goddard They’re a massive influence on us and we’ve played with them several times. Bernard [Sumner] once told me that one of the reasons he fell out with Peter Hook was the way Hooky ate his crisps. Apparently, when he’d finished them he’d open up the bag and get his face in all the corners. Relationships with bandmates do get quite intense! You always look like you’re having a great time live. Is it as much fun as it looks? Slowandnoddy Goddard [drily] No. Doyle Sometimes. This is a raw question, because we’ve had some gigs recently where things haven’t been quite right , so you’re smiling on stage but dying inside. When we were very young, Owen [Clarke, multi-instrumentalist] and I had a fist fight and Joe once hit Alexis with a baseball bat. Goddard It was actually an outsize drum stick from a shop display, but it looked like a baseball bat. One of my happiest times on stage was in Cardiff, hitting balloons with it, but I accidentally clipped Alexis. Doyle It was a head wound. We retired it from live shows after that. • Freakout/Release is released on 19 August",Hot Chip; Pop and rock; Electronic music; Dance music; Culture; Music,Culture
2020-01-26T06:00:14Z,May I have a word about… why even estate agents don’t deserve to be shuttered | Jonathan Bouquet,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2020/jan/26/may-i-have-a-word-about-why-even-estate-agents-dont-deserve-to-be-shuttered,"I have never felt the need to address the subject of estate agents. True, theirs is a despised calling, as my daughter discovered when she briefly became one and had instant pariah status bestowed on her. But reading about the lack of office space in the City, I began to share some of the revulsion. According to Mat Oakley, the head of commercial property research at Savills: “It is going to be a very tough year for office tenants. If you’ve bought into wellness and ESG [environmental, social and governance] and productivity, you obviously want the best of the best – you want accessible buildings, you want buildings that your staff can work flexibly.” I think, reading between the lines, this means that clients want the most space for the least amount of money. The parlous situation of the department store chain Beales reflects a wider malaise in bricks and mortar retail. I am relieved that it hasn’t completely turned up its toes, as it will postpone an outbreak of that noisome word beloved of the financial press – “shuttering”. Shops can’t simply close these days – they must be shuttered. Whether the users hope to inject a note of drama into proceedings – the cataclysmic crashing of steel shutters – I can’t say, but shut will do just fine. I was also amused to discover that the great romantic figure Byron used to refer to Wordsworth as “Turdsworth”. What, this from the creator of Don Juan? Tsk, tsk. We should count our blessings that he didn’t overlap with Walt Whitman. Finally, TV ads rarely make me laugh, but the one for a well-known brand of washing machine capsules that comes with the stern warning “Keep away from children” is an exception. Well, it has long been my policy. • Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",Property,From the Observer
2020-03-09T06:01:01Z,Carbon emissions fall as electricity producers move away from coal,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/09/carbon-emissions-fall-as-electricity-producers-move-away-from-coal,"Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% last year, the biggest drop in almost 30 years, as countries began to turn their backs on coal-fired power plants. A new report on the world’s electricity generation revealed the steepest cut in carbon emissions since 1990 as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources. Overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year, even as China’s reliance on coal plants climbed for another year to make up half the world’s coal generation for the first time. Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007, and last year collapsed by almost a quarter in the EU and by 16% in the US. The report from climate thinktank Ember, formerly Sandbag, warned that the dent in the world’s coal-fired electricity generation relied on many one-off factors, including milder winters across many countries. “Progress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,” the report said. Dave Jones, the lead author of the report, said governments must dramatically accelerate the electricity transition so that global coal generation collapses throughout the 2020s. “To switch from coal into gas is just swapping one fossil fuel for another. The cheapest and quickest way to end coal generation is through a rapid rollout of wind and solar,” he said. “But without concerted policymaker efforts to boost wind and solar, we will fail to meet climate targets. China’s growth in coal, and to some extent gas, is alarming but the answers are all there.” The EU has made the fastest progress towards replacing coal with wind and solar power, while the US has increased its reliance on gas following its shale boom in recent years. The report revealed that renewable wind and solar power rose by 15% in 2019 to make up 8% of the world’s electricity. In the EU, wind and solar power made up almost a fifth of the electricity generated last year, ahead of the US which relied on these renewable sources for 11% of its electricity. In China and India, renewable energy made up 8% and 9% of the electricity system, respectively. To meet the Paris climate goals, the world needs to record a compound growth rate of 15% for wind and solar generation every year – which will require “a colossal effort”, the report warned. The electricity generation report was published as a separate piece of research claimed that 38 out of 75 of the world’s largest asset managers are stalling on taking action on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The latest ranking by Asset Owners Disclosure Project, a scheme managed by the investment campaign group ShareAction, found that the 38 asset managers have weak or nonexistent policy commitments and fail to account for their real-world impacts across their mainstream assets. The survey also claimed that the investment managers often lack appropriate engagement and escalation processes on climate change, human rights and biodiversity. Scores were based on a survey of activities in responsible investment governance, climate change, human rights, and biodiversity and ranged between AAA to E. Not a single asset manager was granted an AAA or AA rating, the top two scores available. Felix Nagrawala, ShareAction analyst, said: “While many in the industry are eager to promote their ESG credentials, our analysis clearly indicates that few of the world’s largest asset managers can lay claim to having a truly sustainable approach across all their investments.” ShareAction said the world’s six largest asset managers – including BlackRock (rated D), State Street (D) and Vanguard (E) – were among the worst performers. Vanguard said it was committed to companies making “appropriate disclosures on governance, strategy and performance on relevant ESG risks”.

2021-10-05T19:15:48Z,THG investors start to question Matthew Moulding’s ambition,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/oct/05/thg-investors-start-to-question-matthew-mouldings-enthusiasm,"When your share price falls by a third in the three weeks after a big announcement that was supposed to reveal hidden value within your company, you’ve got a problem. This is Matthew Moulding’s predicament. The founder and boss of THG, the business formerly known as The Hut Group, was hailed as the nation’s gift to e-commerce retailing during last year’s £4.5bn flotation, but his latest attempt to seize the supposedly “unparalleled” opportunities that exist online is falling flat. THG’s shares stood at 650p before mid-September’s news of a plan to spin off the beauty operation that owns the Lookfantastic cosmetics website. Price now: 418p, down another 5% on Tuesday. The stock is thinly traded, not least because Moulding owns 22% and his super-charged voting rights disqualify THG from stock market indices, but outsiders are clearly rattled. Moulding doesn’t help himself with his hyperbole, but the heart of the problem seems to be an addiction to deal-making. Why does THG want to demerge its beauty division – its largest by revenue – only a year after going public itself? The line about the need to focus investment on “key growth areas, including own-brand portfolio expansion” read like an advertisement of the need to buy more brands in a hurry. The beauty division, ran the thinking, is undervalued compared with US peers, so separation would deliver a sky-high valuation and a new acquisition currency. If only life were that simple. Instead of applauding the idea, investors seem to have concluded that THG will require far more capital, or more share dilution, than previously assumed. That impression was reinforced when Moulding immediately began talking about a follow-up demerger of the nutrition division that sells protein shakes and suchlike. THG raised £920m at float and another £770m via a placing in May that brought in SoftBank of Japan as an investor. Isn’t that enough capital for the time being to pursue the dream of global expansion? Remember, THG has yet to report a bottom-line profit. Part two of the demerger pitch to shareholders arrives next week when Moulding will set out the path to break up by detailing operating margins within THG’s three divisions, including the key Ingenuity platform. More transparency may help, but the safer option at this stage could be to shelve the demerger. Take a hint from the fading share price and leave the corporate gymnastics for another day. Morrissey raises red flag on China Dame Helena Morrissey, the City grandee and these days chair of the investment platform AJ Bell, asks a good question: why don’t China’s human rights abuses get mentioned in ESG debates? Surely they’re the definition of the “S” within the world of environment, social and governance investing. “How can one set of fundamental principles – our human rights – be cast aside simply because it might be inconvenient in the fight against climate change? Or because they might get in the way of a very short-term financial gain?” she asked an event at the Conservative party conference this week. It would be “very naive”, she argued, to think western investment in Chinese companies brings any form of influence. It’s impossible to disagree. HSBC, one of the firms in her firing line, showed as much with its pusillanimous utterances during the crackdown on rights in Hong Kong. It is also, unfortunately, naive on Morrissey’s part to think a revolt by “small pension holders” against managers who put them into Chinese stocks will turn the tide. The investment industry is wedded to its Chinese exposure, which is why Evergrande’s property pack of cards receives infinitely more scrutiny than Beijing’s suppression of the rights of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. But her point stands: ESG investing has brought benefits, but is full of hypocrisy on China. Chip shortage drives car cancellations The supply chain statistic of the day came from Melrose, the engineering company that bought the aerospace and automotive group GKN in 2018: in a normal month “in-month cancellations” in automotive run at 1%, but now customers, mainly big car and vehicle manufacturers, are cancelling at a rate of 20%-25%. The problem is the global shortage of semiconductors, which has a knock-on effect on the production process. It’s a supply issue, rather than a demand one, so Melrose and its peers can still expect a whoosh of orders when the blockages clear. Its shares fell only 1%. The wider tale, though, is that chip shortages are getting worse, which wasn’t meant to happen.",THG; Business; Shares; Stock markets; UK news; E-commerce; Retail industry,Business
2020-12-16T06:14:39Z,Liberal MPs pour cold water on inquiry backed by Frydenberg into bank lending for coal projects,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/16/liberal-mps-pour-cold-water-on-inquiry-backed-by-frydenberg-into-bank-lending-for-coal-projects,"The “modern” Liberals Andrew Bragg and Tim Wilson have brushed off calls from within the government for a fresh inquiry into banks’ decisions to stop lending to coal companies. On Wednesday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, signed up to a plan put forward by the Liberal National MP George Christensen to launch an inquiry through the trade and investment growth committee to query how climate change is impacting banks’ lending decisions. The move comes as 29% of ANZ shareholders approved a resolution for the bank to “to reduce exposure to fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreement’s climate change goals”. All four major banks have signalled they will align their portfolios to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, with most aiming to cease lending to thermal coal companies by 2030. The moves have prompted a furious backlash from Nationals MPs who want a new coal-fired power station in north Queensland, with some even calling to boycott banks including ANZ. Christensen, who has denied the link between climate change and the severity of natural disasters, wants the committee he chairs to set up an inquiry to grill financial regulators – the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority – and banks over plans to pull back on lending or insuring mining projects because of climate change. Frydenberg reportedly told the Sydney Morning Herald: “It is only appropriate that the parliament be able to examine trends in banking, insurance and superannuation investment practices and how they may affect our resources sector and the regions in which they are based.” Wilson, who chairs the house economics committee, told Guardian Australia that his committee “explores the legitimate issues of climate and sovereign risk … frequently during our hearings with the banks and regulators”. “It might be wise to review the house economics transcripts first before starting a new inquiry, but that is a matter for the trade and investment committee,” he said. Bragg, a senator from New South Wales, told Sky News that environmental, social and governance risk is “a very legitimate measurement and framework for financial institutions to measure long-term risk, including the risk of climate change”. “That is something we have been supporting as a government,” he said. “Ultimately, though, the judgment banks and financial institutions make on lending is a matter for those institutions. “Environmental risk is no different from any other sort of risk – it’s an economic risk.” As the Coalition continues to balance its inner-city liberal constituency with regional voters who are more supportive of fossil fuel industries, Labor has also faced internal struggles about whether it should back a gas-led recovery. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told reporters in Logan that central banks, regulators and financial institutions had done “important work” on “how we manage the financial and investor risk associated with climate change”. Chalmers said Nationals, including the resources minister, Keith Pitt, and Christensen, lived in an “alternate universe” and disputed the importance of tackling climate change. “I think it speaks volumes about this treasurer that he places a higher premium on placating the George Christensens of this world rather than engaging properly and rationally in the important work that’s going on to make sure that we can manage financial and investor risk associated with climate change. “We want to see this inquiry based on facts, not based on conspiracy theories.” At the ANZ annual general meeting on Wednesday, 29% of investors representing nearly $19bn of investment backed a resolution demanding less exposure to fossil fuels. The number is almost double the 15% achieved for a similar resolution last year. Despite the Nationals’ anger at banks, environmental activists at Market Forces have accused the big four of taking too long to wind up coal loans and inconsistent efforts subjecting oil and gas to similar scrutiny. NAB and Westpac are reviewing their approach to funding oil and gas, a move Market Forces wants replicated at ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank. The Reserve Bank of Australia has said climate change poses a rise to financial stability and has joined central banks in warning that global GDP could fall 25% below the expected level by 2100 if the world does not act to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Apra announced in February it would undertake a climate change financial risk vulnerability assessment of the major banks in 2021. It estimates that Australia will need to spend about $3.5bn a year to limit damage from climate-related natural disasters, with the cost of responding to them after the fact is likely to be 11 times greater.",Australian politics; Banking ; Climate crisis; Australia news; Australian economy; Business; Banking; Environment; Coal; Josh Frydenberg; Liberal party; Coalition; National party; Liberal National party; Labor party; George Christensen; Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy; Energy,Australia news
2020-10-17T07:00:14Z,Rowan Williams urges UK universities to divest from fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/17/rowan-williams-urges-uk-universities-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels,"The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has called on UK universities to follow the example of Cambridge and end their multimillion-pound investments in fossil fuels. Williams, a former master of Magdalene college, Cambridge, said all universities had a duty to their students to create a “safer world”, and investing tens of millions of pounds in fossil fuel corporations was incompatible with this. “I hope the higher education world in this country and elsewhere will rise to the challenge and lead the way in securing a safer and fairer world for the next generation,” the academic and author said. This month Cambridge University said it would divest its multibillion-pound endowment fund from big oil corporations, following a five-year campaign by students, academics and politicians. Campaigners want all the UK’s leading research universities, known as the Russell Group, to follow suit. Daniel Johnson, a student at the University of Manchester and member of Divest Russell Group, said the pressure on university bosses was intensifying. “It’s not longer acceptable for any institution, let alone our places of learning, to still invest in fossil fuel companies and profit off the climate crisis,” he said. According to the student campaign group People and Planet, which has been at the forefront of the UK divestment movement, 17 of the 24 Russell Group universities have already committed to full divestment, six – including Imperial College London – have pledged only partial divestment, and one – Birmingham University – has rejected any move to divest. Last year more than 200 academics at Imperial signed an open letter calling on the university to divest fully from the top 200 fossil fuel companies. It said: “By profiting from products which are known to cause global climate change and cause serious health issues, these businesses are directly responsible for causing and aggravating the problems that Imperial seeks to tackle.” However, the university has refused to fully divest, saying it will continue to invest in fossil fuel companies as long as they are “actively moving towards meeting Paris agreement targets”. Critics have rejected this, pointing out that a recent study found none of the leading fossil fuel companies were in line with the commitments set out in the Paris agreement. A spokesperson for Imperial said it pursued “an active approach to investments in all asset classes – considering social, environmental and government” issues. They added: “Where companies’ current activities and future plans are not aligned with Imperial’s policies, and efforts at influence do not work, we will divest.” A spokesperson for Birmingham University said it was “committed to maintaining high environmental, social and governance standards across its investment portfolios. Since May 2019, the university has moved its absolute return fund investments to ethical investment funds where available, heavily restricting or excluding investments in companies generating revenue from carbon and fossil fuels.” Campaigners say their victory at Cambridge, which has one of the biggest endowment funds of any European university and had refused for years to countenance divestment, could prove a tipping point. Johnson said: “Universities such as Birmingham or Imperial are standing on the wrong side of history and we will escalate action if they won’t commit to full divestment soon.” • This article was amended on 20 October 2020.

2020-07-07T19:42:54Z,"Next, Asos and Amazon drop Boohoo amid Leicester factory claims",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/07/next-and-asos-drop-boohoo-amid-leicester-garment-factory-claims,"Next, Asos and Amazon have decided to pull all Boohoo clothing from sale as growing anger over workers’ pay and conditions at the company’s suppliers resulted in £1.5bn being wiped from the fast fashion brand’s value in two days. Allegations that some factories in Leicester that sell clothes to Boohoo pay as little as £3.50 an hour and failed to protect workers from coronavirus emerged last week. On Tuesday, the three online retailers were joined by very.co.uk and Zalando, a European e-commerce giant that had €6.4bn sales in 2019, in removing Boohoo clothes from sale. Next said the company acted last week in response to a report from the campaign group Labour Behind the Label, first reported in the Guardian, which detailed the allegations. “Next concluded there is a case for Boohoo Group to answer,” a spokesman said. An Amazon spokesperson said: “Selling partners are required to follow all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon policies when selling in our store. We will be suspending the sale of the brands in question.” The news will come as a further blow to Boohoo after it was forced to announce an investigation into claims that workers at one of its Leicester suppliers were being paid well below the hourly minimum wage of £8.72. Other factories are alleged to have forced people to work throughout lockdown despite some on site having symptoms of coronavirus. Zalando said: “We expect our partners to apply similar fundamental priorities and will distance ourselves from those who don’t.” Boohoo, previously a £5bn company which also owns the Nasty Gal and PrettyLittleThing brands, has strongly denied any responsibility for the alleged bad practices of its Leicester suppliers. It told the Guardian on Friday: “We are working with our third-party compliance partner to further investigate the claims raised and are working with suppliers to ensure compliance.” It did not respond to a request for further comment. Shares in the company fell almost 12% on Tuesday to 261.4p, their lowest level in nearly three months. That knocked £440m off its market capitalisation, on top of the £1.1bn wiped off its value on Monday – a drop of almost a third. The claims have revived long-held concerns over working conditions in Leicester’s garment industry, where around 1,000 factories and small workshops make clothes, mostly for UK fast-fashion brands. An estimated 75%–80% of clothes produced in the city are for Boohoo. The online retailers said that their relationships with the company in future would depend on the results of investigations and how the company responded to any findings. Next said its approach was “based on trust” but that the allegations could not be ignored, and had launched its own investigation. It said it was “not pre-judging the outcome of this process and no final decision has been made” but that Boohoo items would be suspended in the meantime. It is understood that Amazon and Asos have taken temporary measures while they await the outcome of investigations into Boohoo’s supply chain. Zalando said it would consider restoring Boohoo items “only once all corrective actions have been satisfactorily addressed”. Very said its move was temporary and that it would “await the outcome of Boohoo’s investigation and its subsequent operational response”. The news is “part of the reputational fallout” for Boohoo and its brands, said Aneesha Sherman, an industry analyst who estimated that revenue from other sellers amounted to 4% of the company’s income but was important as a marketing platform and signal of status. She said there would be concerns that social media influencers who are the company’s main marketing route to its young customer base would start to desert it. “I expect to see them distancing themselves in the next few days,” Sherman said. Former The Only Way Is Essex cast member Vas Morgan and model Jayde Pierce, moved to distance themselves from their former work for Boohoo on Tuesday. They have around 1.5m Instagram followers between them. Others, including former Love Island star Molly Mae O’Hagan, viewed by industry sources as Boohoo’s most valuable endorsement, declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Investors believe the company will ultimately right itself but are concerned in the short term, Sherman said. “There’s a lot more consideration of ESG [environmental, social and governance issues] than there was five years ago.” Concerns about Boohoo’s supply chain emerged less than a month after the company announced a bonus plan worth up to £150m for its bosses. On Tuesday, Umar Kamani, the son of the company’s billionaire owner, Mahmud Kamani, and founder of PrettyLittleThing with his brother Adam, tweeted “the truth will always come out” but then deleted the message. Amy Reddish, head of brand at PrettyLittleThing, posted an Instagram story with the text: “Don’t believe everything you hear or read.” The company’s customer service replies on social media posts appeared to be struggling to catch up with the situation, meanwhile, with comments on Boohoo Instagram posts raising concerns drawing what appeared to be automated replies. One message calling Boohoo “disgraceful” and criticising practices at its suppliers drew the response: “Please DM us in regards to this and I’ll get this looked into for you! :)” • This story was amended on 8 July 2020 to correct a reference to the share of Boohoo revenue coming from sales on other online retailers.",Boohoo; Next; Asos; Retail industry; Fashion; Leicester; Coronavirus; Business; Life and style; UK news; Amazon,Business
2020-02-20T11:22:54Z,Audit firms face review by watchdog over climate risk exposure,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/20/audit-firms-review-watchdog-climate-risk-exposure,"The UK’s accounting watchdog has launched a major review into whether companies and their auditors are adequately reflecting the financial risks of the climate crisis in their accounts. The Financial Reporting Council, which sets reporting standards for all listed companies in the UK, plans to use the review to make sure companies are being clear with investors about their exposure to climate risks. The review could lead to tougher disclosure rules for UK listed companies and more scrutiny on the work of accounting firms – including KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC – in helping investors to identify climate risks. Sir Jon Thompson, the FRC’s chief executive, said company reports and accounts were “essential to understanding how the corporate world is responding to the challenge of climate change”. “Not only do boards of UK companies have a responsibility to report their impact on the environment and the risks of climate change to their business, but investors expect them to operate sustainably,” he said. “Auditors have a responsibility to properly challenge management to assess and report the impact of climate change on their business.” The FRC will also examine whether companies have adopted the recommendations put forward by the the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was set up to highlight the financial exposure of companies to the risk of climate chaos. Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, warned companies late last year to use their next two annual financial reports to road-test how they represent climate risks in their accounts. He said that while many of the largest banks and energy companies had made progress in how they report their climate risks, this progress is “uneven across sectors”. Investors are calling for better climate disclosure standards as they face increasing pressure to prove they are investing responsibly. Under a new voluntary City code, which came into effect this year, pension funds and asset managers must publish annual reports showing they have taken environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account when investing. The FRC, which governs the code, said it would help “align the approach of the whole investment community”. The FRC plans to select a sample of company financial reports from across different industries to assess to what extent they comply with reporting requirements in relation to the climate emergency. It will investigate whether auditors have assigned enough resources to analysing climate risks and whether the impact of a climate crisis has been appropriately reflected in company reports and accounts. The first set of accounts to face the FRC’s scrutiny under its new investigation will be taken from this year, which will be published from early 2021.",Accountancy; Financial sector; Business; UK news; Climate crisis; Environment,Business
2020-03-15T15:50:04Z,LGIM to launch its first fossil fuel-free pension fund after pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/lgim-to-launch-its-first-fossil-fuel-free-pension-fund-after-pressure,"The UK’s biggest fund manager has bowed to client pressure and agreed to launch its first fossil fuel-free ethical pension fund later this year. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which has been one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, made the decision after a number of clients raised concerns that stocks such as Shell were still being included in its range of ethical funds. Those clients include PensionBee – an online pension provider that handles £750m-worth of client assets for more than 75,000 customers – which is expected to be among the new fund’s first investors. It wrote to LGIM last year after being inundated with questions from its own customers about the fact that Shell was among the top 10 holdings in one of the investment firm’s ethically focused Future World funds. PensionBee is believed to be one of the fund’s top five owners, with more than £60m invested. “It is clear that there is increasingly strong demand for pension products that give customers the choice to divest from oil,” PensionBee said. While the full stock list for the new fossil fuel-free fund has not yet been confirmed, it will exclude oil companies and take a wider ethical stance by barring investments in tobacco, weapons makers and pure coal manufacturers. Emma Douglas, the head of defined contribution at LGIM, said: “Based on our funds in our Future World range, the new fund will be driven by long-term thematic analysis, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations and active ownership, which means engaging to bring about real, positive change in the companies we invest in.” LGIM, which has more than £1tn in assets, said the fund will be open to corporate pension schemes and individuals. The investment firm has defended holding Shell in its Future World range of funds. Those funds are governed by its climate impact pledge, meaning it is willing to exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as for lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. LGIM has said it needs to balance environmental and financial concerns when putting together the investment portfolio, previously noting that Shell is one of the largest payers of dividends in the UK. Its climate pledge has led LGIM to dump stakes in China Construction Bank, Rosneft Oil, Japan Post Holdings, Subaru, Loblaw and Sysco Corporation in 2018. Last year, it cut a further five stocks from the ethical funds, including the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer MetLife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) last year. However, a Guardian analysis last year also found LGIM as a whole had spent about $367m (£285m) between January and November, increasing its stake in those companies in other parts of the business, even when accounting for the divestments. LGIM openly admits it continues to hold stakes in companies excluded from those environmentally and socially focused funds, saying it gives them the opportunity to engage with the board and ultimately influence company behaviour. Commenting on the launch of the fossil fuel-free fund, PensionBee said: “We hope this is just the start of all savers using their investments to transform the world they live in – for the better of the planet, society and their retirement.”",Legal and General; Business; Investments; Investment funds; Money; UK news; Fossil fuels; Environment; Shell; Pensions; Pensions industry; Oil; Climate crisis,Business
2020-06-13T00:11:32Z,'Heritage of all Australians': Rio Tinto and BHP in damage control after call for mining halt,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/13/heritage-of-all-australians-rio-tinto-and-bhp-in-damage-control-after-call-for-mining-halt,"Calls are growing for an immediate halt to mining operations in the Pilbara that have been approved under Western Australia’s “archaic” Aboriginal heritage laws and the Senate will hold an urgent inquiry, as international outrage from investors pushes big mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP into damage control. On Thursday, Guardian Australia revealed that BHP Billiton was poised to destroy at least 40 significant Aboriginal sites in the central Pilbara to expand its A$4.5bn South Flank iron-ore mine, even though it was aware the traditional owners are deeply opposed to the move. By day’s end, following public outcry, the company said it would not go ahead without “further extensive consultation” with the traditional owners, the Banjima people. The mounting backlash against mining companies for their destruction of Aboriginal heritage grew after Rio Tinto’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old heritage site at Juukan Gorge last month, and their actions have been compared by shareholder groups to widespread bad conduct in the financial services sector before the banking royal commission. Rio Tinto’s global chief, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, made his first public comment on the issue on Friday, saying “we are very sorry for the distress we have caused the PKKP in relation to Juukan Gorge and our first priority remains rebuilding trust with the PKKP.” The apology came after Rio’s chairman held meetings in London this week to explain their actions to major shareholders. Among them were Aberdeen Standard International (ASI), its seventh-largest shareholder, which said it was “deeply concerned”. “The reports on BHP’s activities are also deeply concerning to ASI, and we will similarly be reaching out to BHP to discuss these reports,” said ASI’s Danielle Welsh-Rose. Welsh-Rose said investors should expect companies to go beyond their legal obligations, particularly when local laws fall short of international standards or community expectations. “In a situation like this, mining companies will face reputational risk as well as the likelihood of being downgraded on ESG factors such as governance, oversight and community relations,” she said. “ESG factors” are the environmental, social and governance values of its investments. Even Australian Super, which is notoriously quiet on matters of ESG, told Guardian Australia it was “very concerned about this situation” and had twice engaged with Rio Tinto about it. This week, Rio Tinto was also stripped of its partner status with Reconciliation Australia. Reconciliation Australia wrote to all its partner organisations, including BHP, “regarding our expectations on the standards we expect of them as partners and what constitutes respectful relationships, including organisations who operate under WA heritage laws”. On Tuesday, about 300 people joined a protest led by Noongar elders outside Rio Tinto’s offices. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, asked protesters to “express yourselves in other ways” than gathering during the coronavirus pandemic, even though most wore face masks. “The approvals for [Rio] were granted in 2013, we didn’t know anything about it,” McGowan told reporters. But concerns about mining in the Pilbara have been around for years. The executive officer of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Brynn O’Brien, said she had been contacted by investors concerned about BHP’s Aboriginal heritage track record long before Guardian Australia revealed it had received permission to destroy sites in the expansion of its South Flank mine. Rio Tinto and BHP are considered peers in the industry, O’Brien said. “BHP would be very, very unwise to ignore this backlash.” But their conduct has been perfectly legal. Both companies received ministerial consent order to destroy the sites under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws. The Aboriginal Heritage Act was introduced in 1972 to protect “sacred or otherwise culturally significant” sites from destruction by the mining and pastoral industries. It developed a process for registering sites, making it illegal to discover a site and not notify the government. Section 18 allows mining companies and other landholders to apply for ministerial permission to destroy Aboriginal heritage. It does not give traditional owners a right of appeal or even a right of reply. In many cases, as with BHP, the registration of sites and permission to destroy them is sought in a single application. The Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee (ACMC) makes a recommendation to the Aboriginal affairs minister, who grants consent for a site to be destroyed. Between 1 July 2010 and 1 March 2020, the ACMC considered 463 section 18 applications from mining companies. None were refused. In BHP’s case, permission was granted four days after news broke of Rio Tinto’s detonation at Juukan Gorge. On May 28, the WA minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, a Yamatji man, said he had not known about Juukan Gorge until after the blast happened. He told reporters: “Yeah, I didn’t know. Which is unusual. Normally when there is a concern around upcoming activity around heritage sites I do get contacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation. The first I heard about this was after the explosion. But it has emerged that his department was aware. Wyatt told parliament that the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage held a pre-arranged meeting with advisers for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people (PKKP) four days before the blast. It told the PKKP advisors there was no way to revoke the section 18 approval, and called Rio Tinto after the meeting. But Wyatt repeated that he was not aware of concerns until after the site was destroyed. Federal Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt, also a Yamatji man and cousin to his West Australian counterpart, admitted lawyers from the PKKP contacted his office on 20 May, seeking an injunction under federal laws. Wyatt referred them to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has carriage of the federal Aboriginal heritage protection act. Wyatt told the ABC this week the PKKP lawyers did contact Ley, but “by then it was too late”. His office did not follow-up with Ley until after the sites were destroyed. “But we have to watch every other site that exists within that Pilbara region and I would urge elders to make sure that they check on those sites to ensure that there is no further damage done in the Pilbara, because some of those other sites are 60,000 years plus old,” he said. On Friday, the Senate agreed to take a look at all states and territories, where Aboriginal heritage is poorly protected under the law. “This is a very significant outcome,” Labor’s Linda Burney said on Friday. “We believe that the resources industry is incredibly important to the Australian economy, and we want to see better practices. “We also make the point very strongly that Aboriginal cultural heritage, as pointed out by Unesco two weeks ago, is the heritage of all Australians.” But WA Labor senator Pat Dodson went further, calling for a moratorium on the granting of section 18s until WA amends the act. “And if that holds up production, well that’s a question for the minister to be getting on with these consultations and trying to improve the legislation,” Dodson said. “It’s an archaic act, the minister makes that admission himself. He’s been trying to amend this for two years or so. There’s gonna be another election before he gets around to introducing a new bill. So, in the meantime, you just cannot have the status quo position prevail. “I cant tell the state what to do, but, you know, there’s got to be some fairness for First Nations peoples.” A long way from machinations in Perth and Canberra, the Banjima traditional owners found themselves in the media spotlight this week, unable to comment specifically due to their agreement with BHP, and reeling from the sudden loss of a beloved senior elder. But in a statement they said: “As a matter of lore and culture shared with other traditional owners across Australia and the world, the Banjima people do not support the destruction of sites of cultural significance. “We stand with all Aboriginal traditional owners and particularly our Pilbara brothers and sisters, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura, at this time in our abhorrence at the destruction of the Juukan rock shelters, and those suffering the threat of or having recently experienced similar site destruction.” The Senate inquiry is due to report by 30 September.",Indigenous Australians; Mining; Australia news; Western Australia; Rio Tinto; BHP,Australia news
2022-03-09T10:28:07Z,Green credentials of world’s largest investor questioned over oil industry emails,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/blackrock-privately-soothes-oil-industry-fears-over-its-new-green-credentials,"Emails have revealed the high-wire act performed by major banks and the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, as they privately soothe oil industry concerns about their public support for greener investment. In his annual letter to chief executives, BlackRock boss Larry Fink said that pursuing climate action policies was not about being “woke” but was about pursuing profits on behalf of clients. The comments were widely seen as a signal that the asset manager, whose clients have entrusted $10tn to its care, would wield its investment clout to support greener ventures. But emails – obtained via a freedom of information request by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the thinktank InfluenceMap – show that a regulator in oil-rich Texas left a meeting with BlackRock believing the company had undergone a change of heart. After the meeting with BlackRock staff, on 7 January 2022, the chair of the Texas oil regulator, Wayne Christian, wrote to the company expressing his relief. He said he had been concerned by the asset manager’s promotion of investments governed by environmental and social guidelines (ESG), which typically involve selling out of oil and gas stocks. He said that it was “nice to hear that BlackRock didn’t mean – or no longer believes – many of the disagreeable things the company and … Mr Fink have said about the oil and gas industry”. In an attached letter, Christian said BlackRock’s staff had referred to “media misrepresentations” about its environmental stance and had also declared themselves “supportive” of the oil and gas industry. Replying to Christian, a BlackRock employee did not question his interpretation of the discussion but pointed to comments made by Fink, saying that “traditional” energy companies were “part of the solution” alongside environmental investment policies. BlackRock said there was no contradiction between its public statements and its private conversations with Christian. “BlackRock has been clear and consistent since January 2020 that climate risk is an investment risk that will impact returns in investors’ portfolios as companies navigate both the physical and transition risk associated with climate. “Our investment conviction is that sustainability and climate-integrated portfolios can provide better risk-adjusted returns to our clients. “In addition, BlackRock has long stated that energy firms play an important role in the global economy and in a successful transition. “We expect to remain long-term investors in carbon-intensive sectors. We do not pursue broad divestment from sectors and industries as a policy. But Anusha Narayanan, climate campaign manager at Greenpeace USA, said it appeared BlackRock was “trying to have their cake and eat it”. “We need to stop falling for this false choice between a healthy planet or a healthy economy. Fossil fuels give us neither. Last week’s IPCC report made it clear that climate change is already causing widespread damages and losses to people and ecosystems around the world, with increasingly irreversible consequences. “Financial regulators are calling the climate crisis an emerging threat to the stability of the US financial system. “For companies like BlackRock, investing in a carbon-free future must mean the immediate divestment from coal, oil, and gas.” While BlackRock walked the line between greener investments and staying on the right side of oil industry advocates, US banks have faced similar pressure from oil-rich states, in one case apparently forcing a change of policy. In November, the treasurers of 15 US states – responsible for more than $600bn in funds – wrote an open letter to the banking industry in which they threatened to withdraw from financial institutions that boycott fossil fuel companies. A second freedom of information request shows that US Bank wrote to the state treasurer of West Virginia, who coordinated the letter, saying it hoped to maintain its relationship with the state, a major coal producer, for many years to come. In a note, Tim Rieder, senior vice-president of US Bank, added: “Personally, I totally agree with the [treasurers’] letter.” US Bank subsequently appeared to change its investment policy, removing a pledge to boycott coal investments. US Bank said it had not changed its policy under pressure from US states and that its investment policy had not prohibited financing coal-fired power since October 2020. However, its 2021 environmental responsibility policy, displayed on the bank’s website until last week, did prohibit US Bank from financing coal-fired power. A host of other banks have also issued reassurances to Texas, after it implemented a law requiring financial institutions to certify that they do not boycott energy companies in order to remain eligible to do business with the state. Barclays, Citigroup, UBS and Wells Fargo were among 39 institutions that made the pledge. Barclays said: “We are aligning our entire financing portfolio to the goals and timelines of the Paris [climate] agreement, on the way to becoming a net zero bank by 2050.” UBS said it supports the goals of the Paris agreement and added: “We view engagement with companies in all industries as fundamental to any sustainable investing approach.” Citigroup said: “Our policies are focused on responsibly managing the energy transition, not boycotting the energy sector. This position has been communicated consistently to all of our stakeholders.” Wells Fargo declined to comment.",Climate crisis; Fossil fuel divestment; Business; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Banking,Environment
2021-07-26T07:00:14Z,The truth behind corporate climate pledges,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/26/climate-crisis-green-light,"For climate campaigners, 26 May seemed like the start of a long-awaited reckoning for oil and gas companies. Over a single 24-hour period, a Dutch court ordered Shell to dramatically cut emissions, shareholders voted to force Chevron to reduce emissions from the products it sells, and a tiny activist investment firm secured three positions on ExxonMobil’s 12-member board for candidates committed to climate action. When trying to ascribe responsibility for the climate crisis, it’s hard to overstate the outsized role fossil fuel companies have played. The products of just 100 private and state-owned fossil fuel companies were linked to 71% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a groundbreaking 2017 report. A subsequent Guardian investigation in 2019 found 20 fossil fuel companies, including Chevron and ExxonMobil, were responsible for more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1965 – the point at which experts say fossil fuel companies were aware of the link between their products and climate change. But it’s not just fossil fuel companies fueling the climate crisis. Even if we immediately phased out oil and gas, emissions from agriculture alone may make it impossible to limit warming to the 1.5C goal in the Paris agreement. Across a slew of sectors from food and fast fashion to construction and heavy industry, companies have helped drive climate chaos. As climate impacts accelerate – the world is boiling, burning, flooding and melting – there is unprecedented pressure on all companies to start taking their own role in the crisis far more seriously. This pressure is translating into action. A record number of companies are making climate pledges, but experts warn the pace of action remains glacially slow in the face of a barreling climate crisis. *** Even if all current Paris agreement climate pledges are met, the world is still set to see temperature rises of about 2.4C by the end of the century – well above the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will already lead to severe climate impacts. As countries are under pressure to up their climate ambitions in the run-up to Cop26, the vital UN climate talks in November, the private sector is also being increasingly pushed by investors, employees, activists and consumers to take meaningful action. In response, corporations have put out a flurry of climate commitments. At least a fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies have now made some kind of “net zero” pledge to cancel out their carbon emissions. They are investing billions in clean energy, moving to electric vehicles, pledging to halt deforestation, and urging the US government to step up climate action. Tech companies have perhaps some of the most far-reaching goals. Last year, Microsoft pledged to be “carbon negative” by 2030, meaning it would remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. By 2050, it aims to have compensated for all of its historical emissions through carbon removal projects. Apple says its products and supply chain will be carbon neutral by 2030 and Google has committed to be powered exclusively by renewable energy by 2030 and claims it has already wiped out its carbon footprint by offsetting emissions. Most oil companies are moving far more slowly. Shell, BP, Total and Equinor have announced plans to reach “net zero” emissions by 2050, but few have committed to halt fossil-fuel exploration. Some have gone much further and completely transformed their business model: Danish firm Ørsted sold its oil and gas business in 2017 and has now installed more than a quarter of the world’s offshore wind capacity. The transport industry, responsible for around one-fifth of global CO2 emissions, is gearing up for bolder climate pledges. GM Motors announced in January it would be carbon-neutral by 2040 and sell only zero emissions vehicles by 2035. The aviation sector, which has been slow to make climate pledges, is considering whether to set a goal of becoming net-zero by 2050. Large numbers of companies, including consumer-facing firms such as Ikea, PepsiCo and Levi’s, are also signing up to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which helps companies calculate emissions targets aligned with the Paris agreement ambition of 1.5C. More companies have signed up in the first half of 2021 than in the whole of 2020, according to a Bloomberg report. “A decade ago, companies were setting these very incremental targets,” said Cynthia Cummis, co-founder of the SBTi and director of private sector climate mitigation at the World Resource Institute. “Now science-based target setting is becoming standard practice.” And it’s having an impact. An SBTi analysis of 338 large companies with science-based pledges found they had reduced combined emissions by 25% between 2015 and 2019. Corporations are losing the ability to “fudge the numbers” on climate policies, said Ketan Joshi, an Oslo-based climate analyst who tracks company climate pledges. “Companies are increasingly starting to understand that they’re losing their grip on the public relations hit of announcing a climate ambition and then doing nothing about it.” *** There are still big caveats. Global emissions are rebounding post-pandemic and 2023 is on track to see the highest levels of CO2 emissions in human history, according to the International Energy Agency. Despite the record number of corporate climate pledges, an analysis of 9,300 listed companies from index provider MSCI published in July found that they are still on course to exceed their “carbon budgets” – the total amount of emissions they can release and still keep in line with 1.5C of warming – within the next six years. This finding highlights the need for these companies to “dramatically accelerate climate action”, said Remy Briand, head of environmental, social and governance at MSCI. “It is easy to say that becoming net-zero is a high priority, but it is another to take action, especially immediate action.” While some companies have placed climate change at the top of their agenda, he added, others have made weak pledges or failed to act at all. “For those not matching their commitments or lagging, there should be nowhere left to hide.” Analyzing what companies are actually doing, however, can be painstakingly difficult when there is no requirement to disclose all key climate information and little consistency in corporate pledges making it all but impossible to benchmark progress. The changes required are so vast that many companies struggle to even articulate them. In an evaluation of some of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, the investor engagement group Climate Action 100+ found no company has fully disclosed how it plans to reach net-zero. With many corporate net-zero pledges still several decades out, often with few interim targets, monitoring their effectiveness can be hard. “We cannot wait for 2050 to see whether we fulfil the commitments or not,” said Gonzalo Muñoz, UN high-level champion on climate for Cop25. “It’s what we do today, and in these next five to 10 years, that will determine whether we succeed or not.” Figuring out how to quickly cut emissions is not an easy task for companies, which must work out not only how to reduce direct emissions and those from the energy that they use (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions), but also those which come from the use of their products (scope 3 emissions). Some of the boldest pledges rely on carbon removal technologies that don’t even exist yet, or at least not at the scale required. Many more are heavily reliant on carbon offsets, which allow companies to invest in “nature-based” programs like tree planting or forest protection to counteract their own emissions. Offset projects, however, have been plagued by allegations of flawed accounting, greenwash and sometimes even of actively fueling climate change. These climate pledges are also voluntary. To some, this shows that industry is trying to take responsibility for its own emissions. For others, it looks more like an effort at self-regulation to avoid government intervention. “I don’t think we have time for voluntary corporate initiatives any more,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “We’ve done them for decades and they haven’t worked. I think there’s a real need for governments to be coming in and putting in place some legislative and regulatory frameworks.” Many companies have publicly called for governments to take stronger climate action; behind the scenes it can be a different story. Amazon and Microsoft, for example, have been criticized for pitching themselves as climate leaders while also donating tens of thousands of dollars to politicians who oppose climate action. An Amazon spokesperson said it actively advocates for clean energy policies and a spokesperson for Microsoft said that to make progress the company “must engage with candidates and officeholders who hold a range of views”. The lobbying efforts of fossil fuel majors, meanwhile, are well documented. The five largest publicly traded oil and gas companies spent over $1bn on misleading climate-related branding and lobbying in the three years following the Paris agreement in 2015, according to a 2019 report by InfluenceMap. A host of investigations has revealed big fossil fuel companies knew about the link between their products and climate change for decades but continued to argue that climate science was uncertain and to push against climate action. Just last month an Exxon lobbyist was caught on tape by the investigative outlet Unearthed describing how the company was actively working against key US climate policies through lobbying and membership of trade associations. These same firms also encouraged a public narrative of individual responsibility for the climate crisis. British Petroleum notoriously helped to popularize the term “carbon footprint” with an online calculator that encouraged people to measure their own emissions. This focus on personal responsibility is echoed in other sectors, which advertise “more sustainable” products while continuing business-as-usual models of consumption and production. “The discussion that moves us away from corporate responsibility to personal responsibility is a huge distraction,” said Shannon Lloyd, an assistant professor of management at Concordia University in Canada. “As an individual, your choices have very little impact in terms of reducing the carbon or other environmental footprint of products. It’s more about getting laws put in place or policies in place than individual purchasing decisions.” *** Reaching a net-zero world will entail “wholesale transformation” in both infrastructure and how things are done, said Steven Clarke, director for corporate clean energy leadership at non-profit Ceres. “Some people refer to it as on the scale of a second industrial revolution.” Certain key sectors will face big challenges. There’s a lack of easy answers for some energy-intensive industries with huge carbon footprints, such as steel, cement, aviation and shipping, which are notoriously hard to decarbonize. Sectors which rely on high consumption of products with big climate footprints, such as fast fashion and meat, will also need to adapt significantly for the world to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. But there is huge potential for innovation and action. Most solar and wind projects are now expected to be cheaper than coal. Investment is flowing into “green hydrogen”, which could provide zero-emissions fuel for ships and airplanes and replace fossil fuels in steel manufacturing. Meanwhile, pressure on companies is intensifying. More than 1,500 lawsuits have been brought against fossil fuel companies. This number could accelerate thanks to advances in climate science making it easier to link climate damage to corporate activity. Employees are another lever for change. In 2020, hundreds of Amazon workers criticized the company for climate inaction last year. This year the non-profit ClimateVoice launched a campaign mobilizing employees to demand that big tech companies spend more of their lobbying dollars on climate policy. Companies cannot tackle the climate crisis by themselves, said Jamie Beck Alexander of Project Drawdown, a non-profit focused on climate solutions, “regulation will absolutely be required to transform entire sectors.” But this doesn’t let them off the hook, she added. “If business leaders truly grasped the seriousness of this crisis, they would immediately pivot their entire business models and resources toward scaling climate solutions full stop.”",Environment; Climate crisis; US news; Fossil fuels; World news; Energy; Business,Environment
2020-11-24T17:43:56Z,"AIA sponsorship is stain on Spurs shirts, say Kick Out Coal campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/aia-sponsorship-is-stain-on-spurs-shirts-say-kick-out-coal-campaigners,"Tottenham Hotspur may be top of the Premier League for a change, but the climate credentials of its shirt sponsor AIA are among the lowest of any club in the country, according to a new report by fossil fuel divestment activists. The logo of AIA has been emblazoned across the chests of Harry Kane, Hugo Lloris and teammates since 2013. But campaigners say it risks becoming a source of shame for the club, because the Hong Kong-based insurance company holds a stake of at least $3bn in coal projects. The AIA Kick Out Coal campaign, which comprises several divestment groups, says this “dirty secret” stains the shirt of Tottenham, which has otherwise gone further than almost any other club in its commitment to climate action. They say the coal investment also tarnishes the reputation of England football captain David Beckham, who is the global brand ambassador of AIA. The targeting of football sponsorship deals represents a new front in global divestment campaigns, which have so far concentrated on persuading financial institutions, governments, universities and churches to halt investments in fossil fuel companies. Several Premier League sponsors have dire climate records, including Chevrolet (Manchester United), Etihad (Manchester City) and Fly Emirates (Arsenal). The Champions League has partnered with Russian fossil fuel company Gazprom. The campaigners are focusing on AIA and Tottenham because that is where they see the greatest potential for change. Both organisations publicly aspire to the highest standards of efficiency and sustainability. This, says the campaigners, does not align with a link to coal – the dirtiest of fossil fuels and the main source of the carbon dioxide that is disrupting the climate. Last month, Tottenham became a founding member of Count Us In, a global initiative aiming to mobilise a billion people to act on climate change. One of its aims states: “Choose financial institutions and funds that invest responsibly.” AIA also has a reputation as a leader within the insurance field on environmental, social and governance issues. It has divested from tobacco and ammunition and is part of the Climate Action 100+ investor group that pressures fossil fuel producers and other companies to cut emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement. But the report says it is the only insurer in the group that has not fully divested from coal or adopted restrictions on new coal investments. Research for Insure Our Future – one of the groups behind the campaign – indicates AIA holds at least $3bn (£2.25bn) and most likely $6bn in bonds and equities of coal power utilities and loans to coal projects. This is said to include $125m of shares in Tenaga Nasional Berhad, which operates more than 13,000MW of coal power plants in Malaysia and other countries, and a $21m loan for the Toledo coal power plant in Cebu, in the Philippines. “We congratulate Spurs for being top of the league. They deserve a sponsor who is top of their own league and should call on AIA to drop all their toxic coal assets,” said Peter Bossard, the coordinator of the Insure Our Future campaign. “Along with Champions League sponsor Gazprom, next World Cup host Qatar and several other Premier League shirt sponsors, AIA are an example for climate villains using football to launder their image. Tottenham Hotspur is a climate champion among football clubs and could set an example by calling on their sponsor to clean up their coal business.” Tottenham, which signed an extended shirt sponsorship deal with AIA last year reportedly worth £320m, said it took its environmental responsibilities “extremely seriously” and would work towards improving efficiency and sustainability at all levels. “AIA has shared with us the significant strides it has already made to address the carbon intensity of its investments. In addition, more action in this area is planned to further reinforce their efforts as a result of the threat posed by climate change,” a spokesman said. AIA said it has reduced the carbon intensity of its portfolio in recent years by halting direct equity holdings in coal mining and coal power generation, focusing on renewables and investing in more green bonds. The company says it is now considering its position regarding its remaining coal-related investments. “The results of that process are currently being reviewed and finalised, and they will guide our future investment strategy in this area,” a spokesman said by email. “AIA places the highest priority on the wellbeing of our communities and we continuously work to ensure long-term sustainable outcomes through our investments.” UN secretary-general Antόnio Guterres has called for an end to the construction of new coal projects. Divestment activists have seen considerable progress in recent years in their efforts to deprive the sector of finance. Along with the falling price of wind and solar, this has promoted hopes that coal emissions – the main source of human-caused climate disruption – may finally have peaked. Climate campaigners say Tottenham, like other sports clubs, has a role to play. “Football could be a game changer on climate change, activating millions of fans,” said Eric Levine, a coordinator of Count Us In. “The Club (Tottenham) is a leader on climate action in football and committed to working with all its partners to encourage best practices.”",Environment; Coal; Tottenham Hotspur; Climate crisis; UK news; Football; Energy; Fossil fuels; Sport,Environment
2019-12-22T13:54:18Z,FTSE leaves coal and oil firms and G4S on ethical investment list,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/22/ftse-leaves-coal-and-oil-firms-and-g4s-on-ethical-investment-list,"Some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, including Russia’s state oil giant Rosneft, have been added to the London Stock Exchange’s “ethical” investment lists. The FTSE4Good indices, run by the London Stock Exchange Group’s FTSE Russell subsidiary, are marketed to investors interested in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. However, the LSE has refused to remove big polluting companies or the security company G4S despite allegations of systematic labour abuses across the world. At its latest semi-annual review earlier this month, FTSE Russell added the world’s 13th and 15th largest oil companies by market capitalisation, Rosneft and ConocoPhillips, to the FTSE4Good index. Rosneft Oil, Russia’s state oil company, produced 1.9bn barrels of oil in 2018. ConocoPhillips produced 468m in the same period. Other new inclusions were: Marathon Oil Corporation, a US company which produced 153m barrels in 2018. Lundin Petroleum, which produced 29.6m barrels in 2018. Origin Energy, which owns Australia’s largest coal-fired power station, Eraring. The FTSE4Good index rules explicitly ban coal firms, but the company also added Itochu Corporation, a Japanese conglomerate that mines coal as well as having interests including food, technology, textiles and machinery. Itochu’s coal-mining subsidiaries made profits of 65.2bn Japanese yen (£455m) in 2018. However, a loophole in the rules means that this exclusion only applies to firms whose main business is coal production – letting through conglomerates. The Guardian has previously reported that the FTSE4Good indices contain some of the world’s largest coal miners as well as oil and gas exploration and production companies. At the same time as adding the fossil fuel companies, FTSE Russell’s ESG committee refused to remove G4S, despite serious allegations over its treatment of migrant workers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The allegations were detailed in a report by Norway’s Council of Ethics, which monitors investments in the country’s £860bn Government Pension Fund Global. The report said there was an “unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations”. Human rights campaigners had expected the pension fund report – and G4S’s acknowledgement of issues – to trigger its ejection from the index. Wolfgang Kuhn, director of investor engagement at ShareAction, said: “We’re incredibly disappointed at FTSE’s decision. It’s deeply troubling that the index provider doesn’t consider evidence of human rights abuses to warrant exclusion from a so-called ethical index, particularly its failure to apply its robust exclusion policy when it matters most. “FTSE4Good is at best a mis-selling scandal in the making, and at worst continues to reward the most harmful activities in the corporate world.” The latest publicly available factsheets show that 65 oil and gas companies were already present on FTSE4Good’s emerging and developed markets indices. They included British and French oil “supermajors” Royal Dutch Shell and Total – the sixth and 17th biggest contributers to carbon dioxide pollution in history. Others included Italian supermajor Eni, Canadian oil sands miners Imperial Oil and Suncor Energy, and India’s Reliance Industries, the world’s seventh largest oil company. In a press release this month Italy’s Enel, the 13th largest, trumpeted its inclusion on the index because of its “sustainable business model”. “Looking at the number of oil companies listed in this index, this looks more like FTSE4Crude than FTSE4Good,” said Rosie Rogers, the head of Greenpeace UK’s climate campaign. “It takes some brass neck to argue that there’s anything ‘ethical’ about investing in the fossil fuel companies driving the climate emergency.” A spokeswoman for FTSE Russell declined to comment on the inclusion of new fossil fuel companies. On G4S, the spokeswoman said: “FTSE Russell and the FTSE Russell ESG advisory committee considered G4S against the controversy framework at this review, which assesses both the severity/scale of an incident as well as how effectively the company has responded. “Based on this assessment it was decided not to suspend G4S at this review. FTSE Russell will continue to closely monitor developments in relation to G4S.” The London Stock Exchange Group’s head of sustainable business, David Harris, has previously told the Guardian he would not exclude the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring shareholder pressure to bear.",FTSE; Oil and gas companies; G4S; Ethical business; Coal; Stock markets; Business; Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment; Energy industry,Business
2022-06-21T09:20:04Z,Palantir: Trump-backer’s data firm that wants a big NHS deal,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/21/palantir-concerns-over-data-firm-poised-to-be-operating-system-of-nhs,"For a company tipped to provide the NHS’s new overarching data platform, it is appropriate that Palantir Technologies is named after an all-seeing orb. Palantir, which draws its name from the powerful crystal balls deployed in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, is the favourite to win a £360m contract for the NHS’s Federated Data Platform (FDP). Covering everything from individual patients’ data to vaccination programmes, waiting lists and medical trials, the FDP will aggregate data from multiple sources and different formats on to a single platform. According to a document sent to potential bidders for the five-year contract, it will “provide access to real-time data to enable decision-making to better coordinate care”. Speaking at London Tech Week last week, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “This is the perfect moment to bring data together and reap the benefits.” The ambitious scope of the platform has alarmed campaign groups, who fear for patient confidentiality, privacy and data security, but the identity of the frontrunner has also caused concern. US-based Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of Silicon Valley’s few high-profile Donald Trump supporters. The $15.6bn (£12.7bn) company has been criticised for its work with the US immigration agency, as well as its intelligence service and defence contracts. It already works closely with NHS England by providing software that processes data for a variety of purposes including take-up of Covid-19 vaccines and managing the post-pandemic bounce back in elective care (surgery or treatment booked in advance). But the prospect of it setting up an overarching data platform for NHS England has alarmed Foxglove, a UK legal campaign group that focuses on accountability in the technology industry. Foxglove’s concerns, and those of similar organisations, centre on two aspects: the safety of patient data, and the nature of the company that will set up the data framework and seek to exploit it. “A firm like that has no place being the ‘operating system for the NHS’ – period,” says Cori Crider, a director at Foxglove, who adds that the company “makes no secret of its desire to keep profiting from war and surveillance”. Crider adds that there is not enough public information about the FDP, although documents have been circulated among would-be bidders. According to the documents, the main five-year contract for FDP is worth £360m and the platform will deliver £3.6bn in benefits over 10 years. “We’ve got deeper concerns about this Federated Data Platform,” says Crider. “How much confidential patient data is going to be swept in, who is going to have access, and on what terms? It’s clearly not being built just for your GP – it will serve a host of other government officials. We’ve sent a legal letter seeking answers, and received almost no detail in return.” Phil Booth, founder of medConfidential, which campaigns for confidentiality in healthcare, says Palantir is the favourite for the contract because it already carries out some of the work envisioned in the FDP. “Palantir is already doing many of the things which are going to be done by the platform. To move away from something that is already deeply embedded into NHS England’s systems would be a significant shift.” He adds that it is “crazy” to amalgamate such a wide variety of NHS functions into a single monolithic system. “NHS England proposes swapping out all of the complex data flows across a whole host of life-critical systems just by buying one company’s product off the shelf. This single platform, the idea of one thing to rule them all, is odd. You cannot just slap in all the data and expect the entire ecosystem’s architectures to align and integrate.” Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Thiel, 54, a co-founder of PayPal and early investor in Facebook. Some initial funding came from In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency – the US foreign intelligence service – reflecting the company’s origins as a tool to combat terrorism. Palantir’s software programs process huge amounts of data, enabling clients to identify previously undetectable patterns and connections or, as the company puts it, convert “massive amounts of information into knowledge that reflects their world”. It is deeply embedded in the US public sector. Other US government clients include the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, the US financial watchdog and the Department for Health and Human Services. It also has a contract with the US army to modernise its battlefield intelligence system and is reportedly working with the Pentagon on Project Maven, its artificial intelligence programme. It helps several western governments combat terrorism and governments account for more than half of its revenue, with clients including the UK Ministry of Defence. Despite surging revenues – up 41% to $1.5bn last year – it has posted annual net losses of $520m, $1.2bn and $580m since 2019. Its most controversial contracts in recent years have been with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE). It works with an ICE subdivision called Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). HSI tackles drug smuggling, money laundering and human trafficking, among other forms of criminal activity that might break US immigration and customs laws. Palantir says it has never had a contract with the ICE unit responsible for deportations, Enforcement and Removal Operations or ERO. But a US immigrant rights group, Mijente, says its technology played a role in raids on food-processing plants in Mississippi in 2019 in which 680 undocumented immigrants – described as “removable aliens” in the official press release – were arrested. Thiel, 54, is a libertarian billionaire who has used his fortune to support rightwing candidates in the US, including Trump’s successful bid for the presidency in 2016. His other Republican endorsements include Hillbilly Elegy author JD Vance, who is running for the Senate in Ohio, and Blake Masters, a senatorial midterm candidate for Arizona who warns of “widespread wokeness” on his website. Speaking at a bitcoin conference in April, Thiel described ESG – which stands for environmental, social and corporate governance and is a cornerstone of responsible investing principles – as a “virtue signalling, hate factory term” while describing cryptocurrency’s supporters as a “revolutionary youth movement”. Palantir’s co-founder and chief executive, Alex Karp, 54 is a Joe Biden supporter who told the New York Times in 2020 that his leftwing upbringing and dual heritage – of a Jewish father and African American mother – would make him a natural target in the wake of a far-right powergrab. “Who’s the first person who is going to get hung? You make a list, and I will show you who they get first. It’s me. There’s not a box I don’t check.” However, Palantir’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2020 was accompanied by a letter from Karp that slammed the Silicon Valley community. Around the same time Palantir announced it was moving its headquarters from California to Denver, Colorado. “Our company was founded in Silicon Valley. But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector’s values and commitments,” Karp wrote. “Our software is used to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe … We have chosen sides, and we know that our partners value our commitment.” The head of Palantir’s London office is Louis Mosley, grandson of Oswald Mosley and nephew of the late former president of Formula One’s governing body, Max Mosley, who became a privacy campaigner later in life. Speaking to the Sunday Times in 2020, Louis Mosley said Palantir’s origins were as a defender of personal privacy. “Palantir was actually started to guard against government overreach into personal privacy. Much of the software we’ve built is to prove those kinds of protections.” Palantir describes itself as a software company that does not mine or sell customer data. Indeed, the bidder documents for the FDP state it is a platform that will be “owned and controlled by the NHS”. An NHS spokesperson said: “Safe and secure use of patient data allows the NHS to build services that are more responsive to patients, and this software we are seeking to use for the FDP will put the NHS in control of its data and ensure that sensitive patient information is kept in a secure environment that meets the highest national standards.” The spokesperson added that the NHS would run a “fair and open” procurement process for the platform. But MedConfidential’s Booth says Palantir’s work outside the UK should give the NHS pause when it considers awarding the contract, due to start in November. “Is this really a company we want to have at the heart of our NHS? You cannot divorce a piece of software from the company that makes it.”",NHS; Peter Thiel; Software; Business; Technology; Computing; UK news; US news,Society
2020-11-19T00:01:57Z,Megaprojects risk pushing forests past tipping point – report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/19/megaprojects-risk-pushing-forests-past-tipping-point-report,"Infrastructure megaprojects risk pushing the world’s remaining forests past a “dangerous tipping point” and making climate targets unachievable, a report says. Tens of thousands of miles of roads and railways are planned alongside mines and dams, opening up the forests of South America, south-east Asia and central Africa to destruction, according to the report by a coalition of 25 research and conservation organisations called the New York Declaration on Forests Assessment Partners. Today, almost half of all large mines – more than 1,500 – are in forests. In 2014, 50 countries and 50 of the world’s biggest companies backed the declaration, pledging to cut deforestation by 50% by 2020 and end the destruction of forests by 2030. But the 2020 goal has been missed and deforestation is rising. The report found that many countries and businesses had introduced regulations and plans but implementation remained poor. Only 10% of 225 companies that mine in forests responded to the report’s authors’ request for information about their biodiversity commitments. “Forests are at a dangerous tipping point and these large-scale projects could push us over the edge,” said Erin Matson, a senior consultant at Climate Focus and co-author of the report. “There’s a very small – and closing – window of opportunity now to rethink these projects. Governments, companies and investors need to step up and act quickly to avoid further harm to people, wildlife, and nature.” Franziska Haupt, the lead author of the report and also at Climate Focus, said: “Forests are absolutely essential. If we don’t stop deforestation, we won’t meet our climate targets. Infrastructure and mining are probably the biggest threat to forests, maybe even more important than farming, because they really open up forests for these other drivers and create access for global markets to these remote areas.” Robert Nasi, the head of the Center for International Forestry Research (Cifor), one of the NYDF assessment partners, said: “We are living in a dream world of pledges but a reality of little progress, lack of transparency, vested interests and short termism. Alas, reality will always catch us up.” Aidan Davy, at the International Council on Mining and Metals, which has 27 mining company members, said: “We need mining companies across the industry to commit to higher standards of performance on biodiversity, and other environmental, social and governance areas which is the purpose of ICMM’s mining principles.” The ICCM also called on governments to ban mines in forest areas of greatest conservation value and enforce stronger protective measures. The report by the NYDF assessment partners, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Chatham House, and the World Wildlife Fund, found that megaprojects involving transport corridors were planned or under development in most of the critical tropical forest regions. “Even just planned projects already create an incentive for land speculators,” Haupt said. The governments of five Amazon countries are investing $27bn (£20bn) over the next five years to build or upgrade more than 7,500 miles (12,000km) of roads, the report says, which would lead to deforestation of about 2.4m hectares. In Indonesia, the 2,500-mile Trans-Papua highway will cut through Lorentz National Park, increasing access to more than 50,000 hectares of mining concessions inside the park, while a railway planned for Kalimantan would open areas for coalmining and palm oil production. In Papua New Guinea, two plans would double the length of the country’s road network by late 2022, the report says. An infrastructure boom in sub-Saharan Africa involves dozens of international development corridors to export minerals and energy, the report says. The corridors would cut across 400 protected areas and degrade an additional 1,800. “People need improved access, but these are not highways designed to prioritise linking communities to health care or economic opportunities,” said Anthony Bebbington, a mining and expert and report author. “Their purpose is to make it easier and cheaper to extract natural capital in ways that benefit economic elites above all.” The report said some governments had improved regulations, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo reforming land planning and Indonesia setting ambitious goals, though the latter have since been weakened. Brazil’s government has opened indigenous territories to mining and the Trump administration in the US has ended the requirement of federal agencies to consider the indirect environmental impacts of new infrastructure. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an NYDF assessment partner, invited 225 mining companies to report on their biodiversity efforts. Of the 23 that replied, and a further 22 that were analysed, few shared specific targets for action, said Morgan Gillespy, the global director of forests at CDP. The report sets out steps to deliver forest protection. “We can do things differently,” Haupt said. “What we’re talking about is not pie in the sky.” One step is ensuring the benefits of forests are included when assessing megaprojects. Matson said: “If the true value of forests was factored in – reducing climate change, protecting animal habitats and reducing the spread of zoonotic diseases [like the coronavirus], keeping water sources clean and a long list of other benefits without a price tag – then many of these projects would never get the green light,.” Another step is considering alternative ways to develop poorer areas. Anne Larson, a team leader at Cifor, said: “There is still a fundamental disconnect between what governments and companies think development has to look like and the kind of actions needed for healthy livelihoods and a healthy planet. “Securing rights and supporting sustainable livelihoods of indigenous people and other local communities would go a long way toward reducing deforestation.”",Trees and forests; Climate crisis; Mining; Deforestation; Conservation; Environment; Amazon rainforest; Business; Fossil fuels; Coal; Mining; Infrastructure; Energy,Environment
2021-11-30T11:40:49Z,‘How dictatorship works’: Hungarian academic quits in censorship row,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/30/hungarian-academic-andrea-peto-quits-in-censorship-row,"A prominent academic has resigned from a Hungarian higher education body, alleging censorship and accusing the top European standards organisation of turning a blind eye to waning academic freedom in central Europe. Andrea Pető, a professor at the Central European University in Vienna, said she had resigned from the Hungarian Accreditation Committee’s humanities subcommittee last week after she was asked to change part of an article she wrote that was due to be published in an academic journal. Academic freedom in Hungary has been under pressure since Viktor Orbán returned to power in 2010. Under the prime minister’s self-proclaimed “illiberal democracy”, the ruling Fidesz party has sought to take control of courts and public institutions, while shrinking the space for independent media and NGOs. The Central European University was forced to leave Budapest for Vienna in 2018, and observers have voiced concern about a tax on institutions helping refugee students and researchers. Pető said the director of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee (MAB), Prof Valeria Csépe, asked her to withdraw a statement in the draft article that criticised the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA) for failing to confront a slide to illiberalism in educational policy in Hungary and Poland. MAB is a member of ENQA, a Brussels-based body that promotes quality standards in higher education across Europe, the Balkans and Central Asia. “You can feel how dictatorship works,” the historian and specialist in gender studies said in her first interview with international media since her resignation. “Because this is not the state, this is not Prime Minister Orbán who is giving orders. Those who make this system work are the kind of ordinary people who are running those institutions. The whole story looks as it had happened in communist Hungary well before 1989.” Pető said the request to withdraw her criticism of ENQA was “unacceptable … against my values, against my professional conviction, against everything I have been working for in the last 30 years. “The president of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee wanted me to change what I think about the European accreditation process, namely that the ENQA is unprepared for the illiberal attack, as they are just accepting at face value what is reported to them as the truth.” She accused ENQA of staying silent while academic freedom was under pressure in Hungary, citing the examples of the Hungarian government’s decision to close gender studies programmes and policies that pushed her university to leave Budapest for Vienna – the first time in decades a university has been forced out of a European country. The professor said “the European infrastructure” was so focused on box-ticking requirements it was failing to recognise a paradigm shift in higher education in central Europe. MAB joined the pan-European ENQA in 2002 and had its membership reconfirmed in September 2018 under a regular five-year review. Her resignation came after what she described as “a very stormy discussion” on academic responsibility inside MAB’s humanities subcommittee over a government plan to cut teacher training by one year, which she opposes. The professor hopes other academics will also resign, as she believes the episode illustrates a wider problem. In the article, which was published unchanged last week, she argued an illiberal turn in higher education policy was leading to self censorship among Hungarian academics. MAB declined to comment publicly. Senior sources, however, do not dispute that the director requested a change to Pető’s article, but characterise the change as a technical correction relating to MAB’s relationship with ENQA. In a statement, ENQA said the purpose of its agency reviews was to assess “compliance with external quality assurance activities relating to learning and teaching in higher education”. It added that academic freedom “is not specifically covered” by those standards and the review process, but is covered by other aspects of the Bologna process, a reference to a wider policy of cooperation in European higher education spanning 48 countries. “The ENQA review process assesses the agency itself (its policies and practices) and not the education system of the country in which it operates,” the agency added. ENQA also said it had full confidence in the independent experts, who receive training, to carry out reviews. “Since the review in 2018, ENQA remains satisfied that [MAB] continues to meet the standards of the ESG,” a reference to its standards and guidelines on quality assurance.",Hungary; Europe; World news; Viktor Orbán; Poland; Higher education; Education; Censorship; Human rights; Law,World news
2021-12-07T18:49:40Z,SSE may not need to split now but it does need more clean energy expertise,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/07/sse-may-not-need-to-split-now-but-it-does-need-more-clean-energy-expertise,"Elliott Management’s open letters are improving. When the US activist hedge fund tried to take a pop at GlaxoSmithKline in the summer, it produced 17 pages of waffle that could have been condensed to a few sentences of substance. Tuesday’s 10-page blast at energy group SSE was tighter, scored a couple of solid hits and should make the newish chairman, Sir John Manzoni, realise the Perth-based firm is in a scrap. That is not to say Elliott is right on every score, or even on its main demand that SSE should be split in two. Indeed, one of the activist’s points was plainly exaggerated – the idea that an “unequivocal message” was sent by the 4% fall in SSE’s share price on the day last month when the company unveiled its energy transition strategy alongside a delayed dividend cut. Come on, the signal in the share price – now down just 1.8% – simply isn’t clear. Rather than being “thoroughly frustrated”, as Elliott claims, SSE’s investors merely seem uninspired. That, though, is hardly a triumph for a £17bn FTSE 100 company at the moment of its great strategic reset. Manzoni could start by addressing Elliott’s legitimate criticism that SSE didn’t show its arithmetic when it refused to split its renewables assets from its electricity transmission and distribution networks on grounds of cost. The financial detail was indeed missing. What are the £200m worth of separation costs and £95m of “quantifiable dis-synergies”? Both figures need explaining. The heart of SSE’s “better together” defence, though, was weightier: it was the argument that it’s cheaper to finance the construction of more renewables assets, primarily offshore windfarms, when the division is housed under the same roof as a networks and distribution division that throws off cash reliably. SSE’s argument feels intuitively correct since size and diversity of income tend to deliver lower funding costs over time. But it is not one that is universally accepted – three big continental European energy firms are contemplating doing the splits – so, again, the evidence needs to be displayed. In its absence, Elliott’s refrain that a standalone renewables division would be inundated with offers of cheap capital from ESG-friendly investors will sound beguiling. The hedge fund may be guilty of wishful thinking (Danish pin-up Orsted’s share price is down 35% this year, note) but SSE needs to slam its points home, which means showing you’ve engaged with the nitty-gritty. Then there’s the make-up of SSE’s board, which is where Elliott’s case is strongest. Look down the list of non-executive directors and it’s not obvious who the renewable specialists are supposed to be. There is big-project expertise aplenty from directors whose executive lives were spent at the likes of BP, Eon and National Grid, but out-and-out renewables experience is thin. That is a problem when you’re trying to bill yourself as the UK’s “clean energy champion”. The smart move by Manzoni would be to grant Elliott’s wish for two new non-executives. It might even take some heat off the chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, who, after eight years in post, probably isn’t planning to stay forever anyway. In the end, SSE should win this tussle. It was supremely well-connected in Westminster and Edinburgh even before Manzoni, a former permanent secretary of the Cabinet Office, arrived. It is not going to be bullied easily by an activist that, for all its noise and reputation, owns less than 5% of the share capital. But a point-by-point response to Elliott is required. The activist may be wrong about the immediate need for a split, but SSE needs to be seen to win its case convincingly. The company is planning to spend £12.5bn over five years on critical infrastructure. Non-Elliott investors need to be fully signed up. The long-term Train of thought It wasn’t a mea culpa from Nick Train of Lindsell Train, one of the very few fund managers who still enjoys (deservedly) star status among retail investors. Rather, it was an admission that current stock markets are tough. His funds are experiencing “arguably the worst period of relative investment performance in our 20-year history”. An underweight position in technology stocks – the likes of Tesla – is one main explanation, plus an absence of cyclical manufacturing stocks that have enjoyed the Covid recovery. Train promises to stick to his tried-and-tested long-term approach, which is exactly what his investors will want to hear. But the markets do increasingly feel erratic. The FTSE 100 index, up 100 points on Tuesday, seems to have decided that the Omicron variant is not much to worry about. A tad premature, surely.",SSE; Corporate governance; Energy industry; Utilities; Business; Renewable energy; Energy; Environment; Investing; Stock markets,Business
2020-10-28T07:30:36Z,The world's banks must start to value nature and stop paying for its destruction,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2020/oct/28/the-worlds-banks-must-start-to-value-nature-and-stop-paying-for-its-destruction-aoe,"The scientific community has long been unequivocal about biodiversity destruction. Last month, the UN reported that the world had failed to meet fully any of the 2020 Aichi bioiversity targets that countries agreed with fanfare in 2010, even as it found that biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, and the pressures driving this decline are intensifying. This week’s Bankrolling Extinction report finds that financial institutions provide the capital that is funding over-exploitation of our lands and seas, putting biodiversity in freefall. Last year, the world’s 50 biggest banks provided $2.6tn (£1.9tn) in loans and other credit to sectors with a high impact on biodiversity, such as forestry and agriculture. Bank by bank, the report authors found a cavalier ignorance of – or indifference to – the implications, with the vast majority unaware of their impact on biodiversity. In short, this report is a frightening statement of the status quo. Fortunately, signs are emerging that some governments are – slowly – taking aim at financial backers of the destruction of the natural world. They must now push more forcefully. In the wake of Covid-19, treasury cupboards may be bare, but with new policies and limited recovery funds, they can steer trillions of dollars of private capital towards a nature-positive response to coronavirus, to spur growth, prosperity and resilience without returning to business as usual over-consumption and climate and biodiversity risk. Voices from economics and finance are starting to add impetus and rationale for such momentum. One of the world’s foremost business groups, the World Economic Forum (WEF), has recognised the economic importance of nature. In its annual Global Risks Report, published earlier this year, WEF found that for the first time environmental risks dominated perceived business threats. Biodiversity loss was considered among the five most impactful and most likely risks in the next decade, with concerns ranging from the potential collapse of food and health systems to the disruption of entire supply chains. And Cambridge University professor of economics Partha Dasgupta will describe in a forthcoming report how we are running down our precious natural capital because we have omitted to value nature. Dasgupta has said that the “asset management problem” resulting from this economic oversight requires us to become far more efficient about how we use our planet’s precious natural resources. Smart financial institutions are aware that biodiversity regulation is coming. The first recommendation of the Bankrolling Extinction report is, quite rightly, for banks “to disclose and radically reduce their impact on nature and stop finance for new fossil fuels, deforestation, overfishing and ecosystem destruction”. I see three critical actions governments can take. First, they should set an example in biodiversity-positive finance, by diverting harmful agricultural subsidies to promote a shift to less damaging activities. Agriculture is the leading cause of biodiversity loss today. The Paulson Institute recently estimated that, at $450bn annually, the value of agricultural subsidies harmful to biodiversity exceeds the cost of paying farmers to use nature-friendly practices. In other words, diverting harmful subsidies to pay farmers to protect biodiversity can lead to a net saving. In this case, Britain could be a leading light, if it can get right its planned overhaul of agricultural subsidies post-Brexit, replacing crop-based payments with environmental payments. Last week, the EU also recognised that we need to make farming more environmentally friendly. Second, governments should direct their development banks to use their cash and convening power to become global role models for reporting and reducing their impacts on biodiversity. There are 450 development finance institutions (DFIs) worldwide, which invest $2tn annually. Many have just one shareholder, their national government, and as such they can be a powerful financial lever of political goals, including to conserve and restore biodiversity. DFIs could become world leaders by showing commercial banks that the data and methods to allow them to measure and reduce their impact on biodiversity already exist. It would be wonderful if they could announce such an initiative at the first-ever global meeting of all 450 DFIs, at the Finance in Common Summit in November. And third, financial regulators and central banks could make such biodiversity risk reporting a condition of licensing of financial institutions. The Dutch Central Bank has already taken a first step, in its recent report, Indebted to Nature. Having identified biodiversity-related risks exceeding €800bn (£725bn) at Dutch financial institutions, the bank concluded that financial institutions should spell out the risks they face from loss of biodiversity. Once they report their impacts on biodiversity, financial institutions will have to reduce them, under pressure from stakeholders including citizens and financial regulators, and they will pass this pressure on to the companies they invest in. We saw a glimpse of this in action, when the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, this month joined a shareholder revolt, demanding that the world’s biggest consumer group, Procter &amp; Gamble, specifically measures and reports the impact the company has on forests. At a time of regulatory change, doing the minimum is a dangerous strategy. In the case of biodiversity, the minimum bar is likely to move constantly upwards for the foreseeable future. By going beyond, investors can seize the opportunity, rather than focusing on solely avoiding risk. Funds specialising in environmental social and governance priorities highlight this opportunity. Such funds are now worth more than $1tn, and could exceed the value of conventional funds by 2025 in Europe, according to a new PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis. By paving the way for private capital in this way, governments can set new biodiversity goals for 2030 at the UN’s conference on biodiversity in Kunming next May with the confidence that they will not again be shamefully missed. • Sir Robert Watson is the former chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)",Environment; Global economy; Economics; Biodiversity; Conservation; Wildlife; Banking,Environment
2022-01-30T08:05:15Z,‘Woke’ capitalism is the new villain of the right. It’s also the only way forward | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/woke-capitalism-new-villain-of-the-right-only-way-forward,"British capitalism is in trouble. The UK stock market, populated by too many legacy companies with scarcely a major hi-tech company in sight, has been the worst performing among advanced countries since 2000. Brexit has deepened the crisis. Our companies, vulnerably cheap by international standards, have become easy prey for takeover merchants from all over the globe who are rarely benign stewards. Too few great new companies are coming through to take their place. Yet, by the criteria of the political right, the UK should be a capitalist beacon. Regulation in Britain – from the world of work to product standards – is light, applied weakly and is too often close to non-existent. Companies and capital are taxed modestly by international standards. But, stubbornly, the growth rate shrinks as investment and productivity stagnate. Could it be, pray, that the dominant rightwing intellectual paradigm is wrong? Endlessly inventive, the right has found a convenient new villain to blame – “woke” or “stakeholder” capitalism. It may be that the woeful economic trends are longstanding and deep-seated, but don’t let that get in the way of a good new culture war. Last week, the Adam Smith Institute crystallised the complaint in a paper, Capitalism After Covid, which added stakeholder capitalism to the state as culprits in chief. Governments, intoned author Matthew Lesh, have failed in their pandemic response while the private sector has done brilliantly. This “state failure” removes the case for more government involvement in the economy, post-Covid. Instead, capitalism must be given its head, but not a woke capitalism that “stabs itself in the face” by wanting to address “racial justice or environmental protection”. Capitalism must ruthlessly put profit and shareholders first, which is its sacred duty, not sacrifice profit to appease stakeholders in the trivial search for good headlines – the road to perdition. Too many companies are following woke Unilever and sacrificing profit and performance for lofty talk of pursuing sustainability and social purpose, personified, said a leading critical investor, Terry Smith, by trying to argue that the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise was to further healthy eating. Lesh won kind headlines in the Mail. But his thinking is fossilised in the 1980s and singularly fails to address today’s facts and arguments. Has state failure been so complete? Opinion in 27 countries has become more trusting of state competence in handling the pandemic, according to Cambridge’s Centre for the Future of Democracy. In pandemics, you need collective action and state leadership. Yes, there have been weaknesses – but offset by astonishing successes. In Britain, for example, the speed at developing and rolling out vaccines was because of smart collaboration between clever public procurement, universities, notably Oxford, the NHS and purpose-driven companies such as AstraZeneca. Equally, economics is wrestling with the gaping shortcomings of the simple free market views that Lesh champions. Not least, as the 2021 winter edition of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy asks: “Capitalism – what has gone wrong, what needs to change and how can it be fixed?” Radical uncertainty besets economic decision-making; we need better designed institutions to win the gains from cooperation and individuals are much more complicated than economic automata responding to price signals. Economic models that ignore all this (such as Lesh’s) argue successive contributors, lead to a degraded capitalism, stagnating living standards and rising populism in response. Witness Britain in 2022. Companies shape and are shaped by the society of which they are part and this includes the evolving preferences of shareholders. The Investment Association annual 2021 review reports that 49% of the £9.4tn of investment funds under UK management are pledged to promote the environment, social cohesion and good governance (ESG in the jargon), reflecting the wishes of their millions of savers. Founded in the 1880s, Unilever’s purpose was “to make cleanliness commonplace and lessen the load for women”. Today’s investors want it to continue with an updated purpose – making “sustainable living commonplace”, the principle reason it is a great company. Unilever, and the growing number of companies like it, are only responding to their shareholders’ priorities. McKinsey Global Institute declares that stakeholder capitalism, in which companies carefully manage the trade-offs between their varying stakeholders, is the key to long-term value creation. It is the future of business. This is not a sacrifice of profit in woke appeasement of useless consumers, employees and wider societal pressures, as Lesh characterises it. Stakeholder capitalism is a recognition that any company is a social organisation that needs engaged workforces, loyal customers, supportive shareholders and strong brands, all of whose claims have to be managed, alongside financial priorities. Mock the idea that Hellmann’s mayonnaise has a purpose, but consumers care about the health of what they eat and will do more in future. Purposed brands, as Unilever’s own data shows, outperform their non-purposed rivals. And that means profit. Are companies good enough at explaining these realities and trade-offs, at explaining why they consider what they are doing is so material to their long-term profitability and why they feel compelled not to ignore climate change or Black Lives Matter? Lesh attacks the entire framework without recognising the huge current debates about how stakeholder companies and their investors can do better. Companies are asking how they can better explain to their shareholders their best guess of future trends and explain why engaging workforces and customers is so worthwhile. Investors are becoming better at calling out greenwashing and soft corporate baloney. It’s called “materiality”, to borrow the buzzword of the hour – think relevance, significance. Ignore these material pressures beyond immediate financial demands and companies get into profound trouble. British capitalism suffers from a long history of making easy money through being the first to industrialise and possessing a global empire. As a result, the culture of innovative risk-taking and the institutions to support it, along with a sophisticated conception of the company, are cruelly under-developed, as Adam Smith would have been the first to recognise. The value of the institute that proselytises in his name is that it is a useful fool, setting out so revealingly why its 1980s thinking is so wrong. And why so many in business, investment and academia are right to figure out new ways to reset capitalism and better capture its undoubted dynamism to serve the common good. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Business; UK news; Unilever; Investing,Opinion
2019-10-23T23:22:31Z,New guidelines force pension funds to reveal shareholder voting records,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/24/new-guidelines-force-pension-funds-to-reveal-shareholder-voting-records,"Pension funds and asset managers will have to disclose their shareholder voting records on issues including the climate crisis, as part of UK guidelines that will come into force in January. The revamped stewardship code means firms will have to publish annual reports showing they have taken environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account when investing and engaging with companies. Signatories will have to prove they took appropriate action in the preceding 12 months by publishing their full shareholder voting records. They will also have to explain the rationale behind their voting decisions and outline how they are responding to systemic risks such as the climate emergency. Those who fail to comply risk being shamed by ejection from the public list of signatories to the code. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the accounting watchdog that has been in charge of managing the code since its launch in 2010, has also expanded the scope of the guidelines beyond asset managers to include pension funds, insurers, investment consultants and proxy advisers. The FRC said it would help “align the approach of the whole investment community”. The move will also expand its 289-strong list of signatories – although new firms will have to formally apply to be included from its launch. The FRC chair, Simon Dingemans, said: “It is an ambitious revision that strengthens the UK’s standards of governance, transparency and clear reporting. We are looking for widespread adoption by the investment community, reinforcing the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business and delivering real benefits to the economy, the environment and society more broadly.” The first set of annual reports will cover signatories’ actions in 2020, with the first disclosures due in 2021. It marks the first major overhaul of the stewardship code since 2012 and comes just months after the influential Business Roundtable in the US made waves across the investment community by dropping its long-held shareholder-first policy. Asset managers have recently come under scrutiny for continuing to invest in carbon-heavy industries as climate worries grow. It has led fund management firms including Legal &amp; General Investment Management to start divesting from companies such as oil giant ExxonMobil that have dragged their feet and failed to adapt their business models. The Investment Association, which represents City firms with £7.7tn in assets under management, welcomed the revised code and said it set an “ambitious standard” for UK firms. Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said the overhaul was a positive step, but that the government should give the new accounting regulator – meant to replace the FRC – full legal powers. “The government needs to play its part too and, at the very least, bring forward the legislation to put the FRC’s replacement on a statutory footing, so that the regulator has the tools it needs to hold auditors, investors and directors to account.”",Pensions industry; Business; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news,Business
2019-09-17T13:00:28Z,Wall Street investment giants voting against key climate resolutions,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/wall-street-asset-management-climate-change-blackrock-vanguard,"Some of Wall Street’s largest asset management companies are failing to live up to commitments to use their voting power to fight the climate crisis, according to a new report. The report, published on Tuesday by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project, claims that BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $6tn under management, and Vanguard, with assets of $5.2tn, have voted overwhelmingly against the key climate resolutions at energy companies, including a resolution at ExxonMobil’s annual shareholder meeting, and at Duke Energy. Had BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&amp;P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claims. Refusing to use their proxy votes to support shareholders’ resolutions means letting companies off the hook – even as the climate crisis threatens their investors, their business models and the planet, the group says. “The climate crisis is well upon us, and leading investors are stepping up to press fossil-fuel-dependent companies to align their strategies to the goals of the Paris agreement but some of the largest US investment companies are severely lagging,” said Majority Action’s Eli Kasargod-Staub. “Blackrock and Vanguard have been using their shareholder voting power to undermine, rather than support, investor action on climate, including opposing every one of the resolutions proposed by the $34tn Climate Action 100+ coalition, calling for significant board room reform in response to its failure to act on climate change,” Kasargod-Staub added. Blackrock published a report in April on climate-related risk stating: “Climate change is a risk investors can’t ignore.” Vanguard publishes an annual “investment stewardship” report outlining its commitment to sustainable investing. Majority Action, which delivered a petition of 129,000 petition signatures to Blackrock in April, claims it ranks at the bottom of the list of fund managers using their voting powers to force companies to act responsibly on climate. “We have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,” Blackrock said in a statement to the Guardian. “We support shareholder proposals that we believe will enhance the value of our clients’ investments. But not all shareholder proposals are created equal, and it would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal’s impact.” While funds like Blackrock and Vanguard may not be using their proxy power to force change, there is evidence that some of their funds are moving toward investing under environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Blackrock has launched an array of sustainable equity exchange-traded funds, and it offers clients direction to build portfolios focused on companies that are likely to offer returns on clean-energy investments. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi’s $800bn sovereign-wealth fund recently added a new criterion to its investment process: how will the Earth’s changing climate affect a potential asset’s price? According to the data provider EPFR Global, the total value of funds that have integrated ESG factors into their investment process has more than quadrupled since 2014, rising to $485bn as of April. Funds that may not be explicitly listed as ESG are also investing with the climate in mind. Blackrock holds that its 45-member environmental stewardship team engaged 250 companies last year on the subject of climate change. It says singling out the use of proxy votes is misleading because it ignores the totality of Blackrock’s engagement on the issue. In its 2018 stewardship report, the company said its discussion with clients addressed the robustness of board oversight, ESG disclosure frameworks, climate risk management, environmental impact management and sustainability around waste, water, energy efficiency, packaging and product life-cycle management. Nicholas Eisenberger at the advisory firm Pure Energy Partners said he was encouraged by the growing awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis in the business sector. “Large asset managers are just at the beginning of taking the urgent actions required to more aggressively confront the threat of climate change,” he said, describing them as battleships at the start of an emergency corrective turn. “We seen a fundamental shift in the last two years in the understanding of the dangers climate change presents but the steps we’ve taken are nowhere near adequate to the task yet.”",Climate crisis; Business; Environment,Environment

2020-02-12T07:00:26Z,The real problem with your Netflix addiction? The carbon emissions | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/real-problem-netflix-addiction-arbon-emissions,"Binge-watching Netflix doesn’t just fry your brain; it may also be frying the planet. The streaming service’s global energy consumption increased by 84% in 2019 to a total of 451,000 megawatt hours – enough to power 40,000 average US homes for a year. Netflix disclosed these figures in its inaugural environmental, social and governance report, noting it matched 100% of its 2019 non-renewable power use “with renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets”. While these may help the brand, they don’t address the inconvenient fact that our love of streaming has unfortunate side-effects – most of which we are only starting to comprehend. Digital technology has ushered in an age of inconspicuous consumption. It is easy to understand the environmental impact of buying “stuff” or flying across the Atlantic. It is harder to wrap your head around how much energy it takes to fly data across the web. We may feel that we are consuming less thanks to the internet, but digital technologies account for more carbon emissions than the aerospace industry, according to a study by the Shift Project, a Paris-based thinktank. Transmitting and viewing online video accounts for a large portion for this, generating nearly 1% of global emissions. Similarly, a study from the universities of Glasgow and Oslo found that streaming music has led to “significantly higher carbon emissions than at any previous point in the history of music”. Being a conscientious consumer does not mean you have to turn off your wifi or chill with the Netflix. But we should think more critically about our data consumption. Apple already delivers screen-time reports; perhaps tech services should start providing us with carbon counts. Or maybe Netflix should implement carbon warnings. Caution: this program contains nudity, graphic language and a hell of a lot of energy. •Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",Music streaming; Music; Netflix; Media; Climate science; Science; Climate crisis; Environment; TV streaming,Opinion
2021-12-26T07:06:15Z,The best songs of 2021 … that you haven’t heard,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/26/the-best-songs-of-2021-that-you-havent-heard,"Leslie Winer – Hold On Postcards Leslie Winer’s mesmerising face – strong jaw, stern lips, graceful cheekbones – made her a muse to Jean-Paul Gaultier, a star of Dior and Valentino ads and a cover girl for Vogue, though girlish she wasn’t: her tough androgyny and power dressing was the perfect expression of an uncaring yet increasingly permissive 1980s. “I was a reluctant model for five junkie years,” she later said, “I’m also a former nasty alcoholic and former Tampax user, each for more than five years and with considerably more enthusiasm.” That career discarded, her next act was astonishing: music that delved into industrial, dub and – influentially – trip-hop, Winer issuing drawled monologues over the top with Gobi-arid humour. Her work was reissued this year by Light in the Attic on the compilation When I Hit You – You’ll Feel It. Hold On Postcards is its sole unreleased track but maybe its very best. Slurring as if after a boozy nap on a sunbed, her vocal as fried as a bit of fritto misto, Winer slowly recites banal postcard observations from Europe: “Lovely weather, we go to the beach, I’ve been playing boules,” this last revelation with a funny note of astonishment as she stirs briefly out of total indolence. Slipping sunburned and omnipotent from Ajaccio to Nice to Guernsey and beyond, she conjures the listlessness of holidays, and of the wealthy, with a supernatural accuracy. With its piano motifs and sing-song backing vocals, there’s something lulling about this song, and yet a mistral of disquiet feels like it’s about to blow in. “Thinking of you all the time,” she admits amid aloof statements about how many new friends she’s making. Tellingly, her holiday ends – or at least her postcards do – at somewhere called the Hotel Nadir. Ben Beaumont-Thomas PE – The Reason for My Love One of the most unfairly overlooked songs of 2021 could just as easily have come out during the sooty New York summer of 1981. The Reason for My Love, by the young Brooklyn quintet PE, channels the fidgety, dark, and inescapably danceable sound of Mudd Club-era, underground bands like Bush Tetras, the Contortions and ESG. From the fractured, no-wave sax to its briskly undulating bass line to the haunted vocal of Veronica Torres, every sound in the song confronts and thrills. Like some avant-garde ear worm, the falling-apart sound in the song oddly coheres. More, it extends a mini-trend of young bands who have been refiguring New York’s aural history. Just as the debut album by the teenage Brooklyn group Geese recast the sound of local guitar bands like Television and the Feelies, PE’s song gives Manhattan’s underground club history its own dynamic twist. Jim Farber Doss – Look In less than three minutes and about five lines of lyrics, the mysterious New York/Baltimore producer (and sometime PC Music associate) Doss draws an addictive portrait of power, temptation and danger. “You see me on my own,” she chants, and depending on which way she limns the line, it’s either an invitation to approach or a warning to back away. She repeats her mantras of isolation – “not looking at my phone / Myself, on my own” – with the cadence of an expertly bounced basketball; around her, an intense bubblegum synth motif that contains strange echoes of Benny Benassi’s Satisfaction pings and bungees. It’s a tightly snatched, head-down burst that doubles as a defiant anthem for these past two lonely years. Laura Snapes Jenna Esposito – The Other Side of Forever It’s the heartbreak and hopefulness of a turbulent 2021 from the mind of a songwriter who knows them all too well. Ernie Rossi, owner of the century-old gift and music shop E Rossi and Company in New York City’s Little Italy, was sidelined by health problems after reopening following the long city-mandated shutdown. Margaret, his wife of 51 years, knew the neighborhood icon might not stay afloat if doors closed once again and solely took over duties with the couple’s best friend, Freddy. Then this past spring, both Margaret and Freddy caught and died of Covid-19. In the wake of their consecutive deaths, Rossi wrote The Other Side of Forever, a heartfelt tribute to the bond the trio shared and the immense loss he feels. Recorded by the New York indie artist Jenna Esposito, the earworm ballad with a momentous opening and climatic finale was produced in the Italian folk style the store was known for being a chief importer of nearly 100 years ago. And today, Rossi is continuing his fight to stay in business. Rob LeDonne DijahSB – New Harrison “I’m not sure what to do, at this point I didn’t plan to survive,” DijahSB matter of factly spits on New Harrison, a standout from their latest album Head Above the Waters. Be it such commendably frank rhymes (along with social media posts) about mental health, or being an out-and-proud non-binary artist in a genre once notorious for its heteronormativity, the rising Canadian MC certainly is a trailblazer. But aside from breaking such ground, DijahSB is also a student of the game. Rather than chase trap-rap trends, they choose instrumentals that are both breezy and fresh but also frequently steeped in rap’s soulful old-school grooves. The mellow, melancholy yet cheeky beat for New Harrison is a prime example of DijahSB’s past-meets-future motif. That, along with the MC’s penchant for on-point NBA-inspired punchlines throughout the song’s three-and-a-half-minute runtime, make DijahSB’s potential to be an all-star in their own right abundantly clear. Kyle Mullin Dylan Fraser – I’d Rather Be Here There’s something horribly, embarrassingly familiar about the predicament at the centre of 20-year-old Scottish singer Dylan Fraser’s hair-raising track I’d Rather Be Here, released to quiet acclaim this past autumn. The song, which starts with a whisper for attention and ends with a cry for help, is about a specifically awful place to be: in love with someone who is detrimental to your mental health (“the top of these buildings used to feel so tall but maybe that’s ‘cause you made me feel so small”). While many songwriters would use this as a jump-off to celebrate the empowerment that comes attached to then taking flight, Fraser instead focuses in on something far messier: staying there because being with someone harmful is better than being without them. It’s slickly produced but Fraser’s alternately sad and furious desperation is nothing but heartbreakingly genuine. Benjamin Lee",Music; Culture; Pop and rock; Indie; Rap,Music
2020-01-14T16:30:39Z,"Scott Morrison in danger of becoming a 'climate change casualty', says Steve Bracks",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/15/scott-morrison-in-danger-of-becoming-a-climate-change-casualty-says-steve-bracks,"Scott Morrison needs to take action on global heating or he will become a “climate change casualty”, a former Victorian Labor premier, Steve Bracks, said. Bracks, who is chair of the $55bn industry superannuation fund Cbus, said the fires that have raged Australia have galvanised community support for action and he called on the Morrison government to put a price on carbon. “It’s really in a sad position in Australia where we’re seeing effectively corporate Australia, industries, the financial sector and business who are leading on climate change and the government’s not,” he told Guardian Australia. The fires, which have burned more than 10m hectares, killed 28 people and covered Sydney and Melbourne with hazardous smoke, “made a world of difference” to public feeling about global heating. “People’s experiences are so important so I think there is a great appetite now for effective climate action in Australia, and even the prime minister I think is sort of starting to recognise that and move in that direction, and that’s a good thing,” he said. “If he doesn’t do that I think he’ll be another climate change casualty in Australia.” Bracks said Cbus had focused on environmental, social and governance issues for about 10 years under its chief executive, David Atkin, who announced his retirement on Wednesday. Under Atkin’s leadership, Cbus has grown from an organisation with about $12bn under management that was, he said, something of a cottage industry, to one of the nation’s biggest funds. Atkin, who will step down in six months after almost 13 years in the job, said the fires had changed public sentiment on the climate. “There’s nothing like seeing the physical consequences – you can see it in Melbourne, there’s smoke everywhere,” he said. Super funds had “a really important role to play” in combating global heating. “We’re looking for companies that we invest in who have thought carefully about this, have done their scenario testing, understand what their footprint is from a carbon perspective and are changing their business models to ensure that they can be successful in the future,” he said. “We will not support companies, as investors, if we think that they are being too short term or aren’t taking that issue seriously enough.” Cbus and other industry funds are always under pressure from activist organisations to dump their shares in fossil fuel companies and other big emitters. But Atkin said refusing to invest in an industry category was the wrong approach and Cbus looked to invest in companies with a strategy to decarbonise operations. “We are not investing in companies we don’t have confidence in all the time,” he said. “We do not have the dinosaurs in our portfolio because we’ve already made that call. We think they’re going to lose us money, not make us money.” Bracks said: “All the companies we invest in understand they have to have a long-term sustainable future and they have to assess the risk of climate change within that. “They know that there will be some stranded assets – particularly in energy generation – if we don’t get the right economic settings for investment in generation in the future, and so they’re really taking the lead and doing the work that the government should be doing.” As well as pushing corporate Australia to take environmental, social and governance issues more seriously, including by serving as a member of a string of investor groups, Atkin also piloted Cbus through two royal commissions. The trade union royal commission, set up by the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, after the 2013 election criticised Cbus and Atkin over the leak of personal information about fund members to the construction union – before itself giving confidential Cbus documents to other parties. But Cbus skated through 2018’s banking royal commission after counsel assisting, Michael Hodge, QC, decided not to call any witnesses from the fund. Instead Hodge and the commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, held hearings that demolished the reputations of the for-profit sector – an outcome that embarrassed the government, which had included superannuation in the inquiry’s terms of reference in a bid to embarrass industry funds over their links to the unions. “We were to be called and they did not call us in the end and they were quite satisfied with the procedures we had in place, and that’s a good thing,” Bracks said. “So we take that as a seal of approval, but more than that the royal commission as it turns out was a great boon for industry funds, and certainly in our fund we had something like $1bn of net inflows extra compared to the previous year over the period of the royal commission.”",Climate crisis; Superannuation; Scott Morrison; Australian politics; Environment; Business; Bushfires; Australia news; Natural disasters and extreme weather,Environment
2021-03-24T19:18:23Z,Top UK fund refuses to invest in Deliveroo amid City concern over riders' rights,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/24/top-uk-fund-refuses-to-invest-in-deliveroo-amid-concern-over-riders-rights,"One of the UK’s top fund managers is to boycott the stock market float of the meal delivery firm Deliveroo next month, amid growing disquiet in the City over the company’s treatment of delivery workers. Aviva Investors said on Wednesday it had turned down the chance to invest in Deliveroo’s £9bn initial public offering. Aberdeen Standard, another of the UK’s biggest investors, has also expressed concerns about Deliveroo’s employment practices, the Guardian understands. David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities at Aviva Investors, which is part of the UK’s largest insurance company, said there was a combination of investment risk and social issues that affected its decision on whether to buy shares or not. “If they are classed as riders they don’t necessarily get basic rights for minimum wage, sick leave or holidays, and [Deliveroo] states a reclassification of employees as an investment risk to the business,” Cumming told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. “We won’t be investing in Deliveroo for a number of reasons but that is one of them.” He added: “A lot of employers could make a massive difference to workers’ lives if they guaranteed working hours or a living wage, and how companies behave is becoming more important.” The IPO has provoked a sense of unease among some in the City. A portfolio manager at another large investor said Deliveroo’s treatment of workers would raise concerns, while others in the investment industry have questioned Deliveroo’s decision to list with two share classes, a move that will give co-founder Will Shu tighter control over the business for three years. Aberdeen Standard and Aviva Investors, which have £464bn and £365bn assets under management respectively, have recently taken more vocal approaches on ESG issues – investment industry shorthand for the environment, social and governance – and particularly on climate action. Tom Powdrill, head of stewardship at Pirc, a consultancy for pension funds, said gig economy companies were likely to face increasing scrutiny from investors over social issues because of the ESG “tidal wave”. The pandemic had further highlighted the problems of worker welfare, he added. “The nature of the employment relationship is absolutely essential now,” Powdrill said. “Everyone looking at a gig employer knows what the deal is. These companies have shifted risk and flexibility onto the employees. Nobody has any illusions on that.” Gig economy companies, including Uber and Deliveroo, are thought to have faced at least 40 major legal challenges around the world, as delivery drivers and riders try to improve their employment rights. Their workers have brought numerous cases as they try to secure basic employment rights, such as being paid the minimum wage or receiving holiday pay. Uber said earlier in March it would start to make these payments to its workers in the UK, after a supreme court ruling that confirmed worker status for its drivers. Alex Marshall, a former gig economy courier who is president of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), described Aviva’s action as “promising” and said Deliveroo workers were denied rights such as minimum wage protection. “Until riders are classified as workers and given basic rights, Deliveroo will continue to face protests and challenges from these key workers,” Marshall said. Documents released before the Deliveroo IPO revealed that the firm had set aside more than £112m to cover potential legal costs relating to the employment status of its delivery riders. Deliveroo expects the company to achieve a valuation of up to £8.8bn when it floats on 7 April – £1bn more than initially forecast, and putting it on track to be the biggest debut on the London Stock Exchange since Glencore listed almost a decade ago. A Deliveroo spokesperson said: “We are proud to provide work for 50,000 riders in the UK and that thousands more people apply to work with us every week. We are confident in our business model, which has been upheld by UK courts three times, including the high court twice. “Deliveroo riders are self-employed because this gives them the freedom to choose when and where to work. Every rider is protected with free insurance and our way of working is designed around what riders tell us matters to them most – flexibility.”",UK news; Deliveroo; London Stock Exchange; Gig economy; IPOs; Stock markets,UK news
2021-09-13T02:47:37Z,Liberal Andrew Bragg urges Scott Morrison to commit to net zero ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/13/liberal-andrew-bragg-urges-scott-morrison-to-commit-to-net-zero,"The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has urged Scott Morrison to commit to net zero emissions at the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow as the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, has warned that the test for whether or not the junior Coalition partner signs up will be the impact on jobs “in Muswellbrook”. Bragg, who has just become the chair of the Senate standing committee on environment and communications, told Guardian Australia on Monday: “It is quite clear that we should be looking to commit to net zero.” While arguing it was “entirely valid” that the government did the policy work to show how the commitment would be met, Bragg declared net zero “a target we need to have”. “There is a lot of heavy lifting that can be done in the cities in terms of electric vehicles and also energy – two of the big areas with our emissions profile.” He said he did not have a position on whether the government should increase the ambition of the 2030 emissions reduction target as well as locking in on 2050 in Glasgow. “The longer term is the most important position because that underpins a permanent management plan for climate change,” Bragg said. “Environmental risk is like any other economic risk, it needs to be managed, which is why I have always been attracted to the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) framework, which is a way of making these risks measurable and folding them into an economic paradigm. “There is a lot of good work out there on the table from places like the Grattan Institute, and I’m keen we work through all the opportunities to get our emissions down. This is a critical issue.” Bragg’s call comes as the government is continuing to work through policy options before the Glasgow conference. Morrison says he wants Australia to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible and preferably by 2050 – but he has not specified whether Australia will make a formal commitment in November at Cop26. Liberal moderates in metropolitan seats are now strongly of the view that it is politically untenable for the government to resist making a formal commitment to net zero. But Nationals championing fossil fuels in regional areas have signalled that they are strongly opposed to the government making that commitment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While Australia has faced sustained diplomatic pressure from key allies including the US and the UK to increase its level of climate policy ambition, it was revealed last week that the British government had removed references to the temperature goals of the Paris climate agreement from a prospective trade deal with Australia because the Morrison government sought their removal. Morrison confirmed last week that the government had opposed including the Paris agreement’s specific temperature goals because the deal was meant to be “about trade”. During an interview with the ABC on Monday, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, acknowledged that “certain ideas” had been brought to him during internal discussions. But he didn’t intend to share proposals publicly: “I wouldn’t be announcing it on radio.” Joyce also attempted to reassure his party room its members would determine the final position. “We will be making sure as ideas come forward, as qualified scientists put to the prime minister their views about how they would go forward, those views will be taken back to members of the National party room, and they can have their deliberations.” He said he was not looking to extract new commitments on grants programs or infrastructure projects from the prime minister and the only test he was interested in was the impact of any policy decision on regional jobs. The Nationals have been eyeing federal seats in the Hunter Valley. The Labor veteran Joel Fitzgibbon has confirmed he intends to retire at the next federal election. Joyce said on Monday that the Hunter – a coalmining region – was in his party’s sights. “If I go to Muswellbrook, where Joel Fitzgibbon has retired from, and we will stand in, and say to the people there, this is our belief about what will happen to your job, and this is why we are going in to bat to make sure you keep your job, up against Kristina Keneally, she now has an open seat, she can come up to the Hunter, she doesn’t have to stand in Fowler any more, it’s an open seat, Kristina, up you go to the Hunter … we can have the debate there with the people of Muswellbrook, the people of Singleton and the people in the Hunter Valley, about which plan is most likely to keep them in a job. “That’s what I am looking to, not some price tag for some piece of infrastructure.”",Coalition; Australian politics; Liberal party; National party; Barnaby Joyce; Energy; Climate crisis; Australia news; Environment; Scott Morrison; Hunter Valley; New South Wales; Coal; Australian economy; Fossil fuels; Labor party; Greenhouse gas emissions,Australia news
2022-06-03T05:00:05Z,"‘All is not lost!’ Yeah Yeah Yeahs return with riffs, risks and radical optimism",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/03/yeah-yeah-yeahs-return-karen-o-radical-freedom,"When the pandemic hit in 2020, Karen Lee Orzolek set about constructing what she thought of as a “portal” in a closet at the foot of her stairs. Orzolek, better known as Karen O, the spectacularly charismatic frontwoman of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, was experiencing the locked-down contraction of her world along with everyone else. Unlike everyone else, however, Orzolek is a rock star in the truest sense of the word – a woman used to selling out huge venues with a triple-Grammy-nominated band whose driving spirit these past 22 years comes from a swirl of notions that now seem almost antiquated: that rock music might set you free, that defiance can change the world, that transcendence through art is possible. Remembering that odd year spent at home in Los Angeles, Orzolek, 43, thinks first of worms: “My son was really into worm-hunting in our backyard; I remember life shrinking down to going on worm hunts with him,” she says with a smile. Second, she thinks of the concerts she did in that closet, mini broadcasts over Instagram for which she would transform her tiny space into “a different world” each time. Balloons, streamers, whatever it took – the band’s gleeful DIY spirit prevails. Those peak-pandemic months were the first time since she was a child that Orzolek experienced time as irrelevant: “Isn’t it so fascinating how these fraught times can bring so much revelation?” Now, nine years after the last Yeah Yeah Yeahs record, that sense of revelation thrums through their triumphant fifth album, Cool It Down. Finely calibrated between widescreen emotion and sonic precision, it sounds ready to sweep the jaded out of their stupor, and is the band’s best testament yet to their idealist spirit. It is mid-May, and Orzolek has arrived early to the sun-drenched terrace of a Los Angeles hotel wearing a sky-blue jumpsuit that makes her look like a chic garage attendant. A stylish older woman leaps up from a neighbouring table to tell her it’s incredible: did she make it herself? Orzolek thanks her and tells her no, her best friend did. This is designer Christian Joy, whose outre costumes shaped the band’s iconography from the start. By phone, Joy recalls the first one she made for Orzolek: “It was this really ugly, shredded blue prom dress that said ‘Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ all over it and had all these plastic flowers hanging off it. It was ugly and she rocked it.” In September 2020, Orzolek once again enlisted Joy. The band were turning 20 and Orzolek wanted to celebrate with a closet performance that would be some sort of transmission of love. For this, she needed an outfit that recalled the messy exuberance of their 2003 debut album, Fever to Tell. The concept, Joy says, went something like: “Crazy mom at a kids’ party who’d walked away with the whole table.” She sometimes wonders when Orzolek will “reach the point where she’s like: ‘OK, I can’t wear this stuff any more.’ I mean, we’re all in our 40s now …” In the clip, Orzolek appears against a backdrop of shiny rainbow streamers, wearing a spangly headdress bristling with balloons and a dress made from a shower curtain studded with dollar-store party tat. Then, with drummer Brian Chase and guitarist Nick Zinner beamed in via video, she sings their most indelible love song, Maps. It seems a sweet irony that a band known for not giving a damn should have this raw-hearted distillation of longing be their most famous song. Yet both Maps and the carnival-like disinhibition of the live shows seem to come from the same source: a refusal of self-consciousness. Zinner is next to arrive on the terrace: pale, clad in black, and wincing from the sun, he murmurs drily about being “a diva” as he seeks the shadiest corner of the table. His demeanour, that of a bewitched Tim Burton character, makes him an endearing foil to the labrador-like enthusiasm of Chase, who pulls up a chair with an: “All right! Los Angeles!” Chase, 44, is the lone NYC holdout; Orzolek moved to LA in 2004, and Zinner, having gone back and forth between the two cities, finally moved in 2020. People still assume, Orzolek says good-naturedly, that they all still live in New York. As much coffee and kale is ordered, I sense the magnitude of these three people having known each other for so long. “When we started out in 2000 we were inspired by music that came out in 1980,” says Zinner in quiet wonderment. “You know, ESG or New Order … and I can’t wrap my head around the fact that the beginning of our band is the mid-point between those things.” Both Chase and Orzolek are parents now, yet all three still seem like the awkward, occasionally awestruck art-school kids who came together in New York. When I suggest that silliness is at the band’s core, Orzolek agrees seriously, then gazes at the table to let a thought coalesce: “God, give me a second because this is huge …” Still thinking, she offers a throwaway line: “Don’t take the tongue out of the cheek!” “Did you just come up with that?” says Chase, impressed. “That’s brilliant.” She laughs this off. The creative ideal, for Orzolek, is “if you can forever be in the sandbox. For one thing, it’s disarming.” This was something she tried to figure out in the band’s earliest days. “I mean, New York’s a tough crowd. It’s a lot of somewhat jaded people who’ve seen it all.” It was a question, then, of: “How do I disarm this crowd of their own self-consciousness?” The answer was by summoning a welter of sexuality and absurdity and angst, ridding herself of self-awareness. “It sets me free! And the idea is if it sets me free, it sets everyone else free. And it sets Brian and Nick free! I mean, holy shit, the three of us when we’re up there: it really does feel like radical freedom.” “Performing with this band,” Zinner says simply, with full eye contact, “is the greatest thing in the world.” After the release of 2013’s Mosquito, however, it was by no means certain there would be another Yeah Yeah Yeahs record. The band had fulfilled their contract with Universal and thus freed from a cycle of writing, recording, touring. A couple of years later, Orzolek had a son, Django, with her husband, Barnaby Clay, a director. “I’m glad I was able to squeeze one out,” she says. “And then I was rubble for a couple of years after that.” The band remained in close touch but it wasn’t until late 2019 that they started talking about new music. In early 2020 came what they refer to as “the Black Dragon conversation”. “Karen and I had dinner and were hanging out and drinking this sake called Black Dragon,” Zinner explains. It resulted, Orzolek says, in the worst hangover of her life. But that night was also the first time she expressed a readiness to start writing again. “They’ve been extremely patient in waiting for me to come round,” she says of her bandmates. The Black Dragon conversation acknowledged the trauma of the Trump years, plus “the baggage and pressure of just 20 years of being a family”, ultimately leaving all three with one governing question: “How can we do this in the most joyful, pressure-free sort of way?” Soon after Zinner sent Orzolek a folder of ideas, the pandemic arrived. Not long after that, wildfires began raging through LA and Orzolek was reminded of “this ticking clock” of ecological doom. Confused by hearing so much music that seemed merely escapist, she longed to hear her emotions reflected – not least the vertigo of parenthood, and “ushering a new life into a world that feels so uncertain”. The mood of the album’s first track, Spitting Off the Edge of the World, is one of defiance – in particular, “defiance of ruin. It was me wanting to convey to my child that all’s not lost.” “There’s what I describe as a zoom-in, zoom-out quality to living right now,” says Chase. “The more I zoom out, the more I realise how problematic life is. Which sphere do I place myself in? Do I keep things in the immediate, or how much do I obligate myself to concern with the larger circumstances?” “I’m just stumbling through that every day,” says Orzolek. “In order to write music you have to be great friends with mystery and uncertainty. When Nick and I initially go in to ‘jam’ or whatever, we have this affinity and trust with the mysterious process of how music arrives. You have to be so open and almost innocent. I know I’m good at it when it comes to making music in this band – that’s the safe haven for big feelings.” The songs flowed out faster than ever before, with Orzolek seized by an urgency she hadn’t experienced since Fever to Tell. The result is a bombastic studio record, conveying a sense of cosmic awe with a punk sneer: when guest artist Perfume Genius sings on the euphoric opening track about the sun “melting houses of gold”, it’s both a spitting “fuck you” to capitalist greed and an arms-wide “I love you” to our planet. Cool It Down is also, Orzolek notes, “the most peaceful record between Nick and I – it just felt so simpatico”. “Just to see these things emerge from Karen, seemingly instantly …” murmurs Zinner, “it was so cool.” Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ very first show in 2000 was as the first of three openers for a little-known outfit called the White Stripes. “To play a show at the Mercury Lounge, to play a show in New York City – that was it!” says Orzolek. Beyond that, they had little or no ambition. “I don’t know if the Strokes did, or anyone did. Everyone was just doing it because they wanted to do it; it just happened to be the right place at the right time.” The grimy, heedless glamour of that moment is now undergoing a resuscitation. There’s the forthcoming documentary adaptation of Lizzy Goodman’s oral history Meet Me in the Bathroom, which memorialises the rise of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and their cohort – the Strokes, LCD Soundsystem, TV on the Radio. We are also witnessing the so-called “indie sleaze” revival, whereby all the sweat, glitter and spilt beer of an early 2000s subculture is being reclaimed by a generation who weren’t born at the time: Orzolek and her iconic bowl cut feature prominently on the Instagram account indiesleaze. When the US songwriter Lucy Dacus (of Boygenius) first heard Yeah Yeah Yeahs in high school, Karen O “opened up a world of possibility,” she tells me. Dacus was seized by Orzolek’s “wild confidence … her showing up in a way that felt reserved for rock legends. She was like, ‘Actually I’m a rock legend.’” There are, Orzolek will readily admit, two different Karens: the self-effacing one at this table, just a shy girl from New Jersey, and then the onstage force that is international rock goddess Karen O, howling and yelping into a mic. “I really revelled in there being little to no precedent or legacy for me,” she says. “I felt like because there are so few [women] and they’re all fucking crazy mavericks – Janis Joplin, Grace Slick, Patti Smith, Debbie Harry – all they taught me was you make it up as you go along. So I felt incredibly liberated in that sense.” It is one reason she felt fairly unscathed by the sexism of that time. “But yeah, the shots up the fucking skirt … That sucked.” It also annoyed her that people paid more attention to the spectacle than to the songwriting. “I was a hot mess, man,” she says. “The amount I wanted to please the crowd through self-destruction was escalating and escalating.” After she fell off a stage in Australia and injured herself in 2003, “I really had to reconfigure the way I performed. I had to understand that I didn’t need to destroy myself up there in order to reach some sort of transcendence.” On the band’s forthcoming tour, they will be supported by Japanese Breakfast, whose songwriter Michelle Zauner is Korean-American, and youthful punk band the Linda Lindas, who identify as half-Asian, half-Latinx. Orzolek, who is half Polish-American and half-Korean, is gratified by the “Asian-American representation blossoming” in music. “I feel like I’ve been waiting all my life for that. It’s crazy, man, how things like that change all of a sudden.” It is also life-affirming in a different way, she adds: “It feels like, ‘Man, we’re cool enough for these cool bands to open for us!’” The astonishment in her voice goes some way, I think, in explaining Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ enduring coolness – because what’s cooler than wonder? Here are three people still not taking a thing for granted, whether it’s worms or the vast mysteries of the creative process. Now, ahead of their shows for Cool It Down, Orzolek is puzzling over how she might “arrive as who I am right now in this moment” – with vulnerability and courage. “There’s going to be a new performer up there,” she says. “I just haven’t met her yet.” • Cool It Down is released 30 September on Secretly Canadian",Yeah Yeah Yeahs; Music; Culture,Music

At their best, the New York trio dig up the bones of punk-funk and post-punk, bolt them together and run a power line through for a giggle. Just as often, they sound like the scrag-end of dated hipster indie. Their new album edges Lily, Ani and Nina closer toward professionalism, with perkier production than they’re used to, although they don’t quite have the strength of songwriting to leave the scuzz completely behind. This brings the familiar problems for any basement band seeking to stride up the stairs and widen their appeal. The scrappy underdog bite of, say, their quarter-arsed, one-minute cover of the Bee Gees’ unimprovable Stayin’ Alive is swapped for a swathe of toothless tunes neither cool nor commercial enough to satisfy hardcore fans or find an entirely new audience. The band’s mayfly magic endures, though, particularly on The Way That You Do’s ragged clarity, the hypnotically repetitive Big Bad Want or live favourite Corner Store, heavenly harmonies dissolving into a menacing, stalkerish intensity. Then there’s All Over My Face, savagely funky and joyously wayward, bundling Television, Pavement and ESG into a slippery melange.",Indie; Music; Culture,Music

Top stories A young man in Hong Kong has been diagnosed with coronavirus more than four months after he recovered from a first episode of the disease. It suggests that immunity to the virus can be short-lived and has raised more questions about vaccines against Covid-19. Here’s a breakdown of six of the most promising treatments for Covid-19 so far. And here’s a guide to convalescent plasma, a method that was contentiously given an emergency authorisation by Donald Trump for Covid-19 patients in the US. Australians are prepared to countenance much stronger surveillance measures to ensure people diagnosed with Covid-19 remain in quarantine while they recover, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. A survey of 1,068 respondents shows 60% of the sample would support compulsory tracking bracelets during self-isolation for people diagnosed with coronavirus. The aged care royal commission has criticised the Morrison government for failing to establish independent monitoring and reporting of aged care quality outcomes. An inquiry heard a security guard at a Melbourne hotel who contracted coronavirus received no infection control training and wasn’t clear on his obligation to tell his superiors if he felt unwell. And after Covid, there’s no getting excited about budget predictions. The Republican party has formally nominated Donald Trump for re-election on the first day of a national convention meant to strike a contrast with Democrats and, in the president’s own words, deliver a “very uplifting and positive” message. Basking in chants of “Four more years! Four more years!”, Trump accused Democrats of trying to “steal” the election by expanding absentee voting during the coronavirus pandemic. He went so far as to say it was impossible for him to lose a fair contest in November. Australia Employers who use approved payroll software could be provided “safe harbour” against prosecution and penalties for wage underpayment under a plan put forward by the small and family business ombudsman. Labor has claimed victory in the Northern Territory election, with the latest result count confirming the party will hold at least 13 seats in the 25-member assembly. The Morrison government has proposed lifting a ban on the importation of exotic parrot species into Australia. Experts are concerned it could lead to the introduction of diseases and feral pests and an increase in illegal wildlife trade. A judge has said nine-year-old Indigenous boy Quaden Bayles has an arguable case that he was defamed by columnist Miranda Devine. Justice Anna Katzmann has approved moves to serve court documents on the New York-based columnist. The world At least 90 people are feared trapped in the debris of a five-storey building that collapsed to the south of India’s financial capital of Mumbai, according to police in Maharashtra state. Tests indicate that Alexei Navalny was the victim of a poisoning and he is being treated with atropine, the same antidote used after the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, according to the German clinic where the Kremlin critic is a patient. A police officer is being investigated by the justice department in the US state of Wisconsin after a man appeared to be shot in the back. The shooting prompted hundreds to protest in the city of Kenosha, about 40 miles south of Milwaukee.

2020-08-24T17:30:31Z,AMP sexual harassment scandal shows shareholders will insist on higher standards when directors don't,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/25/amp-sexual-harassment-scandal-shows-shareholders-will-insist-on-higher-standards-when-directors-dont,"The events that have unfolded at AMP over recent weeks prove company directors today need to be as worried about good corporate governance as delivering a strong bottom line. The resignation of the chair of AMP, David Murray, on Monday and the demotion of one of its senior executives over the company’s response to a sexual harassment complaint, is a clear indicator to boards that environmental, social and governance issues are now regarded by shareholders as inextricably linked to a company’s value as an investment. Shareholders are willing to use their voting power to insist on higher standards. Since 1 July, AMP has been facing a growing shareholder revolt over its decision to promote the man at the centre of sexual harassment allegations, Boe Pahari, to the head of one of its most important corporate divisions, AMP Capital. The company had been given a deadline of this Friday to respond to shareholders’ demands for action to be taken over Pahari’s appointment and to give more details on how it handled the sexual harassment complaint. Groups such as the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), representing major super funds, called for a public explanation of the company’s decision to promote a man who had been sanctioned with a $500,000 penalty, while his victim, Julia Szlakowski, had left the company, saying her decision to report him had made her career at AMP untenable. Some institutional investors were agitating for an extraordinary general meeting, which could potentially have led to board members being removed and further engulfed the insurer in controversy. A week ago Szlakowski outed herself, saying that was the only way to defend herself against what she saw as AMP’s trivialising of the events of 2017. In 2016, Szlakowski was named institutional director, unlisted, Americas and put in charge of North American distribution for AMP Capital’s infrastructure debt and equity strategies. She reported to Pahari, who then held the role of global head and managing partner, infrastructure equity, north-west region. Szlakowski was AMP Capital’s first US hire for AMP’s unlisted business, as well as the only woman on the North American distribution team, she says. Just six months into her new position, however, Szlakowski lodged a seven-page complaint with AMP, detailing a pattern of sexual harassment, which she says began in December 2016 and culminated in May 2017. “The conduct Ms Szlakowski alleged did not constitute an isolated incident of poor judgment, nor simple ‘comments’ that could be brushed aside as merely ‘uncomfortable’, as AMP and Mr Pahari had described in their public statement,” Szlakowski’s Australian lawyer, Maurice Blackburn principal Josh Bornstein, said in a statement on Monday. “The sexual harassment perpetrated against Ms Szlakowski was serious, persistent and wide-ranging.” Some details of her seven-page complaint have found their way into the media, including that Pahari referred to his “limp dick” when she turned down his offer to use his credit card to buy clothes, called another employee “a fag”, and asked her about the “oldest man she dated” in front of her colleagues. Pahari said in a statement earlier this year: “I genuinely regret that my comments made a colleague feel uncomfortable. It was never my intention, but I accept that they had an impact and I apologised and accepted the consequences. I have learned from the matter.” But Szlakowski says she wants the entire investigation report and her complaint made public by AMP. AMP on Monday released the conclusion of the 2017 internal report by Andrew Burns QC. “I find that there was poor judgment exercised by [Pahari] during this evening and one moderate and two minor incidents which overall added up to a relatively modest breach of the AMP workplace behaviour and equal opportunity policy,” he wrote. “However, this involved a senior manager who ought to have been observing a high standard of equality and diversity practice and who ought to have had a much better understanding of how his actions might be perceived by and may affect a junior colleague.” The issue for AMP is whether it has fully appreciated the seriousness of sexual harassment in the workplace, dealt with it appropriately and made the necessary adjustments to its corporate culture. Szlakowski said she was forced to engage private lawyers to get action, and the reporting has come at a high cost of her career at AMP. In contrast, Pahari was promoted. When the Australian Financial Review approached AMP about the promotion in July, AMP put out a statement saying: “The external investigation identified lower level breaches of AMP’s code of conduct for which Mr Pahari had appropriate consequences imposed, including a financial penalty and counselling for his conduct.” AMP said it had considered the matter prior to the appointment and the consequences applied to Pahari “were both significant and appropriate”. But that has not placated Szlakowski, who says AMP’s statement downplayed the impact on her. “There is nothing in AMP’s public statements that acknowledge that Ms Szlakowski was [allegedly] sexually harassed and traumatised and that her career with the company was prematurely finished as a result of what happened,” Bornstein said. Exactly what occurred at board level is not clear. Murray and John Fraser, a senior executive and the former head of treasury, have resigned. “These changes respond to feedback expressed by some major shareholders regarding the appointment of Mr Pahari as AMP Capital CEO on 1 July 2020,” the AMP board said in a statement to the ASX. Murray, however, in his public comments attached to the same statement, made it clear he considered the board should have stuck by its decision to promote Pahari, which he noted had been unanimous in July. “The board has made it clear that it has always treated the complaint against Mr Pahari seriously. My view remains that it was dealt with appropriately in 2017 and Mr Pahari was penalised accordingly. However, it is clear to me that, although there is considerable support for our strategy, some shareholders did not consider Mr Pahari’s promotion to AMP Capital CEO to be appropriate.” Murray said his decision to leave “reflects my role and accountability as chairman of the board and the need to protect continuity of management, the strategy and to the extent possible, the board”. Murray has been a long-time critic of attempts by the ASX and shareholder bodies to extend guidelines on good corporate governance to include corporate social responsibility principles. When Murray took over at AMP he told the AFR the ASX governance principles had led to directors being swamped by hundreds of pages of board papers and not having enough time to debate important strategic issues. “We will not be guided by the ASX corporate governance principles where they either weaken accountability or distract the company to less important issues,” he said. But that is a view increasingly not shared by the shareholders. “Today’s announcements are an acknowledgement by the company that significant change needs to occur. This is an important step in addressing concerns raised by investors’ and resetting company culture,” ACSI chief executive Louise Davidson said on Monday. “The company must now get on with the job of rebuilding public confidence, and in particular, the trust of their staff.” The activist group Australasian Centre of Corporate Responsibility said there should be no place in boardrooms for people such as Murray. “ACCR has always questioned the suitability of David Murray for chair of a modern ASX50 company,” the centre’s director, Brynn O’Brien, said. “Murray is a well-known climate sceptic. He waged a war against the ASX’s inclusion of ‘social licence’ in its corporate governance principles. It is quite ironic that AMP’s catastrophic social licence issues ultimately brought him down.”",Business; Sexual harassment; Insurance industry; Australia news; World news,Australia news
2019-04-07T16:47:17Z,London Stock Exchange refuses to remove palm oil firm from green index,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/07/london-stock-exchange-refuses-to-remove-palm-oil-firm-from-green-index,"The London Stock Exchange Group has refused to remove a palm oil company from an influential investment index of environmentally friendly firms, despite a string of allegations of corruption and unsustainable business practices. The group’s index subsidiary, FTSE Russell, has written to environmental groups declining to remove Golden-Agri Resources (GAR) from its FTSE4Good indices, which only include “companies demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices”. GAR, which is headquartered in Singapore and has a market value of 4.1bn Singapore dollars (£2.3bn), trumpeted its inclusion in the FTSE4Good indices in a press release in July 2018. Rafael B Concepcion Jr, GAR’s chief financial officer, said the firm was “honoured” by the inclusion. However, GAR has since been involved in a corruption scandal. In October, Indonesia’s anti-graft agency arrested two senior executives at GAR subsidiaries over allegations of bribery of officials. Reuters reported that the companies were alleged to have polluted a local lake. Some environmental groups also criticise the production of palm oil, used in products from soap to food, for its contribution to deforestation. Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, a US rival to FTSE Russell’s FTSE4Good series, removed GAR from its products in February after Friends of the Earth accused it of “greenwashing”. ESG stock market indices are used by investors to allocate billions of pounds of investments.Gaurav Madan, a senior forests and lands campaigner at Friends of the Earth US, said: “It is unacceptable that an index provider oriented towards driving sustainability standards should list companies whose business is predicated on an outdated model of industrial production that decimates local communities and globally significant forests. “Golden Agri-Resources has been involved in well-documented financial crimes, environmental degradation, and human rights violations.” Friends of the Earth said the inclusion of GAR highlighted the need for standardisation of ESG ratings. The London Stock Exchange said: “We can confirm that GAR’s latest assessment did not breach the required threshold in our Controversy Monitoring model to be suspended from the FTSE4Good Index Series. We continue to monitor GAR and the next evaluation will feed into the June semi-annual review process for the FTSE4Good index series.”",London Stock Exchange; Investing; Palm oil; Environment; Business; Stock markets; Financial sector,Business
2021-08-12T18:29:59Z,Vectura board unanimously accepts Philip Morris’s controversial takeover bid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/12/pressure-grows-on-vectura-board-to-reject-philip-morris-takeover-bid,"The board of the UK asthma inhaler maker Vectura has unanimously recommended that shareholders accept a controversial £1.1bn takeover bid from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, despite warnings from health charities and public health experts. In a statement to the stock market on Thursday afternoon, the Vectura board said it considered the terms of the final PMI offer “fair and reasonable”. The move came despite more than 20 health charities, public health experts and doctors sending a letter to the board urging them to reject the bid. PMI had raised its bid for Vectura to 165p a share last weekend, valuing the firm at £1.1bn and outbidding a rival £958m offer by the US private equity group Carlyle, which had agreed a takeover of Vectura in late May. The proposed takeover is now in the hands of Vectura’s shareholders. After PMI has launched its offer document, it has 60 days to win their support for its offer, and needs backing from holders of more than 50% of the shares. The company’s main shareholders are a series of American investment funds. The largest, with a 6.7% stake, is Brown Capital Management, a Baltimore firm with $18bn (£13bn) assets under management. Founded by Eddie Brown, it is one of the oldest African American asset management companies in the US. None of the individual funds at the top of Vectura’s shareholder list appear to screen out tobacco, although the fund management companies behind them offer other products targeted at ethical investors. Invesco markets tobacco free funds, and its website features a petition urging American film companies to make movies targeted at children smoke free. Vanguard’s website also markets ESG funds, stating that these might involve “screening out the tobacco industry or weapons manufacturers, as well as excluding businesses caught up in human rights or labour controversies.” Three of Vectura’s largest investors – Axa Investment Managers, TIG Advisers and Berry Street Capital Management – who collectively control 11.2% of the shares had publicly backed the Carlyle bid and are expected not support the PMI offer due to ethical concerns. The bidding war for Vectura has led to a near-40% spike in the company’s share price and could deliver multimillion pound bonuses for executives. Chief executive Will Downie could receive pay and bonuses of £2.4m this year if the company’s shares rise by more than 50% over the year, according to the company’s remuneration report. Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said the charities were “extremely shocked and concerned” at the news. “PMI makes billions every year from making addictive products that can cause and exacerbate lung diseases. It’s totally absurd that PMI could make more money from providing treatments to the very people they have made ill in the first place. “We will continue to oppose this dreadful proposed takeover until a final decision is made. We appeal now to Vectura’s shareholders to make the right and ethical choice and say no to big tobacco.” The letter to the board, signed by heads of charities including the British Lung Foundation, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and the American Lung Association said: “Vectura’s future commercial viability as a company dedicated to improving respiratory health would be seriously jeopardised should the PMI takeover proceed.” PMI says it advocates a smoke-free future, but still makes about three-quarters of its $28bn in annual revenue from “combustible” products that involve the burning of tobacco. In its statement, the Vectura board said: “Wider stakeholders could benefit from PMI’s significant financial resources and its intentions to increase research and development investment and to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit that will form the backbone of its inhaled therapeutics business.” Danni Hewson, financial analyst at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “What comes first, the heart or the wallet? That’s got to be uppermost in the minds of some the City’s most influential investors who’ve just come face to face with a dilemma of mythic proportions. Big tobacco has the bigger bid and Vectura’s board has unanimously recommended the £1bn offer, but can anyone seriously espouse a social conscience and accept this deal?” Carlyle said on Tuesday it would not raise its 155p a share offer, which valued Vectura at £958m. The private equity firm also insisted it would be a better steward for the company, its employees and patients than PMI. Vectura shares closed at 163.25p. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Philip Morris’s attempted takeover of a key player in lung health products beggars belief. It is bitterly disappointing that Vectura have so far failed to exercise duty of care to patients and scientists and reject this takeover by big tobacco. “This is now a test for Sajid Javid. When we know smoking causes so much serious illness and premature death, it’s time this government takes the right course, stands up to this tobacco giant and blocks this takeover.” Nicholas Hopkinson, the chairman of ASH and professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College in London, said PMI had no place in healthcare. “A PMI takeover will ruin Vectura. Doctors will stop prescribing its products, scientists will leave rather than become pariahs and the academic collaboration necessary to drive its progress will cease.” Vectura was founded by academics at the University of Bath almost 20 years ago and specialises in developing respiratory drugs.",Healthcare industry; Philip Morris International; Tobacco industry; Mergers and acquisitions; UK news; Business,Business
2021-07-03T13:00:53Z,Sault: Nine review – a masterclass in anger and balm,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/03/sault-nine-review-london-99-days-balm-,"Sault – a semi-anonymous UK collective – have already made their mark with four extraordinary albums in the space of two years. Releasing their works without much warning, unwilling to talk about their art, they have become a prolific leftfield outfit torching the rules. Nine, their fifth album, is available to buy and stream for 99 days (until 2 October). It’s pretty special too – not least because it’s an album about the experience of growing up in London that thumbs its nose almost entirely at the capital’s rich history of music genres, both black and white. We are accustomed to hearing these sad, angry, mischievous stories told as the fast 8-bit rhythms of grime or hip-hop. But Nine eschews the sounds synonymous with London; it only hints in passing at dubstep and rave. You really have to pinch yourself at the audacity, too, of a track called Trap Life containing 0% trap beats – the now-dominant strain of hip-hop here as in the US. Rather, Sault turn to warm African-Caribbean sounds, and righteous anger played out as playground chants. A hard-hitting song about London’s gang infrastructure sounds like the Chemical Brothers’ Block Rockin’ Beats. Sault have always confounded. Nine follows their genre-melting albums of 2019, 5 and 7, and their twin records of 2020, Untitled (Black Is) and Untitled (Rise). The latter two were impassioned outpourings in sync with last year’s international Black Lives Matter protests. All offered up an unexpectedly boxy, retro sound: rolling drums, funk bass and R&amp;B groove, rogue analogue keyboards, and a sampledelic aesthetic. Vocalists Cleo Sol (UK) and Kid Sister (US) were as likely to chant as they were to sing or rap; African and Caribbean inflections were ever-present. Throughout Nine, Sault double down on this vinyl crate-digger vibe: a rolling break here combined with an unexpected Beatles tilt there. The electronic Afro-funk of ESG or Tom Tom Club still looms high in the mix, as it has on all Sault’s records, but there are songs here – such as the lovely Bitter Streets – that recall, of all things, French chanson. Nine returns to Sault’s earlier album art: titles formed by matchsticks, and a fire about to be lit. The visuals speak loudly so that the artists involved don’t have to: joining Sol and Kid Sister are UK producer Inflo and a handful of collaborators. Inflo (Dean Josiah) is better known as Michael Kiwanuka’s producer on Kiwanuka, his Mercury-winning album of 2019; Josiah is also involved with Little Simz and Jungle. Like Adele (19, 21, 25), Sault have a thing for odd numbers. Nine showcases its namesake twice: the title track turns on a delicate retro guitar motif holding aloft Cleo Sol’s cooed vocal. Another “nine” occurs earlier, on Trap Life: “Don’t reach for that nine, nine, nine,” Sol begs, referring to a firearm; the repetition also suggests dialling 999. An Instagram statement explains that the band’s origins lie in London’s council estates, where resources and options are limited and people can fall into even more harmful situations. The final song, Light’s In Your Hands, talks of kids growing up too fast, traumatised. The spoken word is paramount here. One of a number of spoken interludes, Mike’s Story bears witness to one Michael Ofo hearing of his father’s murder. 9 finds an unnamed, older contributor explaining how being from a particular area inevitably marked you. If a sense of discomfiture has run through all Sault’s albums – they challenge, seethe and weep, confound expectation, change tack abruptly – there is never a sense of a misstep. As with previous Sault LPs, there is at least one thoroughly mainstream knockout moment: Alcohol is a smooth neo-soul paean to self-medication played out in gentle waltz time. Just as Michael Kiwanuka featured on Untitled (Black Is), Inflo’s other close associate Little Simz appears here, her old-school flow detailing a life of Oyster cards and being triggered by sirens – Untitled themes given an unmistakable London flavour and dreamy organ keys, jazz horn and a tickle of hi-hat. There’s humour here too: You From London also pokes fun at American attitudes to Britons. (“Like people be going to work on horses and stuff?”) Where the two Untitleds were aflame with anger as well as pain, Nine returns to trauma – and healing – as its central motif. “The pain is real,” Sault repeat. As on 5’s Add a Little Bit of Sault, the band briefly namecheck themselves. Their name has always carried with it the cold shiver of the word “assault”, but here they offer their music as a remedy. “The Sault will heal the wounds,” croons Sol.",Sault; Music; Culture; Michael Kiwanuka; Little Simz; R&B; Soul; Pop and rock,Music
2021-09-21T13:15:35Z,Johnson says he has changed his mind on the climate – but he’s still dragging his feet | Adrienne Buller,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/21/johnson-climate-denial-delay,"As he flew to New York yesterday to speak to the UN general assembly about the Cop26 climate conference, Boris Johnson was asked to defend old comments made by his newly appointed trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan. Trevelyan had made statements on Twitter in the past decade promoting climate-denial literature, denying climate change was happening at all, and denigrating climate scientists and activists as “doom-mongers” and “fanatics”. Johnson insisted that these views – despite coming from a minister whose role has serious climate implications – weren’t really such a big deal. In fact, he was himself guilty of similar statements not so long ago. He reminded the public that were we to “excavate some of [his] articles from 20 years ago”, it wouldn’t be difficult to find sentiments that “weren’t entirely supportive of the current struggle”, as he generously put it. “Facts change,” he added, “and people change their minds.” Johnson is a man who questioned human-caused climate change as recently as 2015. We have to ask: has he truly seen the light? And has the Conservative party – long a bastion of organised climate denial – come along with him? At a glance, the Tories’ new record – or at least rhetoric – looks good. Johnson continues to make strong, sober statements ahead of November’s Cop26 conference, and the party has nicked Labour’s “green industrial revolution” framing in its ambitions for “building back better” after the pandemic. It might seem that this Conservative party is a new beast: bring on all the “green crap” David Cameron once dismissed. But critically, the Tories aren’t the only formerly denier-friendly party suddenly ready to discuss the C word, and anoint themselves heroic climate leaders. Public opinion on climate has changed rapidly, and now to appear credible, parties across the political spectrum must have a stance on the central crisis facing humanity. Free-market stalwarts in the Republican party increasingly clamber over each other to prove their climate credentials. The fossil fuel majors and chemical giants are spending millions to rebrand as leaders in “clean energy” and “nature-based solutions”. Even Charles Koch – scion of disinformation campaigns and the fossil fuel lobby, and the gravedigger for countless climate regulations and actions – now seeks absolution for his role in obstructing climate action and fomenting political division. Nigel Farage, the golden boy of reactionary politics, now sits on the advisory board of a carbon-offsetting firm. Contrast this with the political landscape of only a few years ago, and it certainly looks like times have changed. Outright denial of the climate crisis still exists, but thanks to decades of advocacy it has been pushed definitively to the fringes. To remain mainstream, politicians must at least speak to the reality of climate change. But why, then, do we remain so perilously off-track for meeting even the inadequate target enshrined in 2015’s Paris agreement? How can it be, with all of this “consensus” on the need for action across the political spectrum that so little is changing? The simple answer is that denial has been replaced by a phenomenon that might just be worse: delay. “Delayism” is in some respects the political equivalent of greenwashing: gesturing to a veneer of green policy, while the underlying problems remain unchanged and unaddressed. The politics of delay are those of acknowledging the reality of climate change, while ridiculing ambitious climate policy as a “green dream, or whatever”, or of weak incentives and nonbinding, intangible targets with no plans for meeting them. Delayism builds a broad church, welcoming both those politicians who genuinely resist vital action on the climate crisis – pushing it far into the future – and those who are committed to half-hearted, inadequate or regressive solutions in the present. Worryingly, this might be delayism’s most troubling form: the proliferation of false solutions that – in the same vein as greenwashing – contribute very little to curb emissions, while creating a false sense of progress that undermines the effective action we need. And they often lock in the injustices and inequalities that underlie the climate crisis in the first place. From carbon offset programmes that drive land grabs in the developing world, to ineffectual carbon pricing schemes – something the US and EU have spent decades on to little effect – to the opportunism of “ESG investing”, which overwhelmingly provides the wealthy with an opportunity to profit from the transition, and the widespread harms caused by mineral extraction in the global south, often devastating communities to support the green demands of the wealthy, the ‘green transition’ is increasingly recognised as an opportunity for the accumulation of wealth and pursuit of profit. Actual progress seems to come second, if at all. Left to their own devices, the champions of this new green politics will continue to talk a good game on climate, while ensuring that little about the world actually changes. This makes it difficult to address the climate crisis at all, and impossible to address it in a way that is fair and equitable to the billions of people who did little to create the crisis – but will bear the brunt of its effects. Whether that means weakening emission targets and accountability in international treaties to minimise disruption to wealthy economies; prohibiting the use of climate-related language in trade agreements; or pouring money into the environmentally destructive and resource-intensive electric vehicle industry rather than investing in the societal shifts in mobility and mass transit that will necessarily support a decarbonised future. If recent shifts in politics have shown that accepting the need to decarbonise is no longer the dividing line, they have just as clearly underscored that the path we take and the speed we travel will be the central battle in the years to come. The fight is no longer between “the science” and conspiracy. Climate action – however patchy, unjust or ineffective it may largely be – is happening. Securing the pace, scale and shape of action that we need and which justice demands means freeing our collective capacities from the imperatives of accumulation. We have to hold our leaders accountable to their newfound green rhetoric – or it will remain just that. Denialism may have been bad, but delay could be just as harmful.

2019-11-08T19:00:45Z,Global funds management giant rejects Scott Morrison's attack on activist investors,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/09/global-funds-management-giant-rejects-scott-morrisons-attack-on-activist-investors,"Global funds management giant Aberdeen Standard Investments has rejected prime minister’s Scott Morrison’s call for companies to listen to “quiet shareholders” as part of a comprehensive rebuff of the government’s attack on activist investors and the environmental movement. The UK’s biggest listed fund manager, which controls assets worth more than £550bn, also defended the role of environmental groups including Market Forces, which has been accused by the attorney general, Christian Porter, of pressuring companies through “widespread, co-ordinated harassment and threats of boycotts”. Aberdeen’s intervention in Australian politics comes after bank bosses on Friday told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environmental groups and rejected the need for changes to the law foreshadowed by the Morrison government. In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council last Friday, Morrison attacked “an escalating trend towards a new form of secondary boycotts in this country” in which environmental groups “are targeting businesses and firms who provide goods or services to firms they don’t like, especially in the resources sector”. “Some of Australia’s largest businesses are now refusing to provide banking, insurance and consulting services to an increasing number of firms who just support through contracted services to the mining sector and the coal sector in particular, which is the nation’s second-largest export sector,” Morrison said “I think some of our largest corporations should listen and engage with their quiet shareholders, not just the noisy ones.” An Aberdeen spokeswoman said the company had a “critical role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the adaptation to climate change impacts through our products and investment decision”. “We see environmental, and particularly climate, risks as financially material to the businesses that we invest our clients’ money in and that is why it is a strong focus of our analysis,” she said. The company is among shareholders in BHP who delivered large votes in favour of a resolution proposed by activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that, if passed, would have forced the mining giant to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and other lobby groups with a track record inconsistent with the company’s position on the climate crisis. “Like many large asset owners and asset managers, we actively engage with companies and much of this engagement is done ‘quietly’, in that it is conducted privately between ASI and the company,” the spokeswoman said. “We believe this is generally the most effective way to influence change. However, we strongly believe that there is also a place for ‘noisy’ action where other forms of engagement have been ineffective, and where the issue of concern is not aligned with the company’s broader strategy. “Shareholders, noisy or quiet, are not faceless institutions. As shareholders, it is our responsibility to represent the interests of our clients in generating sustainable long-term returns.” She said Morrison’s remarks would have no effect on the group’s strategy. “Our engagement and investment activities are informed by our disciplined investment approach, and we will continue to engage with companies, quietly or otherwise, where we believe that company strategy does not adequately address material environmental, social and governance issues – including climate change,” she said. Asked about the government’s attack on Market Forces, which is associated with environment group Friends of the Earth, she said that protesting was “an effective and vital part of a democracy”. “At the end of the day, companies are commercial organisations that will not be influenced by activist groups unless they can see a commercial benefit,” she said. Under questioning from Labor’s treasury spokesman, Andrew Leigh, and the Greens deputy leader, Adam Bandt, at a parliamentary hearing on Friday, the Westpac chief executive, Brian Hartzer, and his counterpart at the Commonwealth bank, Matt Comyn, both denied they felt bullied by climate activists. Leigh took Hartzer to Westpac’s climate commitments, asking: “Is it fair to say you made these decisions in your own business interests rather than being bullied into it?” “Yeah,” Hartzer replied. He said Westpac made its decisions after taking into consideration its role in society. “We do that independently,” he said. Asked if the law needed to be changed as foreshadowed by Morrison, he said: ‘No, but I’m not sure what’s specifically proposed there.” Bandt put it to Comyn that it didn’t sound like the CBA was being “bullied”. “Yes, that’s right,” Comyn said. He said that to his knowledge the bank had never asked the government to change the law because of campaigns people ran that affected its business. The Commonwealth Bank’s deputy chief executive, David Cohen, said that the bank’s “experience has been that engaging with some of the environmental groups has been to our benefit”. He said it had helped shape the bank’s thinking on environmental, social and governance issues. “I think that’s enriched our own thinking over time,” he said. Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski asked Comyn if the bank had been subjected to shareholder activism by groups that bought small parcels of shares in order to put motions or be disruptive. “One of the unique and positive features of the AGM is that people, regardless of their shareholding, are able to get up and ask questions of the chairman,” Comyn said. He said the number of questions on the environment had increased recently, mirroring wider debate in the community. “It’s not unreasonable and as I said in many ways positive that small shareholders are able to stand and ask questions of the board and management of their company,” he said.",Business; Scott Morrison; Australian politics; Business; Environment; Climate crisis; Australia news,Australia news
2019-10-11T03:42:08Z,Josh Frydenberg rejects IMF report that Australia will fail to meet Paris target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/australia-will-fail-to-meet-paris-target-even-with-carbon-price-of-us75-a-ton-imf-says,"Josh Frydenberg has rejected the International Monetary Fund’s warning that Australia will fail to meet its Paris agreement emissions reduction target even with a carbon price of US$75 a ton. The IMF made the observation in a report on mitigating climate change which concluded that a carbon tax is still a more cost-effective solution than “feebate” models, which impose fees on activities with above-average emissions and subsidise those with below-average emissions. Frydenberg, the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader, told reporters in Canberra on Friday the government is “confident we will meet and beat our targets and as you know at the election we laid out our $3.5bn climate solutions package with a range of methods”. Angus Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction, said the IMF report “does not take into account” the government’s emissions reduction fund, which pays polluters to cut greenhouse gases by 328mt by 2030. The fund has been criticised for rapidly diminishing returns and widespread exemptions to limits on emissions elsewhere in the economy. Despite the Morrison government claiming that Australia will meet its Paris target of 26% to 28% emissions reduction by 2030 “in a canter”, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have risen for five years since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. In a separate report the IMF warned that companies cannot afford to ignore environmental and social goals because they have a “material impact on corporate performance”, in part because of investor pressure and potential “large losses from climate change”. The paper implicitly rejects the view expressed by senior Coalition figures that business should not speak up on social issues, interpreted as an attack on one of Australia’s biggest resources companies, BHP, for its efforts to reduce emissions. The first IMF paper found that if G20 countries imposed uniform carbon prices of $25, $50, and $75 a ton emissions would fall by 19%, 29%, and 35% respectively for the group. Although a $25 price would be “more than enough” for some countries – such as China, India and Russia – to meet their targets, even with a $75 a ton price Australia and Canada would fail owing to differences in the stringency of targets and the price responsiveness of emissions. Retail energy prices in Australia would rise by 75% with a carbon price of $75 a ton owing to its heavy reliance on coal-fired power generation, it said. The report suggests a combination of regulation and “feebate” policies in Australia would only cut emissions by two-thirds the amount a $50 carbon price would, and would add 50% to mitigation costs. The report suggests in Australia a $50 carbon price would raise about 1% of GDP in revenue and suggests returning revenue to taxpayers. “To make carbon taxes politically feasible and economically efficient, governments need to choose how to use the new revenue,” it said. “Options include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, increasing investment in green energy, or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.” Taylor said the “point of a carbon tax is to raise the price of energy so people consume less”. “Labor’s carbon tax did exactly that, and that’s why we abolished it.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australia Institute’s climate director, Richie Merzian, said the IMF report showed “carbon prices work” and would have little impact on the economy. “In just two years under the Clean Energy Future carbon price, Australia reduced emissions by 2%, grew the economy by 5% and added 200,000 jobs,” he said. “If there is one clear message for the Australian government, it is get your act together. Australia’s emissions are increasing, not falling, because there is no credible climate and energy policy.” In its sustainable finance report, the IMF argued that integrating environmental, social and governance factors into firms’ business models will “help mitigate risks” such as financial stability risks via exposure of banks and insurers and large losses from climate change. It identified both “physical risks” from damage to property, land and infrastructure from catastrophic weather-related events and broader climate trends, and “transition risks” from changes in the price of stranded assets and broader economic disruption because of evolving climate policy, technology, and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower-carbon economy. “Environmental, social, and governance issues can have a material impact on firms’ performance and on the stability of the financial system more broadly,” it said. In September the heads of Australia’s two major airlines – Alan Joyce of Qantas and Virgin Australia’s Paul Scurrah – rejected government calls to stay out of social and environmental issues, citing the strong business case to attract employees and customers with a social conscience.",Paris climate agreement; Climate crisis; Australia news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Australian politics; Coalition; Scott Morrison,Environment
2020-06-11T17:30:02Z,Adani mine: three major insurers to have no further involvement in coal project,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/12/adani-mine-three-major-insurers-to-have-no-further-involvement-in-coal-project,"Three major insurance groups that provided cover for parts of the Adani coal project in Queensland have said they will not provide future policies to the project. AXA XL, Liberty Mutual and HDI have told Guardian Australia they will not have any further involvement in the project after previously providing insurance cover that has now expired. The names of the three companies, together with one other insurer, appear on a file seen by Guardian Australia as having provided insurance cover for the project. Construction has started on the Adani coal site – one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia’s history. The mine and its railway will export coal through Adani’s Abbot Point terminal to power plants. Insurance broker Marsh has reportedly been working with Adani since 2015 and like other companies has come under pressure from campaigners to walk away due to coal’s contribution to the climate crisis. A spokesperson for AXA XL told Guardian Australia the company “do not currently have a live insurance policy for the Carmichael mine’s assets, neither directly nor through packages, and we do not intend to do so in the future.” The spokesperson said the policy had provided “a period of residue cover for work defaults” and that this expired in 2021. The decision to break ties with the Adani project was related to a new company policy on coal, announced in January 2020. The spokesperson added that “we are all committed to a long-term ‘exit’ strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030 in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world”. A spokesperson for Liberty Mutual said the firm and its subsidiary Liberty Specialty Markets “do not have any current policies in place for the Adani Carmichael mine project”. Guardian Australia asked if the company had any ongoing involvement in the mine and its railway project. In a statement, the spokesperson added: “In January 2019, we informed the appropriate parties we would not be participating in the insurance program for the operational phase of the project. We will not have any further involvement in the Adani Carmichael mine project.” A previous policy covering early-works site construction had expired in October 2019 and the company remained “contractually obligated to a 24-month maintenance period for any defects that may arise in that specific construction following the conclusion of the period of insurance”. The spokesperson said the company recognised the risk of climate change and had a new “Office of Sustainability” that would “embed responsible investment and risk management policies into our decision-making.” The company’s 2019 environment review said “the world needs to retain some level of balance between fossil fuels and renewable sources while making the transition to a fully decarbonised system”. The company had a policy, the report said, to make no new investments in debt or equity securities of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and to “phase out coverage and investments for existing risks that exceed this threshold by 2023”. Two other insurers named on the files seen by Guardian Australia were Aspen RE and HDI. A statement from HDI Global said the company “is not an insurer of the Adani Carmichael coal mine project” and Guardian Australia understands this includes the railway that is part of the Carmichael project. The statement said the company could not rule out that one or more of its Australian customers could be among the mine’s contractors. The statement said the company – part of the German-owned Talanx Group – would no longer underwrite any risks for newly planned coal-fired power stations or coalmines. By 2038, the company aimed to no longer have any coal plants or mines in its portfolio. “It is part of our fundamental business principles not to grant any direct insurance cover to projects like the Adani Carmichael coal mine,” the statement said. A Marsh employee who has been a commercial risk manager for more than two years with the company, but who asked not to be named, said the insurance broker had “lost domestic clients over this already” and that some colleagues were “concerned about where Marsh stands on climate change and what we represent”. There was concern among some employees, the manager claimed, of the impact of the mine on the land and culture of the Wangan and Jagalingou people. In May, the company’s parent group, Marsh &amp; McLennan, released a one-page “client engagement principles” document, saying the firm had a commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on climate change. That goal does not include specific temperature targets, unlike the UN’s Paris climate agreement. The document was branded as “greenwash” by campaigners. A spokesperson for Marsh told Guardian Australia the company had a “long-standing policy not to comment on the identity of clients” and pointed to its client engagement principles. “These principles do not contain a bright-line policy against any industry. Rather, we will evaluate proposed engagements that potentially conflict with these goals and determine whether work can proceed as proposed or with limitations.” The spokesperson said Marsh had adopted recommendations of the international Financial Security Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures – a project chaired by Michael Bloomberg that encourages financial institutions and companies to disclose their exposure to risks from climate change. A spokesperson for Aspen Insurance said the company could not discuss individual policies, adding: “We are currently reviewing our underwriting appetite around fossil fuel but cannot comment further at this time.” Aspen “understands the importance of environmental, social and governance issues,” the spokesperson said, and the company had joined a UN leadership platform “for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices.” In January, the Australian coach company Greyhound cut ties with a contractor building the Adani mine railway after Guardian Australia revealed its association with the coal project. Pablo Brait, a campaigner at Market Forces, a group working to highlight financial links between companies and fossil fuel projects, said: “The fact that there are more than a dozen insurers who have said that they won’t go near the Adani project speaks to the reputational risk that any company that underwrites it faces. “Most insurance policies have expiry dates and we encourage any company underwriting the project either with Adani directly or through a contractor to refuse to renew any policies when they come up for renewal or expire.” An Adani spokesperson said: “Details on insurance providers for the Carmichael Project are commercial in confidence, however we have the requisite insurance requirements in place.”",Carmichael coalmine; Adani Group; Business; Insurance industry; Coal; Fossil fuels; Environment; Queensland; Australia news,Environment
2021-06-26T08:00:49Z,"The pandemic was meant to change work, but what have we got so far? Free pizza | Josie Cox",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/26/pandemic-change-work-free-pizza-corporate-perks-office,"Earlier this month in lower Manhattan’s financial district, food carts lined what is otherwise a usually sterile stretch of pavement. Vendors doled out free burritos and ice cream to the mingling sun-kissed bankers – folks who had begrudgingly traipsed back to their physical desks after a year of remote working, following the stern orders of moneyed overlords. Free lunch is entry-level when it comes to corporate perks, a trusted staple many businesses have fallen back on as a means of convincing workers to resume their pre-pandemic working habits and arduous commutes. Elsewhere, on both sides of the Atlantic, some companies have demonstrated a little more creativity. From Peloton bikes to house-cleaning vouchers and meditative gong baths, the name of the game seems to be to conjure up the wackiest perk possible, to keep staff – forced to upend their working habits for the second time in two years – sweet. Companies, most recently the dating app Bumble, have given workers paid time off as a thank you for their commitment and resilience during the past 15 or so months, and no doubt as a means of retaining the smartest minds amid headlines warning of escalating talent wars due to labour shortages. But as we settle back into some sort of routine, having lived through an entirely traumatic period of pain, anxiety and loss, extra holiday, fair-to-middling Mexican food and even gong baths aren’t going to cut it. The labour force in the UK and elsewhere is in crisis. Wealth inequality is staggering and getting worse by the minute. In January, researchers at the Resolution Foundation thinktank published a report showing that almost a quarter of all household wealth in the UK is held by the richest 1% of the population. More recently, Credit Suisse found that more than 5 million people became millionaires across the world in 2020. The tally of people plunged into poverty and destitution, meanwhile, is still rising. Minorities are the worst off. Experts have warned that the pandemic has wiped out years of progress towards a more gender-equal labour market. Constrained by limited childcare options, many women have left certain industries, such as finance, and even those who have stayed in jobs have never been more anxious and stressed. Hybrid working, hailed by some as the perfect post-pandemic set-up, will quite feasibly create a two-tier workforce in which those who are physically present –predominantly able-bodied men who are not primary carers – are professionally favoured over their remote counterparts: women, disabled people and those with caring duties. Even the prospect of this trend materialising should keep every single business leader up at night and bathed in cold sweat. So no, free sandwiches won’t do the trick. Companies and their leaders have the immense privilege of being in a position in which they can use this moment in history – the pandemic pause after decades of great acceleration – to recalibrate and reconsider what being responsible truly means. A real perk would be to alleviate financial worries for workers whose spouses lost their jobs on account of the pandemic. A real perk would be free on-site childcare for those who need to be back in their physical office full-time. A real perk would be knowing that taking advantage of a hybrid work model won’t adversely impact your chances of getting promoted, winning a pay rise or generally being respected just as much as any physically present co-worker. As we prepare to rethink how work actually works, businesses have a duty to understand, acknowledge and address the underlying systemic failings of the business world, not just paper over them with cheap headline-grabbing ping-pong tables , yoga classes and cold beer on tap. Raising dividends for shareholders and executing massive stock buy-back programmes (in order to prop up their own stock prices) at a time when employees are worrying about how to stay physically healthy and mentally sane is entirely crass and ethically tone deaf. And yet, so far this year, the volume of shares bought back by some of the world’s biggest companies is running at a record high – up to mid-June, $567bn, or more than £400bn, had been splashed by corporations. That’s money that could have been channelled into much-needed pay rises. It could have averted the need for businesses to employ merciless “fire-and-rehire” tactics. Alternatively, the cash could have been spent on research and development, particularly in the case of healthcare companies, or it could have been used to offer equity to more workers, beyond executives. At least that way the seemingly indelible culture of shareholder primacy that still permeates so many businesses could actually be a positive force for employees, because they, too, would be shareholders. The ESG hype, the popular corporate pledge to consider economic, social and governance factors when making business decisions, has been around for long enough for workers and consumers to hold those business people to account who parrot the empty claims enshrined in their corporate strategy. In the decades to come, it’s unlikely that most of us will witness another moment of such severe reckoning, a period of such extreme forced experimentation. Now is the time to capitalise on that opportunity, to rethink what an employee benefit really means and to understand what purpose it should truly serve.

2019-12-08T09:00:36Z,Market debut for world’s biggest polluter must be a rallying cry for climate action,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/08/saudi-aramco-flotation-biggest-polluter-climate-action,"In less than a week the most valuable company in history will make its debut on a publicly traded market. Saudi Aramco is both the most profitable and the most polluting company of all time. Its looming $1.7tn (£1.3tn) market listing is also evidence of the gaping chasm between Europe’s growing climate movement and the carbon addiction the rest of the world just cannot kick. A year that has seen the most determined green investor activism, fossil fuel divestments and climbing climate targets will end with the largest single fossil-fuel binge in investment history. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman put in motion plans to offer international investors the opportunity to own a piece of the world’s biggest oil company in 2016, only months after governments in Paris had agreed plans to tackle the climate crisis. Nonetheless, the world’s biggest investors, from Wall Street to the largest financial centres in Europe and Asia, still clamoured for a chance to help bring Aramco to market. The scale of the world’s biggest IPO has since been scaled back in line with a waning western appetite for a company indelibly linked to the Saudi regime and its flaring geopolitical tensions. When Aramco makes its debut later this month, it will be on the local Riyadh stock exchange, for the dubious benefit of investors based almost exclusively in the Middle East. The plans for a second, international, listing are gone, as is the hope of a $2tn valuation, but Aramco’s failure to live up to Prince Mohammed’s desire for a place in the global investment community should not be chalked up as a victory for ethical investment. Despite the cold feet of western banks, the float still attracted investor interest equating to more than five times the number of shares on offer. Aramco will still raise $25bn for the Saudi government, breaking the record set by China’s online retail giant Alibaba. It will also topple Apple – worth more than $1tn – from its position as the world’s most valuable public company. Its market capitalisation will tower above the combined value of the next five largest oil companies. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, has predicted that a $2tn valuation could still be on the cards once trading begins, and with Opec’s new deal to buoy global oil prices next year. He may be right. The centuries-old bonds which bind global capitalism to carbon show little sign of fraying as the world’s fastest-growing economies remain keen to continue investing in oil, coal and gas. Even investors wary of a future decline in demand are keenly aware that Saudi oil is some of the easiest and cheapest to produce in the world. If their investment horizons were to stretch to the day the world uses its last barrel of oil, that barrel would most likely be Saudi. The funds flowing into the single biggest contributor to the climate crisis may not come from European investors, but this doesn’t mean Aramco’s move away from the west should not be ignored. The limited listing effectively puts the world’s most polluting company beyond the reach of green campaigners, activist investors and the ESG (environmental, social and governance) codes followed by European banks. Aramco will not face political pressure from its state owners, or even from its neighbours in the region. The threat of divestment is meaningless for Aramco. This is no reason to give up on the strides made in Europe. It is a reminder that these hard-won standards must gain traction beyond Europe’s financial centres, too. In the same way that the world’s rapidly warming atmosphere is blind to the geographic provenance of carbon emissions, the greening of the financial system needs to be global too. Saudi Aramco’s market triumph may be more muted than planned, but it is still a deafening warning about tackling the climate crisis. Virgin Trains terminates here Like the high street after Woolworths, or the package holiday after Thomas Cook, rail travel will survive the passing of Virgin Trains this weekend; but it will be shaken nonetheless. The great disruptor, as Sir Richard Branson styled his brand, had become part of the furniture after 22 years. It was the first and only firm to run Britain’s main intercity service since privatisation. Now, though, Virgin has been ejected in favour of First Trenitalia, some seven years after rival FirstGroup thought it had won the franchise. Instead, in 2012 Virgin – the champion of competition – cried foul and called the lawyers, and has sat prettily ever since on a string of direct contract awards from a befuddled Department for Transport. The ironies do not stop there. Virgin later proved to have overbid to win the east coast franchise, and its default on payments led to it being taken over by the UK state operator, LNER. And the death of Virgin Trains also marks the end of transport firm Stagecoach’s interests in rail, as it follows National Express back to busland. The founding myths of private rail – of the efficiency and flair that would vanquish British Rail’s curled-up sandwiches and associated public sector failings – are still aired. Yet with the handover of West Coast, as few as 7% of domestic journeys will take place on trains operated entirely by private firms. First’s partner Trenitalia is run by the Italian state, and state-owned firms from Germany, France, the Netherlands and beyond have a hand in virtually all British franchises, bar just two operated by First alone. Virgin and Stagecoach extracted more than £600m in dividends. That is money that Labour argues the taxpayer could keep if services were renationalised – and unless the remaining private operations demonstrate a spectacular improvement, the question might increasingly be: why not? Britain gets wealthier, and more divided Britain has for decades lived off its wealth. In some respects this works for the nation, but in many ways it does not. Last week official figures showed that the nation’s wealth grew to a record high in the two years to 2018, adding to strong gains made in the years since the 2008 financial crash and almost uninterrupted increases ever since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the UK’s wealth equated to three times national annual income (GDP). By 2008, that ratio had risen to 5.5 times and now it stands at seven times GDP. In the 10 years to 2018, typical household incomes have increased by just 6% in real terms, while typical household wealth has gone up by 18%. The best that can be said for our wealth is that it provides an asset from which to borrow money. There has also been a trend for selling ever-inflating assets to fill the 4-5% shortfall in the UK’s balance of payments each year. However, wealth is pernicious in the way it divides communities and rewards those who would profit from buying assets only to milk them for an income while paying a tax at a rate lower than the equivalent income tax. The emphasis on building up wealth and assets – and if possible extracting an income from them – is also a reflection of the low wage rises on offer to those who make their income from work. The situation has improved over the past couple of years, with a spread of wealth to millions of lower-income workers via their occupational pension schemes. The expansion has happened so rapidly that private pension wealth has become the largest component of overall wealth – marginally bigger than property wealth. To some extent this reflects a slight cooling in the housing market, but an extension of wealth to lower-income groups must be welcome.",Oil; Middle East and north Africa; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; World news; Saudi Arabia; Virgin Trains; Environment; Business,Business
2021-05-09T06:00:11Z,Football’s super league fiasco underlines the need for levelling up everywhere,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/09/footballs-super-league-fiasco-underlines-the-need-for-levelling-up-everywhere,"Four weeks on from what is turning out to be one of the biggest self-inflicted errors by any members of the business elite, the owners of the supposedly top six English football clubs must be wondering how on earth they got themselves into this mess. They are also probably, wishfully, thinking: “Head down, this will all blow over.” Among the numerous fascinating aspects of the European Super League debacle, designed to ram through non-competitive staged events for Europe’s top teams, is that it arrived in the UK – England, specifically – at a time when the government is trying to resurrect its domestic mantra of “levelling up” after 14 months of challenges over Covid-19. As a sign of perhaps growing confidence that, at least in the UK, the pandemic is starting to become endemic, No 10 announced the appointment of the MP Neil O’Brien as an adviser on levelling up. From my own deep involvement with the “northern powerhouse”, the related theme of devolution, and much else in this space, it is highly welcome. I doubt that O’Brien would immediately think of the European Super League as something that fell into his territory, but it completely symbolises why the rough edges of globalisation need to be shaved. The idea of an oligopolistic entity being imposed on the top of European football, resulting in even less money cascading down the so-called pyramid of domestic football, is right up there with the worst attempted rigs of any market in the world of business. Of course, in this instance, it was laughable: some of the declared “top” 12 clubs had never won the European Cup or the Champions League, simply serving to underline the stupidity of it. I am not sure I can recall anything quite as blatant as this since I was studying for my PhD and commentators talked at length about the Opec cartel supposedly controlling crude oil supplies. That view never had any legs, due to the emergence of other oil and other energy producers, as well as the behaviour of Saudi Arabia, but the establishment of the organisation in the early 1970s had the same audacity about it. What is so beautiful about this latest colossal error of judgment is that it shines a strong light on the instincts that exist in parts of the business world, despite the staggering pandemic we have gone through, and the catastrophic personal challenges it has created for so many people. As a result, it has induced all sorts of reactions, some of which are not going to be put back in their boxes any time soon. Last weekend saw the enforced postponement of the biggest annual football match in the English calendar: Manchester United v Liverpool. Of course, the violence that occurred in Manchester should not be condoned, but the role of the club’s current owners in the failed Super League has unleashed 16 years of pent-up anger. As Roy Keane, the club’s former captain, said that day, this could be just the beginning. Within three days, the Premier League had issued what for it seemed like a surprisingly tough statement, indicating that an owner’s charter, incorporating a code of conduct and commitment to key principles, would now need to be signed, with significant penalties for failure to comply. Cynics – not surprisingly, given the history of football governance – dismiss this as a crude attempt to pacify the masses and government. But I doubt the other 14 Premier League clubs that had to sit uncomfortably in on that Zoom call would agree; nor do I suspect would the government, given its efforts three weeks ago to hurry through a football governance review. Hopefully that will lead to much-needed reforms, and call for two basic requirements in particular: one, an independent regulator that sets the rules within which each of the English organisations conduct themselves, Premier League included; and two, some kind of legislated move to enforce proper representation of fans’ needs and desires. It certainly would be difficult to introduce the much-discussed German “50+1” common ownership model, and that might not translate to the English game. But the enforcement of proper boards with true independent directors would be an extremely easy step, and a beginning. Whether some of the current owners of the failed breakaway group still see any purpose in owning these precious assets remains to be seen, but unless they have drunk the Kool-Aid of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) and profit with a purpose, I rather doubt it.

2020-02-26T07:47:17Z,Rio Tinto announces $1bn spend to reach net zero emissions by 2050,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/26/rio-tinto-announces-1bn-spend-to-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2050,"Mining giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint. The second biggest miner in the world has also committed to reducing its emissions by 15% by 2030. Rio Tinto’s decision, which follows pressure from investors, puts it in line with Australian business groups and unions and at odds with an Australian government that has devoted itself to attacking the Labor opposition over its commitment to the same net zero target. Its commitment to cut emissions is easier for Rio Tinto than BHP and other big global miners because unlike BHP, it does not mine coal or oil. However, unlike BHP, Rio Tinto has refused to set a target to reduce so-called “scope 3” emissions produced by its customers. Announcing Rio Tinto’s full-year results on Wednesday, the company’s chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations. Chinese steel mills are major Rio Tinto customers, however Jacques said the company’s iron order books were full. “But we are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers,” Jacques said. “We acknowledge that there will be some short-term volatility and uncertainty, but we are very well positioned.” He said Rio Tinto’s new commitments on climate added to a 46% cut in the company’s emissions since 2008, although much of that reduction was due to it selling operations that produce a lot of pollution. To reduce its total emissions by 15% by 2030, every new business opened by Rio Tinto in the next decade will need to be carbon neutral. Jacques said the company was open to buying carbon offsets if necessary but this was a “last port of call”. He said the emissions cut to 2030 would be achieved using existing technology but Rio Tinto would also be investing part of the $1bn on developing new ways of eliminating carbon production. “We have approved around US$100m last week for the Pilbara, I think it would be a good example of things we may look at going forward,” he said. “It’s a 34MW solar photovoltaic plant and a battery system of 12MW per hour storage facility at one of our operations. “By doing this investment … we’ll be able to take out about 90,000 tonnes compared to commercial gas power generation.” This was equivalent to taking 28,000 cars off the road or about 3% of the company’s emissions from the Pilbara, he said. “At the same time we are investing serious money in order to find the technology for the future. We have only a pathway for the next 10 years. If we don’t work today on options beyond the next 10 years, we’ll never get there.” He defended Rio Tinto’s decision not to set scope 3 targets – something rival BHP did in July as part of a $400m program to cut its emissions. “We will not set targets for our customers,” Jaques said. “Having said that, we are looking to partner with our customers and the customers of our customers to look for ways to work together in order to improve emissions across the value chain.” He said examples included a deal the company struck with giant Chinese steel mill and key customer Baosteel in September to reduce emissions from steelmaking and another deal struck with Apple and the government of Quebec two years ago relating to aluminium. “Remember, we are the only large diversified mining and metal company that is not selling either coal, and the carbon associated with coal, or drilling oil and gas and the carbon associated with oil and gas. “So if you step back, if you believe in climate change – and we do believe in climate change – we know we need to have more high quality copper, high quality aluminium, in order to be part of the solution.” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s conservative Coalition government campaigned hard against Labor’s net zero target as part of its re-election strategy at the federal election last May, and in recent weeks has revived its attacks on the opposition over the policy by demanding costings and raising the spectre of soaring energy prices. Asked if Rio Tinto would like the government to commit to net zero by 2050, Jaques said: “I don’t think that would make a massive difference.” “What is absolutely clear is that for us to be able to meet our net carbon target by 2050, there will be a need for new technology. “Any government – so I’d make a broad point – that can provide us with some smart, clever policy to create a pathway, a framework for us to accelerate our development in that space, would be more than welcome.” Andrew Gray, the head of environmental, social and governance issues at Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $175bn AustralianSuper, said Rio Tinto’s move followed pressure from investor group Climate Action 100+. “These are issues that AustralianSuper as a lead investor has been engaging with Rio on for more than two years as part of the Climate Action 100+ initiative,” he said. “We look forward to continuing to engage with Rio to fulfil these commitments.” The company declared a profit after tax for 2019 of US$7bn, down from US$13.9bn the previous year.",Climate crisis; Business; Mining; Mining; Business; Environment; Australia news,Environment
2019-10-12T11:00:19Z,World's top three asset managers oversee $300bn fossil fuel investments,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/top-three-asset-managers-fossil-fuel-investments,"The world’s three largest money managers have built a combined $300bn fossil fuel investment portfolio using money from people’s private savings and pension contributions, the Guardian can reveal. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, which together oversee assets worth more than China’s entire GDP, have continued to grow billion-dollar stakes in some of the most carbon-intensive companies since the Paris agreement, financial data shows. The two largest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard, have also routinely opposed motions at fossil fuel companies that would have forced directors to take more action on climate change, the analysis reveals. The investment rise is driven by the success in the last decade of tracker funds that use algorithms to follow major stock exchange indices such as the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500. The Guardian has worked with the thinktank InfluenceMap and the business data specialists ProxyInsight to analyse the role played by asset managers in the financing and management of some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies. Figures compiled by InfluenceMap show how Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street – known as the big three – have become crucial climate actors in the financial world. They are the largest money managers in the $74tn industry. According to an analysis of the data, their effective thermal coal, oil and gas reserve holdings through the companies they manage have surged 34.8% since 2016. This means they are now the largest investors in public oil, gas and coal companies, managing funds for large pension funds, university endowments and insurance companies. While asset managers do not own the companies in which they invest, they often exercise shareholders rights on behalf of clients to vote on board members and company policy issues. Disclosures for publicly available company reports show that from 2015 to 2019 Vanguard and BlackRock used their votes to frequently oppose efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures. The investigation by the Guardian has found: Vanguard ($161.1bn), BlackRock ($87.3bn) and State Street ($38.3bn) oversee a combined $286.7bn of shares in oil, coal and gas companies through 1,712 funds. Their total combined portfolio is likely to be higher as the calculation excludes direct holdings and non-listed fund holdings. The potential CO2 emissions from the investments have increased from 10.593 gigatonnes (Gt) to 14.283Gt since the Paris agreement, equivalent to 38% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions last year. BlackRock and Vanguard opposed or abstained on more than 80% of climate-related motions at FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 fossil fuel companies between 2015 and 2019, according to data provided by ProxyInsight. The big three are among a number of asset managers that offer “climate-friendly” and “sustainable” investment funds that have substantial holdings in fossil fuel companies. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street did not challenge the findings. They told the Guardian they prioritised private engagements with company boards, where the climate crisis was regularly discussed. They said they had increased the size of their teams responsible for investment stewardship, opting to use their votes as a final resort. Vanguard said it neither managed the companies in which it invested nor sought to influence their business strategy. “As a steward of lifetime savings for more than 20 million people around the world, and a practically permanent investor in more than 10,000 companies, Vanguard is concerned about the long-term impact of climate risk,” a spokesman said. “While voting at shareholder meetings is important … it is only one part of the larger corporate governance process. We regularly engage with companies on our shareholders’ behalf and believe that engagement and broader advocacy, in addition to voting, can effect meaningful changes that generate long-term value for all shareholders.” BlackRock said it “offers investors a wide range of environmentally sustainable investment options … [and] is also a leading investor in renewable power generation globally. Our award-winning climate research helps investors understand and mitigate the impact of climate change on their portfolios.” State Street said: “If an investor wants to buy an ETF [exchange-traded fund] that tracks the FTSE 100, we would purchase the shares (proportionately) of all the companies in that FTSE 100 index in order to meet the objective of that strategy. That will today undoubtedly include energy companies. “We do not proactively determine whether to exclude a particular company or sector since it would be inconsistent with the stated ETF objective. If an investor did want a strategy that considered climate issues or other ESG [environmental, social and governance] factors, that would be a different product with a different index; we can provide that too.” Asset managers are increasingly finding themselves at the heart of social and environmental issues, and corporate governance experts have raised concerns about conflicts of interest in their business models. Campaigners are demanding asset managers vote out company directors who are not deemed to be taking sufficient action. In June, the London-based Legal &amp; General, formerly a top 20 investor in ExxonMobil, announced it was selling a $300m stake in the company and would use remaining shares to vote against the chief executive, Darren Woods. But environmental shareholder proposals face increasing challenges from the management of fossil fuel companies, which are being sustained by the American regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC declined to comment. In April, ExxonMobil shareholders were denied a vote on whether the company should set targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the SEC, which called the proposal an attempt to “micromanage” the company. Data for the 2019 season of annual general meetings for shareholders, provided by Institutional Shareholder Services, shows that only a quarter of proposals made it to a vote at companies in the US, with 79 of the 105 motions either withdrawn or omitted. Despite setbacks, other proposals and engagements by asset managers have been more successful. In an industry first last year, intense pressure from shareholders forced Royal Dutch Shell to set carbon emission targets linked to executive pay. The decision was backed by Climate Action 100+, a group of $35tn investors who are pushing fossil fuel companies to react to the crisis. Many pension funds and asset managers support schemes to improve information about how climate-critical companies are responding to environmental concerns, including the Transition Pathway Initiative, which grades the boards of fossil fuel, energy and transport companies on their response. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are supporters of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, a voluntary scheme chaired by the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to improve information.",Fossil fuels; Oil and gas companies; Business; Energy; Energy industry; Environment; Corporate governance,Environment
2019-07-11T06:00:58Z,Millions in US taxpayers’ money invested in private prison firms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/11/private-prison-firms-profiting-trump-immigration-policy,"Millions of US taxpayer dollars are being invested into private prison operators involved in the detention of thousands of migrants across the United States, an investigation shows. Some of the largest investments, which are by pension funds for public sector workers such as teachers and firefighters, come from states with “sanctuary” policies, such as New York, California and Oregon. Nationwide, at least 20 pension funds and plans have invested in Geo Group or CoreCivic, the two biggest private prison operators, according to a Guardian/Documented analysis of US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. These funds range from big organizations like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPers), which manages $81bn in stock holdings, to the more modestly sized funds like the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, which manages about $2.3bn. Public worker funds across the US have at least $67m currently invested in the two companies, according to filings from the first quarter of 2019, which probably show just a portion of the total amount of public sector pension money invested in both companies. The two firms have become more attractive to investors after Donald Trump became president, pushing tougher immigration policies. The firms have secured contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) which has turned to private operators as it has detained growing numbers of immigrants. ‘Complicity is unacceptable’ While the holdings in the SEC filings are only a tiny proportion of the estimated $3.8tn invested in public retirement funds, immigration advocacy campaigners and some lawmakers say they have a symbolic power, and have called for public pensions funds to follow the lead of some banks and disinvest. Last week it emerged one of Canada’s biggest pension funds quietly divested from the two firms after the Guardian/Documented had reported late last year that the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) held nearly US$8m in stock in Geo Group and CoreCivic. Disinvestment in private prison operators sent a powerful message, according to Daniel Altschuler, director of civic engagement and research at Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy organization. “Taking a stand sends a message that complicity with companies that are profiting from people’s pain is unacceptable,” said Altschuler.This is a message some major banks have been getting, he added. “As some cities and states either divest or look at divestment, the banks have been aware of that.” In March, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co decided to stop financing private prison companies. They had previously underwritten bonds and syndicated loans for Geo Group and CoreCivic. Earlier this week SunTrust Bank announced it would be ceasing to do business with the private prison industry. Last month Bank of America did the same. The Miami Herald reported that the bank had provided Caliburn, the operator of a Florida facility where roughly 2,300 migrant children are held, with a loan of $380m and a $75m credit line. The bank said that it decided to cease doing business with prison operators, in part due to “the concerns of our employees and stakeholders in the communities we serve”, a Bank of America spokesperson told CNN. Private prison operators boom in Trump era Towards the end of Barack Obama’s second term, the justice department (DoJ) decided to discontinue all use of private prison corporations to house American prisoners and immigrant detainees. The stock for Geo Group and CoreCivic immediately plummeted more than 30% each. But shortly after Trump was sworn in, he discontinued the DoJ policy and the stock of both companies slowly started climbing again. Between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2018, as the administration began to ramp up its crackdown on immigrants, the targeted average daily population of detained immigrants grew 50%. Since 1 January 2017, Geo Group has won agency contracts worth over $390m, according to data from USA Spending, the federal government’s spending tracker. CoreCivic received over $228m in the same timeframe. Biggest investments from New York and California According to the SEC data, the largest investments into both companies come from the New York Teachers Retirement System, which has a total investment of $9.5m, and CalPers, which has an investment of $9.5m into the companies. Other states with immigrant-friendly policies and investments in the two companies include Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. The state board of administration of the Florida Retirement System reported about $3.8m in the first quarter of 2019. In a response to questions, John Kuczwanski, manager of external affairs for the fund, said they had more than $16m invested in the two companies, actively and passively. About half of the 20 pension funds responded to a request for comment on their holdings. Most of them said they made their investments through following indices created by financial research firms like S&amp;P. Some had portions of their money managed by external firms. Some funds said environmental social and corporate governance (ESG) principles informed investments; several said they had no ESG guidelines. In a statement, the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System (NYSTRS) said their holdings in the two firms are “primarily passively held in portfolios that track a broad market index. NYSTRS is mindful of balancing fiduciary duties with environmental, social and governance concerns in investing. Where appropriate, and on a case by case basis, we express our views on ESG through our proxy voting program. “For example, there was a recent Geo Group shareholder proposal calling for the publication of an annual human rights report. NYSTRS voted for this proposal.” CalPers said: “CalPers global equity portfolio is comprised of more than 10,000 companies from across the globe, and is largely managed through an index-oriented investment strategy. For more information on CalPers’ investment strategies, see our policies page … [and] our CalPers governance and sustainability principles.” The Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund grew its investment over 45% from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2019, from about $1.4m to about $2m. Arizona’s state retirement fund its investment grew 44%. Best returns Some funds said maximising returns was their focus, not social concerns. “We’re not a social investor. We want to get the best return while managing risk,” said Beau Barnes, deputy executive secretary and general counsel at the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement System. A representative from Pennsylvania’s Public School Employees’ Retirement System said that fund does not have ESG principles either, and only follows a state law that forbids them from investing in companies with ties to Sudan and Iran. “Our statues generally prohibit prioritization of social investing considerations over maximization of long-term risk-adjusted returns,” said Matt Clark of the South Dakota Investment Council. While Geo Group has maintained a relatively stable price, CoreCivic has plummeted from about $30 to $19 in three years. The median growth in investment over the course of the Trump administration was 14%. Collectively, these 20 public sector funds manage more than $319bn, of which just 0.02% is invested in those two private prison companies. Calls to divest Some public pensions have been resistant to calls to divest. After a hard-fought campaign spearheaded by a group of advocates called Educators for Migrant Justice, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System into divested the fund’s holdings from CoreCivic in November 2018 and Geo Group, which amounted to about $12m. Now, advocates are focusing on CalPers. “We’re starting to see traction with board members,” said Emily Claire Goldman, founder and director for Educators for Migrant Justice, an ESG transparency initiative. Goldman explained that the pension fund industry has started increasingly using private equity as an investment vehicle, which she said “is a complete black box”. CoreCivic and Geo Group say they follow the government’s guidelines for detention practices and routinely pass inspection. “Geo’s facilities are highly rated by independent accreditation entities … and provide high-quality services in safe, secure and humane residential environments,” the company said in a statement. • This article is co-published with Documented, a news website/daily newsletter that covers immigration news in New York City and beyond.",US immigration; US news; US prisons,US news
2020-01-22T17:17:24Z,"Reshape economy to fight climate crisis, says Prince Charles",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/22/reshape-economy-to-fight-climate-crisis-charles-tells-davos,"The Prince of Wales has urged business and political leaders at Davos to embrace a radical reshaping of economies and markets in order to tackle the climate crisis. In a special address at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Charles outlined a 10-point plan to help the global economy become more sustainable including the imposition of green taxes and investing in environmentally friendly technologies. He argued that taxes, regulations and policies could all be changed, as part of a drive to reverse environmentally damaging subsidies such as financial assistance for the fossil fuel industry. He also cited the “polluter pays” principle that requires those who create environmental damage to pay for the clean-up. “In order to secure our future and prosper, we need to evolve our economic model,” the Prince told an audience of politicians and business and civic leaders at Davos. “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance, when we could have done?” Charles, who is supported financially by the £1bn Duchy of Cornwall, made a direct challenge to some of the world’s wealthiest people gathered at the Swiss ski resort to think about more than money. “What good is all the extra wealth in the world gained from business as usual if you can do nothing with it except watch it burn in catastrophic conditions?” he said. Charles, who also met the climate activist Greta Thunberg at the summit, urged the private sector to use its ingenuity and practical skills to help lead the world out of a climate calamity. “The only limit is our willingness to act and the time to act is now.” The prince was speaking after launching an initiative, the Sustainable Markets Initiative and Council. His 10 proposals included the rapid decarbonisation of businesses, driving investment in new environmentally friendly technologies and helping consumers to make sustainable choices. Climate change, biodiversity loss and global warming are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced, he warned, adding that capital needs to be properly deployed in order to tackle these threats. The prince said global consumers could make markets sustainable, but could not make sustainable choices if these options were not clearly laid before them. Charles also warned that being socially and environmentally conscious cannot be an option for wealthier people only. Markets needed to change, so that prices actually reflected the environmental as well as economic costs. “If all the true costs are taken into account, being socially and environmentally responsible should be the least expensive option because it leaves the smallest footprint behind,” he argued, implicitly calling for subsidies and tax changes. Charles’s intervention comes nearly 30 years after he last spoke at the World Economic Forum, when he had already begun campaigning on environmental issues and corporate responsibility. He joked on Wednesday that it had been “an uphill struggle” trying to generate support but he believed the world was now at a turning point. The Prince of Wales arrived in an electric car – rather than the helicopter option favoured by some, such as Donald Trump. However, he reportedly travelled to Switzerland by private jet, a reminder of the gap between the goals outlined at the forum this week and the global elite’s behaviour. Environmental issues and the climate emergency have taken centre stage at Davos this year, with a stream of business leaders and politicians expressing concerns and signing up to initiatives to promote sustainability and climate action. But the meeting also exposed the split between the US and Europe on the issue, with Trump attacking “prophets of doom” in a speech heavily criticised by environmentalists. Prince Charles’s 10-point plan for a sustainable economy 1) Put nature and the protection of nature’s capital at the heart of operations. 2) Create responsible pathways to decarbonise to reach net zero, and for governments and businesses to set a clear plan for how they will decarbonise. 3) Reimagine industries through the lens of sustainable markets. 4) Identify game-changing technologies that can speed up the creation of a sustainable economy and eliminate barriers to change. 5) Remove subsidies that prevent the economy becoming more sustainable, and set taxes, policies and regulations in a way that catalyses sustainable markets. 6) Invest in science, technology, engineering and maths skills, and in research and development, to help bring emerging technologies to market. 7) Invest in nature as an economic driver of growth. 8) Agree unified metrics for measuring environmental, social and governance standards, to provide transparency to company’s supply chains. 9) Make it easier for consumers to see which products are ethical and sustainable. 10) Realign investing so it can support sustainability. This would direct trillions of pounds in pension funds, sovereign wealth funds into environmentally responsible projects that offer long-term value and rate of return.",Davos 2020; Davos; Business; Environment; Climate crisis; Green economy; Economic policy; Politics; UK news; King Charles III; Monarchy; Greta Thunberg,Business
2021-06-21T06:00:44Z,The pandemic has revived hope that a more sustainable world is possible | Jeremy Caradonna,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/21/the-pandemic-has-revived-hope-that-a-more-sustainable-world-is-possible,"Some of the most striking images from the early days of the pandemic, when public health orders and lockdowns ground economies to a halt, were the arresting photos of the Himalayas, suddenly visible from across northern India, as decades of unrelenting smog finally abated. Unbelievably, some locals glimpsed the immense mountain range for the first time in their lives. It’s never too late to clear things up. And the pandemic has revived a movement that has its roots in the 18th century, when the word “sustainability” was first coined (in German) to describe a new approach to forestry enabling a continual harvest of wood. It’s a movement widely believed to have entered the mainstream with the 1987 Our Common Future report – a UN-backed initiative, overseen by Norway’s then prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, which laid out an ambitious pathway towards a “sustainable economy”. This left us with the enduringly relevant definition of sustainability as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. Historians of the future will see the last year as a major turning point in world history, and perhaps even the dawn of a new era. The enforced economic slowdown of the pandemic, which inadvertently drove down emissions and induced simple living (gardening, sour dough, local hiking!), provides new momentum for recalibrating cultural values and changing the very trajectory of our globalised industrial society. In many ways, sustainability has been a success story. It has driven an unprecedented increase in renewable energy, revived local and organic food markets, led to the start of the phasing out of single-use plastics, catalysed circular economy systems and sparked an unprecedented normalisation and institutionalisation of sustainability within governments, NGOs, corporations and universities, making many organisations less wasteful, more energy-efficient and more committed to the “triple bottom line”, which means weighing equally social, environmental and financial wellbeing. The rise of theories such as Kate Raworth’s “doughnut economics”, adopted by the city of Amsterdam, offer exciting new ways for such ideas to be further adapted. Moreover, sustainability has had an enormous impact on consumer behaviour, driving sales in everything from shade-grown coffee, environmentally friendly bath products and Fair Trade chocolate, to investor decisions. So-called ESG investments (ones that support environment, social wellbeing and good governance) captured $51.1bn of net new money from investors in 2020. Increasingly, consumers want to see their values reflected in their spending and investing habits. On balance, however, the sustainability movement has failed to solve the most pressing social, economic and environmental challenge of the day – climate change, and the fossil-fuelled economic growth that sits as its principal driver. Hence the increasing urgency from activists and climate scientists alike. The Paris climate agreement of 2016 was certainly a win for sustainability, but it took far too long to get all of the world’s countries on the same page. Sustainability wasn’t mainstream, or widely seen as a priority, until around 2000. Before that the pressure to act on sustainability came largely from specialised interest groups, including climate scientists, energy specialists, some policymakers, ecological economists and simple living advocates who had been inspired by environmentalism. As a result, the major milestones in the history of sustainability are largely institutional, methodological and top-down in nature – the 1987 Montreal protocol that banned ozone-depleting substances, the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988, the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, among others. These milestones have had beneficial impacts, but they did not result in the systemic transformations that was their original intent. As 2030 climate targets bear down upon us, our inability to solve the major crisis of our age serves as a potent reminder of why much of the pandemic-era slowdown must, in some form, remain. The smartest jurisdictions figured out how to advance sustainability during the pandemic and make the most of the precipitous decline in traffic congestion. Cities from Milan to Mexico City and Mumbai took tangible steps to advance active transportation, build new bike lanes and create “the 15-minute city”. A realistic goal will be for communities to come together and decide cooperatively on a new, sustainable, low-impact vision for the future that would undoubtedly include more robust healthcare, emergency and basic support systems. In a survey, around two thirds of Europeans said they did not want to return to pre-pandemic levels of air pollution. That dream will become a reality only with a concerted effort. It is no longer heretical to observe that economic growth will not, and cannot, solve our climate crisis. From spring 2020 until the early months of 2021, absolute emissions worldwide decreased for the first time in decades, by an average of 26%. Sadly, the early signs from 2021 suggest that emissions are already bouncing back. The economic downturn of 2008 slowed emissions growth, but we haven’t witnessed an absolute dip since the USSR broke apart, creating a temporary slowdown in the world economy. It is now time to face this elephant in the room – that more growth means more emissions. We, of the wealthy global north, must find ways to create prosperity without aggregate economic growth. Promise comes, too, from the energy sector, where peak oil seems finally to have occurred, thanks in part to the pandemic. Demand for oil fell by 9% in 2020, and although it’s already rebounding, it is clear that we’re witnessing the global plateauing of fossil fuel demand. What a post-fossil fuel economy will looks like is anyone’s guess, but one clear takeaway from the pandemic is that we cannot return to self-centred and worry-free air travel. People need to stop flying, or at the very least, to fly far less often, and only out of absolute necessity – as in the case of a death in the family. Happily, we finally have the fossil fuel companies against the wall. Shell was recently ordered to limit emissions in a historic court case, and both ExxonMobil and Chevron recently had shareholder revolts over climate concerns. The divestment movement grows daily. With sustained pressure, we will see a near-complete receding of fossil fuel consumption over the next two decades, even if China stubbornly drags its feet. As we look ahead to the After Times of the pandemic, we can mitigate our collective trauma by making meaning from the suffering we’ve endured and by reviving a flagging sustainability movement. Let us learn to normalise and enjoy the low-carbon, low-cost, simple pleasures that truly sustain us.

2021-06-04T07:23:02Z,Pat Dodson attacks ex-WA Aboriginal affairs minister for joining Rio Tinto board,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/04/pat-dodson-attacks-ex-wa-aboriginal-affairs-minister-for-joining-rio-tinto-board,"The Labor senator Pat Dodson has launched a scathing attack on the former Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt for joining the board of the mining giant Rio Tinto, saying it showed “poor judgment” and would “do nothing” to restore Rio’s reputation after the Juukan Gorge disaster. Wyatt, a Yamatji man, was the Aboriginal affairs minister and treasurer in WA from 2017 to March this year when he retired from parliament. The state Labor minister was responsible for approving applications to destroy Aboriginal heritage – the same mechanism under which Rio received approval from a previous minister to destroy Juukan Gorge. Rio blasted the 46,000-year-old heritage site in May 2020, resulting in the departure of its chief executive, two senior executives and two board members, including the chairman. Wyatt will take up the non-executive director position vacated by Michael L’Estrange, who wrote the company’s internal review of the Juukan Gorge disaster in a process the academic Marcia Langton called “inadequate” and lacking transparency. The former state minister was also responsible for drafting WA’s new Aboriginal heritage laws, which are due to be introduced to parliament this year. The laws remove the contentious section 18 under which Juukan Gorge was destroyed but still allow the minister final say. “Having left high office in the WA Labor government, Mr Ben Wyatt is entitled to pursue new career pathways,” Dodson said on Friday. “But his decision to join the board of Rio Tinto shows poor judgment and makes a mockery of the WA government’s ministerial code of conduct, which says ministers should exercise care in taking up employment immediately after leaving government.” Rio Tinto said Wyatt would join the board as a non-executive director in September. The announcement comes less than three months after Wyatt left politics and days after he announced he would join the board of Woodside Petroleum. “Mr Wyatt’s appointment will bring no credit to Rio Tinto and will do nothing to restore its reputation after the Juukan Gorge disaster,” Dodson said. “The company inherits the legacy of Mr Wyatt’s ministerial role in having approved harm to sacred sites under section 18 of the existing Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act. Rio Tinto may think it’s bought respectability by appointing Mr Wyatt, but Aboriginal people – especially those whose sacred sites are endangered by mining – will rightly be sceptical.” Wyatt declined to respond directly to Dodson’s criticism. But he told the ABC his appointment was a “win” which would increase pressure on other corporations to appoint Aboriginal people to their boards. “Me going on a board, whether it’s now or 12 months from now, I suspect I would have copped the same critique,” he said. “But I often put this to those critiquing: if I had gone on the board of an organisation that puts photovoltaic cells on roofs I suspect I wouldn’t have got a similar critique, I suspect that there’s bias against some of the mining companies.” Wyatt said it was “in the interests of every Australian” for Rio to get back to a position of leadership in the industry and reconnect with the Pilbara. “One of the biggest employers of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara is Rio Tinto, so I want it to be successful. It is not going anywhere but we need to recalibrate its relationships back with those key relationships.” Friday’s news comes after the two major explosives companies operating in WA, Dyno Nobel and Orica, granted their employees the right to refuse to undertake works they believed would pose an “unacceptable risk” to Indigenous cultural heritage. Wyatt had campaigned to reform the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act while in office but approved applications for mining companies to destroy heritage as recently as February. He released draft heritage laws for comment last year but did not support a moratorium on approving any applications to destroy or damage heritage until the new laws are passed. At the time, Wyatt argued that a moratorium was “not a practical solution in light of their use across a vast array of different projects most of which are uncontentious”. He has also written publicly opposing the introduction of a veto power, which was recommended by a federal parliamentary inquiry, saying that would undermine the ability of traditional owners and mining companies to negotiate. Dodson, a member of the inquiry committee, said Wyatt had supervised the drafting of heritage protection laws “which, although they are yet to be enacted, have been criticised as too weak – in particular because they don’t give traditional owners a right to veto destruction of their sacred sites”. But the chairman of the inquiry, the Queensland Liberal National MP Warren Entsch, said Wyatt had a chance to guide Rio Tinto towards “positive change”. “He certainly has had criticism that he deserves, but at the end of the day, I think he will very much learn from what happened there,” Entsch said. “He is in an excellent position, from his political contacts, and working with Rio, to make sure he can be the one spearheading the changes that are necessary to avoid it happening again.” Rio’s chairman, Simon Thompson, said he was delighted by the appointment. “With family links to the Pilbara and an impressive track record in public life, Ben’s knowledge of public policy, finance, international trade and Indigenous affairs will significantly add to the depth of knowledge on the board at a time when we are seeking to strengthen relationships with key stakeholders in Australia and around the world.” Brynn O’Brien, the executive director of the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said Wyatt’s experience made him an “attractive candidate” but would raise questions about political influence. “Given Woodside and Rio Tinto face enormous challenges in bringing their Western Australian operations into line with community expectations and ESG standards, it is fair to be concerned about their political influence,” she said. “From that perspective, the appointment of a very recently retired WA government minister who had responsibility for key portfolios should raise eyebrows about the revolving door between government and industry.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people who are the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge.",Indigenous Australians; Rio Tinto; Mining; Australia news; Woodside,Australia news
2021-07-05T20:45:28Z,"Morning mail: aged care vaccination blitz urged, PM’s approval drops, Ash Barty at Wimbledon",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jul/06/morning-mail-aged-care-vaccination-blitz-urged-pms-approval-drops-ash-barty-at-wimbledon,"Good morning. Leaders will gather today for the first “war game” meeting of Operation Covid Shield, the federal government’s revamped vaccine rollout strategy. And Australian tennis champion Ash Barty is dominating Wimbledon. The federal government should fund a state government-operated vaccination blitz of aged care workers, according to the main nursing union, who say it is “enormously frustrated” and “angry” at the commonwealth’s repeated failures, lack of urgency and blame-shifting. Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) federal secretary Annie Butler wants the federal government to fund the program that would vaccinate staff in their workplaces as initially intended. “It makes sense to us to fund the states and let them manage an on-site vaccination program for aged care, and then we can get it done,” she says. It comes as more than 600 NSW health workers have been forced to isolate after being deemed close contacts of an unvaccinated student nurse who worked across two Sydney hospitals while infectious with Covid, wreaking havoc on staffing levels. New South Wales confirmed 35 new Covid cases on Monday. The race to obtain Covid vaccine supply has been likened to The Hunger Games as Australia’s rollout continues to lag behind similar nations, with just 7.2% of the population fully vaccinated. Australia’s peak Aboriginal health group has urged leaders at today’s Covid Shield meeting to speed up the vaccine rollout to prioritise Aboriginal remote communities. England looks set to become “the most unrestricted society in Europe” from 19 July, with Boris Johnson expected to revoke hundreds of Covid regulations, despite saying new cases could soar to 50,000 a day before masks and social distancing are ditched. The announcement comes as Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, self-isolates after contact with someone who later tested positive after returning from Wimbledon on Friday afternoon. Speaking of Wimbledon, Ash Barty has secured a spot in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the first time after defeating French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova 7-5, 6-3. Trailing the Czech 4-2 in the first set and within a point of going 5-2 down, Barty steadied the ship and started to attack, taking the game to Krejcikova. “Probably for the first 15 or 20 minutes, I felt like I was really struggling to pick up her ball off her racket. I wasn’t able to give myself a chance to get into games, plain and simple. Once I was able to do that, getting a break back instantly at 4-3 to level things out was a good game,” Barty said. Australia The Coalition’s commuter car park fund paid $115,000 a space, almost double the benchmark price, for a project in Melbourne. Parking Australia’s Stuart Norman said he could not see “any logical reason” why the project should cost so much.

Catholic doctors are being urged to support George Christensen’s “nonsensical” abortion bill. Medical professionals have been offered anonymity if they choose to support the bill, but critics say patients have a right to know if their provider supported the bill. Australia’s export credit agency, Export Finance Australia, provided 80 times more in finance to fossil fuel projects than renewables between 2009 and 2020. A new report found up to $1.69bn in financing went to coal, oil and gas projects compared with $20m for renewable projects. The Victorian Nationals will push for a bolder position on climate change at the party’s next federal council, while exploring the “ramifications” of cutting ties with the federal party in protest at the return of Barnaby Joyce as leader. Aboriginal traditional owners have told mining giant Rio Tinto they will no longer do “welcome to country” for Rio related events, and are refusing to meet with the company until it demonstrates it is “serious” about modernising its agreements with them. The world Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been personally implicated in an alleged corruption racket. The allegations suggested Bolsonaro, already accused of mishandling Covid, was involved in embezzlement scheme during his almost 30 years as a lawmaker in the lower house of congress. Gunmen have kidnapped 140 children from a boarding school in north-western Nigeria, the latest in a wave of mass abductions targeting schoolchildren and students.

2020-07-28T06:30:15Z,Investors drop Brazil meat giant JBS,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/28/investors-drop-brazil-meat-giant-jbs,"The investment arm of northern Europe’s largest financial services group has dropped JBS, the world’s biggest meat processer, from its portfolio. The Brazilian company is now excluded from assets sold by Nordea Asset Management, which controls a €230bn (£210bn) fund, according to Eric Pedersen, its head of responsible investments. The decision was taken about a month ago, over the meat giant’s links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation, its response to the Covid-19 outbreak, past corruption scandals, and frustrations over engagement with the company on such issues. “The exclusion of JBS is quite dramatic for us because it is from all of our funds, not just the ones labelled ESG,” Pedersen said. ESG stands for the “environmental, social and governmental” standards used to evaluate a company’s sustainability and societal impact for investors. A third of Nordea Asset Management’s investments are classified as ESG, Pedersen said. Nordea was one of 29 international financial institutions managing $3.7tn (£2.9tn) worth of funds that warned the Brazilian government last month over rising deforestation. Last year, Nordea suspended the purchase of Brazilian government bonds after the Amazon fires crisis. Over the past year alone, five exposés by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Brazilian agency Réporter Brasil, Greenpeace and Amnesty International, have linked JBS to cattle supplied by Amazon farms involved in deforestation. Although the company has made advances in controlling its “direct suppliers” – the farms from which its slaughterhouses source cattle – it is unable to control its “indirect suppliers”. These are farms breeding or rearing cattle that sell on to farms that in turn supply JBS slaughterhouses. In some cases, the “clean farms” have links to “dirty farms” – or are even run by the same people, as in the latest case revealed on Monday. JBS and Brazil’s other large-scale meat producers Minerva and Marfrig have been subject to controversy over their Amazon cattle sourcing for more than a decade. In 2009, after a devastating Greenpeace report, JBS, Marfrig, Minerva and other companies committed to stop buying from any direct suppliers involved in deforestation. Within two years, they promised to verify that their indirect suppliers were not involved in deforestation, either – but that promise has yet to be fulfilled. That same year JBS, Minerva and Marfrig signed similar deals with federal prosecutors. In 2017, JBS was fined $7.7m by government environment agency Ibama for buying over 49,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas in the Amazon state of Pará – some from indirect suppliers. As a result, Greenpeace walked out of the deal, but the agreement with federal prosecutors still stands. In July 2019, an investigation published by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Réporter Brasil found that JBS slaughterhouses in the same state had bought cattle from farms owned by AgroSB Agropecuária SA, a powerful ranching company. Those farms had been supplied with cattle from another ranch owned by the same company – a ranch with a long history of fines and land embargoes for deforestation. AgroSB said the deforestation had occurred before it bought the land in 2008. JBS said it did not buy cattle from land that had been illegally deforested or embargoed against use for ranching and that its own 2018 independent audit showed that more than 99.9% of its purchases met the terms of the Greenpeace deal. It did not say that its independent audit recognised the company was unable to audit its indirect suppliers. And earlier this year a Réporter Brasil investigation published by the Guardian linked the company to a farmer whose farm, according to satellite images, had seen extensive deforestation in 2015. A sawmill the farmer had owned in another location also had a long list of fines. A court recently dropped charges against him in another case involving the massacre of nine men. JBS reiterated its previous position that it did not buy cattle from farms involved in deforestation, invasion of indigenous reserves, rural conflicts or land conflicts, and denied the farmer had ever been a supplier. The company said it monitored more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day and had blocked more than 8,000 due to non-compliance. It told the Guardian: “Full traceability of our supply chain including workable solutions to monitor indirect supply remains a top priority. New initiatives have been proposed and are being examined with stakeholders on top of the substantial policies that have already been implemented.” On 1 July it introduced a new “theoretical index” that uses a farm’s productivity to calculate if it is suspected of cattle laundering and now checks supplier farms for Ibama embargoes. It has also said it is working on a “green” version of cattle movement records with Brazil’s agriculture ministry that would show the environmental status of supplying farms. The company has said it has been discussing the scheme with the ministry since 2014. Marfrig repeated its previous statements and said it was “fully aware of the challenges related to the livestock production chain”, highlighting its mechanism under which farmers supply information on their suppliers. It said 53% of its Amazon cattle came from indirect suppliers. Minerva said its Amazon cattle purchases were “100% made in monitored farms” but that it was not possible to fully track Amazon cattle movements without full access to government data, which it does not have. In June this year a Greenpeace investigation reported by the Guardian found JBS, Marfrig and Minerva had bought cattle from a farm that sourced cattle from another farm inside a protected reserve in Mato Grosso state co-owned by the same owner – who had been charged with environmental crimes. According to a 2017 Observer report, JBS had said it had blocked purchases from farms inside the reserve. This month, Amnesty International, with Réporter Brasil, revealed that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas of the Amazon state of Rondônia had entered the JBS supply chain. JBS says the company “is fully committed to achieving a deforestation-free beef supply chain and avoiding irregular suppliers. We acknowledge that indirect supplier traceability remains a system level issue in Brazil and are working with governmental and cross-industry stakeholders to find workable solutions. We urge anyone with evidence of malpractice to report it to the appropriate authorities. We also operate a company whistleblowing hotline for any employee to contact if they see or suspect irregularities.” But Pedersen said scandals such as these, and JBS’s response to them, influenced Nordea’s decision to exclude the company from its portfolio. “We’ve had several meetings with them in Brazil and regular updates by phone and video and we’ve not been impressed with the level of commitment we could see from their side,” he said. “If we don’t see progress, we have to take that step.” Sustainability is increasingly important not just for ESG investments, Pedersen said, but for standard products, too. “We are also engaging with Minerva and of course Marfrig,” he said. “The bar keeps rising.” JBS told the Guardian that it does not comment on dialogue with its shareholders. On 23 July, Marfrig launched its own ambitious plan to monitor all indirect suppliers in the Amazon by 2025 and Brazil’s Cerrado savanna region by 2030, using chips in cattle, satellite monitoring, blockchain and risk maps, as well as schemes to help farmers previously involved in deforestation produce sustainably. “The details are lacking of when it will start, what is the target per year, what system will be used,” said Daniel Azeredo, the federal prosecutor involved in the 2009 deals with the meat companies, but he stressed: “It’s a positive plan.” Adriana Charoux, Greenpeace Brazil’s senior forest campaigner, said the company’s deadlines were too long. “Marfrig knew the roots of this problem in 2009,” she said. Minerva said that in July it began testing Visipec, a cloud-based, tracing tool developed by the University of Wisconsin and the US National Wildlife Federation. It said it monitors over 9,000 suppliers in the Amazon, but said “currently there are no data and accessible statistics … to determine the number of indirect suppliers in Brazil.”",Deforestation; Environment; Brazil; Meat; Meat industry; Americas; Farming; Food; Food; World news; Business; Trees and forests; Europe; Investments; Investment funds; Financial sector; Food & drink industry; Ethical business,Environment
2019-08-27T21:00:23Z,Justin Welby: investors must pressure firms to act on climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/27/justin-welby-investors-must-pressure-firms-act-climate-crisis,"The archbishop of Canterbury has criticised the investment industry for inaction over the climate crisis and called on fund managers to push companies to reduce their impact on the environment. Justin Welby said fund managers had “not sufficiently stepped up to the plate” to use their ownership of companies to press for change. He said investors should tell firms to help meet targets set by the Paris climate agreement. Welby said: “The situation we find ourselves in has rightly been called a climate emergency. We know it’s unquestionable that investors acting together can influence outcomes on everything, including climate change. “It is in investors’ power to help avert the disastrous consequences – ethical and financial – of failing to achieve the Paris goals.” Welby’s words are his most direct criticism of the fund management industry over the climate emergency. He has argued before that concern over global heating would shake up investment and has encouraged investors to drive change. He made his latest comments in support of a Global Ethical Finance Initiative summit next month in Edinburgh on how to make finance work better for people and the planet. Welby said: “Money is not morally neutral – it can do harm and it can do good. At the very least it is the responsibility of investors to take account of environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions and in their stewardship of their assets.” Oil companies, miners, airlines and carmakers are among companies facing increasing criticism over their responsibility for carbon emissions that contribute to global heating. The biggest companies in the US recently conceded they should take responsibility for the environment, worker welfare and ethical dealing as well as making money. The archbishop said funds that track indexes such as the FTSE 100 rather than picking individual shares needed to exert more pressure on companies over the climate crisis. Welby said: “Passive investment … may be the right investment solution for many, but passive stewardship is the answer for no one. All investors can make a difference by engaging and voting determinably in support of the Paris agreement.” BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management company, has defended its lack of action on the climate emergency by saying most of its funds invest in indexes. BlackRock has lost an estimated $90bn (£73bn) over the past decade by ignoring the financial risk of investing in fossil fuel companies, a report said last month. The archbishop, a former oil industry executive, has said the Church of England was late in switching its own investments away from companies that damage the climate. In its latest move the church voted last year to withdraw investment from companies that do not meet the terms of the Paris agreement by 2023.",Justin Welby; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news; Carbon footprints; Greenhouse gas emissions; Ethical and green living; Investment funds; Investments; Money; Business,UK news
2021-02-23T07:00:22Z,UK councils still invest in fossil fuels despite declaring climate emergency,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/23/uk-councils-still-invest-fossil-fuels-despite-declaring-climate-emergency,"Local councils that have declared a climate emergency are continuing to pour money into fossil fuels through their staff pension funds, analysis has shown. Nearly £10bn worth of investments in fossil fuels, including oil and gas companies such as BP and Shell, were found in local government pension funds in the last financial year, according to an assessment by the campaign groups Platform and Friends of the Earth. Councils in Greater Manchester, Strathclyde, West Midlands and West Yorkshire had the biggest investments in fossil fuels, accounting between them for nearly a fifth of local government pension fund fossil fuel investments in the UK. The Greater Manchester pension fund, administered by Tameside metropolitan borough council, had more than £1bn invested in fossil fuels in the financial year 2019-20, accounting for nearly 5% of its pension fund, with the other three areas at about £500m in investment each. All of these councils have declared a climate emergency. Councils often join together to invest their pension funds, so the funds do not always correspond exactly to specific local authorities. Councils have been reducing their exposure to high-carbon investments. Similar research in 2015 found £14bn was invested in fossil fuels. Several other smaller pension funds also had about 5% of their assets invested in fossil fuels, including Teesside, Dyfed and Dorset. Three companies alone – BP, Shell, and BHP – account for about 40% of all direct investments in fossil fuels by local council pension funds. Of the fossil fuel investments by councils, the majority – about £6.5bn out of £10bn – were in oil and gas, but about a third of the investments were in coal. Coal has become a hot issue for councils as Cumbria is reconsidering a new coalmine, after outrage when the government gave green light to the proposal. Campaigners said the findings showed councils must take action to ensure their funds were not supporting fossil fuels. Rianna Gargiulo, a divestment campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Declaring a climate emergency may garner good headlines, but too often it seems to stop there. Councils can’t make a bold claim about saving the planet while continuing to invest in fossil fuels. Local authorities have the power and duty to ensure local workers not only have a pension for their retirement, but also a future worth retiring into.” Robert Noyes, a campaigner at Platform and co-author of the report, said: “Local councils can and should be using their pension funds to support local investment priorities. Instead of making risky bets on fossil fuels, let’s channel the wealth in our pensions to local communities and build a better world beyond the pandemic.” Several councils told the Guardian they were reviewing their pension investment strategies, in line with their declaration of a climate emergency. A spokesperson for Somerset county council said: “The committee is committed to a review of its investment strategy in 2021, which will include a full review of the fund’s approach to ethical, social and governance (ESG) issues and will include a review of the approach to climate change.” Some felt divestment was not necessarily the way forward. A spokesperson for Strathclyde pension fund said although they agreed that transitioning to a low-carbon economy was essential, “the fund has felt that divestment is a blunt tool in terms of securing that transition to a low-carbon economy and not on its own radical enough to have a meaningful impact on the climate emergency. Instead, it has preferred to be an activist investor – pushing for improvements on everything from carbon disclosure and lowering emissions, while committing hundreds of millions of pounds into a range of renewable energy projects.” Others pointed to the environmental work they were doing in different areas. Steven Coutts, the leader of Shetland Islands council, said: “We have acknowledged that there needs to be a step change in the global response to climate change and we are actively engaged in the energy transition, working with the oil and gas industry to transition to net zero by electrification, utilising onshore and offshore wind.” He also referred to the council’s work on creating a green hydrogen export business. Cllr Andy Canning, the chair of the Dorset county pension fund, said: “We are fully supportive of the declaration of a climate emergency and have made changes that will deliver significant reductions in our carbon footprint. Our intention is to substantially reduce our carbon footprint without sacrificing returns.” However, some pension funds will take many years to decarbonise their schemes at current rates. Wirral council said work to do so had been under way for five years and would continue for the next decade or more. Cllr Pat Cleary, the chair of Wirral’s pensions committee, said: “The goal is to align the fund’s investment strategy with Paris’s timescales, which sets the period up until 2030 as our critical milestone for further decarbonising the portfolio on the way to 2050.” This article was amended on 24 February 2021 to clarify that Greater Manchester combined authority does not administer the Greater Manchester pension fund.",Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gas emissions; Local government; Greater Manchester; Climate crisis; Environment; Friends of the Earth; Environmental activism; UK news; Scotland; Yorkshire,Environment
2020-08-12T08:00:05Z,HSBC sounds alarm over investment in meat giant due to deforestation inaction,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/12/hsbc-sounds-alarm-over-investment-in-meat-giant-jbs-due-to-deforestation-inaction,"Analysts at global banking giant HSBC have sounded the alarm over the potential risks of investing in JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, after a string of investigations raising concerns about Amazon deforestation issues in its beef supply chain. The meat giant “has no vision, action plan, timeline, technology or solution” for monitoring whether the cattle it buys originate from farms involved in rainforest destruction, according to analysis by the bank, which has substantial investments in the troubled meat packing firm. In a recent financial report on JBS – obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism – HSBC analysts said they had asked the company “multiple times” about its plan to address deforestation but appeared to be unsatisfied, leading them to conclude that “the pressure is on JBS”. The analysts expressed disquiet that in their view the company had allowed a smaller competitor to take on the mantle of addressing forest destruction, after Marfrig – another Brazilian beef exporter – committed to full traceability of its Amazon cattle by 2025. “We have never seen a major industry leader default an industry matter this serious to a smaller participant,” the report said. “It is the major risk on JBS that worries us because it speaks to seriousness of purpose on ESG [environmental and social governance] matters for a company that in our view, has something to prove.” It adds: “There is a valuation benefit that goes with being the largest solution provider to deforestation in Brazil and unfortunately, we don’t see JBS inclined to lead and own that title.” JBS, which has annual revenues of $50bn (£38bn) and slaughters almost 35,000 cattle a day in Brazil, is coming under increasing pressure from investors over its environmental record. The investment arm of northern Europe’s largest financial services group last month dropped the company from its portfolio. JBS is now excluded from assets sold by Nordea Asset Management, which controls a €230bn (£210bn) fund. The HSBC report cites a recent investigation by the Bureau, the Guardian and Repórter Brasil revealing that JBS’s trucks had moved cattle from a ranch marked by government data as being under sanction due to illegal deforestation to a “clean” farm, which in turn sold cattle onto JBS abattoirs. JBS disputed the findings, but did not give a clear explanation of exactly where their trucks had been collecting cattle from. The investigation prompted calls for supermarkets and fast food chains to immediately cease trading with JBS. HSBC analysts discussed JBS’s recent attempt to split the Brazilian part of its business from its global operations, in order to float the international arm on the New York Stock Exchange with no Amazon risk for investors. The report also refers to other historical issues. “After its legacy of governance and corruption problems, JBS’s board and senior leadership are in need of proof points that the firm has indeed turned over a new leaf on ESG responsibility matters.” Despite expressing concerns, the HSBC report does still recommend buying JBS stock. “We like JBS for its debt reduction story, diverse portfolio of proteins, geographic footprint, leadership in the industry and scale. Its proposed [New York] listing would likely improve governance if done correctly, reduce cost of capital and strategically position the company for new growth opportunities.” HSBC holds JBS shares and bonds worth some $9 million, according to recent research by the NGO Feedback. HSBC told the Bureau that those holdings were usually held on behalf of other parties and that in such cases the bank had no part in the decision to invest in specific companies. The bank’s report comes amid global outrage over the fate of the world’s biggest rainforest. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Experts say its preservation is essential to tackling the climate emergency. Last year, a study by supply-chain initiative Trase concluded that JBS’s global beef exports were linked to up to 300 sq km of deforestation per year in Brazil. JBS told the Bureau and the Guardian: “As we are due to report results to our investors and stakeholders later this week, we believe it is good practice to avoid further comments at this time.

2019-10-10T03:50:12Z,Minerals Council says it will release a 'climate action plan' next year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/minerals-council-says-it-will-release-a-climate-action-plan-next-year,"The Minerals Council has announced it will develop a “climate action plan” amid increasing pressure on its biggest members, BHP and Rio Tinto, to quit the industry body over its position on global heating. In a statement posted on the Minerals Council website this week, the chief executive, Tania Constable, said the plan would be released next year and would “support strong and innovative action by Australia’s world-leading minerals sector to address human-induced climate change. “A thriving minerals sector focused on effective and pragmatic climate action is essential to mobilise the solutions required to address climate change,” she said. The plan is to include preparing members for life in an economy consistent with the Paris agreement, which is designed to limit global heating to less than 2C, and reducing the emissions of member companies by using renewable power on mine sites and developing carbon sequestration technology. However, it does not appear to include consideration of the “scope 3” emissions made by customers of mining companies, putting it at odds with BHP, which has pledged to tackle these emissions as part of efforts to tackle global heating. The plan was immediately dismissed by activist investor group Market Forces, which said it appeared be an effort to play for more time. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The Minerals Council wants to make it look like a change of direction but the pressure has been rightly building and a leopard doesn’t change its spots,” the Market Forces executive director, Julien Vincent, said. A Minerals Council spokesman said the plan was the result of the work of its energy and climate change committee that “predates recent media stories”. Pressure on BHP to leave the council intensified on Wednesday night when one of the miner’s biggest shareholders, Standard Life Aberdeen, said that at next week’s annual meeting it would vote in favour of a shareholder resolution demanding the company quit lobby groups that have positions inconsistent with the Paris agreement. “We think BHP has done many leading things in regard to climate change management,” Standard Life Aberdeen’s environmental, social and governance stewardship director, Bill Hartnett, told the Financial Times. “But these have been undermined by its association and funding of certain lobby groups.” Hartnett did not specifically name the Minerals Council but in recent weeks it has emerged as a central target of investor anger over global heating. Last week Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $170bn AustralianSuper, blasted the council’s existing climate position, which supports the Paris agreement, as inadequate and demanded the group develop a more detailed plan. The call came as the global Climate Action 100+ group of investors, which includes Aussie Super and in total controls more than $35tn in assets, said it would be targeting companies over their membership of industry organisations that have policies inconsistent with their stated positions on the climate crisis. In response to investor pressure, BHP is currently reviewing its membership of all industry bodies, including the Minerals Council. Both BHP and Rio Tinto have previously come close to leaving the Minerals Council, but have so far remained in the organisation after it softened its position. However, Rio Tinto is also likely to face increased scrutiny in the runup to its annual shareholder meetings, which are usually held in April and May. The Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents Australian investors controlling about $2tn, declined to comment on the Minerals Council’s new position. The group’s policy director, Erwin Jackson, told Guardian Australia that investors expected companies to ensure their resources weren’t used to support groups that undermined the objectives of the Paris agreement. “Many participants in the climate policy debate say they support the Paris agreement,” he said. “The real test of this commitment is whether they support achieving net zero emissions by 2050, whether they encourage governments to update their 2030 targets to be in line with limiting warming to [between] 1.5C [and] well below 2C, and ensuring national targets achieve the highest possible level of ambition.”",Climate crisis; Business; Business; Mining; Mining; Environment; Australia news; BHP,Environment

AustralianSuper’s head of environmental, social and governance issues, Andrew Gray, told Guardian Australia the council was a good example of a group of industry associations that had made a general commitment to the principles of the Paris agreement, designed to limit global heating to 2C, but had failed to say how their members would do so. “They’ve got a very high-level statement about alignment with Paris but I want to see them do more,” he said. The substance behind its statement needed to be developed. “A high-level statement like that was probably where people were at a few years ago, but people need to keep evolving,” he said. Over the coming year, tackling industry associations whose climate agendas did not match the stated goals of member companies would be a priority for Climate Action 100+, a global group of investment funds including AustralianSuper that control more than $35tn in assets. Other members of the 370-strong group include Australian fund manager BT, global bank HSBC and California’s state pension fund Calpers. In its first progress report, the group – which was set up in December 2017 – said many companies were making progress but more needed to be done. Gray, who sits on the Climate Action 100+ steering committee, said the initiative was still in its early days. “I’m not disappointed about the progress to date but that’s not the same as saying much more doesn’t need to be done,” he said. “I think these achievements are really significant and we’ve got a lot of momentum.” The Minerals Council’s position on the climate has already caused significant pain for the peak body, with its chief executive, Brendan Pearson, leaving the organisation in November 2017 after clashes with BHP and Rio Tinto, who were unhappy with its advocacy for coal. Despite changes at the council, activists and investors have continued to pressure the big miners over their continued membership. Rio Tinto threatened to quit if the council made statements contradicting the Paris agreement, and BHP is reviewing its membership of all industry organisations.On Tuesday, after lobbying from Climate Action 100+, BHP released new guidance that broadened the issues it would examine when deciding if it should be a member of industry groups. “I think it’s very good steps in the right direction,” Gray said. In its report, Climate Action 100+ said 77% of companies clearly assigned responsibility for climate to the board of directors, but less than 8% ensured their positions were consistent with those of industry associations. “It’s important that industry associations of which companies are a member have consistent positions with their members,” Gray said. “If that’s not the case that represents a business risk for us.” This was because any inconsistency was “potentially undermining the company’s position”, he said. “Generally speaking the climate policy positions of industry associations aren’t where they need to be, they’re not as strong as they need to be,” he said. “The Minerals Council, I think, is a good example.” The Minerals Council’s chief executive, Tania Constable, said it “welcomes AustralianSuper’s endorsement of our public policy position on climate change and agrees with them that there is more that the industry can do, and is doing, to improve environmental outcomes”. She said the Australian minerals industry supported the Paris agreement and claimed the industry’s direct emissions “might have peaked already”. “Australian mining businesses are working together to make our contribution to lowering emissions,” she said. “This includes reducing the emissions from minerals extraction and processing, investment in low emission technology such as carbon capture and storage, energy-efficiency initiatives and increasing the use of renewable energy in operations.” Gray said although AustralianSuper did not screen out companies based on their environmental performance, it was an issue that fed into how they valued potential investments. “The size of ownership or whether we own it or not will be affected,” he said. Companies had to deal with both the physical risk global heating posed to their businesses and with the risks associated with moving the world to a low-carbon future. “I think it is inherently a difficult issue because we are dealing with a) the weather and b) a wholesale economic transition,” he said. But this was not much different to working out the risks associated with other changes, such as technology, he said: “A lot of things investors have to forecast for the long term are inherently difficult.”",Business; Climate crisis; Mining; Mining; Superannuation; Investing; Australia news; Australian economy,Australia news
2019-07-25T04:47:12Z,Australian weapons shipped to Saudi and UAE as war rages in Yemen,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/25/australian-weapons-shipped-to-saudi-and-uae-as-war-rages-in-yemen,"In the same week UK courts declared British arms exports to Saudi Arabia to be unlawful, a large shipment of Australian-built remote weapons systems left Sydney airport. Secret photographs, obtained by Guardian Australia, confirm the identity of the buyers – the Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates governments, whose forces are currently waging a devastating war in Yemen. Also marked are the suppliers of the equipment, which the manufacturer boasts is “significantly enhancing lethality” in combat. Labelling on pallets destined in June for Saudi Arabia’s ministry of interior, specifically the general department of arms and explosives, identify the seller as ATK Alliance Techsystems Operations (Orbital ATK), a US-based company which sells the equipment manufactured by an Australian firm, Electro Optics Systems (EOS). The weapons systems shipped to the UAE armed forces’ joint logistics command from Sydney’s international airport were supplied by EOS. The R400s remote weapons station allows small cannons, guns or missile launchers to be mounted on military and light vehicles and operated remotely. There has been long-running concern over arms exports to the Saudi-led coalition of countries waging war in Yemen. The war, which began in 2015, has displaced more than 3million people, brought widespread famine and disease, and is considered the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been accused of potential war crimes and multiple atrocities including indiscriminate bombing campaigns. In June new figures estimated around 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict – including around 11,700 killed in 4,500 events which directly targeted civilians. In an interview with the Defence Technology Review in 2018, EOS chief executive, Ben Greene, said the RWS was a “game changer” which “meets and overmatches current threats”. “This innovative technology for the first time allows 30mm cannon systems to be deployed with unprecedented accuracy on light vehicles, significantly enhancing lethality and protection without compromising mobility, and at low cost.” EOS was revealed by the ABC last year to have struck a lucrative deal to ship weapons overseas. The company would not confirm the identity of its buyer, but said none of its products had been deployed in Yemen. In the wake of EOS’s links to the Yemen conflict becoming public, Australia’s superannuation peak body divested from the company, beginning its sell-off in early March and concluding last month. In a letter to NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge, the chair of IFM Investors &amp; Industry Super Australia, Greg Combet, said the organisation wouldn’t comment on individual companies but noted the “ceasing” of investment. “IFM invests across a range of asset classes and industry sectors and recognise that our investments are potentially exposed to a range of environmental, social and governance risks factors,” Combet said in the letter. “To ensure these issues are considered prior to investing, IFM Investors has a robust approach to integrating ESG into our investment decision making process.” Combet said the defence industry in Australia and the US was “extremely stringent”, and the industry was an important part of Australia’s economy. Last month the UK court of appeal found the British government failed to properly assess the risk of misuse, making no assessment of any past pattern of violations by the Saudi-led coalition, when approving exports. Australia defends its exports in a similar fashion, claiming every licence application is assessed to check for risk of the end use breaching human rights and other international obligations. For several months earlier this year the US Congress had been blocking sales of military weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, specifically over concerns about the the civilian casualties in Yemen. In May president Donal Trump defied the block to restart sales. Australian Greens leader, Richard di Natale, said while other countries were banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia “Australia is continuing to profit off both nations’ warmongering, while remaining tight-lipped or wilfully ignorant about where our weapons are ending up”. “It’s time to end our arms trade with human rights abusers, and rip up the government’s obscene plans to make Australia a global arms dealer.” In February Tom Hamilton, then acting deputy secretary of the defence department’s strategic policy and intelligence group, repeatedly told a Senate estimates hearing that an export licence would not be approved if the weapons were going to be used in Yemen. “If we assess that they would [to commit human rights abuses], we would not approve the permit,” he said. However the Australian government has admitted that it does not run any checks once the product has left the country. Arms exports from Australia are administered by the Defence Exports Controls Branch of the defence department. Australian defence officials have delegated authority to approve exports by Australian companies, but only the minister can deny them. A spokeswoman for defence said exports were subjected to a rigorous risk assessment process that examines Australia’s international obligations, foreign policy, human rights, national security, and regional security. Defence said it consulted widely on arms exports and carefully considered whether there was a risk of “diversion”. “As part of this process, defence assesses export applications to identify whether the export would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia,” she said. “This assessment includes consideration of whether there is an overriding risk that the exported items could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. “As part of these considerations, defence can require that commitments are made by the end user to not transfer or use the goods and/or technology for other than the original stated purpose without defence’s consent.” Defence said it can revoke permits or approach the foreign government if arms are diverted from their intended purpose. Freedom of information documents released last year were extensively redacted but revealed lengthy internal discussions of a company’s request to export remote weapons systems. Defence recommended approval as it was “unlikely to be used in contravention of human rights law or international humanitarian law”. Applications are assessed against five criteria: international obligations, human rights, national security, regional security, and foreign policy. The language of the criteria is not explicit. Three of the criteria call for the assessors to consider just whether the weapon “might” be used in a way that breaches obligations. Only the human rights and foreign policy criteria call for explicitly identifiable risks. The newly-formed Australian Arms Control Coalition, a collection of civil society groups, said the images raised a “whole range of questions” about what was being done with Australian arms, and what checks and balances were in place to prevent them being used in human rights abuses. Kellie Tranter, a lawyer with the coalition, said the lack of guarantees that arms wouldn’t be used in humanitarian law violations was “unacceptable”. “Australians should know who their government is sending arms to and how those arms are being used, and they should have concrete guarantees that those arms won’t be used to commit or facilitate violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) or international human rights law,” Tranter said. She said the UK court’s decision to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia also raised “the possibility” that Australia was also failing to conduct proper due diligence on where its arms were ending up. The Arms Control Coalition’s chair and Save the Children campaigner, Joe Rafalowicz, said Australia could no longer turn a blind eye to the role foreign weapons were playing in the war in Yemen. “It is unthinkable that Australian made defence exports could be helping fuel abuses in the war in Yemen, which has left more than 22 million people in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, while some 85,000 children have died from the effects of war including starvation,” he said.

2021-01-14T12:00:37Z,Shame: Drunk Tank Pink review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/14/shame-drunk-tank-pink-review,"The annals of rock history are packed with songs bemoaning the lot of the artist on tour. You can understand the urge to write them – they proliferate on second albums, when artists who have done almost nothing except tour since their debut search for inspiration – but, nevertheless, attempting to elicit sympathy for a rock band among people who do a proper job for a living always seems dementedly optimistic. Under the circumstances, you have to take your hat off to London quintet Shame: whatever you make of their second album, they’ve successfully come up with an entirely new variant on a well-worn theme. Drunk Tank Pink – which takes its name from the colour that psychologists discovered automatically weakens anyone who stares at it for two minutes, and which went on to become the decor of choice in cells for intoxicated arrestees and the title of a bestselling book about how subconscious forces affect our behaviour – features songs about heartbreak, but it’s essentially an album about the privations of not touring, the struggle to decompress into normal life (which, in the case of Shame, critically acclaimed but low-selling, includes the aforementioned proper jobs) after two years on the road, during which the band, still in their teens when their debut album came out, are supposed to have played nearly 350 shows. The timing of its release is an intriguing thing. The music it contains would be potentiated by being performed live, which won’t happen for the foreseeable future; songs largely deal in riffs and dynamic shifts rather than tunes, and the kind of sprechgesang vocals having a moment thanks to Fontaines DC and Idles. Equally, the themes it delves into – dislocation, boredom, the weirdness of a life that was in constant motion suddenly turning static, the urge to fill time on your hands with hedonism – stand a better chance of hitting home with an audience that hasn’t spent the last two years on the road than they ordinarily might. There are certainly moments of self-indulgence that might cause you to roll your eyes a little. Born in Luton appears to concern itself with frontman Charlie Steen returning home from tour to find himself locked out and his housemates absent – “buzzer broken, I guess I’ll just wait, no umbrella and it’s starting to rain” – a situation that was doubtless frustrating, but which perhaps didn’t warrant commemorating with a song, particularly one that sets his predicament to five minutes of admittedly exciting, shouty punk-funk and elevates it to matter of existential despair. “If the body is willing then so is the mind,” he bellows, “if you can’t trust in either prepare to decline”: mate, calm down and go and wait in Costa, I’m sure they’ll be back in a bit. But these are outweighed by moments elsewhere in which the lockdown-bound listener might find themselves nodding along with his predicament in empathy: “Are you waiting to feel good?”; “Will this day ever end? I need a new beginning / it just goes on, it just goes on.” The music slips its moorings from Shame’s acclaimed debut, Songs of Praise, and ventures into darker, more abrasive waters: there are points when Drunk Tank Pink’s knotty guitar riffs, off-centre time signatures, sudden changes in tempo and bursts of dissonance resemble a less self-conscious Black Midi. When it works, it’s viscerally thrilling: the scouring blast of Harsh Degrees, the slow-build-to-cacophonous-climax of Station Wagon, and the sheer oddness of Snow Day, the least bucolic-sounding song imaginable about losing yourself in nature. You are, though, occasionally struck by the sense that some of Shame’s new directions aren’t quite as new as they think they are. Someone has been listening to late 70s/early 80s post-punk of the Talking Heads and ESG variety, which is fair enough: the problem is that so have a lot of other bands in recent memory. If you date alt-rock’s renewed interest in scratchy guitars, funk rhythms and yowly vocals back to the release of the Rapture’s Out of the Races and on to the Tracks and Radio 4’s Dance to the Underground, the post-punk revival has been going on for more than 20 years, almost as long as some members of Shame have been alive, longer than the distance between the post-punk era and the first releases that reanimated its sound. It’s a musical trope that still works, as evidenced by Drunk Tank Pink’s stuttering Nigel Hitter, but the sense of familiarity is overwhelming, at odds with the album’s aim. In fact, Drunk Tank Pink is best when it shifts towards something more soft-focused. Human, for a Minute slackens the tempo, Steen stops shouting, the prickliness of the guitars is dialled down, there are vocal harmonies on the nagging, endlessly repeated refrain of “I’m half the man I should be”. Emotional impact isn’t sacrificed. If anything, the song hits harder than its ostensibly harder-hitting neighbours: proof that – for all the noisy excitement generated elsewhere – there’s a power in stepping back and reining things in. This week Alexis listened to Jamal Bucanon: Waved Belatedly discovered via the excellent One New Song Per Week blog, Bucanon’s debut single is gorgeously, hazily regretful, its sound lurking somewhere between bass music, R&amp;B and – as the blog points out – the 80s dream-pop of AR Kane.",Indie; Punk; Pop and rock; Music; Culture,Music
2020-09-13T06:00:51Z,A Japan trade deal is little consolation if Britain is locked out of the EU,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/13/a-japan-trade-deal-is-little-consolation-if-britain-is-locked-out-of-the-eu,"There was a consistent message from business leaders to international trade secretary Liz Truss’s claims that she had signed a “historic” deal with Japan to lower tariffs and gain access to previously restricted markets. Thank you, they said, but could you please sign a deal with the EU because that is our most important export market. Truss is not a minister to be moved by such demands. The former chief secretary to the Treasury has a mission to bolt together as many trade deals with non-EU countries as she can while No 10 takes on the task of signing a comprehensive agreement with Brussels. Officials at the signing ceremony with Japan confirmed that the deal was expected to boost UK trade with the world’s third-largest economy by an estimated £15.2bn, though there was no date by which this figure would be achieved. It would also add only 0.07% to UK gross domestic product, which compares with forecasts by government economists of a 5% loss of GDP from leaving the EU customs union and single market. No wonder Mike Hawes, the boss of car lobby group the SMMT, and Adam Marshall, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, were quick to point out that a deal with the EU was far more important. Truss was undaunted, though her attempts so far to sign other significant deals, and especially with the US, have proved fruitless. Under normal circumstances, a deal with the US is not a priority. It might be the largest economy in the world and the single largest destination for UK goods and services exports outside the EU, but it is an open market characterised by low import tariffs. That was the situation until Donald Trump began his bruising battle with China over what he claimed were trade barriers damaging to US companies. In the last couple of years this trade war has expanded to take in the EU. Importantly for Truss, the UK has been one of the biggest losers. In particular, single malt Scotch whisky has suffered from a 25% import tariff, pricing it out of the US market. Truss needs to win over the US to push trade tariffs back down to more normal levels, or better still to zero. However, there is a high price to be paid for favours in Washington. Farmers are an especially powerful lobby group in the US and want full access to foreign markets as the price of any trade deal. They expect Congress to abide by this maxim, and it usually does. Before the US pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal that included Australia, Vietnam and Japan, Washington had extracted concessions for US beef and other farm produce that were effectively banned in many TPP countries up to that point. The former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who last week officially joined Truss’s advisory board, has long wrestled with criticism that his determination to sign trade deals meant that many domestic industries were thrown overboard, including agriculture and manufacturing. Truss is under pressure to protect UK agriculture from being steamrollered by cheap US produce. If she is to uphold farming standards – ones that would allow the continued export of livestock and food to the EU – Truss must not lower UK rules in order to give access to industrial-scale farmers in the US who use growth hormones on their beef and chlorine washes on their chicken. Whether to comply with the US or the EU rules is not a question that troubles business leaders. It is the EU every time. This makes sense when you consider the numbers. If you include services industries, imports and exports between Britain and the EU were worth a total of £672.5bn last year, more than 20 times the value of UK-Japan trade and three times the £200bn sent back and forth to the US. A deal with the EU will be the historic prize. A woman has got to the top of Wall St. But others still face a climb The appointment this week of the first female leader of a Wall Street bank was greeted with a roar of approval. Jane Fraser, the Scottish-American banker from St Andrews who will lead Citi, is “a pioneer”, declared David Solomon over at Goldman Sachs. It is indeed a landmark moment. But, now that a breakthrough has finally happened on Wall Street, a bastion of corporate maleness, should we expect a rush of female appointments? Don’t bet a cent on it. That hasn’t been the wider experience in the US or the UK. The first woman to become chief executive of a FTSE 100 company was Dame Marjorie Scardino in 1997, and her appointment at Pearson was similarly hailed as groundbreaking. Almost a quarter of a century later, one can say the predicted rush of female FTSE bosses was a trickle. The highest number within the 100-strong club at any one time has been seven. Within banking, the first female chief executive of a UK top-four firm was Alison Rose at NatWest Group, appointed as recently as last year. It’s true that the UK’s top boardrooms overall have become less male over the years. A third of board positions at FTSE 100 companies are held by women, the Hampton-Alexander Review found this year. Yet the review also highlighted a “concerning lack of female representation in senior leadership and key executive roles” in FTSE 350 companies: only 15 female finance directors among FTSE 100 firms, for example. In the US, the picture is similar: progress, but painfully slow. Only 31 women lead S&amp;P 500 firms. On Wall Street, there are two men for every woman on banks’ operating committees, according to Bloomberg. Fraser’s success is a personal triumph, but the corporate world has not undergone a revolution. Rio resignations signal the end for profit without accountability When Rio Tinto announced last week that its chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, would be stepping down, it marked a new low for the mining giant – but potentially also an inflection point in corporate accountability. Jacques resigned, alongside two other senior bosses, after investors lined up to condemn the company’s leadership for overseeing the destruction of an Australian heritage site of importance to Indigenous communities. The world’s biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia, after blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, which held irreplaceable artefacts. The executive clearout was by “mutual agreement”, according to a statement, but it should send a clear signal to others culpable for environmental destruction in the pursuit of corporate profit. Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) may once have been regarded as a box-ticking exercise for company executives, but growing public intolerance of shoddy ESG standards can no longer be ignored. Investors, too, are unwilling to turn a blind eye to poor practice. If the 2015 Samarco dam disaster, which resulted from a joint venture between miners BHP Billiton and Vale, had happened today it is difficult to imagine that executives would be let off as lightly as they were at the time. The dam’s collapse left 19 dead, hundreds homeless and is considered the single worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history. For Andrew Mackenzie, BHP’s then boss, it meant sacrificing a short-term bonus, even though hundreds living near the dam are still without homes. The past loss of life and natural heritage at the hands of mining companies can never be replaced. But the swift condemnation of reckless corporate greed today could help safeguard the future.",Trade policy; Liz Truss; Brexit; UK news; Politics; Business; European Union; Europe; Banking; Inequality; Women; Rio Tinto; Corporate social responsibility; Environment; Mining,Politics
2019-07-02T05:00:21Z,"Firms must document climate impact on profits, Treasury says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/firms-climate-impact-on-profits-treasury,"Britain’s leading companies, investment funds and pension schemes must show by 2022 how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances, under government plans to boost the UK’s green credentials. Firms must document within the two-and-a-half-year deadline how extreme weather and changes to climate rules, such as a ban on plastic packaging, could hit their profits. The Treasury is also urging City banks to play a bigger role in supporting the UK meeting its legal target to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Under a new government strategy, banks will be pushed to invest in sustainability and come clean about their own exposure to the climate crisis. The Treasury said its green finance strategy would help the City emerge as a green finance capital by funding green investment, an education charter, a green home finance fund and by establishing a new green finance institute. The institute succeeds the green finance taskforce that was launched in 2017 and will encourage investment in sustainable businesses such as renewable energy firms. Financial services firms will also be expected to disclose how climate emergency risk impacts their activities by 2022. John Glen, the City minister, said the green finance strategy would help establish London as “a pre-eminent international centre for green finance”. He said: “The UK has a long history of leading the way in tackling climate change, but we need to do more to protect our planet for future generations.” The Treasury’s flurry of green finance initiatives has emerged as it prepares to face questions from a committee of MPs over its role in supporting the government’s climate targets. The Treasury select committee launched an inquiry last month to scrutinise the role played by Treasury officials, regulators and financial services firms after Theresa May’s announcement that a net-zero carbon emissions target would be enshrined in law. Philip Hammond responded to the policy by saying a net-zero carbon economy would cost £1tn to create. The claim was quickly rebuffed by No 10 in a rare rebuke to the chancellor. John McDonnell recently outlined plans to give the Bank of England powers to help scrutinise the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. The shadow chancellor has promoted the idea of a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a key member. The new body would be supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. McDonnell said: “From the government, this is too little and too late. It’s also totally ineffectual and toothless. “While it’s true that the finance sector will need to play a huge role in securing a sustainable economy for the future, it seems like the government is still stuck in the mindset of fiddling around the edges and hoping the free market will solve the climate emergency.” Climate emergency campaigners have supported the concept of a Green New Deal that mostly involves state support for a switch to low-carbon energy use and greener infrastructure. Hammond said he preferred to encourage the private sector to back green companies through a green finance institute, headed by former Barclays executive Rhian-Mari Thomas. He pointed to the already burgeoning market for green bonds, which act like mortgages for businesses that want to pursue environmentally friendly projects. All the main city regulators said they backed the chancellor’s move, saying a new stewardship code that required investors to check the “environmental, social and governance issues, including climate change” of UK businesses would make them more sustainable.",Business; Climate crisis; Investment funds; Pensions industry; Philip Hammond; Politics; UK news; Extreme weather; Environment; World news,Business
2019-06-05T06:00:27Z,Climate crisis and antibiotic use could 'sink' fish farming industry – report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/climate-crisis-and-antibiotic-use-could-sink-fish-farming-industry-report,"The climate crisis, drug use and feeding farmed fish with wild stocks risks “sinking” the $230bn (£180bn) aquaculture industry, according to an ethical investment network. Fish farms now surpass wild fisheries as the main provider of seafood on our plates, but combined risks from global heating, excessive use of antibiotics, a dependence on wild stocks for feed, and poor governance threatens the lucrative and fast-growing sector, warned Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (Fairr), a $12trn-backed network. The aquaculture industry is the world’s fastest-growing food production sector but has recently been hit by governance scandals. In April, US seafood buyers filed a class lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Norwegian salmon producers, following spot raids on fish farms across Europe by European Commission anti-cartel investigators. And in May, a Panorama report named several fish farmers as among those under investigation by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for alleged misreporting of chemical use. Fairr’s report, Shallow returns?, shows an average growth in aquaculture of almost 6% annually, providing “significant” returns for shareholders, at up to more than 400% over five years. But the investor group warned that much of this expansion is based on high-density farming associated with environmental, social and governance risks. It accused the sector of “limited transparency” on these issues. “Investors should be aware of the sustainability risks in the aquaculture sector before they wade in too deeply,” said Maria Lettini, director of Fairr. “From effluents to emissions, this sector must address significant environmental and public health challenges if it is to prosper over the long term.” Aquaculture is both a significant contributor to emissions and is highly exposed to their impacts, the report said. Farmed marine fish production in south-east Asia, one of the largest aquaculture regions, is expected to drop 30% by 2050 due to rising sea temperatures and acidification of oceans. Farmed salmon and shrimp require fishmeal and fish oil, making the sector highly dependent on rapidly depleting wild fish stock for future growth, the report found. Lettini said: “We thought that farmed fish would save our wild stocks in the oceans, but now it’s coming to the fore that we are using wild-caught fish to feed our farmed fish – and that is causing real problems.” Nearly one fifth of global fisheries production is used for fishmeal and fish oil production, the report found. Sewage and wastewater discharged from fish farms is also associated with toxic algal blooms and polluted drinking water, Lettini said. Last month Norway suffered its worst algal bloom in 30 years, with 8 million salmon killed so far. Algal blooms caused an estimated $800m in damage to the Chilean salmon industry in 2016, killing nearly 27m fish, about 20% of the country’s annual production, according to the report. Hotspots of antibiotic use in fish farming accelerate antimicrobial resistance, the report found, with some countries taking action against importers. In January this year, the US Food and Drug administration denied entry to 26 shipments of Indian shrimp, after detecting banned antibiotics. Another major issue highlighted by the report was the issue of farmed fish slipping out of their pens and coming in contact with native populations. Lettini said: “Farmed fish escape and mix with their organic peers and that is changing the gene pool of wild fish. Changes in DNA have been found and we don’t even know the importance of that yet.” Fairr recommended good management practices, including the use of probiotics to reduce antibiotic use, and alternatives to fishmeal, including feed made from bacteria as well as greater cultivation of mussels and oysters, which do not require fishmeal-based feed.",Fishing industry; Fishing; Environment; Climate science; Climate crisis; Science; Conservation; Food; Marine life; Wildlife,Environment
2019-12-20T11:00:15Z,Sault: 5 / 7 review – intriguing grooves from a mystery funk machine,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/20/sault-5-7-review-forever-living-originals,"Mystery is a rare commodity in rock and pop these days. The internet has made investigative journalists of us all, and an artist who expends a lot of effort creating an enigmatic aura will almost invariably find themselves revealed online. So hats off to Sault, who managed to release two albums in 2019 – titled 5 and 7 – without anyone managing to conclusively solve the puzzle of who was behind them. It was not for want of trying. Some people suggested the involvement of a London-based musician called Dean Josiah, whose CV boasts co-writing and production credits for Michael Kiwanuka, the Saturdays and Little Simz – the last of whom raved about Sault on social media. Others have posited that British soul singer Cleo Sol and Chicago-based rapper and sometime Kanye West collaborator Kid Sister – both signed to Sault’s label, Forever Living Originals – are the vocalists. But no one has confirmed or denied anything. You can understand why people are intrigued, because both of Sault’s albums are fantastic, walking an idiosyncratic path that zig-zags between ESG-esque post-punk funk, early 80s boogie and something approaching neo-soul, without ever really fitting into any of those categories or sounding like straightforward homage. Whoever is on drums is clearly a big fan of Can’s Jaki Liebezeit: their playing adds a strange, hypnotic intensity to tracks even as laidback and sunlit sounding as 5’s We Are the Sun. Elsewhere, the dubbed-out spaciness of the production consistently gives everything a weird, disorientating edge, no matter how poppy the melodies get. For all the sparseness of the arrangements – drums and bass, the odd wash of electric piano or blast of fuzzed-out guitar and synth – Sault seem as interested in writing songs as constructing grooves. Virtually every track is concise and to the point, rarely tipping over four minutes, and even the furthest-out moments - 7’s Red Lights or 5’s warped closer BABE – come with really powerful hooks woven through them. The net result feels simultaneously exploratory and confident, a really appealing, intriguing combination. Whoever they are, Sault sound like they know what they’re doing.",Pop and rock; Electronic music; Music; Culture; Soul; R&B; Sault,Music
2020-10-02T10:12:59Z,Cambridge is right to join the flight from fossil fuels. But divestment is just a start,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/02/cambridge-fossil-fuels-divestment-fossil-fuels-climate-emergency,"It’s been a year of considerable blows to the fossil fuel industry. Thursday’s announcement that the University of Cambridge will divest its endowment fund from fossil fuel corporations is another considerable win for campaigners, who have spent many years doggedly demanding change from an institution that – despite being a global leader in scientific research and education – has been obstinate about severing its many ties to the fossil fuel industry, including significant research funding from Shell and BP. Of course, serious questions will doubtless be raised about why a full decade is needed to shift money out of direct fossil fuel investments, and until 2038 to arrive at a “net-zero portfolio”. And the absence of a commitment on cutting the university’s close research ties with fossil fuel companies is also sure to draw some ire. Ultimately, however, the announcement is significant for the message it sends about the future of the fossil fuel industry. It joins a swelling chorus of voices spanning cities from Oslo to LA, more than half of UK universities, the Republic of Ireland, Norway’s $1tn sovereign wealth fund, and even – in a very limited way – BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Divestment pledges worldwide now total $11tn worth of fossil fuel assets. But as encouraging as this snowballing divestment has been to watch, the fact that even companies such as BlackRock – with its notoriously poor record on climate – are slowly coming onboard should prompt some reflection on the stage the divestment movement has reached, and whether it needs to evolve if it’s to continue pushing for the radicalism we need. We appear to have firmly entered the era that divestment campaigners have long foreseen: fossil fuels are simply no longer good investments. This year, oil companies have written down billions in assets, and waves of bankruptcies have swept US shale gas while the North Sea oil and gas industry has shed jobs. ExxonMobil was removed from the Dow Jones industrial average after nearly a century, and five tech companies now dominate the S&amp;P500, occupying an astonishing 20% of the index’s value compared with the measly 2.3% claimed by the entire energy sector. Prudent financial institutions are responding by shifting investments to industries where returns are both greater and more secure in the long term. Sometimes this includes green energy, but often it simply means following the market, with freed-up cash shifting to tech and other financial companies. Even “ethical” investment strategies, so-called “ESG (environmental, social, governance)” funds, have come under fire for poor quality control, inconsistent or dubious ratings, and questionable impacts. Divestment has played a significant part in advancing the timeline for fossil fuels’ demise. Although questions have been raised about the immediate impact of divestment on share prices, the movement has undoubtedly stigmatised investments in the fossil fuel industry. Last year, Shell admitted the divestment movement posed a “material risk” to its business model. But there is a limit to the number of endowments and funds that represent beneficiaries who can be readily organised and are willing to submit to these demands, such as student bodies, religious communities and the constituents of progressive councils and cities. A vast amount of the financial system is deeply undemocratic, and – despite the industry’s gloomy outlook – demonstrably unresponsive to demands for an end to fossil fuel finance. Just five North American banks, for instance, have financed nearly $1tn in fossil fuels since 2016, with little sign of slowing. The question, then, is what comes next? Divestment is a means of addressing an urgent, immediate problem: the financing of fossil fuels. But the divestment movement is fighting a war of attrition, in which its opponents – at least within the economic and political systems built by and for them – are considerably better resourced. The climate crisis is a product of those same systems, and it demands that we fight against them. Climate and environmental breakdown are a crisis of inequality, rooted in profound imbalances in wealth and power both within and between countries. A spate of reports and letters from leading scientists have sounded the alarm on this sober reality, and warned that we will likely fail in combating the climate crisis unless we radically reduce inequality and redistribute consumption and resource use. The divestment leader and legendary activist Bill McKibben was right when he said “money is the oxygen on which the fire of global warming burns”. But we need to be just as concerned with its distribution as we are with its flow. There’s a long way to go to “turn off the tap”, and the divestment movement is still very much needed. But to challenge the status quo driving this crisis in the first place, the movement must challenge the immense and undemocratic structural power of the financial system, and the explosion of inequality it has supported, and not settle for greener portfolios.

2019-07-31T06:00:38Z,"Bob Geldof's firm's use of tax haven is legal, but the system hurts African nations",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/31/bob-geldof-firms-use-of-a-tax-haven-is-legal-but-damaging-to-african-nations,"At their closest point, Europe and Africa are just eight miles apart. That’s the inspiration for the name of Sir Bob Geldof’s private equity firm, 8 Miles, set up to channel investment into successful businesses in Africa. But we learned last week that 8 Miles’ cash travels considerably further than this on its way from one continent to the other. It has established a cluster of companies in Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, which funds pass through. Geldof is an outspoken champion of African countries, and has raised millions of pounds for the continent through Band Aid and other initiatives. That he sees no contradiction in this type of corporate structure shows how depressingly routine the use of jurisdictions like Mauritius has become. Mauritius is the tax haven of choice for companies investing in Africa. That’s why this story by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), has made front pages in Africa. A key ingredient in Mauritius’ success is the special tax treatment given to foreign firms, combined with a network of bilateral treaties with African countries that limit the taxes investors pay on the continent. An 8 Miles business plan that ICIJ claim to have obtained states: “Mauritius is an offshore jurisdiction with a wide network of double taxation treaties in interesting markets.” The government of Mauritius have issued a vigorous defence of their tax laws in response to the reports. For developing countries, tax treaties are supposed to attract investors by restricting how much and in what circumstances they can be taxed, though economists disagree on whether they really affect foreign investment. Tax treaties with Mauritius reduce African countries’ tax revenues considerably. When I analysed the impact of treaties, I found that African countries’ treaties impose more limits on their ability to tax investment than they need to, and recent research published by the Tax Justice Network points to Mauritius as one of the most aggressive negotiators. For example, Mauritius’ treaty with Uganda, where 8 Miles has investments in poultry and banking, allows investors to avoid paying capital gains tax altogether, despite “realizing capital gains” being one of 8 Miles’ principal objectives. Uganda is already embroiled in a dispute with mobile phone company Zain over its use of a tax treaty. In conversations with African tax officials over the past 10 years, I’ve heard many lament their tax treaties. “They ask for an arm and a leg, and you give them both legs,” an official in Zambia told me. “Nobody comes to invest because you have a tax treaty,” said another from Uganda. “When you see the rationale to attract investment, it sounds laudable. But when you look at the evidence, it’s not the case.” Mauritius looms large in these discussions, as ICIJ found in its own reporting. Although there are issues with the tax treaties between African countries and their major sources of investment, such as the UK and China, what makes Mauritius especially problematic is that it’s a haven for “treaty shopping”. Its treaties with African countries don’t just prevent them from taxing investments originating in Mauritius, but also those made by firms, such as 8 Miles, that are based elsewhere but structured through it. Over the past few years, the OECD, EU and G20 have taken steps to make this harder, blacklisting countries whose tax regimes are deemed harmful, and writing treaty clauses to prevent treaty shopping. Mauritius has continued to play the system, adapting its tax laws just enough to comply with the blacklist criteria, and responding reluctantly to requests from developing countries to renegotiate their treaties. But there are signs that the tide is turning: Rwanda and South Africa have negotiated new, stronger treaties with Mauritius; Senegal, unsatisfied with Mauritius’ attitude to renegotiations, has decided to terminate its treaty altogether. Kenya’s treaty with Mauritius was recently struck down in the Nairobi High Court. Other countries are considering renegotiations. A spokesperson for 8 Miles said: “8 Miles invests in African businesses to create jobs and improve communities, using high environmental, social and governance standards and generating tax revenues which support the governments where we operate. The companies we invest in pay all taxes in their home jurisdiction in Africa. Only when we sell a company will the sale proceeds be paid back into the fund in Mauritius.” They added: “Any double tax agreements are a matter between the governments who sign these agreements and we comply with such agreements but we do not make them.” This is true, but one of the major reasons governments feel compelled to enter into tax treaties, and are reluctant to terminate those that are harmful, is their anticipation of reactions from investors. As a former negotiator from Zambia told me: “There’s empirical evidence that [tax treaties] have no effect on investment, but the reality country-to-country is that there’s a bluff going on, and countries don’t want to take the risk of losing big investments.” 8 Miles needs to bring its market power to bear, with a clear commitment to stand by countries that negotiate less damaging tax treaties, and to reconsider its reliance on Mauritius, unless the country gets its house in order. • Martin Hearson is a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, researching international tax treaties",Global development; Private sector; Tax and spending; Politics; Mauritius; Africa; UK news; World news; Bob Geldof,Global development
2020-01-21T07:00:50Z,"Oceans, biodiversity, deforestation: what's on the climate agenda for 2020?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/21/oceans-biodiversity-deforestation-whats-on-the-climate-agenda-for-2020,"World leaders and business chiefs meeting in Davos this week will be confronted for the first time with an agenda on which the climate and ecological crises take top billing. Financial and economic concerns have been shunted down the list of priorities in favour of five environmental issues: climate breakdown and extreme weather; failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change; human-made pollution; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Green campaigners and social and human rights activists have been raising concerns on all of these for more than two decades, but it seems that finally the world’s powers are paying attention. In some cases it may be too late to act to avoid the consequences of the delay in taking action. Since 2015 when the landmark Paris agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen a further 4% and although there are signs the rate of increase may be slowing, that is nowhere near enough. Oceans are at the hottest ever recorded. Last year, ecological scientists said 1 million species were on the brink of extinction. The biomass of wild animals on the planet has fallen by more than 80%, about half of the area of key natural ecosystems has been lost, and insect populations have crashed, according to the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that by 2030 the world must be on track or exceeding 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels would be all but inevitable. Warming has already topped 1C and 2019 was the second hottest year on record. As the Davos agenda shows, businesses are taking note. Ashim Paun, the global co-head of environmental, social, and governance research at HSBC, said: “Will 2020 be an inflexion point? Our investor clients increasingly think climate change is absolutely core to their investment processes. So this year we look to major political and policy developments – the details of the EU green deal in March, the outcome of elections, particularly the US where we see the outcome as fairly binary for climate, and whether this year’s climate talks in Glasgow [in November] can regain previous momentum.” There is plenty that all people around the world can do to get involved and shape the direction of this crunch decade. “2019 proved that activism works,” said Richard George, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “The amazing contributions from the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion, along with many others, got us a net zero target [in the UK and other countries], and almost universal agreement that not only is climate change happening but action to stop it is both vital and urgent. What we need now is real action to get the carbon out of our energy, transport, food and finance sectors, which means turning up the heat on politicians and corporations. This is the year to do it.” There will be international conferences this year on the climate, the oceans, biodiversity, deforestation and a host of other pressing environmental concerns. Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction. Here’s what to look out for in 2020. Climate Nearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year’s UN climate conference in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries’ commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a disastrous 3C rise. That makes this year’s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to COP26 in Glasgow in November armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success. US presidential election Trump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been baleful on climate action: he started the formal process to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the presidential election on 3 November. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role. Trump will also preside over the G7 meeting in June, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8’s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing. Oceans Plastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a crisis in the oceans. The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”. Biodiversity Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating. Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species. A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress – or the lack of it – on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference. Sustainable development goals The Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the UN sustainable development goals, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills – including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July. Business The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder. Transport and the climate emergency Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency’s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century – a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda. Deforestation In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference. EU green deal and China EU summit The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions. The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world’s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26.",Climate crisis; Davos 2020; Davos; Global climate talks; Oceans; Biodiversity; Sustainable development goals; Deforestation; Conservation; Environment; Business; Cop26,Environment
2019-09-04T11:50:36Z,Global food producers 'failing to face up to role' in climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/04/global-food-producers-climate-crisis,"The world’s biggest producers of meat, dairy and seafood are failing to tackle the enormous impact they are having on the planet through deforestation, the routine use of antibiotics and greenhouse gas emissions, a report warns. The Coller Fairr index ranks 50 of the largest global meat, dairy and fish producers by looking at risk factors from use of antibiotics to deforestation and labour abuses. The producers are the “hidden” supply chain, providing meat and dairy to global brands including McDonald’s, Tesco, Nestlé and Walmart. The index is written by investment experts who want to encourage awareness of the risks posed to the planet – and to their own profitability – by companies that fail to mitigate the damage done to the environment by food production. Jeremy Coller is founder of Fairr and chief investment officer at Coller Capital. He says it is the huge companies behind the brands that will themselves suffer if the planet isn’t protected. “It is the companies hidden upstream in the meat and dairy supply chain who face the most significant climate and public health risks. “As last month’s landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) demonstrated, the world’s meat, fish and dairy industries are under serious threat from climate change impacts. In stark contrast to the transport sector, only one in four meat, fish and dairy producers even measure their greenhouse gas emissions, let alone act to reduce them.” Among other failings, the index says that none of the companies analysed have a comprehensive policy to stop deforestation. And just four companies in the index “have committed to phasing out routine use of antibiotics, widespread in the industry”. According to the report, two-thirds of producers do not even measure all their greenhouse gas emissions let alone set targets to reduce them. These include Hormel Foods in the US, a supplier to McDonald’s. Also included is Cal-Maine Foods. Cal-Maine is the largest producer of fresh eggs in the US and a supplier to Walmart and Nestle. Nestlé, McDonald’s and Walmart have all publicly committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And while Walmart has previously said it wants to achieve zero net deforestation in its supply chain by 2020, the research shows that Walmart suppliers such as Cranswick in the UK have no comprehensive policy on deforestation. McDonald’s have pledged to reduce antibiotics use in their beef supply chains. But the vast majority of beef suppliers do not have a policy to avoid routine use of antibiotics. Only one – Marfrig – does. The companies are ranked according to their risk for investors, based on analysis of nine key environmental, social and governance risk factors, combined with the sustainable development goals. The Hong Kong-based WH Group were noted as “high risk” while Hormel Foods and Cranswick were designated as “medium risk”. The research argues that some of the companies, who between them have a value of $300bn (£248bn), are already suffering the costs of the deepening climate crisis. Cal-Maine Foods reported a 30% decline in revenues in the last quarter of the year alone due to extreme weather. Peter Van der Werf is an engagement specialist at investment firm Robeco, advising on how to invest sustainably. He told the Guardian that research into the environmental risks of food production is vital. “This is very important research. As investment managers we take a lot of care assessing risk – for example an analyst looking at food production needs to have a good understanding of climate change risks … like deforestation, loss of feed supply that comes through cattle grazing on depleted land, use of water.” Van der Werf says that he can see progress being made as producers are made aware of the benefit of considering environmental risks. “Companies were previously reluctant to show an interest in alternative proteins like fake meat, but we have seen a huge growth in demand. We started engagement over labour safety and use of antibiotics and over three years we have clearly seen an engagement and awareness. Now Tyson Foods, for example, has climate targets. They didn’t have that before.” He says the end aim is for producers and investors to move away from meat and fish as protein sources as much as possible. “The fires we have seen in the Amazon have come up in conversations with investors. They are concerned about climate change, about forest fires. There is a global need to further reduce reliance on meat and dairy and look at different protein choices.” A spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union told the Guardian that there is a commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions in the UK farming industry by 2040. He said this will be achieved through improving efficiency and animal welfare, managing carbon storage on farms and boosting renewable energy. The Guardian contacted the companies named but at the time of publication had not received responses from all of them. Nestle said: “The Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Standard sets out sustainability practices that we ask our suppliers, their employees, agents and subcontractors to respect and adhere to at all times. In addition, we run a responsible sourcing program for 15 high-priority raw materials, including meat, poultry and eggs and dairy. For these materials, our work starts by mapping our supply chain all the way down to the farm or slaughterhouse. When suppliers refuse to improve, we will remove them from our supply chain.” Walmart said: “We believe that both collaborative action and traceability across our global supply chain are needed to reduce deforestation associated with the production of beef and soy in Brazil. We’re working with the Consumer Goods Forum, the Tropical Forest Alliance and the Statement of Support Group for the Cerrado Manifesto as we work toward our goal to reduce deforestation.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “Food is at the heart of our business, and our commitment to sustainable sourcing is recognised by FAIRR both in this report and its recent ‘Appetite for disruption’ report, where Tesco topped the retail ranking for our focus on sustainable protein. We set ourselves ambitious and transparent sustainability targets, including across carbon reduction, biodiversity and tackling deforestation, which we will meet through working in partnership with our suppliers.” Tyson Foods said: “We recently announced a science-based target to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 as well as a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund focused on increasing sustainable farming practices on more than 2m acres of row crop corn by 2020. This is the largest commitment ever made by a US protein company, and we will be reporting on our progress over time.” Hormel said: “As a global branded food company, we take our sustainability practices very seriously. We are working toward achieving our 2020 goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and non-renewable energy use by 10% by 2020. “We are pleased to see the report highlighted our company as one of the leaders in the industry and showcased Hormel Foods for our best practices for water usage. Additionally, the report singled out Hormel Foods as being the only company that has established a sustainable agricultural policy that extends to feed-grain growers.”",Environment; Meat industry; Farming; Food; Deforestation; Climate crisis; Conservation; Trees and forests,Environment
2020-04-08T06:00:10Z,Fund manager channels fees to tackle coronavirus in developing world,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/fund-manager-channels-fees-to-tackle-coronavirus-in-developing-world,"A London investment manager is launching a campaign to encourage investors to support communities in the developing world hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Alquity’s 40-40 campaign aims to improve the lives of 40,000 people in countries where overcrowded living conditions, chronic ill health and weak public health systems leave the population at risk from coronavirus. Through 40-40, which launches on Thursday, Alquity will donate 40% of its management fees from new investments to programmes which support vulnerable people in emerging markets. It hopes that this will channel $1m (£800,000) to good causes. “The 40-40 campaign is our response to the severe economic and social hardship the Covid-19 epidemic will cause many people around the world,” said Alquity’s chairman, Paul Robinson. Alquity is also worried that the financial impacts of quarantining are more damaging for those on low incomes in emerging markets, as people have fewer savings and little regulatory protection. “As some of the freedoms and comforts we are used to in developed countries are dramatically reduced, we are getting a glimpse of what daily life is like for a some of the poorest people on the planet,” Robinson said. Alquity wants clients to sign up to its campaign and signal their support for sustainable economic development. “By signing up to the 40-40 partnership agreement, in addition to the enhanced donation, investors will be signalling their commitment to creating a fairer, more sustainable world,” said Alquity’s co-founder, Suresh Mistry. Alquity runs a range of funds which invest in emerging markets. Founded in 2009, it uses environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards when choosing which stocks to buy. It already donates at least 10% of its management fees to charitable causes, as a “social investment”, and will raise this to 40% for money invested through the campaign. Since launching its Transforming Lives Foundation in 2011, Alquity has donated around $2m – which it says has helped some 60,000 people. One project backed by Alquity, called Phool, recycles flowers from Indian temples into incense sticks, which are then sold. This has provided income for more than 1,200 women, and prevented the flowers from being thrown away into rivers. It has also supported educational projects in Vietnam, Uganda and Brazil, women’s employment projects in Ghana and Mexico, and waste collection groups in India and Kenya. Several of these projects have already been disrupted by the pandemic.",Ethical business; Ethical money; Coronavirus; Investment funds; Business; Money,Business
2020-06-01T20:47:47Z,Q+A: Matt Canavan grilled on climate change and family links to coal industry,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/qa-matt-canavan-grilled-on-climate-change-and-family-links-to-coal-industry,"The Nationals senator Matt Canavan has been grilled over his criticism of action against climate change during an episode of Q+A where he was also asked to clarify his family’s links to the coal industry. In an episode that also featured opposition agriculture and resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon defending his call for Labor to adopt the government’s target of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2030, and independent MP Zali Steggall attacking Fitzgibbon for his views on gas extraction, Canavan was pushed by host Hamish Macdonald about his “interests” in the coal industry. Canavan’s vocal support of the coal industry has included calls for new coal-fired power stations, despite his moderate government colleagues opposing the idea. But the senator pointed out he had disclosed his brother’s senior position in the coal industry during his maiden speech to the Senate. “I hardly started talking about the coal industry yesterday ... I have been elected on that platform, to develop our country and keep our jobs here. I think the best way of doing that is making sure we do not deny ourselves the cheapest form of power and energy,” Canavan said. “The Australian people have never voted for net zero emissions ... We seem to try and get bullied into these positions that the Australian people didn’t vote for.” When asked why the government was able to accept experts’ views when forming its coronavirus response but not when its climate change response, Canavan likened conflicting views of the impact of climate change to epidemiologists who differed on how drastic they thought lockdowns should be. “There are very, very different scientific views being put on this issue. So it’s not quite right to say that we just accepted the science,” he said, noting some experts have said governments are too strict, while others have said governments, like in Sweden, are too relaxed about lockdowns. “These are very hard questions ... And it’s the same thing with climate change science. “If you read the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report, the level of uncertainty around temperature increases from a doubling of carbon emissions has increased in the last 10 years. Increased. There’s no consensus on exactly what that figure will be,” Canavan said. Canavan also criticised the Paris climate agreement – something he has called for Australia to abandon – arguing the agreement is “transferring industrial wealth from the west and from Australia to China, a country that’s bullying and threatening us”. Fitzgibbon argued “the market will never” build a new coal-fired power station in Australia, and defended his position for Labor adopting the government’s climate targets, “if we can get there [26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030] without causing people economic harm, then surely then we’ve got a stronger platform from which to sell a more meaningful policy”. He also reiterated his support for coalmining – a significant employer in his electorate of Hunter – and said his backing of zero net emissions and support for the industry were not mutually exclusive. In calling for greater gas extraction to fill any shortfalls in energy production left by reductions in coal-fired power, Fitzgibbon said, “our manufacturing plants will not compete either domestically or internationally if we don’t get more gas out of the ground”. “Domestic prices will go up if we do not get more gas out of the ground. And I get angry when I see state governments putting bans or moratoriums on gas in their own states, and then importing it from other states, and allowing others to take any environmental risks that might be involved,” he said. Steggall called Fitzgibbon’s argument “completely inconsistent”. “You’ve just indicated that you’re committed to net zero. We cannot be increasing gas out of the ground ... gas is as high in terms of emissions as coal,” she said. Fitzgibbon responded: “Do you really think, Zali, really, that we’re going to have enough renewables in the system to replace that baseload power and battery storage? No.” Steggall replied: “Absolutely.” Zoe Whitton, Citi ESG analyst and Investor Group on Climate Change, also criticised increased gas extraction, saying “investors are very uncertain and hesitant about it”. Macdonald asked Steggall if she was “picking and choosing” when to use experts’ opinions, after she cited chief scientist Alan Finkel’s work when making a point earlier in the program, but later rejected his views on gas being a transition fuel in 30 years. Steggall denied she was picking and choosing when to rely on experts’ arguments, and said she disagreed with Finkel on gas because his view was at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan.",Q+A; Climate crisis; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; Australia news; Australian media; Australian politics; Environment; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Coal; Fossil fuels; Energy,Australia news
2018-06-18T06:26:52Z,UK pension funds get green light to dump fossil fuel investments,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/18/uk-pension-funds-get-green-light-to-dump-fossil-fuel-investments,"Managers of the £1.5tn invested in Britain’sworkplace pension schemes are to be given new powers to dump shares in oil, gas and coal companies in favour of long-term investment in green and “social impact” opportunities. Government proposals published on Monday are designed to give pension fund trustees more confidence to divest from environmentally damaging fossil fuels and put their cash in green alternatives if it meets their members’ wishes. Until now many pension trustees have been hamstrung by fiduciary duties that they feel requires them to seek the best returns irrespective of the threat of climate change. The new rules, though couched in opaque legalese, are a coded go-ahead for pension funds to sell shares in fossil fuel companies if they believe that they could turn into “stranded assets”. The term refers to companies’ coal, oil and gas deposits that may not ever be monetised as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. In the paper published on Monday, Clarifying and Strengthening Trustees’ Investment Duties, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: “Our proposed regulations are intended to reassure trustees that they can (and indeed should) take account of financially material risks, whether these stem from investee firms’ traditional financial reporting, or from broader risks covered in non-financial reporting or elsewhere.” Environmental campaigners reckon that investments amounting to trillions of dollars in fossil fuels – coal mines, oil wells, power stations, conventional vehicles – will lose their value when the world moves decisively to a low-carbon economy. They believe that fossil fuel reserves and production facilities will become stranded assets, having absorbed capital but are unable to be used to make a profit. This carbon bubble has been estimated at between $1tn (£753m) and $4tn, a large chunk of the global economy’s balance sheet. But the DWP warned that the new rules do not give carte blanche for activist groups to bully pension funds into selling out of fossil fuels. “These proposals are not intended to give any support to activist groups for boycotts or divestment from certain assets,” the DWP paper said. “Trustees have primacy in investment decisions and, whilst they should not necessarily rule out the ability to take account of members’ views, they are never obliged to, and the prime focus is to deliver a return to members.” Unison, the public sector union, launched a campaign in January to encourage local government pension funds – which have invested £16bn in the fossil fuel industry – to divest from carbon. The new rules, subject to a consultation period, have been brought forward by secretary of state for work and pensions, Esther McVey. “As we see the younger generation care more about where their money is going, they are also increasingly questioning that their pensions are invested in a way that aligns with their values,” she said. “This money can now be used to build a more sustainable, fairer and equal society for future generations.” Climate change campaigners said they were delighted at the proposals. Bethan Livesey, head of policy at ShareAction, said: “ShareAction has been pushing for changes to these regulations for years. “For too long, many pension schemes have disclosed little more than vague, high-level statements on their approach to ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] factors, and it is unclear what, if anything, is being done behind the scenes. “Pension schemes seem to fall into three camps: those who understand the financial value of taking ESG factors seriously and do so, those who say they understand but do very little and those who have no clue. These changes to the regulations should at the very least enlighten the third group.” A growing number of UK and European insurance companies have started selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. More than £15bn has been divested by insurers including Allianz, Aviva, Axa, Legal &amp; General, Swiss Re and Zurich in the past two years, according to Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. Last week Legal &amp; General said it would exclude China Construction Bank, Russia’s Rosneft, the Japanese carmaker Subaru and five other companies that have failed to act on climate change from its Future World Fund. The Rockefeller Family Fund, a charitable fund of the Rockefeller family, which made its fortune from Standard Oil, has started divesting from fossil fuel holdings. However, Cambridge University has just ruled out divesting from oil and gas in its £6.3bn endowment fund – despite public pressure from hundreds of academics and a hunger strike by three undergraduates. Cambridge said it had no direct investment in fossil fuel companies and wanted to avoid any direct investment in coal and tar sands, while keeping indirect investment to a minimum.",Pensions industry; Oil; Business; Pensions; Money; Fossil fuels; Oil; Energy; Environment; UK news,Business
2019-10-12T11:02:37Z,"Fossil fuel bosses must change or be voted out, says asset manager",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/12/fossil-fuel-bosses-change-voted-out-asset-manager,"The world’s biggest fossil fuel companies must take action on climate change or their directors could face being voted out of their jobs, the head of one of the world’s leading asset managers has warned. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Ron O’Hanley, the chief executive of State Street, said his firm could consider taking the radical step of voting against the reappointment of entire company boards if they were not taking sufficient action to deal with the climate crisis. While it would be “very dangerous” to vote out directors without reason, he said State Street could resort to the measure if it judged company managers were not reacting to the risks climate change posed to their business model or engaging with the transition away from oil, gas and coal. With fossil fuel companies under increasing pressure to tackle the climate emergency, O’Hanley’s remarks could signal a new attitude by asset managers, who are also under growing pressure to behave responsibly. State Street is a Boston-based money manager that oversees stocks, bonds and other financial assets worth $2.2tn (£1.8tn) for pension schemes, university endowments and insurance companies. It is the third largest manager in the world behind BlackRock and Vanguard. Together they are known as the big three. State Street handles investments worth at least $38.3bn in publicly listed fossil fuel companies, according to an analysis for the Guardian by InfluenceMap. Its stakes afford it a say on company directors, as well shareholder decisions on improving emissions disclosures and ensuring companies are aligned with the Paris agreement. The State Street boss pointed to its “aggressive” historical voting record on issues such as gender diversity on boards, and suggested climate change could become a priority, but refused to give a defined timescale. Large asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard have faced criticism for routinely voting against efforts to improve climate-related financial disclosures, appointing board directors to deal with climate-related business risk and publishing substantive emissions data. State Street’s record is mixed, although O’Hanley’s comments could signal an escalation in the firm’s approach. “If we conclude that a company’s board is not taking into account these risks then we will either vote all the board out or we’ll use our vote against the board or we’ll use it against individuals on the board that we think should be acting and aren’t,” he said. “So it could be against the company chairman, against the head of the risk committee, but that is our strongest tool, our vote. And it’s a powerful tool because although it only takes a majority for someone to be voted in, typically if a significant minority has voted against a particular individual on the board that’s generally taken as a lack of confidence and that will cause the person to leave, so these votes are important. It’s a high responsibility and we understand that.“ Large asset managers, who do not own companies but exercise shareholder powers on behalf of clients, are uniquely positioned to hold the boards of oil and gas companies to account on the climate crisis and ensure a green energy transition. O’Hanley told the Guardian that State Street preferred to discuss politically sensitive corporate governance issues such as the climate crisis, background checks on gun purchases in the US and board diversity in private with companies at first, opting to use its voting power as a last resort to demand action. He added: “Our work doesn’t revolve just around the vote. I mean at this moment, now, the entire team is out engaging with our various portfolio companies. They do this all day every day and they’re, on a company-by-company basis, developing a perspective on whether or not the board has this. “But I think it’s very dangerous to just say that every oil and gas company ought to have its board voted out. I mean … Put it this way, some of the best technology that’s going to get us through this is actually coming from oil and gas companies, right, if you look at what some of them are doing on renewables. “Carbon capture, the leading carbon capture technology at the moment is Occidental [Petroleum]. Without Occidental, society wouldn’t be as far along as it is on carbon capture. It’s not as easy as saying let’s just vote the whole lot out.” Negative emissions technology such as carbon capture has been put forward by the oil and gas industry as a solution to the climate crisis, but there is widespread scepticism about its long-term viability. Pushed on when State Street would start using its vote more aggressively, O’Hanley said: “We engage as investment analysts do with each of the companies, determine where they are in dealing with this risk and overseeing this risk. And if our conclusion is they’re not then we will take a vote, but we don’t have a quota of votes. “It could be very much in the next season, it could be in 15 years we’re voting out people.” The asset management veteran also agreed that the industry must do more to improve disclosures around green and sustainable investing. Asked why State Street offered some fossil-fuel-free investment funds that had clear exposure to the fossil fuel industry, O’Hanley said his company was working hard to improve information about so-called environmental, sustainable and governance (ESG) investing, the acronym used for green investing. “One person’s ESG isn’t another person’s ESG. Part of this comes down to definitions and again, we would completely agree with you that there needs to be some kind of measurement here. We’re working quite hard on that. We’re working with some of the largest index providers in the world and you will see us announcing a few tools in a very short time frame that will help address that very problem that you’re stating,” O’Hanley said.",Environment; Oil and gas companies; Business; Energy industry; Oil; Gas; Climate crisis; Commodities; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; US news; World news,Environment
2020-05-14T18:26:49Z,Paul Epworth's lockdown listening: 'People recommend me records that don’t even exist',https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/14/paul-epworth-lockdown-listening-tony-allen-jazz,"I don’t have a studio space at home because of noise levels, so I’ve brought a laptop home and am working on headphones, and it’s been a challenge. But I’m not on the frontline of the NHS, so it’s a moment of gratitude in many ways. I’ve got two young kids who are out of school, and the opportunity to give them 110% attention is amazing. And it’s a moment for us as a species to pause and think about what we’re doing, and everyone’s going to appreciate everyone they love who’s got through this period. I’ve been listening to Khruangbin’s last two albums – this playful Meters-meets-ESG ambience rolling in the house has become a soundtrack to this experience. Also Arthur Verocai, a Brazilian composer; really creative stuff with amazing brass and string arrangements. His self-titled album [released in 1972] is one of those weird languid atmospheres we’ve been living in as the sun’s shining. Plus a bit of Lonnie Liston Smith. I’ve rediscovered Jimi Tenor and what a mercurial genius he is, including his album, Exocosmos. I don’t know that many people who have managed to forge a career in the last 20 years that is truly as good as the film score greats: he’s got that mad 60s Lalo Schifrin thing, and that Brian Wilson or Joe Meek sense of ambition. The music I’m about to release is like a 70s concept album about space, but an updated one. So going back to these really virtuoso moments has been part of the journey: rediscovering this weird and wonderful music with a combination of overt musicality and eccentric production that I find fascinating. As far as newer stuff goes, I’ve discovered 100 gecs – it’s like future mutant indie, bits of trap music, a bit of Crystal Castles or Sleigh Bells dystopian 8-bit … Super modern production but it’s quite lo-fi. The Paul Institute’s records – there’s a sense of real honest integrity to the fact that no one but Jai Paul and AK Paul could have made them. They’re part Daniele Baldelli, part Phil Collins, part J Dilla, part Bollywood film score and part D’Angelo. If you sat down with a piece of paper and said, “This is what I want my music to sound like”, you could never do it. It doesn’t feel self-conscious, and it’s effortlessly cool. I’ve been listening to Tony Allen, who died recently – possibly the greatest drummer who ever lived. I was obsessed for about 25 years with the music he made with Fela Kuti, but the newer electronic records he made with Jeff Mills, Moritz Von Oswald Trio and Motor City Drum Ensemble are all amazing, too. I would never call myself a drummer, but I have played drums on a few records people don’t know I’ve played on, like Paul McCartney’s Queenie Eye – it wasn’t on my bucket list, but I’ll take it! It takes learning a bit of drums before you realise how amazing Tony Allen was, how he changed a rhythm and feel from track to track so subtly. There are loads of players who have been inspired by him, like Yussef Dayes who I was lucky enough to play with recently. He also has his own amazing, unique style; by the time he’s Tony Allen’s age, he may have had the same impact. To take it to another modern context, you could also look at the way the rap producer Mike Will Made It does hi-hat programming – it always seems to lead a rapper to the bounce of their flow. From my experience of watching people listen to a beat or a drum track, the subtleties of the hi-hat or the way the drums are played, that’s what an artist is going to use to find the melody and the rhythm. I’m some way on my journey to study it, and I still feel like I don’t know anything! I’ve spent the last few years listening to loads of spiritual jazz, obsessing over Sun Ra and discovering Alice Coltrane; growing up I also listened to a lot of jazz, the Miles Davis electric stuff and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Once you go into that world, it’s infinite. People start recommending you records that don’t even exist – you have to go to some record market in Brazil to find them and they only pressed 10 copies. It feels like an adventure. The idea that music is a spiritual pursuit, a representation of an artist’s consciousness, and the idea of spirit as universe – all this really struck a chord with me, as did the infinity of possibility. The interest in jazz has reignited over the past few years more generally, from kids rediscovering musicianship as a way to push the envelope more than production. By the middle of the last decade, every production trick in the house had been used on every single record. So for musicians around the world, but particularly in LA – Thundercat, Flying Lotus, that whole Brainfeeder scene, Dorian Concept – jazz ceased being a dirty word and it was something to be nurtured and respected. The magic of playing together with a bunch of musicians who are really great, when you get that feel together and you click, it’s something you can’t put your finger on, and that in itself feels like a sort of spiritual connection. It’s like Frank Zappa said: music’s always out there, you just have to reach out and plug in. • Love Galaxy by Paul Epworth (feat Lil Silva and Jay Electronica) is out now",Music; Culture; Jazz; Electronic music; Tony Allen; Pop and rock; Psychedelia,Music
2019-02-22T13:41:34Z,Just how ethical is ethical investment?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/22/just-how-ethical-is-ethical-investment,"Supposedly environmental stock market indices used to help investors allocate hundreds of billions of pounds in investments include some of the world’s biggest contributors to fossil fuel pollution. Index providers including FTSE Russell, MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Stoxx all run indices that take into account environmental, social and corporate governance concerns known as ESG. FTSE Russell, owned by the London Stock Exchange, says it has a “hard exclusion” for coal companies from its FTSE4Good ethical indices, after it was decided that the most-polluting major fossil fuel did not fit its criteria for a sustainable future. However, major coal producers including BHP and Anglo American are included because they are listed as “general mining” firms rather than coal companies. FTSE Russell refused to provide the Guardian with a full list of index constituents but publicly available factsheets indicate that 34 oil and gas related companies account for 3.4% of the FTSE4Good developed index by market capitalisation. The inclusion of major oil and coal companies on indices is likely to prompt concerns about the term ESG being used to “greenwash” the reputations of major polluters. The New York-headquartered MSCI claims that investors worldwide have used its ESG indices to direct well over £200bn in investments since 2014. Fund managers such as Blackrock and Vanguard sell investors products such as exchange-traded funds, which track the performance of ESG indices. Savers whose money is invested using these indices may be unaware that they are funding fossil fuel extraction, said Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “In today’s world, many people buying products labelled ‘4 Good’ may expect that a fund created to take into account environmental impact would not include oil or other fossil fuel companies,” he said. “The stark reality is that to achieve the targets of the Paris agreement and avoid huge impacts on billions of people as well as massive biodiversity loss, there will have to be drastic changes to the way we power our societies, move around, grow much of our food and look after the natural world. Including oil companies in funds that are marketed as protecting the environment won’t help that transformation – it will slow it down.” Some index providers argue that ESG indices can be used to give greater weight to those companies which do better than their peers on various sustainability issues. Linda-Eling Lee, global head of ESG research at MSCI, told the Guardian this “competitive logic” can give companies incentives to improve their operations. MSCI’s indices favour those companies that “are actually paying attention to these emerging or latent ESG risks”, she said. All of the index firms provide detailed methodologies for their indices, assigning clearly defined ESG scores to companies. However, the scoring systems used by some indices only count direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions, such as those from company vehicles or offices – ignoring the much larger emissions from burning fossil fuels extracted by energy companies, known as scope 3 emissions. David Harris, the group head of sustainable business at the London Stock Exchange Group, said scope 3 emissions calculations are not suitable for index creation. “Scope 3 is a great concept but if you want to use it for investment purposes there’s very little data,” he said. FTSE Russell’s aim instead was on “raising the standards over time” by engaging with companies on the indices on their environmental practices, with the threat of them being thrown off if they do not improve, he said. He ruled out excluding the entire oil and gas sector from FTSE4Good indices, saying divestment from those companies would mean forfeiting the ability to bring investor pressure to bear. Spokespeople for MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones and Stoxx also cited engagement with companies as a key reason for retaining polluters on indices. All of the index providers argued that they offer investors choices for how they structure their portfolios and that it was not their responsibility to rule out entire sectors. The index firms do offer sub-indices that exclude fossil fuel producers and they run profitable and growing businesses that can produce bespoke indices for investors. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “It’s daft that these oil, gas, and mining giants are allowed to be labelled as businesses with ‘strong environmental practices’ when their whole business model is predicated on extracting and burning fossil fuels. This speaks to a wider need for regulatory clarification on what constitutes a green investment but in the meantime a little common sense wouldn’t go amiss.” She added: “Investment firms and index providers must take responsibility for the products they market to consumers and implement stricter rules for qualifying for ESG indices. So much is at stake.” Index providers have previously resisted activist pressure to adjust their ESG indices but the activists have also scored some notable successes. Dow Jones Sustainability Indices removed Golden Agri-Resources, a Singapore-listed palm oil company, from ESG benchmarks in December, after Friends of the Earth accused the index of “greenwashing” a company behind deforestation. “There’s a lot of hiding behind opaque metrics of what sustainability investing is,” said Gaurav Madan, senior forests and lands campaigner at FoE in the US. He added that companies “hide behind [the] idea of engagement” with boards to improve practices.",Ethical business; Stock markets; Corporate governance; Investing; Business; UK news; Dow Jones; FTSE; Greenpeace; Environment; US news,Business
2020-07-11T20:00:21Z,From Covid-19 to climate: what's next after the global oil and gas industry crash?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/12/from-covid-19-to-climate-whats-next-after-the-global-oil-and-gas-industry-crash,"The global oil and gas industry has crashed. In mid-June, BP – formerly British Petroleum – slashed the value of its assets by US$17.5bn and revealed plans to cut its workforce by 15%. It forecast the price of oil would be a third lower than expected for decades to come and said it may be forced to leave new fossil fuel discoveries in the ground. It was later joined by Royal Dutch Shell, which announced its own US$22bn writedown, with its vast gas business – including major liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments in Australia – expected to take the heaviest toll. Wood Mackenzie, a global energy research and consultancy group, says the fall in value is industry-wide, estimating US$1.6tn has been wiped from the sector this year, with more to come. While oil and gas are not alone in struggling in the face of biggest economic slump in nearly a century, WoodMac says its carnage cannot solely be blamed on Covid-19. The economic reality of the climate crisis is also starting to bite. “It’s about fundamental change hitting the entire oil and gas sector,” WoodMac’s vice-president for corporate analysis, Luke Parker, said. “Just a few years ago, few within the oil and gas industry would even countenance ideas of climate risk, peak demand, stranded assets, liquidation business models and so on. Today, companies are building strategies around these ideas.” If that reflects the global picture, the story among Australia’s oil and gas businesses – which until recently have been enjoying booming growth selling LNG to Asia, and driving most of the increase in national greenhouse gas emissions – is less clear. The idea of stranded assets due to climate change is not new. It suggests carbon-intensive projects potentially worth trillions risk becoming next-to worthless – stranded – if investors abandon them in favour of emissions-free technology, as required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. In Australia, the risk is recognised by the country’s major financial institutions and regulators, and has increasingly become a focus of shareholders. Earlier this year they gave resolutions calling for climate action and transparency at oil and gas companies Woodside Energy and Santos more than 50% and more than 40% support, respectively. Activist shareholders are not persuaded by suggestions support for gas is justified as it emits less than coal when burned, and point to studies suggesting it may release more emissions than previously thought. ‘Double-whammy effect’ On coal, where the concept of climate risk is increasingly accepted, Australia’s second-largest superannuation fund, First State Super, last week announced it would divest from any company that earns more than 10% of revenue from thermal coal mining. It followed an earlier, similar statement by Hesta, and three of Australia’s four major banks promising to soon stop supporting thermal coal. But the possibility of major assets being stranded is only occasionally acknowledged across politics, media and the industry. The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, responded to First State Super’s announcement by saying it was “mystifying” that a fund would deny its members a “solid and attractive investment opportunity” in coal based on “misguided ideology”. Australian oil and gas companies have been hurt by the shutdown, with decisions on more than $80bn of new LNG projects put on hold and Oil Search this month laying off a third of its workforce. But the local industry’s public position on what the future holds differs from its competitors in Europe. In response to questions about Shell and BP’s writedowns, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), representing oil and gas producers, did not mention climate risk. Andrew McConville, Appea’s chief executive, said Covid-19 and the ongoing low oil price were having a “double-whammy effect” and that it would remain an “incredibly challenging time” for the sector even after the broader economy began to recover. But he said the industry was accustomed to cyclical commodity prices and would be “here for the long term”. “Energy demand, and oil demand with it, will recover as travel restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes over time,” McConville said. “The right regulatory and fiscal policy settings will help ensure that Australia remains a competitive destination for oil and gas investments into the future.” The Morrison government agrees, having backed the idea of a “gas-fired recovery” from coronavirus after a drop in domestic gas prices. Its National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, led by the former Fortescue Metals executive Nev Power, has focused on gas-related recommendations. Neither the government nor the commission has explained how lower gas prices would encourage increased private investment unless it is backed by substantial public support. Even if that were in the offing, analysts believe maintaining low prices would be a pipe dream given production costs in new Australian gas fields are recognised to be high. This, in part, is what is driving the push to install gas import terminals along the Australian east coast. While it may seem ridiculous to starting buying fossil fuels from overseas while the country mines huge amounts for export, experts believe it may be the cheapest gas option – if the Morrison government and industry are determined to back new gas infrastructure rather than accelerate a switch to cheaper renewable energy. Big investors may ultimately drive change Analysts and investor representatives say it is still unclear how much weight climate risk will be given in oil and gas investment decisions in Australia in the short-to-medium term. Zoe Whitton, the head of ESG research with the financial services multinational Citi, says Australia’s outlook is arguably different to some other oil and gas producers as it mostly extracts gas, not oil. It also mostly sells to north Asian countries, where investment patterns are less clear and have been interpreted as backing both fossil fuels and renewable energy. It means that compared to Europe, views on gas still range from it being seen as a legitimate transition fuel to any support for it being clearly at odds with where the rest of the world is pulling. Whitton says investors are increasingly, but not uniformly, in the latter camp. “The local [companies] face the same pressure that the internationals do,” she says. “There is a process of negotiation going on between companies and investors, but I don’t expect the locals will respond to the global signal in a uniform way or a rapid way.” Whitton believes the future of the local gas industry may be clearer once world-leading models published recently by more than 60 central banks, under the banner of the Network for Greening the Financial System, give a local, rather than just a global, picture. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has begun the job of producing that data. It could, for example, give investors a better picture of whether Santos’s controversial $3.6bn Narrabri coal-seam gas proposal has a viable future. “The truth is gas may be a transition fuel for some regions, but not at any price and not forever,” Whitton says. “So the question is at what price, and for how long?” Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors with funds worth about $2tn, says there is clear evidence an industry-wide structural change is under way. “Covid is to some extent attaching a rocket to a trend we were seeing anyway,” she says. She says Australia is part of that trend, but agrees with Whitton that it is a slightly different conversation than in some parts of the world. “Australia is saying its gas will continue to be competitive and its markets will hold up as others go down. The big question is: is that true?” Herd says if there is any analysis to support the idea that the local gas industry will thrive while others crash it has not been publicly released. The lack of information is driving calls for fossil fuel companies to release data on their “scope 3 emissions” – in basic terms, the carbon pollution that results from the fossil fuels a company sells. Herd says including information on scope 3 emissions in financial reporting is vital for investors to understand financial risk in a world that has pledged to cut emissions, and driving the push at recent annual general meetings for greater disclosure. “The obvious question is if Shell and BP can do it, why can’t Australian companies to the same extent?” she says. “What we need to see for our gas companies is reporting at the asset [project] level, not just at the company level. We need the data to assess risk. That could change the viability of some of their projects.” Australia’s oil and gas companies did not engage on the question of climate risk. Santos declined to comment while spokespeople for Woodside and Origin Energy said the companies periodically reviewed their portfolio of assets. Origin said several factors contributed to the valuation “including commodity prices, interest rates, exchange rates and costs”. Whitton suggests big investors, who may ultimately drive change faster than governments, have additional criteria. “A lot of investors are saying ‘look, if I have 10 futures and if in five of those futures gas is an answer and in five it is not, but renewable energy is an answer in all 10, then you can see where the greater risk lies,” she says. “The reality is when you have a really wide range of future scenarios the risk of stranded assets is higher. And the risk of stranded assets is higher in Australia just by dint of the higher likelihood that people will take a bet on oil and gas compared to the EU, where they won’t.”",Energy; Climate crisis; Business; Australia news; Oil; Gas; Fossil fuels; Environment,Environment
2020-02-19T06:30:48Z,The European Green Deal will bypass the poor and go straight to the rich | Daniela Gabor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/european-green-deal-polish-miners,"When Josep Borrell, the EU’s newly appointed foreign policy chief, recently caused outrage by dismissing young climate activists as flaky sufferers of “Greta syndrome”, he made not just a serious error of judgment but a serious mistake in macroeconomics. It was a mistake that is symptomatic of the dire state of European economic debate after a decade of austerity and schwarze Null (balanced budget) ideas. “The idea that young people are seriously committed to fighting climate change – we could call it the ‘Greta syndrome’ – allows me to doubt that,” Borrell said, before going on to question their naivety about the cost of tackling the climate crisis. “I would like to know if young people demonstrating in Berlin … are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, because if we fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.” For Borell, greening the European economy is a zero-sum game, in which paying for the move to a low-carbon economy must come out of the pockets of German taxpayers. Borrell’s views, however unpalatably delivered, are perfectly aligned with the flawed macroeconomics of the much-vaunted European Green Deal. The clue is in the name. The European Green Deal is the European commission’s proposed €1tn plan to finance the transition away from fossil fuels to decarbonising Europe’s economy. But the commission quietly dropped the word “new” from original US plans for a green new deal, which of course echo Franklin D Roosevelt’s Depression-era economic New Deal. Losing that “new” is a signal that the commission does not seek system change through ambitious green macroeconomics and tough regulation of carbon financiers. Rather, it takes a politics as usual, third-way approach that seeks to nudge the market towards decarbonisation. The macroeconomics of the European Green Deal remains trapped in the black zero logic of austerity. Instead of ambitious green fiscal activism, it mostly reshuffles existing European funds through a logic of seed funding to mobilise private sector money. Public money will be used to take risk out of private business activities and finance a “just transition” mechanism that promises to protect groups like Polish miners after their coal mines close through retraining and reskilling programmes. But there is little guarantee that European taxpayer money will reach Polish miners. It will probably go into the pockets of decarbonisation “barons”: clever local elites who will funnel transition money to their businesses, just as land barons siphoned most of the subsidies originally intended for small farmers under the common agricultural policy. Take Romania. Mining unions there complain that measures intended to “reskill’ miners, tested in the Valea Jiului region in Transylvania for the past 15 years, solely benefitted decarbonisation firms. Their connections to Romania’s political elites allowed them to capture the “market” for reskilling services, but private investment and jobs in new economic sectors never actually materialised. In dismissing green macroeconomics, the European commission puts its hopes on private finance. The logic is that the state won’t have to pay if the private sector will, provided there is nudging from public funds to “derisk” green investments. Here, the commission seems to have powerful allies, such as institutional investors with trillions ready to be greened. Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, recently noted that “we are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance” by taking decarbonisation seriously. The turn to green finance is a welcome step given that BlackRock and other global investors have so far behaved more like greenwashing carbon financiers than responsible climate investors: talking green while consistently blocking climate shareholder resolutions. But the danger is that the public money the commission plans to put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing. Think of it as a two-step strategy through which carbon financiers can turn climate into a profitable business. The first step involves shaping the rules of the game, such as the “green list” of assets (or “green taxonomy”) currently being negotiated by the EU institutions. The EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has important advantages over the private environmental ratings (known as ESG ratings) currently used by private finance to identify green assets. Drawing on a broader range of views, including climate experts, the EU taxonomy sets a public standard of green that makes it more difficult for carbon financiers to purchase green ratings privately. Done properly, it could become a global standard for measuring and regulating the environmental performance of global finance. But the EU list risks being watered down in the ongoing political negotiations over the exact details of what constitutes “green” activities. Already, furious lobbying has led to the inclusion of a category of “enabling” activities under the auspices of “pathways to green”. These could easily become loopholes for activities that are more brown than green. The incentive for carbon financiers is to stick the label green everywhere they can in preparation for the second step: persuading European regulators to promote (de-risk) green assets. Meanwhile the commission refuses to talk about – let alone regulate – “brown finance”. Yet the strict regulation of brown finance could be a powerful tool for financing the European Green Deal. The commission could impose penalties on brown assets, either through taxation (a green FTT) or regulation, thus accelerating the switch to green assets. Those outraged by Borrell’s dismissive remarks about Greta Thunberg’s generation should note that the real political battle is to ensure that the European Green Deal does not morph into the first greenwashed social pact between regulators and carbon financiers, between Brussels and local elites, exporting greenwashed finance standards to the rest of the world. Climate activists should be pushing for a complete green economic agenda that recognises the critical role of green fiscal activism in organising the transition to low-carbon. It also means protecting public finances from carbon financiers, ensuring instead that private finance becomes the first lever in the climate fight. • Daniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol",Climate crisis; Green deal and energy companies obligation (ECO); Energy; Energy efficiency; Environment,Opinion
2018-05-30T06:00:43Z,Meat and fish multinationals 'jeopardising Paris climate goals',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/30/meat-and-fish-protein-multinationals-jeopardising-paris-climate-goals,"Meat and fish companies may be “putting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy” by failing to properly report their climate emissions, according to a groundbreaking index launched today. Three out of four (72%) of the world’s biggest meat and fish companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions, despite the fact that, as the report points out, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions. “It is clear that the meat and dairy industries have remained out of public scrutiny in terms of their significant climate impact. For this to change, these companies must be held accountable for the emissions and they must have credible, independently verifiable emissions reductions strategy,” said Shefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy European office. The new Coller FAIRR Protein Producers Index has examined the environmental and social commitments of 60 of the world’s largest meat and fish producers and found that more than half are failing to properly document their impact, despite their central role in our lives and societies. Many of the names in the index will be unfamiliar, but their consolidated revenues of $300bn cover around one-fifth of the global livestock and aquaculture market – roughly one in every five burgers, steaks or fish. The companies looked at by the index include giants like the Australian Agricultural Company, which has the biggest cattle herd in the world; the Chinese WH Group, the largest global pork company; or the US’s Sandersons, which processes more than 10 million chickens a week. Many of them run vertically integrated systems, sourcing meat from contracted farmers around the world, processing it themselves through their own slaughter and packing houses and then selling on to frontline, more familiar companies such as McDonalds, Walmart, Nestle and Danone. But a close examination by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) group has shown that, despite their critical part in our food system, these companies appear to be neglecting some of their social responsibilities. The food system, according to FAIRR, is “very sensitive to changing public sentiment”, and really large sums of investor money in the sector are often at risk due to little-understood risks. The organisation, founded by financier Jeremy Coller in 2015, aims to shed greater light on these risks. Animal welfare, water scarcity, deforestation and working conditions were some of the areas in which the 60 largest protein-producing companies around the world were assessed. The index looked at self-declared information from each company, and set a wide range of key performance indicators such as targets for deforestation reduction, a policy on antibiotic reduction, or water exposer of supply chains. Overall 60% were found to be “either not managing critical risks or are failing to disclose basic information”. “The findings from this first index create cause for concern,” said the report’s introduction. “There is still a worrying lack of ESG [environmental, social and governance] data availability and disclosure … despite the sector’s myriad sustainability impacts.” Climate change emerged as a particular concern. Despite the fact that, according to the report, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, almost 72% of companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions. Some 19 companies received the lowest possible mark in this section, including Australia Agricultural Company, Cal-Maine (a US company which reportedly produced 1bn eggs in 2017), Russian Cherkizovo and Indian Venky’s. This, the report argues, may be “putting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy”. The Guardian approached these companies for comment but received no response. Studies over the last decade have repeatedly shown that the production of red meat is energy and water-intensive compared to the production of most grains and vegetables. But many government officials appear to be reluctant to suggest that consumers should reduce their meat consumption. Antibiotic use also stood out. Antibiotic resistance has soared in recent decades and is now considered one of the biggest public health threats facing the world. The role of farming and food production in spreading resistant bacteria has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as growing evidence points to a direct threat to human health from veterinary overuse of antibiotics on farms. Despite this, there has been a “widespread failure to respond” to the crisis, the report says. The report says that 77% of the sector - 46 companies worth an estimated $239bn - rank “high risk” on antibiotic stewardship, with “little or no measures in place to reduce excessive use of antibiotics”. Abigail Herron, global head of responsible investment, Aviva Investors, said: “Our research shows that three in four of these companies are ignoring the calls from regulators, health professionals and the financial community to manage and reduce their use of antibiotics. That failure puts both global public health and their business models at risk.” Indian poultry giant Venky’s is among the companies ranked as “high risk” on antibiotics. Sanderson Farms, one of the US’s largest poultry producers, is also given bottom-tier ranking. Venky’s was recently found by an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to be advertising colistin, a so-called “last resort” antibiotic, for sale as a growth promoter in India, one of five pharma companies found to be doing the same. Deforestation is another area in which many companies are falling short. A recent analysis by Forest 500 found that despite cattle production being the biggest driver of tropical production globally, only 17% of assessed cattle companies had a policy addressing forest production. And the Coller Index finds that of the 24 companies processing beef and dairy (where deforestation is a particular risk), only one is assessed as “low risk”. “From an investment point of view, it is not only this $300bn group of companies at risk but the wider multi-trillion dollar global food supply chain ... Investors sit at the top of the chain as ultimate owners of these listed businesses. They need to use their influence as responsible stewards of these assets to start a dialogue on best practice and encourage a race to the top to build a more sustainable food system,” said Aarti Ramachandran, head of research and corporate engagement at FAIRR. “A major, systemic change is needed in the way we source protein if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, habitat loss and water stress. This can only be achieved if businesses and policymakers, working with the latest food technologies and scientific advice, collaborate to create a sustainable and nutritious food revolution that meets tomorrow’s demand,” said Emily Farnworth, Head of Climate Change Initiatives, World Economic Forum. “It’s always worth remembering that there is no such thing as cheap meat—these industries have been subsidised for years by the public because we pay for their environmental pollution, public health costs that they do not account for in their business model. This is where governments need to step in,” said Sharma.

2018-03-15T07:00:16Z,What to do with those divested billions? The only way is ethics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics,"Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years – boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers – ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as “socially responsible investment”, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about £300m a year was considered “socially responsible” investment; today it is, by one estimate £23bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (£60tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors – and the wider public conscience – are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business – cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. “I would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else’s misery,” explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year’s Schroders’ Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. “While profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,” said Jessica Ground, Schroders’ global head of stewardship. “But investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.” UBS’s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don’t want or can’t afford to pay for them. “It’s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you’d like to be treated,” says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing ‘bad’, or actively doing ‘good’. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices – also covering weapons and women’s progress – were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons “impact investing” – where investors actively seek out companies doing good – is a “force to be reckoned with”. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes’s £170,000 increased in value by 26% last year – notably more than conventional investments. “It started driven by values, it’s now definitely [driven] by value,” says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a “no brainer”. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years – reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were bêtes noires of ethical investors – tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced – by regulators, investors and public opinion – to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. “This is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,” says Andy Howard, Schroders’ head of sustainable research. “This is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.” In the meantime, says Hughes: “If I’m investing into a company that’s helping the environment, or helping women, I’m happy with that. That’s all you can ask of anyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

2020-12-11T06:00:20Z,"'Oh cool, I don’t have to put on pants!' Stars on music's year of chaos",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/11/oh-cool-i-dont-have-to-put-on-pants-stars-on-musics-year-of-chaos,"Each year we convene pop stars to mull over the year’s big musical moments, and for 2020 this was – like almost every social or professional interaction – convened over a video call. It was a strangely appropriate format for an industry that learned how to livestream as it weathered a total collapse in gigs and festivals, but despite the horrors, there was still plenty of brilliant and indeed cathartic music released. Pondering it all are Danielle Haim, singer with Haim, who are nominated for album of the year at the Grammys; Phoebe Bridgers, also heading to the Grammys with four nominations; British soul-jazz singer Lianne La Havas; emotive songwriter Moses Sumney; glam-pop star Declan McKenna; and British-Japanese pop sensation Rina Sawayama. January Justin Bieber makes a play for TikTok ubiquity with the meme-friendly chorus of Yummy, and Jason Derulo &amp; Jawsh 685’s Savage Love later becomes a global No 1 via the platform. Is TikTok changing the way pop music sounds? Do artists feel under pressure to be on it? Rina Sawayama: Well, I try. It’s really clear if you see my TikTok profile that I have no idea what I’m doing. But I know that people go into [writing] sessions and they’re like: “Yeah, what’s the 15 seconds?” You need a little drop, a little funny moment. I can’t write like that, but other people do. I hate it. Declan McKenna: Every conversation with my label the past year has been: “What are you going to do on TikTok?” My housemate Josh is in a band – he says it’s a ridiculous amount of work, looking for that perfect 15 seconds, and if he’s choosing between that or actually writing ... It rewards repetition, and that consistency isn’t viable if you’re trying to put your creative energy into stuff that you actually like and care about. Phoebe Bridgers: It’s a full-time job. I’ve spent three hours trying to edit something until I was like: “Nope, I’m just not going to do it!” I respect people who are good at it. One of my favourite accounts is this guy who does every single thing that I do, in a wig. He exists so that I don’t have to do TikTok. Moses Sumney: I think TikTok is just a new iteration of what has always existed, a platform that has a value for commercialism. It’s just a modern version of radio, for which people have been tailoring songs since the 50s or 60s. I won’t say it’s infringing on people’s artistic licence or ability. If you’re the type of person who’s going to make a song wholly for TikTok then that’s who you are, that’s your choice, great. If you’re not, then you’re not going to. You always have the option to say no. Feburary and March The live industry shuts down as a result of coronavirus. How has that affected you as artists? You all had albums out this year, you were presumably all expecting to tour … Danielle Haim: We made our album in a room, playing together, more than we’ve done on any other album we’ve put out. We had all these ideas about how we were going to tour it, we booked a whole tour and festivals – we were going to do a whole deli tour and the night Tom Hanks came out with the news that he had coronavirus, we were in DC in a small deli performing a stripped-down set. It was wild. So just releasing something and not having that dialectical experience with a crowd about this music we’ve been working on for a year, that was a bummer. Sumney: I would say that in order to fully understand my records you have to see them live – part of me wonders how people would have understood and received the record if they’d had the chance to see it live. Financially, I wasn’t terribly affected by it – it costs a lot of money to tour. Lianne La Havas: There was a weird relief that I wouldn’t have to have a huge upheaval and loads of stress from going on tour, and spending loads of money and time on rehearsals. That was something that was giving me anxieties. But I do tour a lot so that was very strange having to think: “Oh gosh, I’ve got to think of a way to earn money that isn’t touring.” McKenna: Just being at home doing the promo and stuff felt way less rewarding than it normally would if you were somewhere new, somewhere exciting. Bridgers: Although, there is something about being mildly insulted by journalists from the comfort of your own home! Instead of going to Germany and spending an afternoon sitting across from somebody who’s making you feel bad about yourself. Sumney: When the pandemic hit, I was in Berlin at the beginning of my press tour. I had to do the rest of it in my living room and it was just like: “Oh cool, I don’t have to put on pants!” That was life-changing. May Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande’s Rain on Me becomes the first big song to strike a chord with the pandemic mood – what was the song that got you through 2020? Haim: I was super into Ray of Light. I’m a huge Madonna fan and there’s a lot of fast parts where it breaks down – it was good for getting me out of bed and just dancing it out. I felt that I needed to sweat every couple of days. La Havas: I don’t want to embarrass anyone, but it was Moses’s song, Man on the Moon. The recording has this quality, it’s like you did it at midnight or three in the morning somewhere and it just sounds like fairies or something. The atmosphere is magical. I’m so sorry, I love you! Sumney: KeiyaA’s song Rectifiya really got me through. The quality of her recordings is this lo-fi thing that I really found really inspiring. It’s really beautiful. Bridgers: On tour, I was only a podcast bitch for years, so I feel like I’ve really rediscovered music. I got into a lot more ambient music. I’ve really been into Mary Lattimore, a harpist. She has this song On the Day You Saw the Dead Whale – the whole album [Hundreds of Days] is amazing, but that song is incredible. Sawayama: It’s not one song but because it’s a song that transitions into another, I think it counts: Chromatica II into 911 by Lady Gaga. It was meme-ified everywhere, it’s bloody perfect and the memes made me laugh. McKenna: In the first lockdown I was listening to ESG. My Love For You was a tune I was banging out every day. I just needed to dance, needed some good energy every day. June Black Lives Matter protests spawn #BlackoutTuesday and – ostensibly – a music industry reckoning with its lack of diversity and the debt it owes black artists. Has anything changed? La Havas: I personally haven’t seen anything change. The label I work with [Warner], the people around me, nobody is black. I don’t know what changes they think they’re making. I guess there’s a little more awareness when they’re speaking with me, but I think it’s going to take a while to actually see something effective and meaningful. Sumney: I would agree with that. It was like people were becoming more aware, or aware for the first time, which I find alarming. I’ve been talking about this shit for so long, how it pertains to genre and categorisations and lack of opportunity in the industry. And I also think that it became: “Oh, we have to perform awareness. We don’t want to seem like the only ones who aren’t doing or saying anything.” As long as there aren’t more black people in the music industry who aren’t just the performers but are actually part of companies, I don’t know how much can change. Bridgers: The system isn’t broken, it’s working exactly how it was planned to work for ever, since the beginning of time. I’ve seen more performative activism or virtue signalling, but that translating into real actual work … people can kind of hide behind the scenes who they’re actually hiring. Sawayama: I spoke to the head of my label [Dirty Hit]: “You’re going to have to stop hiring your mates and their mates because that’s literally how it happens.” The barrier to entry is so enormous and completely invisible, it’s like a fog: how do black people get into the music industry, not as an artist, but as an A&amp;R or product manager? It takes people in our generation to make sure that the next person that gets hired is black and then that person might know someone … It just won’t happen overnight. As an artist, if you don’t have a set makeup-and-hair glam team, then there’s this database of black and POC stylists, who are amazing. Send that to your manager, because people can’t be arsed to go on to Instagram and find black creatives, full stop. La Havas: I’ve remembered a story from the day of the blackout. I texted someone in the industry, like: “Hey, I really need help with something, can you please help me?” And he said: “I’m taking the day out to educate myself about the Black Lives Matter movement, so if you don’t mind I’d like to respect the blackout!” I was like: ‘Wow, you really don’t get it.’ It’s funny how confusing it seems to be to a lot of people how to help – first of all, help me by answering my text! Bridgers: I also think white artists have way more power than they are pretending they do, but they don’t want to have that uncomfortable conversation. I just think it’s our responsibility to make someone uncomfy for two fucking seconds. July Taylor Swift surprise-releases Folklore – other lockdown albums include Charli XCX’s How I’m Feeling Now, Paul McCartney’s III and Ariana Grande’s Positions. How has lockdown affected creativity for you as artists – and how do you want to process the events of 2020 in your music? McKenna: There have been moments where I’ve felt really inspired for a short period, been really zoned in, but when I get like that, I get too excited and completely burn myself out for a couple of days and go back to not really doing anything. Sawayama: Performance is what validates the song for me – it sounds weird, but it feels a bit pointless if I don’t know there’s a definite date that I can perform it and connect with the audience. I find it amazing that people like Charli were like: “Right, this is horrendous and I’m going to make art now.” The way she did those collaborative videos completely virtually was genius. I found myself comparing myself to her: why haven’t I written an album during quarantine? La Havas: But you’re different artists, your lives are different. Sawayama: Exactly, you respond to things differently. It’s just when you’re at home, you’ve got your phone in front of you, and you’re trying not to compare yourself with other artists that you feel have blossomed during quarantine. Haim: I rallied, I tried to write music the last couple of months, but it’s so difficult for me to do it, I don’t know what’s going on. For my sisters and I it is just about showing up and willing that something happens, but it’s been hard. I feel privileged not having children – I’m trying to imagine what it would have been like if I had kids. Bridgers: Carmen Maria Machado, my favourite author, said that you have to feel like you’re having an affair with your art. On tour I feel like I’m sneaking around, I suddenly think of a melody and I go to the backstage and shut the door and play guitar, and now at home I’m just like: “I can fuck you whenever I want!” Sumney: All my songs are about loneliness anyway, so that idea of writing a quarantine album seemed quite redundant. I made an active decision not to write songs. I went seven or eight months without writing a song and that felt real good. Probably because I had just put out a huge double album, I felt like I needed to live a little bit – like I needed to live with the interiority of my current conditions and not force it. I started taking photos and started to shoot film, directed more, doing writing of other types. It felt good: yo, I don’t have to feel like a piece of shit because I’m not writing songs. And I watched so much television. So much. August Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s WAP … what did the outraged reaction to the song reveal? Is it good that pop can still shock in that way in 2020? Was it simply good for business? Bridgers: I don’t think we need any more excuses to talk about the patriarchy, but [the outrage] is literally just about that. Sumney: I didn’t find [the outrage] interesting at all. I don’t think it’s new. It’s been happening since the age of Madonna. I think maybe what is new is that outrage, especially in American culture, is an economic vehicle more than ever before and it pertains to the media, a media that is politically binary. I think more than anything maybe that part of it felt new, but I was: “OK, I’ll get over it.” Bridgers: Also, the censored version – “wet and gushy” – is actually more disgusting to me, as a concept. September SXSW and Afropunk announce that they will return virtually in 2021. Can anyone get excited about virtual festivals? Sumney: I did Afropunk this year virtually and I had an amazing time, maybe because I’m interested in directing and making film. We went into the mountains and filmed this crazy experimental thing that was really fun to do. It sucks not to have that communal experience with the audience, but festivals are really a shot in the dark. They suck to play a lot of the time, there’s technical issues. So I really enjoyed taking the cheque I would have been paid to play the festival and being like: “All right, now let me make an experience for you.” Haim: We did a [streamed concert] at Canter’s Deli [in LA] that was really fun. It was right around the time we were releasing the album and the deli actually sounded amazing sonically. That was a real plus, and the engineers who help us in the studio were around, but it was a lot of rallying, a lot of work to get that done. La Havas: Going to a festival is about Going to a Festival. It isn’t even really about the bands, it’s about meeting strangers and talking to them for six hours, being their best friend, then never seeing them again, and all these other experiences, so I am interested to see how it works out as a medium online. McKenna: It’s never going to repeat the experience of a festival. And people are kind of bored of sitting at their laptops in a big way – I know I am. I’ve had opportunities to do a couple of really cool things online, but it’s not a festival. A really good online performance, people are honing that as a thing, but no way is it the same. Sumney: One thing I like about virtual festivals is that people who just never would have gone to the festival will see it. People who are too old, or disabled or who are already immunocompromised, people who just can’t travel the distance to Coachella. There’s something nice about it being available to them by just watching a livestream and not getting Fomo and feeling shitty. November The end of the Trump era. What effect did he have on music? Haim: I feel I need to take a couple of years and go back and understand what the last four years like was even, in a way. I’m just so fatigued, I feel like there’s so much shit to get my head wrapped around about what has happened and how music was affected. I have to zone out and kind of understand. McKenna: There’s a couple of records that felt very direct, some of them were really good, you know, This Is America by Childish Gambino feels very of this era. Bridgers: I’ve been joking lately: “Too bad music’s going to suck now!” That was my least favourite thing when Trump got elected: “Yes, now the most powerful musical minds ever will ... [make great protest music]” Sawayama: I found the fact that he denied climate change quite inspiring. I wrote a song on my album called Fuck This World, about money and power. I think that songs that promoted unity in this time were a form of protest, because the Trump administration was trying to divide. December What was your album of the year? And what’s the one thing you’ll take away from 2020? McKenna: 925 by Sorry, especially during the first lockdown when I needed some music to bang out every day. And then the lesson, I guess, is simply do more things that make you happy every day. Sumney: KeiyaA’s Forever, Ya Girl. It’s phenomenal. And my takeaway is just the importance of building interior life. I didn’t have much of a personal life before this year, my whole life revolved around my career, all of my life lessons were attached to my career. This year was the first time I had to imagine myself a person, as just a person. I’m like: “Can you keep the plants alive, bitch?” That changed the whole game for me. La Havas: Milton Nascimento’s Clube da Esquina. It’s a masterpiece, really inspiring. It comes from the 70s, which I believe is the golden era of recorded music. What I’ll take away is probably how precious our time is and how precious your own time is. Bridgers: The Bright Eyes album that came out this year, Down In the Weeds, Where the World Once Was. All of my arguments with Conor Oberst [Bright Eyes frontman and her partner in the duo Better Oblivion Community Center] are like: “Why are you so wrapped up in how shitty everything is all of the time?” But this year, obviously, I was: “Well, he fucking told everybody what was happening!” I know I will romanticise this time in the future, like: “I wish I’d known how good that was.” I just want to remind myself how shitty this was. I think that we have a tendency when we remember stuff to put our knowledge of how it all ended up on the memory. “Everything was fine and I was fine, so why didn’t I enjoy myself?” Because you didn’t fucking know!

It made me so happy, like I was out with my friends having a great time. The take away from this year is just be fucking grateful. I know people who’ve lost family members; and people in the live industry I know that have really suffered. So just be grateful and just be mindful there’s people that have had a truly awful year.

2018-08-02T10:47:17Z,Tessa Tennant obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/tessa-tennant-obituary,"Tessa Tennant, who has died of cancer aged 59, was led by her ruling passions into a position of huge influence in the world of green finance. Realising the need to reconcile planetary limits with the power of directing investment, for 30 years she was at the forefront of a movement that has encouraged fund managers to invest money in a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion. Tessa co-founded the UK’s first green investment fund, the Merlin (now Jupiter) Ecology Fund, in 1988. She was later head of responsible investment at NPI (now part of Janus Henderson Investors), where she managed massive amounts of institutional money on socially and environmentally responsible lines – for instance by refusing to take shares in high-polluting companies or those involved in child labour. In 1991 she co-founded the UK Social Investment Forum, which lobbied for the wider adoption of responsible investment in Britain. She was also involved in setting up what is now the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, an alliance of more than 200 financial institutions that seeks to improve understanding of how banks, insurance companies and other major investors can take account of environmental, social and governance factors when deciding where to put their money. In addition Tessa co-founded, in 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project, a successful programme that has encouraged major companies to make annual disclosures of the greenhouse gas emissions they generate, and which works with them to cut those emissions. Now known as CDP, the project has grown dramatically since its inception, and works with more than 6,000 companies across the globe, including most of the biggest corporations. Tessa was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, to John Cormack, a pilot, and Jean Davies, the daughter of a Liberal peer. After leaving Prior’s Field school, in Godalming, she gained an environmental studies degree at King’s College London. Working after her degree at the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, she spotted the power that was latent in fund management, and noted that few investors at the time were routinely weighing up the environmental impacts of their decisions. Fewer still considered that excellent long-term returns could be had by investing in business that respects the natural world. After an internship in the US with the green asset management firm Trillium and its inspiring leader Joan Bavaria, she co-founded Merlin (now Jupiter) Fund Management in London and was its head of social investments. There she helped to build up an investment team that featured many people who fanned out into new responsible investment operations across the world over the next quarter of a century. At NPI she built and led a team that grew sustainable assets under management faster than any other group in the UK, winning large institutional mandates.Seeing the implications of billions of far eastern consumers joining the global economy, in 2000 she relocated to Hong Kong. There she set up the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia, which is now part of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an international network of investors pledged to incorporate social and environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes. After helping to create the Carbon Disclosure Project, she became its first executive chair and then a board member until 2014 – encouraging, sometimes embarrassing, corporations into measuring and reporting their emissions. Through defining and disclosing their climate impacts, companies saw the need to bring them down – reducing demand for fossil fuels and driving finance into low-carbon technologies. Over the last 20 years of her life Tessa developed an impressive portfolio of directorships. These included non-executive directorships at the Green Investment Bank and Solarcentury, a solar electricity company. She was possessed of an exceptional combination of energy, social confidence and free-spirited charm that brought her many admirers – her advice was sought by politicians including Tony Blair. In 1983 she had married Henry Tennant, whose father became Lord Glenconner. Tessa and Henry had a son, Euan, shortly before Henry recognised that he was gay. They separated but remained close; in 1990 Henry died from complications of Aids. Tessa took over his forebears’ mansion in the Scottish borders, the grade A-listed Glen House, with accompanying farmland, cottages, steadings and offices. In 2006 she met Bill Staempfli, a New York architect who was in Oxford on sabbatical studying environmental policy, and they married in 2007. Responsibility for managing the Glen estate without the financial means to run it was a legacy that Tessa occasionally thought she could do without, but in partnership with Bill she brought the farm back in hand by managing it organically, planting new native woods, tackling a backlog of repairs and hiring it out for film and fashion shoots. In 2012 Tessa discovered she had ovarian cancer – recording her treatment with wry commentary on a blog. In 2017 she found it had returned – though she spared her friends the knowledge. She declined further treatment, spending her last months at Glen with Bill, Euan, and her two grandchildren, who all survive her. One of her last acts was to be driven by Bill in their all-electric car to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, to collect the insignia of her OBE from the Queen. • Teresa Mary Tennant, green investment campaigner, born 29 May 1959; died 7 July 2018",Ethical business; Green economy; Green Investment Bank; Environment; Business; Society; Carbon offsetting; Climate crisis; Scotland,Business
2019-11-25T07:00:45Z,UK development bank accused of failure to safeguard Congolese workers,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/25/uk-development-bank-accused-of-failure-to-safeguard-congolese-workers,"The UK development bank has been accused of failing to protect workers from exposure to dangerous pesticides and paying “extreme poverty” wages on palm oil plantations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Human Rights Watch said the CDC group, along with three other European development banks, had failed to properly oversee its investments in Feronia, one of Africa’s largest palm oil companies. This lack of oversight has enabled Feronia and its subsidiary, Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), to commit rights abuses and damage the environment, said HRW. The alleged abuses include the exposure of workers to harmful pesticides and dumping untreated industrial waste into waterways that provide drinking water. The four banks – CDC, the Belgian development bank Bio, DEG from Germany and FMO of the Netherlands – have invested $100m (£77m) in the loss-making company since 2013. The banks all aim to promote economic opportunities in poorer countries. The CDC has received £2bn from the aid UK budget over the past three years to invest in projects. In DRC, it owns 38% of Feronia. The bank is currently investigating the alleged murder of a land activist by a Feronia security guard in July, amid claims by villagers they are harassed by plantation guards. “These banks can play an important role promoting development, but they are sabotaging their mission by failing to ensure the company they finance respects the rights of its workers and communities on the plantations,” said Luciana Téllez Chávez, author of the HRW report into the abuses, published on Monday. “The banks should insist that Feronia remedies the abuses and commits to a concrete plan to end them.” HRW researchers interviewed more than 200 people, including 100 workers at three plantations in the north of the country, as well as Feronia’s former CEO and PHC’s director general. Two-thirds of the workers exposed to pesticides, aged between 25 and 49, told researchers they had become impotent since starting work. They described skin irritation, pustules, blisters, eye problems and blurred vision, symptoms described in scientific literature as health consequences of pesticide exposure. Christian Lokulo*, 30, has worked on a plantation in Lokutuin Tshopo province for three years, spraying 300 palm trees with pesticides every day, six days a week, for $1.90. He told HRW: “They didn’t warn me of sexual weakness [impotence], if they’d say it, we’d protest. “They told us we need to protect ourselves, but they didn’t tell us what the risks are … We have discussed this a lot, a lot with the [company] doctors. The [company] doctor in Lokutu told us: ‘The work isn’t good but it’s better than unemployment.’” With long-term use, some of the pesticides used on the plantations cause cancer or other lasting effects, the report found. PHC has compulsory medical testing for workers, but none of the workers interviewed had received the test results. Dominique Azayo Elenga, a local leader, told HRW he filed a complaint with Feronia last year alleging the company’s untreated waste was contaminating its drinking water. “My population [in Boloku] uses water that has dirt from the factory,” Azayo Elenga said. “They’re using it. I discussed it with Feronia but nothing has been done about it yet.” The director general of PHC told the rights group he was not aware of complaints about contaminated water. The four banks have described their investment in the company in one of the world’s poorest countries as a success story, providing thousands of jobs and social infrastructure in very remote communities. But many plantation workers said their low wages left them struggling to feed their families. Managerial staff told researchers PHC frequently underpays wages and uses temporary contracts to withhold cash benefits, a violation of Congelese law. These allegations were denied by the company. Women reported the lowest salaries, earning as little as $7.30 a month gathering fruit, with no protective equipment. HRW said the development banks should ensure the businesses they invest in pay living wages to their workers. The organisation also said risk assessments should be carried out to evaluate the effect of projects on human rights and carry out mitigation, and that he complaint system should be strengthened. Téllez Chávez said the banks, which have invested billions of dollars in developing countries, should carry out reforms “not only to protect the thousands of workers in oil palm plantations in Congo, but to set a standard that could prevent similar abuses by other companies that they finance”. In a statement, a spokesman for CDC said the group was committed to resolving the issues highlighted by HRW. The statement said that, in the past six years, wages had doubled at Feronia and that $10m had been spent on medical and educational facilities, clean water and housing. The workforce is unionised and employees and their families get free healthcare, added the spokesman, with the average worker earning $3.30 a day, as agreed with unions – which he said was higher than a nurse or teacher would earn locally. “Even the lowest paid workers earn one and half times the national minimum wage in DRC,” said the statement. CDC said its palm oil mill effluent is “a mixture of waste oils and fats” and “does not threaten human health”, but recognised that “agrochemical application is an ongoing challenge at PHC”. “The challenge has been compounded by the difficulty in sourcing equipment that is compatible with the local climate and ensuring regular supplies of equipment from Kinshasa to the company’s sites,” said the group. PHC requires workers using pesticides to wear protective equipment at all times, and staff have been trained in its use, said CDC. All four development banks were contacted for comment, but Bio, DEG and FMO referred the Guardian to the CDC for a response. A spokesman for Feronia said they took the matters raised in the HRW report seriously and recognised that more needed to be done. “The issues are not the result of lack of intent, awareness, or monitoring on the company’s behalf. They are mostly the result of economic realities where funding has never been sufficient to tackle all of the company’s ESG commitments at once. They are though important to the company which is committed to tackling them,” he said. * Name has been changed.",Palm oil; Aid; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Pesticides; Human rights; Global development; World news; UK news; Environment; Farming,Environment
2020-02-24T10:00:17Z,Soreness is good and scales are pointless: the 10 biggest myths in fitness,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/24/10-biggest-myths-in-fitness-scales-are-pointless,"With new exercises invented every week, new gurus trending by the day and a fresh study that contradicts all the other ones released every time you think you’re getting the hang of things, it’s easy to think that fitness is confusing – but it isn’t. The fundamentals stay the same, and the science is pretty well agreed – so by simply arming yourself with a few basic facts, you can step into any gym forewarned against whatever fresh nonsense the #fitstagrammers are preaching. These are the 10 biggest myths in fitness – exercise your synapses for a couple of minutes by memorising them, and do your curls with confidence. Soreness is a sign of a good workout Yes, there’s something masochistically satisfying about limping your way down a flight of stairs the morning after a big legs workout, but delayed onset muscle soreness – Doms to its Insta-buddies – isn’t actually a convincing indicator of progress. It’s thought to be caused by micro-tears in muscle, and tends to crop up when you do movements you’re not used to, when you deliberately slow down the “eccentric” (or muscle-lengthening) part of whatever move you’re doing (such as the downward bit of a squat) or just do a ridiculous number of reps. Conversely, then, you can eliminate soreness almost entirely by keeping the reps low, or doing moves that don’t have an eccentric, such as throws and sled pushes. There is such a thing as pain-free progress. Lifting heavy will make you bulky There are two key ways to get stronger: increasing the size of your individual muscle fibres, and recruiting more of them to fire together when you need to use them. The first is what bodybuilders aim to do, but the second is what your body would do – automatically – if you had to lift a car off a loved one. In sports where excess size is a negative, it is what competitors teach themselves to do. This is how female Olympic weightlifters in the lighter weight categories can outlift larger men. Getting big requires specific, targeted training, including lots of volume and extra calories and protein – and it almost never happens by accident. Scales are pointless This one’s been popularised by modern fitness gurus, who will (fairly sensibly) point out that weight isn’t a true measure of progress, as fluctuations in the amount of water being retained can lead to day-to-day shifts in the numbers, and putting on muscle can lead to the numbers going up while you’re making progress in the right direction. This doesn’t mean you should toss away your scales entirely. “Yes, you have to understand that short-term fluctuations are inevitable and don’t represent changes in body fat,” says Emma Storey-Gordon, the trainer/owner of ESG Fitness. “But, over time, changes in scale weight are predictive of body fat. Even if you are also building muscle, the rate at which you can lose fat will be much quicker than the rate at which you can build muscle.” Don’t become overreliant on them, but scales can show whether you’re moving in the right direction. Exercise is bad for your knees Actually, it’s more like the opposite: properly done squats will strengthen the stabiliser muscles around your knee joints, safeguarding you against injury as well as making you a bit more capable of bounding up escalators. As for running, a 20-year study conducted by Stanford University found that consistent runners (many of whom were well into their 70s by the time the research period ended) showed a lower incidence of arthritis than non-runners as they aged. It also showed that runners have a lower risk of osteoarthritis and hip replacements, suggesting that pounding pavements isn’t actually as bad for you as advertised. You can ‘spot reduce’ fat While we all lived in the offline wilderness, the myth persisted that you could, for instance, target the fat around your midriff by doing hundreds of situps. That myth has been mostly wiped by the ubiquity of the internet, but replaced by the more subtle half-truth that it’s possible to single out problem areas by thinking hormonally: that since, for instance, the stress hormone cortisol causes belly-fat buildup, a bit more sleep and a few sessions on the Calm app should see your abs emerge. And while this is technically, sort of, true, deliberately messing with your hormones is tougher than advertised and not really advisable. “The truth is, we all have stubborn fat areas that seem to take the longest to get lean,” says Storey-Gordon. “There are various reasons for this – hormones and sex both play a role, for instance. These can’t be easily changed, so you can’t really choose where you lose fat from. Don’t give up, though. Stubborn areas will get leaner alongside everything else. Patience is the key.” Less rest means you’re working harder CrossFit and endless neon-tinted, EDM-soundtracked fitness classes have made “rest” a four-letter word in the fitness industry, but constant movement for the sake of it could actually be hindering your gains, not helping them. “For most people – especially beginners – periods of recovery between sets or intervals allows for higher-intensity, better-quality movement, lower risk of injury and a greater training stimulus that is likely to lead to superior results,” says the performance and wellbeing coach George Anderson. Or, in other words: if you push yourself for an hour straight, you’ll be forced to lift lower weights, go slower and generally put in less work than you might with some strategic downtime. And the optimum varies – for fat loss, anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds between sets is ideal, but for strength you might spend five minutes preparing for ultra-intense efforts. Machines are pointless (or dangerous) As sparse-and-spartan gym spaces emphasising basic barbell movements have proliferated, so, too, has the idea that using machines to train is at best inefficient, at worst dangerous. Machines force your body into awkward, over-linear movement patterns, goes the theory – reducing the input from important stabiliser muscles and stopping you from moving naturally. But while there is some truth to this, not every machine is the enemy. “Whether you’re a time-poor, technique-free novice or a more advanced lifter, machines can involve less setup, allow more work and provide extra stimulus to isolated muscle groups,” says the trainer Dan Osman. That said, the leg press is no substitute for learning to squat properly. The cross-trainer is the best full-body cardio machine Let’s be honest: you’ve never seen Britain’s greatest living Olympian, Sir Steve Redgrave™, dry-heaving over the side of a cross-trainer. “It may be intuitive and burn some calories, but that’s all this outdated relic offers,” says Dr Cameron Nichol, the founder of RowingWOD. “When done correctly, the rowing machine uses 86% of your muscles spanning nine major muscle groups.” The rower also works with the time you have – if you need a short, horrible finisher, a 500-metre sprint will leave you sucking air and burning fat, while a more ponderous 10k feels almost meditative and the Olympic-length 2k is a test of will as much as power. Shorter is better Once, the four-minute Tabata – 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest, repeated eight times – seemed the logical endpoint of the workout-shortening craze, with claims that it could replace much longer training sessions while offering roughly the same benefits. Now it seems almost glacial, with three, two, and one-minute workouts promising to harness high-intensity interval training’s (HIIT) mystical powers and leave you more time for Candy Crush. The truth? Anything is better than nothing, and it’s certainly possible to make some gains in whatever limited time you have, but longer workouts have effects that no micro-workout can mimic. Oh, and by the way: in the original Tabata study, the test subjects – who were professional cyclists – worked so intensely that some of them refused to countenance trying the protocol again. If you’re not doing that, there’s no guarantee it will work as advertised. There is one ‘best’ way to train Is running better than lifting for longevity? Do you need the mobility yoga offers more than a really jacked set of quads? Is Zumba just a waste of valuable time that you could spend boxercising? “Whatever training style you experiment with, you’ll find someone ready to argue that everything else is useless and stupid, that you should stick with them or go home,” says Dr Michael Banna. “This kind of absolutism risks deflating people by telling them that their efforts have been pointless. The reality is, any physical activity has health benefits; the right type is the one that doesn’t injure you, make you sad or make you want to stop.” Ideally your physical activity should include a mixture of cardio, resistance and mobility work spread across the week – but do what you enjoy. • Joel Snape is a former editor of Men’s Fitness and runs the website LiveHard",Health & wellbeing; Rowing; Running,Life and style
2019-12-26T09:47:22Z,The best songs of 2019 … that you didn't hear,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/26/the-best-songs-of-2019-that-you-didnt-hear,"Kalie Shorr – F U Forever Maine native, Nashville transplant Kalie Shorr has, as they say, bars. F U Forever is an immaculate character assassination that exposes an ex’s weak tricks and reveals him for the grasping bully he really is – one who lays his hands on her while their friends are over for dinner, gaslights her into thinking she’s a hysteric and makes her pay for everything then buys her “a random ring” with his tax return. “Now I’m wearing that stupid ring on my pretty little middle finger,” Shorr sings in the triumphant chorus, “so I can say F U forever!” It’s twangy and tart, with a classic Taylor Swift-style bridge, all helpless momentum until Shorr freezes on a perfect punchline: “I’m just a mirror reflecting,” she realises, “and you’re just an asshole projecting.” LS William Tyler – Alpine Star The self-described “rural new age” instrumentals of William Tyler might be the best music you didn’t hear in 2019, but could equally be the best music you didn’t hear in any year of the last half-century too. Tyler is a graduate of the “New Weird America’” scene of the 00s, and the Nashville guitarist’s hypnotic finger-pickings often feel unmoored from time and space altogether, evoking a dreamy, half-remembered vision of the deep south. For his latest Goes West, he’s added a bit of California sun to the mix too, resulting the most absorbing – and strangely tuneful – album of his career. Its highlight is the opener, a shimmering, ever-so-slightly proggy piece of chamber folk that gets more mesmerising as it goes. It seems to convey so much, without a single word being said. GM Lou Roy – Bite I stumbled into a small watering hole in Downtown LA a few months ago to see a singer-songwriter who previously spent the past five years recording under the name Huxlee, and has undergone a complete reinvention ahead of the release of a debut EP under the new guise of Lou Roy. The moment she began performing I felt that instant reassurance that comes with knowing that all it takes is walking into the wrong bar at the right time to be hit by a hopeful magic. Lou Roy’s voice has the elder sophistication of a legacy recording artist but in the track Bite her intentions have a most modern of truth-speaking. Bite is the lead single from a pensive three-track EP (Your Friend) about trying so hard to be so good to the ones we love, and how sometimes that involves literally biting down on our own instinctive impulses. It’s remarkable. EB Tanya Tucker – The House That Built Me Sure, Tanya Tucker has gotten lots of attention for the title track of her stunningly raw comeback album, While I’m Livin,’ including three Grammy nominations. But the peak song on the singer’s first album in over a decade hasn’t gotten anywhere near the exposure it deserves. Tucker’s recording of The House That Built Me, wipes the floor with the far better-known version of the song by Miranda Lambert, a No 1 country hit nearly a decade ago. In Lambert’s case, it was the song, not the singer, that clicked. Lambert was half Tucker’s age when she recorded House, too shy of experience to make a lyric about the search for lost youth stick. By contrast, Tucker brought every one of her 60 years to bear in her version, using her time-scarred voice and slyly wizened persona to create a performance that will bring you to tears. JF 2099 by Charli XCX &amp; Troye Sivan 2099 is a delightfully weird track. On the surface, this collaboration with Troye Sivan features nonsensical, distorted lyrics about zooming on a jet ski and heavy on the cankerous noises. It’s not an easy, immediately accessible listen. And that’s exactly what makes it a great pop track. In 2019, pop played it safe. The charts were dominated by songs that delivered great Instagram captions (“I just took a DNA test …”) and achieved virality (the domination of Old Town Road on TikTok in tandem with its record-breaking stay at #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100). 2099 is a song that explicitly rides against these waves. The track strives to point pop in a new direction, an expansion of the clunky, futuristic “PC music” Charli first experimented with on her critically praised 2017 mixtape, Pop 2. Charli slyly addresses the fact that, despite making some of the most interesting, daring pop of recent years, she has yet to achieve mainstream success or award recognition. “She might pop but it’s whatever, she might sell but what she’s selling?” Charli sings, deftly throwing shade. AW Hurtling – Memory Cassette Clocking in at less than 750 YouTube views and just over 2,000 plays on Spotify, this indie-rock gem has been totally overlooked, and undeservedly so. Hurtling are a London-based trio fronted by My Bloody Valentine touring member Jen Macro – you might have assumed that she would have been left completely deaf by the experience, or at least given to playing waves of crushing noise. But while there’s a satisfying distortion on her guitar, it’s like something sent forward in time from the tougher end of the Britpop scene: a melodic, swaggering track anchored by bassist Simon Kobayashi’s sneered backing vocals in the chorus. It’s plainly produced and all the better for it, making them sound like the kind of band you go to see in a pub just because your mate knows the drummer and you feel duty bound to support, but who you end up whooping in delight to as the gig goes on. BBT Cleo Sol – One While much of the doom-laden music from 2019 has shared a cold, brutalist texture, from Idles to Slowthai, Cleo Sol’s magnificent One is trail through a verdant jungle of pessimism. Rotary Connection and Marvin Gaye are touchstones in this psychedelic soul track, abundant with cosmic dramatism and hypnotic percussion. Sol possesses the sort of commanding vocals that make you want to chuck away all of your worldly possessions, join a cult and possibly take up reiki. Its somewhat on the nose references to consuming “fake food”, watching too much TV and “forests dying” are offset by the song’s heavenly backing vocals, which, at their most climactic moment, sound distorted by sheer volume. And if you like this, Sol also turns her hand to scratchy, ESG-inspired funk with group SAULT – Let Me Go being another standout tune of 2019). HG Sean C Johnson – New Day (Otis Parham) There’s a stinging sadness behind a deceptively sprightly beat from soul singer Sean C Johnson in this criminally underappreciated track released near the end of this year’s Black History Month. It’s a tribute to his great-uncle Otis Parham who was lynched by a group of white men at the age of 16 and with convincing force, Johnson makes a depressing link between the America of 1934 and 2019. There’s mournful anger but also hope as he insists that a better world is around the corner. There’s been a steady, necessary rise in songs addressing the ongoing crisis of racially motivated killings in the US but this is one of the most impactful examples, as moving as it is melodic.

2018-08-13T05:00:23Z,Council pension funds are major investors in tobacco companies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/13/council-pension-funds-major-investors-tobacco-companies,"More than £1.7bn has been directly invested in tobacco company stocks by healthcare providers, fire authorities and schools via UK council pension funds, the Guardian can reveal. Council retirement schemes in the UK are major investors in firms including British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Philip Morris, according to data compiled from more than 100 freedom of information requests. Several councils said that their pension trustees could not dispose of their tobacco stocks because of a legal obligation to maximise retirement income. However, anti-smoking campaigners said this argument “no longer has any credibility”. Government guidelines say trustees can take ethical, social or environmental concerns into account, as long as the fund’s finances do not suffer. And several investment professionals contested the idea that selling tobacco stocks would crimp returns, pointing to the long-term risks threatening the industry. The schemes, which manage £211bn between them, have £1.7bn of direct tobacco investments, as well as a further £1.1bn via pooled investments, where money is grouped with other clients’ cash as part of larger funds managed. Council pension fund trustees have no control over pooled funds, a common type of investment that makes up around 40% of the UK’s £3.5tn in institutional assets. The council pension funds received dividend income of around £63m, according to FOI requests, although in practice the figure is likely to be higher because some councils provided incomplete information. West Yorkshire Pension Fund is the largest direct investor in tobacco, with £284m held in major purveyors of cigarettes, including £180m in British American Tobacco. It did not disclose its passive investments in the industry. Public Health England’s figures showed that the region’s biggest cities, Bradford and Leeds, have above-average levels of smoking-related mortality, estimated respectively at 350 and 332 deaths per 100,000 of the population over 35 in 2014-16. The average rate for England is 272. West Yorkshire Pension Fund manages the retirement money of staff working for dozens of schools, the West Yorkshire fire authority and local leisure organisations. Lothian Pension Fund is the second biggest tobacco investor with £110m of holdings. Its rate of smoking-related deaths is even higher, at 392 per 100,000 of the population. Liverpool has one of the highest levels of smoking-attributable deaths, with 442 per 100,000 population. But the Merseyside Pension Fund remains an avid tobacco investor, with £64m of holdings in the industry, the eighth most out of more than 100 pension funds surveyed. Employers in its scheme – and that of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which has £69m in tobacco securities – include City Healthcare Partnership. The organisation provides cancer screening, end-of-life care for cancer sufferers and stopping smoking services. A spokesperson explained that only a few of its staff are in these schemes because they were recruited from the council and kept their council-administered pensions. Nottinghamshire pension fund has £95m of direct investments in tobacco and its scheme members include Nottinghamshire Fire Safety, which is owned by the local fire authority. Smoking was the cause of more than a third of house fire fatalities in 2016/17, according to figures from the Home Office. Hampshire, which has £77m of direct holdings, said it was legally bound “to invest fund monies to achieve the best possible financial return, and does not restrict investment managers from choosing certain stocks”. Nottinghamshire council said it preferred a “strategy of engagement” with companies on matters of environmental, social and governance issues. But experts questioned whether it was even possible to engage with tobacco companies on smoking-related harm, while analysis suggested funds can still perform well without tobacco investments. The MSCI World Tobacco Index, which tracks the industry’s investment returns compared with other industries, showed that global stocks have matched or outperformed tobacco in four of the past six years. A separate study by financial data analysis firm FTSE Russell showed that over the past 10 years returns from a portfolio tracking the FTSE Developed Index would have been very little different if it had excluded tobacco stocks. Several local authority funds, including the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, the UK’s largest local authority scheme, which manages more than £20bn of assets, have already taken the decision to exit tobacco for ethical and social reasons, as have some of the world’s largest fund managers. Helena Viñes Fiestas, the head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management, which has moved to disinvest in tobacco investment, said there was no conflict between ethics and financial returns given a recent downturn in tobacco firms’ fortunes. “We believe this industry is at a crossroads and where it provided reliable returns, now uncertainty has come in,” she said. “There are other companies within the consumer staples [sector] that are performing really well that you can replace tobacco with.” Tobacco firms count on emerging economies for much of their growth as smoking rates decline in wealthier economies. Viñes Fiestas said tobacco’s prospects were limited by tightening regulation in the developing world, partly due to the World Health Organization’s framework convention on tobacco control. Viñes Fiestas added that there was no point in councils promising to engage with tobacco companies on ethical issues. “The problem is the product itself and there’s no responsible way of using it.” Fund managers holding $3.8tn of assets last year called for an end to tobacco investment and sold their own holdings. Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health, said: “Local authority pension funds usually argue they invest in tobacco because they have a legal duty to get the best deal for their pensioners. “But this argument, which was always dubious, no longer has any credibility at all, as tobacco stocks are turning into a bad investment financially as well as morally. Local authority pension funds need to follow the lead taken by Greater Manchester, do their sums and get out of tobacco.” The combined annual cost of smoking-related illness to the NHS is estimated at more than £3bn, while the overall societal cost could be as high as £12.9bn, according to anti-smoking health group ASH. The Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association said its members paid £9.5bn of excise duty in 2016.",Tobacco industry; Local government; UK news; Ethical business; Business; Pensions industry; Pensions; Money; Politics; Society; Investing; Scotland,World news
2018-04-25T06:00:40Z,UN staff pension fund mired in 'dirty profits' from firms guilty of rights abuses,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/25/un-united-nations-staff-pension-fund-firms-rights-abuses,"The United Nations is facing calls for a full review of its staff pension fund after the Guardian uncovered that it has around a billion dollars invested in companies whose activities are or have been incompatible with core UN principles and programmes. Established in 1948 by the UN general assembly, the fund provides retirement, death and disability benefits to employees. At present it has 203,050 beneficiaries and a market value of $64bn (£45bn), of which nearly $1.5bn is invested in 24 publicly traded companies. Many of those companies have been or are being prosecuted for corrupt practices, implicated in human rights abuses or in environmental catastrophes. “These investments clearly undermine the credibility of a well-respected organisation,” said Thomas Küchenmeister, managing director of Facing Finance. “How can I promote sustainable development and the protection of human rights and simultaneously benefit from violations of these?” The fund’s largest investment is $210m (£150m) in Shell shares. A 2011 report by the UN environmentproject examining environmental damage from oil spills in Nigeria’s Ogoniland found Shell to be partially responsible, noting that Shell had failed to adhere to its own internal procedures, “creating public health and safety issues”, the restoration of which “could prove to be the world’s most wide-ranging and long term oil clean-up exercise ever undertaken”, with an estimated cost of $1bn. Three years on from the study, Amnesty and other groups said little had been done to clean up the pollution, while further claims are ongoing over the continuing contamination caused by the spills. Shell insists it is following international best practice in its operations in Nigeria. Barnaby Pace, from Global Witness’s oil, gas and mining team, told the Guardian that “as a global leader”, the UN must invest responsibly and “leverage its investment positions to demand that all companies it invests in … embed robust anti-corruption measures in practice”. “This will help ensure UN investments are not wasted in companies that compete on bribery instead of quality and allow public money to line the pockets of kleptocratic elites,” said Pace. Declining to comment on specific companies, the UN special rapporteur for human rights and the environment, John Knox, said: “The United Nations has moral and legal responsibilities to take the lead in promoting and protecting human rights, including the rights undermined by environmental degradation … and [should] seriously consider how to ensure that its investments are consistent with those responsibilities.” The fund also holds a combined $244m in HSBC and Barclays. The pair have been pursued by authorities in recent years over allegations of handling covert financial transactions, and have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines or settlements, most recently Barclays in 2015, over failings in anti-money laundering processes. HSBC was fined a record $1.9bn in 2012 for what US prosecutors described as wilfully flouting sanctions, allowing at least $881m in drug money to pass through its Mexican branches. Also in 2012, the US Justice Department extracted $3bn from GlaxoSmithKline, in which the fund holds $78m of shares, after the pharmaceutical giant pleaded guilty to failing to report drug safety data, misbranding drugs, and marketing anti-depressants not approved for use by minors to children. The firm was fined $490m in China, where it was found guilty of bribing doctors and hospitals to push products. Küchenmeister said there was some irony as the UN was a driving force behind the authoring of the “six principles for responsible investment” (PRI). “With the investments in companies violating human rights, pollution, corruption, or international law the UN is violating its own principles of responsible investment,” Küchenmeister wrote in an email. “It is irresponsible and a no-go to generate pensions from dirty profits for UN people [working] their whole life [to counter] the harmful impacts of companies violating social and ecological standards.” The PRI have at their heart environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). Last year the UN staff pension fund was awarded an A+ PRI rating. However, an analysis of the fund’s top 10 biggest shareholdings by leading ESG ratings agency Sustainalytics categorised them as either of “significant controversy”, or “high controversy”. The ratings reflect “impact on the environment and society”, as well as the degree to which they suffer from ESG issues. Ian Richards is one of 11 staff representatives on the UN pension fund’s board. He told the Guardian that when the board met with the secretary general’s representative in charge of the fund’s investments in March, it voiced concerns about lack of oversight. “Everything with the UN is quite complicated but that doesn’t prevent us having a closer look at this,” he said. “We don’t want to find that our pensions are being paid from companies that go against the values that we’ve been working for all our careers.” A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said that while the fund does not comment on specific investments, it “does not believe there is a conflict between its fiduciary obligation to its beneficiaries and core UN objectives”. They added that the fund “addresses ESG concerns by explicitly prohibiting investments in the tobacco and armaments sectors”, and its policy is built around the belief that: “By deploying an active voting and engagement policy which supports NGO initiatives and communities, the fund can more effectively impact positive and sustainable change consistent with our mission.” But Peter Frankental, director of Amnesty’s UK’s business and human rights programme, said there should be a full review. “These revelations are troubling, because the UN cannot distance itself morally from the activities of its staff pension scheme to which it contributes financially, even if this is an independent body run at arm’s length,” he said. “The secretary general should initiate a full review of the joint staff pension fund to examine how its holdings can become compatible with the United Nations’ vital humanitarian and human rights work.”",Global development; United Nations; Nigeria; Human rights; Environment; Law; Africa; World news,Global development
2018-06-23T13:00:06Z,One to watch: Sink Ya Teeth,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/23/sink-ya-teeth-one-to-watch,"If the return of LCD Soundsystem gave you punk-funk nostalgia, you need to hear Norwich duo Sink Ya Teeth. Maria Uzor and Gemma Cullingford’s eponymous debut, recorded in their living rooms, filters the spiky pulse of Delta 5, Bush Tetras and ESG through the stark energy of early house. The pair are old hands on the Norwich scene – Cullingford formerly played bass in cult art rockers KaitO (whose vocalist Nik Colk went on to form Factory Floor), and Sink Ya Teeth evolved after she joined Uzor’s gothic-bluesy project Girl in a Thunderbolt. Their experience shows in the richness of the album: from the Moroder-esque arpeggiated synths of Glass to the slinky mood of Petrol Blue, infectious grooves abound. The record is largely, Uzor told Loud and Quiet, about “exploring the fragility that you experience as a human being”, from Friends’s tense evocation of social awkwardness to If You See Me’s opening confession, over itchy bass, “I feel a little depressed/A little melancholy at best.” The effect is cathartic, and you can catch some of it at a handful of live dates around the country, including support slots to original post-punkers A Certain Ratio. Be ready to dance without dignity: as Cullingford sagely asked M Magazine: “Who doesn’t love to play air drums when a bongo or a cowbell comes in?” Sink Ya Teeth’s self-titled debut is out this week on Hey Buffalo",Pop and rock; Music; Disco; Punk; Culture,Music
2018-08-15T18:00:28Z,"Underpayment of workers not 'wage theft', employer groups tell inquiry",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/15/underpayment-of-workers-not-wage-theft-employer-groups-tell-inquiry,"Some of Australia’s largest employer groups have rejected suggestions that underpayment of workers amounts to “wage theft”, telling a Queensland parliamentary inquiry the term exaggerates the problem. The Palaszczuk government called the hearings, which begin on Thursday, with a view to criminalising wage theft in Queensland. Submissions to the inquiry have described how wage theft is “rampant”. Employees who steal from their workplaces face up to 10 years’ in jail. When the reverse happens, workers have to take civil action to reclaim their entitlements and there are no criminal penalties. The Queensland Council of Unions says it has been contacted by 169 people to detail cases of wage theft since since setting up a website allowing workers to tell their stories. The National Retail Association said wage “non-compliance” will never be eradicated because “there will always be a business operator with insufficient understanding, or insufficient scruples, for this to occur”. The NRA acknowledged that underpayment was a problem, because it allowed businesses to undercut competitors who did the right thing by workers, but said new laws were not needed. “In NRA’s view the exploitation of workers in any industry is not a failure of the legislation, but a failure of the wider system to educate workers in their rights under the legislation,” the submission said. Other industry groups argued that underpayment was not necessarily theft. The Housing Industry Association said the concept of wage theft “has been greatly exaggerated by implying that all underpayment of wages is theft”. “The complexity of the current workplace relations framework and in particular the ... awards applicable to the residential building industry are a major contributor to underpayment that in no way should be construed as theft.” The Australian Industry Group said criminalising underpayments “would represent a major unnecessary and unwarranted change to the industrial relations system”. “The term ‘wage theft’ is inappropriate,” the AIG submission says. “It risks inappropriately branding employers who mistakenly underpay their employees as criminals.” The inquiry will hear testimony this week from workers who have experienced wage theft. Submissions from workers include those in the security, retail, hospitality and disability services sectors. They include workers who say they were underpaid, were not paid entitlements or superannuation, and who were unable to recoup money owed after approaching the Fair Work Ombudsman. Several small business operators wrote to the inquiry to express their concern about wage theft, and said that it allowed unscrupulous competitors an advantage. Andrew Bourke from Executive Security Group said he had missed out on contracts to competitors who used subcontracting arrangements to get around obligations to staff. “ESG has tendered for many contracts to only be rejected by clients (including government clients) who want the cheapest rate and are not worried what the security companies pay their employees or the quality of the security officers provided,” Bourke said. “For example I lost a major contract solely on my tender price, whereas a major multinational security company won the contract only to have them outsource to a company that employ individual sub-contract staff required to hold their own ABN. Employees ... had to accept a lower rate of pay for employment with the new contractor.” Law firm Maurice Blackburn, in a joint submission with six unions representing vulnerable workers, called for a tiered system of criminal penalties with the prospect of 10 years’ jail for the most reckless or deliberate wage theft offences. The QCU has called on the government to establish an industrial division of the magistrates court. “Wage theft, in our submission, can be traced to structural changes to industry that have enabled business practices that promote or attempt to hide wage theft,” the QCU submission said. “The prevalence of wage theft also coincides with decades of restrictions on the activities of unions, particularly concerning enforcement of industrial entitlements.”",Industrial relations; Australia news; Queensland,Australia news
2019-03-14T16:09:36Z,'All I ever wanted to do was write a love song that stands the test of time': Karen O on her best songs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/14/all-i-ever-wanted-to-do-was-write-a-love-song-that-stands-the-test-of-time-karen-o-on-her-best-songs,"Yeah Yeah Yeahs Bang It is July 2001, and an EP with a 22-year-old frontwoman on its cover is flying out of independent record shops, reaching No 1 on the UK indie chart. Her picture is cropped like a Polaroid: only the shaggy ends of a short bob, her full lips and a necklace on her bare chest can be seen. Bought from an East Village S&amp;M store, it reads “MASTER”, which felt a one-woman fuck-you to the boys-and-guitars indie world at the time. “That was a selfie before its time!” says the woman on that cover today: Karen Orzolek AKA Karen O. “This was my headspace: bratty, complicated, angsty, sensitive 22-year-old living in New York at the turn of the millennium. I still look at that and I see that.” Eighteen years later, Orzolek is on the phone in in office of her director husband Barnaby Clay, in their Los Angeles apartment. Bang was written in another life: in one night, with other songs from that first EP, in Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ guitarist Nick Zinner’s Brooklyn flat; she already knew drummer Brian Chase from her studies at Ohio’s Oberlin College. Orzolek was enamoured of the lo-fi aesthetic of the 2000 ESG compilation South Bronx Story at the time (“it was so stripped down, so badass”). PJ Harvey’s 4-Track Demos had also had a huge impact. “The fact that she’d done it by herself with a four-track, just let loose, and completely unbridled – she taught me that I could do that.” A shy, well-behaved child who still liked writing tender songs, something happened to Orzolek when she became a frontwoman, she says. She let herself go. “New York audiences back then were half awake, half asleep, their arms folded, and I wanted to rock that boat. Bang was me totally peacocking. And I loved it.” Yeah Yeah Yeahs Our Time This solo Orzolek composition, a soft epic, ended the band’s first EP. “It was one of the earliest songs I wrote on my own. And me becoming a songwriter … it came as a complete surprise.” At the opposite end of the EP to Bang, Our Time reveals the other side of Orzolek’s split personality, she says. Originally a song known as Year to Be Hated, released on the 2000 compilation Yes New York, Orzolek had known that the lyric had legs. “Time to Be Hated felt like a slogan. It was something I wanted to stamp on to the walls!” She tried to channel Lou Reed when she recorded it (“I’ve spent my entire life trying to do that”), and her father’s collection of of 50s and 60s CD compilations during her childhood informed the song’s mood, which flips between dusty Americana and girl-group sheen. “I’d listen to those CDs religiously– the best of 60s country, the best of 50s doo-wop – and I’d choreograph dance routines to them in school. They’re totally ingrained in my system – and that all just came out.” Yeah Yeah Yeahs Maps “To write a love song that stands the test of time … that’s all I ever wanted to do. Especially as I’m a hopeless romantic,” Orzolek laughs. “So this song is pretty important to me.” The song that changed the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ career for ever was Maps, initially buried on the second side of 2003’s debut album Fever to Tell. Written in 20 minutes (“It was like it came completely out of the ether”), Maps’ devastating chorus was lifted wholesale from an email that Orzolek had sent to her then boyfriend, Liars frontman Angus Andrew. “He was on tour, and we never saw each other, and I hated it, so I emailed: ‘Why do they get to be with you? They don’t love you like I love you.’” Maps’ video was a huge hit on MTV, and both mainstream and alternative critics adored it. Kelly Clarkson producer Dr Luke has confirmed that its structure and guitar breaks inspired Clarkson’s huge 2004 hit, Since U Been Gone, while Beyoncé’s Hold Up samples it. Orzolek still likes hearing the songs. “It’s like a memento to a time. But it’s also left me long ago, and dived into the mainstream … taken on its own life.” Karen O and the Kids Hideaway Orzolek began her non-Yeah Yeah Yeahs career in 2005 contributing to a film soundtrack (she features on a Har Mar Superstar track, Cut Me Up, for horror movie House of Wax). Then she wrote the soundtrack for Spike Jonze’s 2009 version of Maurice Sendak’s children’s book Where the Wild Things Are. “I loved the book when I was young – and this film meant I got to meet Sendak,” she says. “He was such a punk: irreverent but sensitive, not playing by the rules. He totally gets that kids don’t just want happy, sugarcoated stuff. They want to be scared and explore loss and death. Things that inflame the imagination.” Orzolek’s work with Jonze continued on his 2013 film Her. Her track The Moon Song bagged an Oscar nomination, and she played it at the 2014 awards ceremony (“It was the craziest, most surreal thing I’ve ever had to do”). But the Oscars luncheon, held a fortnight before, was even better, she gossips. “I assumed I’d be sitting with people I knew, but there I was with an animator, a Netflix executive and then Leonardo DiCaprio sits next to me with his dad.” She laughs: “Turns out he was a fan of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, though. He likes [2006’s] Gold Lion best.” David Lynch ft Karen O Pinky’s Dream Orzolek’s Hollywood odyssey continued with this collaboration with one of her “top idols”. “It was incredibly nerve-wracking. “He was all: ‘OK! I want you to do the song now’, giving me these lyrics I’d never seen before and putting me in the vocal booth, waiting for me to come up with something.” Orzolek’s internal mother figure kicked in. “I was all: ‘Karen! Do not buckle! You’ve not got time to be shy! You’ve fucking got this!’” It worked, too: Lynch’s voice rang brightly through the talkback after she sang. “He went: ‘Hot dog! Hot diggity-dog!’, all pleased. Like it was the 1940s!” Her voice works perfectly to the non-director’s ear, too: a worldly-wise, whispery Julee Cruise asking a mysterious figure to watch the room and watch the road. You sense the shy girl behind the microphone, the humility bleeding out as she sings. “There’s only one of him,” she says now, awestruck at the memory. “And there I was.” Yeah Yeah Yeahs Soft Shock In 2009, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their third album, It’s Blitz!, which Orzolek says her band “poured absolutely everything into”. Coming after 2006’s more restrained Show Your Bones, it had a sharper pop sound; new producer Nick Launay, fresh from working with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, got on well with them, and one day was talking to the band about a carpenter he knew who’d had a near-death experience. “He’d had this accident – he’d been so close to dying – but as he came back he felt so supported and comforted by love,” she recalls. “And Nick was telling us this story while we were playing away on Soft Shock.” Thinking of the song takes her back to that setting, she says, and the band at the peak of their powers. “This ranch in the middle of nowhere in Texas, surrounded by desert, feeling totally right about what we were doing. It captures a route we were taking – the perfect way to go.” Karen O ft Michael Kiwanuka Yo! My Saint This 2018 collaboration with Kiwanuka, on a song accompanying a short film for a campaign for the French-Japanese fashion label Kenzo, marked the first time Orzolek had written lyrics for someone else to sing. The story of a fashion photographer falling in love with two models, inspired by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto and fashion model Sayoko Yamaguchi, the film’s narrative brought out Orzolek’s love of “Asian melodrama”, she says; she still feels very connected to her South Korean side. She was born in Busan before moving to the US when she was two years old, “and I really want to push people’s buttons and move them to tears. Turn on Korean TV and surf through the channels, there are always people crying their eyes out.” she laughs. “So, high romance with high odds in a song inspired by south-east Asia? I was all over that.” Karen O &amp; Danger Mouse Lux Prima Orzolek’s new album with Brian Burton AKA Danger Mouse, has its roots in their first meeting as friends in 2008. It took until 2015 to finally get together. “And we went into the studio with zero ideas, a clean slate. Not a clue,” she says. “Then the first thing we came out with somehow was this nine-minute, weird epic.” The title track from the album, it sounds like Goldfrapp meets 70s soul, but strangely twisted. More than anything, though, she says, this collaboration has been about “both of us breaking our moulds to a certain degree. It’s kind of like getting free.” Spoken like the woman she may forget she was once, and the woman she always will be. * * * Karen O &amp; Danger Mouse’s new album, Lux Prima, is released on 15 March on BMG.

2018-11-13T13:10:22Z,"'It was grungy, gritty, rough': the 11-year-old who fronted an 80s post-punk band",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/13/chandra-oppenheim-interview,"Unlike many who claim they saw the New York Dolls play Max’s Kansas City in 70s New York, Chandra Oppenheim was actually there – although she was sleeping snugly under a table as her parents watched. She saw Steve Reich live and would attend hog-roast gatherings under the Brooklyn Bridge hosted by the artist Gordon Matta-Clark set to a live soundtrack by Philip Glass (known to the family as Phil). Aged eight, she was delivering performance pieces at the Kitchen, a downtown arts space; by 12, she was the leader of the post-punk band Chandra. Chandra – the band – were steeped in New York’s prolific post-punk, funk and no wave scenes, but until recently their music was largely forgotten. Even Soul Jazz Records’ comprehensive two-volume New York Noise compilation found no room for it. But a new reissue, along with forthcoming live shows, is bringing Chandra’s story back into focus. “I thought it would be three years before I picked up this music again,” says Oppenheim, now 50. “But it’s been more like three decades.” Oppenheim is the daughter of the late conceptual artist Dennis Oppenheim, who often included her in his work – her first drawing became the basis for a piece. Once, she held a limp, lifeless puppet with a knife in its back in her outstretched arms, while staring malevolently into the camera, for a series on puppets. “On one project my dad said, ‘They are going to shoot you’, meaning photograph me, but I took it very literally – the artist taking my photo had actually shot himself in the arm previously for an art piece.” This became the norm. “I was surrounded by it from day one,” she says. “It takes a long time to catch on that you’re living an unconventional life.” Oppenheim’s parents split when she was five. Dad’s house was filled with the music of Devo, Patti Smith and Lou Reed. At the house of her mum, Phyllis Jalbert, she’d stand on the coffee table and sing along to Janis Joplin. Encouraged by the creative freedom her parents offered her, Oppenheim soon outgrew assisting her father. “By seven, I was the artist and he was supporting me,” she says. Her performance art pieces at places such as the Kitchen and Franklin Furnace, a hole in the wall avant-garde venue, were an evolution of her childhood. “I had become infused with my father’s sensibility,” she recalls. One piece featured her and a friend tossing their babies into trash cans; there was a song about climbing out of high-rise windows. During this era at the Kitchen, the music director was the cult disco artist Arthur Russell, who booked bands including Talking Heads and the Modern Lovers – although Oppenheim’s attentions were focused elsewhere. “I just remember running around and making tunnels to crawl through from these old grey cushions.” Chandra formed when Eugenie Diserio and Steven Alexander saw Oppenheim perform and decided they wanted to work with her. They were contemporaries of her parents, former members of Model Citizens (who had been produced by John Cale) and played in no-wave band the Dance. “Chandra was completely unique,” Alexander remembers. “We wanted to create a project around her. It wasn’t just about working with a kid.” Oppenheim saw no problem: “It felt normal to be in an adult world and treated equally. I felt like an adult to a fault. I probably missed out on more fundamental kid-like experiences but that’s where I wanted to be.” Oppenheim was 11 in 1979, when Chandra rented a room in the Music Building in Hell’s Kitchen. “A grungy, gritty, rough place,” she remembers. They practised twice a week with Fred Maher joining on drums. Some days they would bump into Madonna. Oppenheim’s songwriting quickly evolved, Alexander recalls: “Chandra would blow us away with her lyrics. We were always like, ‘Don’t change a thing.’” The deceptively simple Kate, written about Oppenheim’s best friend, begins: “There’s a girl called Kate and she thinks she’s really great but she’s not.” The account of childhood jealousy moves from envy to empathy, telling a story from two opposing perspectives. Oppenheim squeezed in writing wherever she could: Kate was written on her paediatrician’s examination table while she waited for her appointment. In 1980 the band recorded the EP Transportation. Full of looping bass lines, spiky guitars, wheezing melodica and fizzy drum bursts – akin to ESG and Lizzy Mercier Descloux – these ornery textures were elevated by Oppenheim’s unique delivery. Her vocals were youthful, yet on tracks such as Concentration the manipulative and experimental shifts in tone and delivery sound way beyond her years. “It was very different to a lot of the aggressive no-wave stuff of the time,” Alexander recalls. “It had a meditative quality.” The band gave their debut show at New York’s legendary Mudd Club, a favourite hangout of Lou Reed, Debbie Harry and Johnny Thunders. There were more packed shows and great press in the New York Times and NME. “There were moments when the music was pulsing and Chandra was chanting, in a room full of jaded hipsters, and they’d be staring with their jaw open,” says Alexander. “It was so pure.” Oppenheim says: “I was more comfortable on stage than I was anywhere else in my life.” Oppenheim was shielded from many of the more unsavoury elements of band life. “We were protective of her,” Diserio recalls. “Everybody was always on their best behaviour backstage. We just wanted her to have an outlet.” Oppenheim recalls her mother kicking out a Paris Match photographer who requested she be “scantily clad and pose in a suggestive way” for a photoshoot. A second incarnation of the band called the Chandra Dimension was created in 1981 by Alexander and Diserio. While the pair remained in the band, they brought in three younger players aged between 12 and 19. They didn’t really gel, shelving a second EP. Plus homework got in the way. “I had to make a decision, school or music, and I chose school,” says Oppenheim. Oppenheim figured Chandra’s reputation would allow her to start new projects after finishing school but the interest wasn’t there. She moved into real estate but never stopped making music. “It was incredibly difficult and discouraging,” she says. “To have a life in music within my grasp and then it was gone. I never stopped making music but I no longer had an audience.” A limited vinyl reissue in 2008 via Cantor Records created a new one. The film director Matt Wolf, who had directed a documentary on Arthur Russell, included Kate on the soundtrack to his 2013 documentary Teenage, which was scored by Deerhunter’s Bradford Cox. A year later, offers to reform Chandra came in, which Oppenheim accepted: by 2016 she was performing live with the Avalanches in New York after they sampled the track Subways on their comeback album Wildflower. She continues to tour the music of Chandra with new band members. Schedule permitting, her 11-year-old daughter sometimes performs with them. “She’s the age I was when I was making this music so it adds a strange time warp experience,” says Oppenheim. “She looks so similar to me, it’s like staring at the record cover from 1980.” A reissue of Transportation is released on 7 December through Telephone Explosion.",Music; Culture; Punk; US news,Music
2018-03-12T06:00:03Z,Record numbers switch electricity supplier amid wintry UK weather,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/mar/12/record-numbers-switch-electricity-supplier-amid-wintry-uk-weather,"A record number of households switched their electricity provider in February as wintry weather gripped the UK, sending home energy bills soaring. Trade body Energy UK said 660,000 people switched supplier last month, a new monthly record and 60% up on February 2017. The scale of switching means that so far this year the equivalent of everyone in a city the size of Birmingham has changed supplier, it said. The surge in switching marks a turnaround from the marked apathy that has greeted past attempts to encourage households to move suppliers. The switching figures are also likely to be a fresh blow for British Gas, which is the largest electricity supplier in the country, connecting nearly a quarter of all UK households. Last month Centrica, which owns British Gas, said it was axing about 4,000 jobs, blaming intense competition and the government’s energy price cap. The energy giant suffered a consumer backlash last year, when it raised electricity prices for millions of customers by an inflation-busting 12.7%. Over the last year its share price has fallen by about a third. About one-fifth of customers switching suppliers are opting for a small or mid-tier provider rather than one of the big six, said Energy UK. It added that the bumper February figures follow on from a record 2017 where over 5.5 million – or one in six – electricity customers switched provider. Shona Eyre of comparison site uSwitch.com said: “These figures are yet more evidence that the number of customers switching supplier is continuing to increase dramatically. “Households are making huge savings while maintaining pressure on suppliers to offer competitive deals and improve their customer service – if they don’t, they face the very real risk that those customers will shop around and move elsewhere.” Energy UK said British households are becoming more confident about changing suppliers because of the Energy Switch Guarantee (ESG), a voluntary industry commitment to ensure switching is simple, speedy and safe. A Guardian investigation in February into the UK’s big six revealed that they are routinely charging customers almost exactly the same amount after switching them off controversial default tariffs. In the case of market leader British Gas, the most expensive fixed deal, which many customers are being moved on to, is identical to its standard variable rate, at £1,099.84.",Energy bills; Energy industry; Household bills; Consumer affairs; Business; Money; UK news; Centrica; Utilities,Money

2018-06-09T10:00:20Z,"Squonkers, drippers and cloud chasers: ​the rise of vape culture",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/09/vape-culture-squonkers-drippers-cloud-chasers-simon-usborne,"Charlie Rabone is explaining the conditions required for the Os, or vapour rings, he blows. “You have to think about the wind, the climate – all sorts,” says the 20-year-old from Stockport. He wears a sweatshirt and a trucker cap from Humble Juice Co, a US manufacturer whose Hop Scotch vape liquid tastes of coffee, vanilla and butterscotch. “The air has to be super-dead,” he adds. “Even the heat from radiators can ruin it.” He raises his Asmodus Minikin 2 “mod” to his lips and inhales. The battery-powered device, which costs £90 and is the size of a pack of cards, heats a coil inside the rebuildable dripping atomiser (RDA), which screws on to the top of the mod. Rabone has dripped juice on to the cotton wick around the coil. When he breathes in, the liquid turns to vapour. After a couple of seconds, he cocks his head and exhales. Pressing his mouth into an oval, Rabone forms a vapour ring before raising his left hand and pushing it from behind. The ring grows and accelerates. “I can do a jellyfish as well,” he says. “You blow an ‘O’ and keep a bit of vape in your mouth, and then blow that out into a little cloud, which looks like a ghost. Then it goes into the ‘O’ and wraps around it to look like a jellyfish. People can do mad things.” Rabone is part of a dedicated tribe of “cloud chasers”, who tinker with their juices and gear to produce the biggest possible vape clouds. Some cloud chasers in turn belong to a tribe of “trick vapers”, who gather, like skaters, to show off their moves. Rabone works at Elite Cigs, a Manchester chain of vape stores, having walked through the door two years ago to try his first vape. Today he is at Vape Jam, a public trade fair now in its fourth year at the Excel centre in London. The young vaper is one of the estimated 3 million people in the UK who have embraced what began as a utilitarian quitting aid. “I never even smoked,” Rabone says. “My mum and dad both smoked, so I think I never wanted to. But then I saw vaping and thought: ‘Yeah, I can get on board with that.’ I like the hobby side of it – building my coils, trying to get the biggest cloud. I was like: ‘That looks cool.’ And then I wanted to master it.” Around the world, vaping has spawned a fast-evolving subculture with multiple cliques and niches – a heady blend of hobbyism, gaming, punk rock, steampunk, tattoos, piercings and activism. At events such as Vape Jam, hundreds of brands compete for attention, from the small Italian company Moddog – where the designer Michele Brumazzo is selling £300 mod cases handcarved from spalting beech wood – to Imperial Tobacco’s subsidiary Blu, whose corporate stand is at Vape Jam for the first time this year, like a Toyota Prius pulling up late to a Mad Max car chase. Global regulators and health authorities are still grappling with e-cigarettes. An alternative to smoking that looks like smoking has a complicated status when it comes to public spaces, taxation and the boardrooms of big pharma and big tobacco. Some countries have total bans on vaping; companies that manufacture smoking-cessation drugs and patches have lobbied for tighter regulation. But as the scene has grown, YouTube and social media have spawned vape celebrities: the biggest draw pop star-sized audiences to their reviews, tutorials and fighting talk against regulation. RiP Trippers, a wired thirtysomething American with a beard, has clocked up almost 200m YouTube views and ends his videos with the slogan: “Smoking is dead, vaping is the future, the future is now.” Dimitris Agrafiotis, AKA the VapinGreek, has his own loyal following. “I started vaping in 2010 when there was just a handful of reviewers and no vape stores,” says the former restaurant owner from Tennessee, speaking to me via Skype. “Not in a million years did I think it would be like this, or become my career.” Agrafiotis, who is now a full-time industry consultant and advocate, finds it hard to define a vaper. “It’s so diverse, but what you see at the shows is the hobbying side of it. I never walked up to another person who smoked [cigarettes] and said: ‘What brand is that and can I try it?’ But vaping has evolved because it’s a tech product and, as that tech has developed, the hobbyist side of it has become huge.” The biggest hobbyists, or modders, trawl closed Facebook groups for the latest gear. Skilled engineers sell limited-edition runs of handcrafted devices to those in the know, having released prototypes to top YouTube reviewers. “To get into some of these groups you need to have two other people prepared to vouch for you,” explains John Martin. The former estates manager from Suffolk is the operations manager at Just Add Nic, an online vape store in Felixstowe. He also co-presents The Ideal Ohm Show, an irreverent weekly YouTube show (the “ohm” refers to the electrical resistance of the coil in an atomiser, a vital metric for an advanced vaper). When a new piece of hardware is released, Martin says members of Facebook groups will join a waiting list before names are drawn in a lottery. He recalls recent fevered interest in a new RDA made by a Greek craftsman outside Athens. The Skyfall, by Esmokeguru, is precision-machined in a grade of stainless steel more commonly used to store nuclear fuel and make medical implants. The size of a plastic bottle top, it sold for £140 and only through the ESG Mods club on Facebook (4,000 members), arriving in a handmade, triangular beechwood presentation box. In Britain, Martin knows of a jeweller and a gunsmith who have switched their attention to making limited-edition vaping gear. At Vape Jam, a gathering of what is otherwise largely an online community, the biggest buzz surrounds a counter at the Modders Gallery. “It’s for Frankenskull,” explains a Portuguese thirtysomething called Thago, who is waiting at the back of a long, slow queue. Frankenskull mods go on sale only when Paolo Curcio, an Italian metal engraver based in Spain, decides to make some. They, too, have developed a cult following and sell on the secondary market for thousands of pounds. One spot ahead of Thago in the queue, Joonas Nurmela has flown in from Spain, where he works at a vape store in Fuengirola, on the Costa del Sol. “I like special things,” he says. He owns more than 30 mods, but has long wanted a Frankenskull. Thago and Nurmela are squonkers, who are slightly different to drippers (many advanced vapers will dabble in both). Rather than dripping juice on to a coil, squonkers squeeze a bottle incorporated into the bottom of their mods, via a squonk hole, pushing the liquid directly into the atomiser. This is cleaner and easier and has grown partly in response to the tobacco products directive (TPD). This 2016 EU law limits the size of built-in vape tanks and prohibits the sale of larger juice bottles containing nicotine (advanced vapers now add nicotine “shots” to their vape juice). A squonk bottle is not classified as a tank, so it can be bigger and requires less refilling. “You can do more customisation as well,” explains Kai, 25, a squonker from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. His friend Max has a scraggly beard and black earlobe discs the size of 10p coins; he is wearing a T-shirt of the punk band Alkaline Trio. As much as anything else, Max says a tinkering tendency unites vape connoisseurs. He has a whole dresser at home filled with mods, parts and liquids blended by Kai, a chemistry graduate. Salvador Vazquez, 47, whose tattoos cover his shaved head and face, wears a Frankenskull mod in a leather pouch around his neck. He was a smoker in his teens and picked up an e-cigarette five years ago, when he needed a pipe to wear with a steampunk Sherlock Holmes costume. The Spanish cosplayer (cosplay being a popular costume-and-play subculture) found an elaborate e-pipe that made a big cloud. “Now it is my hobby,” he says. Vazquez is a model maker and a former professional painter for Warhammer, the fantasy battle game, but he says the biggest cultural overlap with vaping is tattoos. Skulls, daggers and ink feature heavily in vape branding and design. There are companies with names such as Thor, Prohibition and Vapour Freaks, which employ young women to promote their wares at events. For such a contemporary culture, it feels a little retro – and overwhelmingly male. “Intense branding and marketing still sells at the moment,” says Agrafiotis, who has previously called out the industry for using child-friendly imagery to promote juices (vaping is illegal for under-18s). “As with any new industry, it’s maturing.” Mainstream vaping, however – away from the unicorn-chasing of exclusive Facebook groups or the macho imagery of Vape Jam – is far more inclusive. At Dulwich Vape, my local shop in London, I am struck by the relative diversity of customers on a Saturday afternoon; there are even women. Shops such as this have mushroomed in the past few years, particularly on high streets with lower rents; Dulwich Vape opened two years ago on a site previously occupied by a funeral director. “We do get a few people who really enjoy vaping, but it’s mostly smokers who get to 40 and think, ‘I need to quit’ and they pop in for a look,” says Stephen Duplock, 23, who sits behind the counter. After more than quadrupling in the past six years, vaping numbers have now stalled. Peter Hajek, a professor of clinical psychology who leads the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University, London, supports vaping as a method of smoking cessation. He believes that regulation – the TPD also bans a lot of vape advertising and requires nicotine health warnings to be put on packaging – and the image of vaping as something to be controlled is putting off would-be vapers, and causing new vapers to complete the switch from cigarettes more slowly. “I think, because we are conditioned that smoking is bad, a device with vapour that you inhale is still seen as a sort of smoking,” Hajek says. “But the risks are roughly on a par with drinking coffee.” Public Health England (PHE) said in its latest review that vaping poses “only a small fraction” of the risk of smoking and that switching completely offers big health benefits. However, the World Health Organisation has advised caution about the long-term effects. Hajek says these apparent contradictions partly explain why, according to the PHE review, only 40% of the UK’s 7.6 million smokers have tried vaping. Regulation has galvanised the hardcore community, but could the image of vaping be putting off converts? “I think [people] might feel it’s a freaky thing,” says Hajek, who believes there should be less regulation and less “misinformation” about the safety of vaping. Vapers say the problem lies with the representation of the culture. “Vaping is literally saving lives, but society loves to poke fun at our ‘douche flutes’,” says Nick Green, a former Starbucks taster who quit caffeine for vaping (his GrimmGreen YouTube videos have more than 60m views). The giant tobacco vape brands should be well positioned to push vaping further into the mainstream, but Hajek says they are too “far behind the curve: they are still making something that looks like a cigarette, which nobody wants”. When I approach Blu’s stand, the slickest at Vape Jam, I am led away swiftly to talk to a pair of publicists. In a conference call the following week, George Tucker, the head of communications at Imperial Tobacco, accepts that Blu will not appeal to squonkers or drippers, but he says the company’s new MyBlu device, which looks like a large memory stick, is a response to entry-level demand for less “cigalike” devices. Rhi Kavok is among a minority of women at Vape Jam and is wavering between fags, entry-level e-cigarettes and something more advanced. The 35-year-old punk poet has come up from Brighton for the day with her friend, Stuart Norman, a keen hobbyist. Kavok had tried entry-level devices and found them unpleasant; then, on a night out last weekend, she borrowed Norman’s Asvape Michael mod. “It was amazing – I didn’t need a single cigarette the whole night,” she says, cradling the device. She is unimpressed by the macho marketing, but not enough to feel excluded. “It just feels a bit punk, doesn’t it?” Soon she is drowned out by a DJ behind her. “It works like this, yeah!” he shouts as a crowd forms. “We’re going to have a little practice run… OK, three, two, one... inhale! And three, two, one… exhale!” A hundred vapers blow large clouds upwards. They spread and coalesce into a giant, silvery cloud, like tornadoes in reverse. Rabone remains rare as a vaper who has never smoked. Before he turns to a customer, he offers me a go. I have never smoked, either, but I agree to try. Rabone drips some Humble Juice Co American Dream flavour on his coil. It promises a “fruity pebbles cereal treat”. I raise the mod to my lips and press the button while breathing in. As the vapour enters my lungs, I can taste Rice Krispie cakes. Then, inevitably, I cough, chasing my first cloud with all the poise of an asthmatic dragon. “Everyone does that their first time,” Rabone says. “But you get used to it.” From dripping to squonking: know your vaper vocab Mod A more advanced e-cigarette than the entry-level “cigalike” or “pen” devices. Made up of multiple parts, including a tank for liquid and a rechargeable battery. A rebuildable dripping atomiser (RDA) screws on top and includes the mouthpiece and a metal coil to create the vapour. Modders modify mods. Juice Vape liquid, a blend of food-grade additives VG (vegetable glycerin) and PG (propylene glycol). A higher VG blend makes a bigger cloud, while more PG means more flavour. Flavourings go in with the nicotine, which can be mixed up to a maximum legal concentration of 20 milligrams per millilitre. Cloud chasers Vapers who perfect their mods and juices to create the biggest clouds. Trick vapers go further, spending hours on YouTube learning ways to make smoke rings and more elaborate shapes. Top chasers have appeared in several international versions of the Britain’s Got Talent TV competition. Sub-ohming RDAs with a low resistance (below 1 ohm) can be paired with a more powerful mod. This increases the size of the cloud, but requires a bigger inhalation, which means the nicotine level can be lower for someone who is sub-ohming to achieve the same hit. Squonking Squonkers squeeze a bottle incorporated into the bottom of their mods, pushing their juice into the atomiser and avoiding EU limits on the size of built-in tanks. Dripping Drippers use small bottles to drip juice directly on to the coil. The liquid soaks into a small piece of cotton wool threaded through the coil, where it turns to vapour during heating and inhalation. This is fiddly and messy, but it appeals to tinkering enthusiasts, many of whom build their own coils. • Commenting on this piece?
