2025-04-11T15:27:30Z,Lego drops diversity terms from its annual sustainability report,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/11/lego-drops-diversity-terms-from-its-annual-sustainability-report,"Lego has cut diversity terminology from its annual sustainability report despite trumpeting the recent addition of “diverse” characters to make its toys more “inclusive”. Most recently the world’s biggest toymaker introduced sets featuring characters with sunflower lanyards, which are worn to indicate a hidden disability. At the time its chief diversity and inclusion officer, Lauren von Stackelberg, said the company was embedding diversity and inclusion in everything it did. As part of this mission, Lego has added characters of different skin tones and cultures, as well as physical and non-visible disabilities to its playsets. Figures with limb differences, Down’s syndrome, anxiety and vitiligo have all been warmly received by children. However, despite these efforts, Lego’s 2024 sustainability statement contains no mention of terms such as “diversity”, “LGBTQ+” and “people of colour”, all of which appeared in 2023. The previous document also mentioned “diversity and inclusion” in three places, including in the opening remarks by Lego’s chief executive, Niels Christiansen, but the phrase is absent from the latest release. The 2024 report does discuss gender breakdown at director level, and outlines a target split for 2025 of 57% male/43% female (building on 2024 levels of 57.9%/41.9%). But for the first time it also makes a point of saying “appointments are made on merit”, echoing language used by the US government. The shift in tone from the Danish company is seemingly the latest example of the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity initiatives having an effect in Europe. Several companies across the EU have reportedly received letters from US representatives telling them that the rollback applies to firms around the world looking to do business with the States. Asked about the altered language, Lego said it remained fully committed to its diversity and inclusion initiatives. The diversity page on the Lego Group’s website is also still live. A Lego spokesperson said: “Every year we review and adapt our reporting to ensure it complies with latest requirements and reflects our plans and results. The 2024 sustainability statement does not represent a change in our ongoing approach to diversity and inclusion.” Louise Eldridge, the head of good work at thecampaign group ShareAction, said removing references to diversity and inclusion from company reports sent a “concerning signal to investors”. She aded: “Removing unfair barriers that prevent disadvantaged groups from competing on a level playing field is a good thing for workers and for businesses. “At this critical juncture, companies must make it clear to investors and their customers that they remain committed to tackling unfairness and inequity in the workplace. Now is not the time to step back.”",DEI policies; Lego; Trump administration; Toys; World news; Business,World news
2025-07-07T10:19:42Z,Like looking in a mirror: how HR data and AI can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility,https://www.theguardian.com/empowering-your-employees/2025/jul/07/how-hr-data-and-ai-support-corporate-social-responsibility,"Businesses have had to get to grips with a range of new criteria in recent years that reflect more socially conscious goals, impacts and metrics. These are often lumped together under the acronym ESG, which refers to environmental, social and governance factors. They might incorporate these criteria for regulatory purposes or simply to better manage their business risks – whether it’s physical risks from the impact of climate breakdown, financial risks, or risks to their reputation. When it comes to ESG, the environmental and governance factors have typically been more measurable. You can count your carbon emissions and you can measure how much waste you produce. Similarly, you can set up governance frameworks and follow best practice. But the S part of the acronym has always been trickier to quantify. This is partly because of a lack of objective and comparable data. Likewise, social factors have often been regarded as subjective and malleable – contingent upon changing social attitudes and individuals’ personal lived experiences. They also vary from company to company and across geographies – taking in everything from diversity and pay disparities to relationships with stakeholder groups, corporate stances on contentious issues and volunteering. Organisations often don’t know where to start, even if they want to do the right thing. But despite being difficult to get a grasp of, social responsibility can’t be ignored. Companies now need to comply with regulatory disclosure requirements, such as the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and European sustainability reporting standards. Moreover, they might also have to meet the requirements of their own business partners in their supply chains, who may stipulate social disclosure and reporting. They also need to think about how they are viewed by potential new hires. Younger people, in particular, increasingly want to work for businesses that align with their own values. Social responsibility is therefore part of being an employer of choice. While it can be confusing terrain to navigate, data can provide clarity. As the adage goes: what gets measured, gets managed. Given that so many social criteria relate to the welfare of a company’s employees, having a robust and dynamic HR platform can help. These platforms provide companies with a wealth of objective data, from deeper insights into the diversity of their workforce to pay gaps at different management levels and social responsibility initiatives. Steve Watmore, HR and payroll product manager at software company Sage, says high-quality HR data can be a bit like looking in the mirror for a business. It can really help you understand what your culture means, what you stand for as a business, where you’re going, and what you need to do to get there. “This really helps when you are trying to attract and retain the best people,” he notes. This can make it easier for businesses to do everything from meeting disclosure requirements to demonstrating community engagement. Of course, all this data still needs to be sifted in order to generate useful insights. Kaustubh Sevak, a principal solutions consultant at Sage, says businesses have often struggled with this. “Traditionally, companies will take all of this data, and it’ll take a team of analysts a week to actually come up with some insights or nuggets on what that data actually is.” Now, he says, companies can take advantage of what Sage calls a “workforce intelligence offering”. “This is where AI and machine learning-led statistical analysis is really powerful, because it’s bringing those insights to HR at the click of a button. HR practitioners can look at whatever data points are important to them in the jurisdiction that they want to restrict it to, and in a couple of clicks they get real-time insights.” This is particularly important when it comes to dealing with different disclosure requirements across different countries or geographical territories. It also enables multinational businesses to integrate data from different territories with different HR policies. There are many other ways that a high-quality HR platform can make it easier for businesses to comply with disclosure requirements. They can provide transparency about company policies, and also the methodology companies use to measure its performance against ESG criteria – which is particularly important given that some ESG reporting regulations require information about how the data was calculated. Moreover, a good HR platform can provide all this required data in one place that’s easy to access and collate. Lampros Sekliziotis, a product leader at Sage, notes how the company’s all-in-one HR and payroll platform, Sage People, can combine HR data insights with responses to employee surveys. “You can use Sage People to gather data on the social side of things and share it with whoever needs it,” he says. “You might, for example, ask staff if enough is being done to support wellbeing or volunteering, or you could look at the backgrounds of new hires – and this could be reported or shared with regulatory bodies.” Data can also be used to help companies improve their own performance and reach their internal social objectives. One Sage People customer has incorporated social mobility data into KPIs (key performance indicators). The idea here is that you can cascade a top-level goal down the organisation and use data to see how employees are contributing to achieving it and what more needs to be done. Sekliziotis emphasises that this is very much a two-way flow of information. “You could also communicate the sort of social responsibility programmes you are undertaking and ask staff if they’re interested in participating, or report on community collaboration.” Another benefit of the platform is that this communication can be targeted. For instance, it can often make sense, if volunteering news is sent to those closest to the communities it takes place in. “[Employees] can even book volunteering days on the system so that the company knows you’re not booking a day’s holiday and that you’re working in your local foodbank,” says Sekliziotis. An organisation can learn from this data and use it to make improvements. For example, it can look at programmes it has instituted and see what the takeup is. Watmore says that this can be useful when it comes to making comparisons across different parts of a business or across different regions and territories. “Comparative data is useful, but you sometimes need to use it to recognise that all data should be comparative,” he notes. “You can use software to slice and dice it into different regions – and the richer the data is, the more powerful this becomes.” Discover more about how HR data can help companies improve their corporate social responsibility",,Empowering Your Employees
2025-06-05T11:00:08Z,Companies that spinelessly follow Trump's cuts to DEI will pay a heavy price | Miriam González Durántez,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/trump-uk-europe-cutting-dei-diversity-equality,"Organising a women’s networking event in the US has become an act of defiance. Companies with equality-driven agendas risk losing government contracts. Some are receiving McCarthy-like letters asking them to confirm that they have no diversity policies. Activities designed to support women, including healthcare research, are being threatened, and companies are backtracking on former commitments. Women’s networking events, the gathering of diversity data and targeted training are being questioned. And some companies are requesting that charities focused on women and girls consider changes to their programmes in order to navigate the current climate. The one I founded, Inspiring Girls, has already been asked to “include men as role models”. This anti-diversity wave isn’t just a social backlash to the many excesses of wokeness – it is politically orchestrated and driven. It crystallised in 2021, when the senator Josh Hawley devoted his entire keynote speech at the second National Conservatism Conference to “reclaiming masculinity”, calling for boys (not girls) to be taught competitiveness, strength, honesty and courage – as if those were only male values. Since then, the movement has reached the highest offices of power: the White House is its headquarters and its commander-in-chief is Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who promised last year to tackle “anti-white racism” if Trump won a second term. The anti-diversity brigade has no shortage of money or allies: several “tech bros” (whether out of conviction or FOMO) have joined in – as have tech venture capitalists and other Maga financiers. These are men who operate in fields dominated almost exclusively by other men and who wield enormous wealth and influence, yet they often cast themselves as victims. They hide their anti-diversity stance under the disguise of meritocracy. On the progressive side, there is a movement claiming that it is actually boys – particularly white working-class ones – rather than girls who are “in crisis”. It is led by the American Institute for Boys and Men, which last week received a $20m grant from Melinda French Gates. They argue that boys lag behind girls in education and employment. It is true, of course, that many of the manufacturing jobs that many young men used to rely on are vanishing due to automation and tech (ironically, for the benefit of mostly male tech moguls). Unfortunately, however, this well-meaning movement is fuelling the anti-diversity brigade’s narrative – because they can now claim that even progressives admit it is white men who are suffering. The Trump administration has not yet imposed specific obligations on businesses to withdraw diversity programmes beyond companies who have contracts with the government – including, now, some companies across the EU, but many are taking spontaneous actions. Some companies are doing so because their diversity policies were just for show, while others are simply acting out of fear. The trend is clear: many are eliminating references to diversity and equality from their websites and in their reporting; others are reneging from aspirational targets, stopping data-gathering on recruitment and promotions, and dismantling training programmes. Some of the companies that are backtracking have headquarters in the UK or Europe. And many of the US tech companies and funds that are leading the diversity backlash have subsidiaries and offices on this side of the Atlantic. Their actions are in straightforward conflict with the letter and the spirit of British and EU legislation on equality, such as EU corporate sustainability reporting rules or equal opportunities and equal pay directives. And yet the equality ministries in the British and other European governments – and in the European Commission – have remained largely silent. Most equality ministries and agencies are led by herbivorous politicians and officials who favour performative programmes over meaningful action. Confronting Trump is far too scary for them, which is why they have not set the limits of what companies can and cannot do, whether specifically or in general guidelines. Over time, it is possible the anti-diversity movement will yield some positives, as it could drive companies who continue to believe in diversity towards more meaningful, effective and data-based policies. Besides, in a litigation-led country such as the US, it is only a matter of time before the courts impose some limits on government-led anti-diversity intimidation. When they do, the backlash against companies that have acted spinelessly will have its own consequences. But the UK and the rest of Europe cannot be passive spectators waiting for the pendulum to swing again. Our equality authorities should counteract Trump’s raid on diversity by providing clear official guidance to companies on what they can and cannot do – it is their legal and moral duty to do so. America First should not mean America Everywhere when it comes to the fundamental principles of diversity, equality and inclusion.

2025-06-26T04:00:50Z,"EU rollback on environmental policy is gaining momentum, warn campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/26/eu-rollback-on-environmental-policy-deregulation-european-green-deal,"The European Union’s rollback of environment policy is gaining momentum, campaigners have warned, in a deregulation drive that has shocked observers with its scale and speed. EU policymakers have dealt several critical blows to their much-vaunted European Green Deal since the end of 2023, when opinion polls suggested a significant rightward shift before the 2024 parliamentary elections. Environment groups say the pace has picked up under the competition-focused agenda of the new European Commission. The most striking examples are the “omnibus” packages that water down sustainable finance rules, some of which have been put on hold even before they came into force, and which member states proposed diluting further on Monday. The European Commission has promised more simplification measures to “radically lighten the regulatory load” on people and businesses. In the first six months of the new European Commission mandate, the EU also delayed a law to stop deforestation in supply chains by one year, gave carmakers two extra years to meet pollution targets and downgraded the protection status of the wolf. Environmental NGOs have found themselves in the crosshairs of a funding freeze they argue undermines democracy. The political tensions reached a high this week after an anti-greenwashing law was seemingly killed in the final stages of negotiations. The warnings of green backsliding come amid a global slump in efforts to cut pollution. In the UK, the government has faced growing political resistance to its target to hit net zero by 2050. In the US, Donald Trump has begun his second term with a series of attacks on environment agencies and policies as he seeks to promote fossil fuels. “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!” he told the US Department of Energy in a social media post on Monday. “And I mean NOW!!! Green groups say similar – albeit less sensational – shifts are under way in Brussels, which boasts some of the most ambitious rules to clean up a polluting economy. “There has been a radical change in political priorities – and this came before Trump was even close to election in the US,” said Marco Contiero, Greenpeace EU’s agricultural policy director. Bold green policies from the EU’s executive body have typically been watered down as they pass through protracted negotiations with other institutions. Critics say ambition is now being lost at the top while resistance is growing stronger throughout the legislative process. After farmers’ protests swept across Europe last year, lawmakers and member states nearly killed off a nature restoration law that EU institutions had already negotiated. It was the first sign of open revolt against the Green Deal that the centre-right president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, had put forward in 2019 after student climate protests. “The fact that the Green Deal became the poster child of the first von der Leyen Commission was received with surprise by civil society, industry, and lobbies,” said Contiero. “In a very similar manner, so has her decision to radically change her approach.” In mission letters to commissioners in September, von der Leyen set targets to reduce administrative burdens by 25% for all companies and by 35% for small- and medium-sized enterprises, with a “one in, one out” principle to ensure that new rules displaced existing ones. The Commission also promised to fight “gold-plating” measures, in which member states add their own rules that go beyond what the EU requires. The push to cut red tape has been led by the European People’s party (EPP), the largest group in parliament and the political home of 15 of the 27 commissioners, including von der Leyen. Its shift in tone has increasingly led to it siding with far-right forces. The cancellation of the anti-greenwashing law this week came after EPP and far-right lawmakers separately wrote to the European Commission to withdraw the bill. The EPP later celebrated the bill’s withdrawal as “a win for European companies”. Tiemo Wölken, a German MEP from the centre-left S&amp;D grouping who led negotiations of the proposal, said: “The Commission obviously wanted to fulfil the wishes of the right, and this is what is so scandalous. The EPP is again working with the far right to get rid of Green Deal files, but are pretending they are still in the middle and working with pro-European democratic forces.” The Commission has said it is pursuing an agenda of simplification rather than deregulation, and that its focus on competitiveness does not contradict the environmental aims of the Green Deal. It has also put forward plans to green industry, such as the Clean Industrial Deal, which have been celebrated as driving the energy transition in the EU forward. Paul de Clerck, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe, said the scale of the cuts in the first omnibus proposal in February showed that the simplification argument was “basically bollocks”. The Commission’s plans postpone corporate sustainability reporting requirements by two years and reduce the number of companies in its scope by 80%; delay corporate due diligence rules by one year; remove a requirement to conduct in-depth impact assessments; scrap a civil liability clause that would make it easier to sue companies; and exclude about 90% of businesses from the carbon border adjustment mechanism. Member states on Monday proposed reducing the scope even further. De Clerck said: “This is highly relevant because it’s the first proposal under the simplification agenda that’s been put forward and … it’s not just weakening it a little bit, it’s slashing it. The heart of the proposal has basically been taken out.” Political support for environment rules has dried up in several wealthy economies in the past year, even as the energy transition gains pace and an overwhelming majority of people say they want governments to cut pollution faster. European businesses have long complained of complex rules that hamper innovation and make it harder for them to compete with foreign companies. “The Green Deal often overlooked challenges like high energy costs or lengthy and complex permitting procedures,” said Markus Breyer, the director general of the industry association BusinessEurope. “The current focus on competitiveness reflects a more balanced and pragmatic approach that better aligns climate goals with economic realities.” Critics counter that failing to quickly transition to a clean economy will jeopardise economic prosperity in the medium term, as well as saddling individuals and governments with the cost of climate damages. Contiero said the EU would be “crushed by larger blocs such as the US and China” if it continued to play by 20th-century rules. “Investing in the Green Deal means decoupling economic growth from the use of natural resources – that was the essential element that made an awful lot of sense for the 21st century,” he said. “Abandoning such a critical approach will take away the competitive advantage that Europe could have had.”",Green politics; European Commission; European Union; Green economy; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Europe; World news; Biodiversity; Wildlife; Environment,Environment
2025-06-18T09:00:45Z,Fifa again under scrutiny for World Cup’s increased carbon footprint,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/fifa-again-under-scrutiny-for-a-world-cups-increased-carbon-footprint,"As next summer’s World Cup approaches, excitement is building for the biggest global soccer tournament ever held, but so too are concerns over the viability and environmental sustainability of the vastly expanded competition. Held across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the 2026 World Cup will be marked by the tournament expanding from 32 nations to 48 competing for soccer’s most coveted prize. It will be a tournament of unprecedented scale both in terms of the number of teams, and the vast geographical expanse it will cover. Both of these factors bring significant environmental concerns, however – particularly regarding the tournament’s carbon footprint and the effectiveness of Fifa’s proposed mitigation strategies. Fifa first introduced its Climate Strategy report back in 2021 in response to growing environmental concerns, launching its initiative at the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) that year. In the plan, Fifa pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. The strategy included measures such as promoting sustainable infrastructure, enhancing energy efficiency and encouraging the use of renewable energy. It also included a fair amount of carbon offsetting – a process by which entities buy “credits” that go toward environmental protection, to theoretically make up for emissions produced. However, it has been argued by critics that Fifa’s reliance on carbon offsetting lacks transparency and may not be effective in mitigating the environmental impact of its expanded showpiece tournament. The organization’s previous claims of carbon neutrality for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar were deemed misleading by a Swiss regulator. Responding to complaints raised by environmental groups in five different countries, the Swiss Commission for Fairness – which is based in Fifa’s home city of Zurich – found the governing body was “not able to provide proof that the claims were accurate” and “did not set out a plan to define how it will further offset emissions”. This raises questions about the credibility of similar assertions Fifa has made about the 2026 World Cup. The tournament will feature 104 matches, spread across the three host countries. The massive geographical spread will necessitate extensive air travel for teams and fans alike, contributing to the tournament’s substantial carbon emissions. United 2026, the joint bid by the host nations, has estimated that the event will generate approximately 3.7m tonnes of CO₂, making it the highest World Cup carbon footprint ever recorded. Of this estimate, travel accounts for 85% of the emissions – 51% from international travel and 34% from inter- and intra-city travel. The 2022 World Cup faced significant criticism for its environmental impact, but that was to do with factors other than travel. The construction of new stadiums and infrastructure, coupled with the energy-intensive cooling systems required for the desert climate, contributed to the tournament’s substantial carbon footprint. Fifa estimated that the tournament was responsible for emissions of approximately 3.6m tonnes of CO₂. In contrast, Uefa’s approach to Euro 2024 in Germany seems to offer a more sustainable model. The tournament used existing stadiums, implemented energy-efficient technologies and promoted public transportation for fans and teams. These measures led to a 21% reduction in carbon emissions compared to initial forecasts. Additionally, Uefa established a €7m Climate Fund to support sustainable infrastructure projects, leaving a lasting environmental legacy for the Euros. In fairness to the hosts, 2026 is being played under different conditions to Euro 2024 and Qatar 2022. Those tournaments were played in a single country (a tiny country in the latter case). Meanwhile, 2026 will traverse North America. The vast distances between venues in Canada, the United States and Mexico make air travel the most practical option for many teams and fans, significantly increasing emissions. While the use of existing stadiums reduces the need for new construction, the pressure on infrastructure and transportation systems remains a concern. Efforts to mitigate these challenges include promoting public transit and reducing reliance on air travel within host cities. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of sustainable transportation options, in addition to the willingness of fans and teams to utilize them. And, as anyone who has used public transport in the US will tell you, it can vary from rickety but effective in cities such as New York to almost non-existent in places such as Kansas City and Arlington. Fifa’s choice of sponsorship partners for the tournament is another area in which the World Cup has come under scrutiny for its environmental impact. Partnerships with fossil fuel companies and airlines contribute to soccer’s carbon footprint and raise questions about the alignment of commercial interests with stated sustainability goals. Among Fifa’s many commercial partners for the 2026 tournament are Qatar Airways and Aramco, officially known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Group. It could be argued that such sponsorships undermine the organization’s efforts to promote environmental responsibility. After facing pushback against their sustainability reporting in the aftermath of the 2022 tournament in Qatar, the 2026 World Cup presents fresh challenges for Fifa and its green initiatives. But it also represents an opportunity for the organization to demonstrate a genuine commitment to environmental sustainability. Soccer’s supposed commitment to reducing emissions and easing its environmental impact is more than a mere box-ticking exercise; it is a matter of increasing importance to fans. A new study commissioned by UK-based climate change charity Pledgeball, in conjunction with the Champions League sponsor Mastercard, polled over 1,600 fans – including attendees at last year’s Champions League final – on the subject of environmental sustainability in soccer. It found that 81% of respondents said they are worried about the climate crisis, and 82% said they wanted their clubs to do more to combat it. The majority of respondents also believed that it was incumbent on governing bodies such as Fifa to take the lead by implementing a top-down approach by overseeing explicit reporting requirements and meting out punishments to clubs responsible for the highest emissions. The sheer scope of the expanded competition next year will provide the sternest possible test of the mitigation measures Fifa has put in place. And there will be an added expectation for a greater level of transparency when it comes to the postmortem reporting of the tournament’s carbon impact, after Fifa’s attempts to do so after the Qatar tournament didn’t stand up to scrutiny. Set in the biggest media market on the planet, the 2026 World Cup will have record-breaking reach, but also a record-breaking carbon footprint. How Fifa tackles that issue will determine the credibility of its grand green plans. • This article was amended on 22 August 2025. An earlier version said the 2026 World Cup would feature 80 matches; however, there will be 104 games.",World Cup 2026; Fifa; World Cup; Environment; Football; Football politics; Sport,Football
2025-02-20T17:44:09Z,Rachel Reeves should rewrite the rulebook on GDP growth | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/20/rachel-reeves-should-rewrite-the-rulebook-on-gdp-growth,"Re your editorial (The Guardian view on Britain’s broken economy: ‘That’s your bloody GDP, not ours’, 13 February), we are frequently reminded of the inadequacy of GDP growth as an objective, given that it includes the money spent on dealing with pollution, sickness, crime etc. But nobody gets out of bed thinking, “I have to grow GDP today”. We’re thinking about how to earn a living and pay the rent. Nobody, that is, except the chancellor, for whom “growth is the No 1 mission” that “underpins everything else” – schools, hospitals, net zero. Yet decades of growth since the 1960s have left us with thousands of food banks and facing an environmental abyss. The idea that only more growth will allow us to protect the planet is like saying we can only finance the fire brigade by selling petrol to arsonists. Yes, our current economy to some degree counteracts the loss of jobs to automation by producing an ever-growing volume of stuff and persuading the better-off to want it. But even at this unsustainable level of consumption growth, the economy fails to provide much of humanity with life’s basics. Furthermore, since money can be made more easily out of addiction and dependence than out of restraint and self-sufficiency, much of the consumption growth consists of products with limited benefits or that are actively harmful to health, wellbeing and community life. The challenge is to end catastrophic consumption growth while simultaneously enabling all of us, globally, to have the opportunity of a good life. That requires changing the economic rules, tackling inequality, taxing wealth not employment, and strong environmental regulation. Donald Power London • Rachel Reeves needs to tweak all three self-imposed targets: the balanced current budget, the investment rule and dashing for GDP growth at seemingly any cost. We should call a balanced current budget by its proper name – austerity. Yes, New Labour achieved this in the ultra-low interest rates of the early 2000s, but since then we have had the global financial crisis and Covid. This leaves the current budget exposed to inflation risk. Without a return to central bank purchases of government debt, and with the inflationary headwinds of climate change and Donald Trump’s trade wars, this self-imposed rule means that higher inflation leads to fewer teachers, nurses and doctors. So remove debt-servicing costs from the rule. The investment rule – including public assets as well as liabilities when looking to reduce debt relative to GDP – makes more sense, except that targeting a reduction in public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) creates narrow incentives to meddle with local government pensions and the student loan book. There are broader alternative measures. As your editorial rightly pointed out, GDP growth hides all sorts of problems – not just stagnant wages, regional inequalities and falling GDP per head, but also no distinction between good growth and bad growth. To encourage good growth, I would suggest one further tweak: integrated financial and sustainability reporting. The logic is simple – by looking at social and environmental benefits alongside financial benefits, the government (and companies) can make better decisions. By announcing investment plans in January but not reporting the carbon budget until later in the year, we risk a period of uncertainty and flip-flopping. Integrated reporting means better decision-making, allowing the government to focus on growth that brings embedded benefits around health, equality, education, clean energy, decent work and resilient infrastructure. Dr Neil Lancastle Sustainability lead, school of accounting and finance, De Montfort University • It is worth remembering that the only beneficiaries of economic growth are the 1% who control the levers of such growth. How long before Rachel Reeves starts banging on about trickle-down economics, which, again, only benefits the 1% at the top of the pile. Improving the wealth of all citizens is only possible through the redistribution of such closely hoarded wealth. However, as the wealthy control the means of redistribution through the media, finance and political support, I don’t expect to see any change in my lifetime. As usual, the rich get richer and the other 99% of the population and the environment can simply drown. But so long as there is demonstrable “growth”, that’s OK.

2025-01-29T15:10:04Z,EU launches ‘simplification’ agenda in effort to keep up with US and China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/29/eu-launches-simplification-agenda-in-effort-to-keep-up-with-us-and-china,"The EU executive has announced “an unprecedented simplification effort” to cut regulations and boost innovation in an attempt to reverse Europe’s economic decline and better compete with China and the US. In her first major policy announcement since starting a second term as the European Commission president last month, Ursula von der Leyen outlined policy proposals intended to boost Europe’s flagging economy. The plans, in a document titled the Competitiveness Compass, respond to a hard-hitting report from the former Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, who warned that the EU risked “a slow and agonising decline” without urgent action. The document reaffirmed the EU’s 90% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2040, which von der Leyen has promised to enshrine in law. However, the commission president said the EU had sometimes imposed “complex” and “partly contradictory” requirements on companies, an apparent reference to laws passed during her own first term. She said the simplification agenda matched the objectives of the EU’s green deal “because we have to speed up. The more complex [the legislation], the slower [to meet the climate targets].” European business, she added, had sent a very clear signal that it faced “too much complexity” and “administrative procedures are too cumbersome”. She promised an “unprecedented simplification effort” that she said would reduce administrative costs for companies by 25%, and by 35% for small and medium-sized enterprises – assuming the commission’s proposals are adopted and followed. The commission will next month unveil “far-reaching simplification” covering the corporate sustainability reporting directive, which entered into force in 2023, and the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which will affect companies in a staggered timeline from 2027 and 2029. The directives oblige companies to report their impact on society, the environment and human rights, but businesses have complained about the high costs and time-consuming demands of gathering the data. However, campaigners at the Climate Action Network said the commission had taken “a dangerous misstep by framing regulation as one of the primary obstacles to competitiveness”. The Competitiveness Compass document set out von der Leyen’s economic agenda for the next five years, with measures targeted at boosting green tech, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. It promised “AI factories” that would allow startups and researchers to train and develop AI models. A separate AI strategy will aim to boost that technology in sectors including manufacturing, automotive and financial services. Looking to one of Europe’s traditional industries, it promised “possible flexibilities” to help carmakers facing fines for failure to meet 2025 emissions reduction targets. Von der Leyen will meet car industry leaders on Thursday for a “strategic dialogue” with the sector that is struggling to adapt to the technological shift in the face of fierce competition from China. The EU executive chief said the EU’s business model for the past 20-25 years had relied on “cheap labour from China, presumably cheap energy from Russia” and “partly outsourcing security”, but “these days are gone”. Echoing the Draghi report, she said Europe had a static industrial model, “with too few startups emerging with new disruptive technologies”. The former president of the European Central Bank highlighted in his report that no EU company with a market capitalisation over €100bn had been set up from scratch in the past 50 years, while all six US companies with a valuation above €1tn had been created in this period. In a note to clients on the current “do or die moment”, Eurasia Group’s managing director for Europe, Mujtaba Rahman, said von der Leyen’s intervention was Brussels’ “most ambitious push” for deeper EU economic integration since the eurozone crisis. But, highlighting the challenge of winning support from the EU’s 27 member states, he said “success is far from certain”. BusinessEurope, the pan-European employers’ association, called for urgency in delivering “meaningful changes for companies in their daily operations”. But the European Trade Union Confederation said that a mooted “28th regime” – EU-wide laws on labour, tax and insolvency that firms could choose to follow instead of national law – was a “recipe for disaster” that risked undermining employment legislation. Bas Eickhout, co-president of the Greens in the European parliament, said his group was concerned that the compass was “too narrowly focused on CO2 reduction alone and not on protecting nature”. He warned the commission against reopening sustainability laws: “We support simplification as a tool to make people’s lives easier, but not as a byword for deregulation aimed at gutting environmental regulations.”",European Union; Europe; World news; US news; China; Business,World news
2024-10-13T06:00:46Z,‘Very concerning’: BP dilutes net zero targets as global retreat from green standards gathers pace,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/13/very-concerning-bp-dilutes-net-zero-targets-as-global-retreat-from-green-standards-gathers-pace,"In early 2020, Bernard Looney had one clear goal as the incoming chief executive of BP: to convince the world to see the oil company differently. For a time, he did exactly that. In a glossy, high-concept London campaign launch, the BP boss set out 10 new aims for the company, the most significant being BP’s transformation to a net zero energy company by 2050. Within months, he reinforced the rebranding with a pledge to cut the company’s oil and gas production by 40% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade. At the time, his strategy even won the approval of Greenpeace – a feat few oil executives can boast. But by early 2023, BP had watered down the 40% cut to a 25% reduction after the war in Ukraine caused oil prices to surge, doubling the company’s profits. Within months, its greenest ever chief executive was ousted from the company amid revelations about undisclosed relationships with colleagues. His green plans have followed suit. It emerged last week that BP plans to abandon its curbs on fossil fuel production in favour of targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. The news angered climate campaigners, but surprised very few. BP’s green retreat has arguably been the most brazen in the industry – from a grandstanding green agenda to a fresh focus on fossil fuels – but the backtrack from environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is gaining pace among the world’s biggest companies and investors. The term ESG was first coined by the UN in a 2004 report entitled Who Cares Wins. It provided companies and investors with a model for implementing the ideals of responsible investing in their spending plans. By 2015, the idea of ESG had evolved from being a talking point to a set of standards which could, and should, be measured. But in recent years, companies and investors in the US and Europe have begun to chafe at the requirements to disclose their ESG credentials, and retreated from the commitments themselves – often to protect their profits. BP’s oil industry rival Shell signalled earlier this year that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. Shell has also backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling”, which involves breaking down plastic polymers into tiny molecules that can be made into synthetic fuels or new plastics. It promised to use 1m tonnes of this recycled plastic in its global petrochemicals plants, but later admitted the plan was “unfeasible”. Oil companies are not alone in scaling down their green promises. Volkswagen has quietly dropped a voluntary target to cut CO2₂ emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 30% between 2015 and 2025 in favour of making the same cuts between 2018 and 2030. And Unilever – the conglomerate that owns brands including Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Vaseline, and which is widely credited with pioneering the ESG movement – signalled earlier this year that it would abandon or water down a string of ESG pledges amid a growing backlash from investors and politicians. “It’s a very concerning trend,” said Lewis Johnston, director of policy at the responsible investment organisation ShareAction. “In general, we have seen quite a concerted and organised pushback against some of the principles of responsible investment. It’s a very different philosophy of what generates long-term value.” As recently as 2021, the world’s biggest investors counted ESG principles as important hallmarks of a sound investment. The US investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard voted in favour of almost half of all shareholder ESG resolutions proposed in 2021. But since then they have dramatically withdrawn their support following a fierce political backlash. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, legislators in Texas and other critics of ESG escalated the stakes in late 2022 by collectively pulling billions of dollars in state funds from BlackRock. The investment group’s support for ESG measures has since plummeted. BlackRock has confirmed that in the 12 months to the end of June 2024, it supported only 20 of the 493 environmental and social proposals put forward by shareholders at the annual meetings of the firms in which it invests. This represents just 4% of ESG proposals, compared with 47% three years ago. Vanguard supported none of the 400 environmental or social shareholder proposals that it considered in the 2024 US proxy shareholder season, saying they were “overly prescriptive”, unnecessary or did not relate to material financial risks. Gemma Woodward, the head of responsible investment at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, highlighted the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a tipping point in the trend against ESG. “We saw a real turn in the market where value came back into fashion, and so we saw an ‘easing of the pedal’ of the interest in [ESG],” she said. “I’m very worried, obviously … I guess the problem we’ve got is that we don’t have a global standard.” However, BP and Shell still looked “pretty good” compared with oil companies in the US, where there was an even bigger backlash against ESG, Woodward said. US banks JP Morgan and State Street pulled out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group, which pushes for change from big greenhouse gas emitters, this year. “It’s certainly at its most extreme in the US,” Johnston said. “But we’re not immune to it in the UK or in Europe.” Last summer, the EU confirmed plans to water down the final rules for corporate ESG disclosures through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The move comes after European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to cut red tape across the EU executive’s work to counter complaints from big companies over the mounting cost of environmental rules. Under the new rules, companies will have more flexibility to decide what information is “material” and therefore should be reported, in effect making some disclosures voluntary instead of mandatory. The easing was described by HSBC analysts at the time as a “step back” in ambition and robustness, but a step that may facilitate convergence in sustainability reporting globally. Johnston insisted that climate transition reporting should not be considered yet as another raft of burdensome reporting rules. Instead, he said, it was about making sure companies were aware of both the risks and the opportunities involved in adapting to the climate crisis. “Mandatory [climate] transition plans are a means of empowering companies and positioning the financial system as a whole, and aligning that and the real economy with the transition that we know is coming,” Johnston said. “So I think it’s absolutely wrong to look at this as merely another regulatory burden, because it really isn’t … It’s about imposing discipline and making sure that companies are preparing for what they should be doing, and that’s, again, responsible stewardship.”",Corporate governance; BP; Ethical business; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Commodities; Business,Business
2025-02-26T16:36:39Z,EU reveals plans to hit climate goals by helping dirty industries clean up,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/eu-climate-goals-dirty-industries-clean-industrial-deal,"The EU executive has insisted it will stay the course on its climate goals, while setting out plans to help Europe’s most polluting industries reach the green transition and watering down environmental reporting demands on companies. Publishing its “clean industrial deal” on Wednesday, the European Commission said it had a plan to help polluting industries, such as steel and cement, make the switch to the net zero emissions future, as well as boosting clean tech companies, such as firms making electric vehicle charging points. The commission also published a plan aiming to bring down energy bills for businesses and consumers, as well as controversial proposals to relax environmental reporting requirements on small and medium-sized businesses. In 2019, before the pandemic, when there appeared to be a broad global consensus around the need for climate action, the EU launched the green deal, a landmark set of laws aiming to transform energy use and set the course to net zero emissions by 2050. But criticism of the rules has grown, against a backdrop of soaring energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and intensifying competition from heavily subsidised Chinese companies. Now the clean industrial deal reaffirms the EU goal of cutting emissions by 90% by 2040, and unveils 40 different measures to speed up the green transition, including faster permits for windfarms and other infrastructure, and changing public procurement rules to favour clean tech made in Europe. “We think that the clean industrial deal is Europe’s business plan to tackle the climate crisis,” said Teresa Ribera, the European Commission executive vice-president in charge of the green transition. Ribera, the most senior socialist in a centre-right-leaning commission, rejected criticism that the EU was reversing course. “We are not deregulating,” she said. “On the contrary: we are coming to the implementing phase.” The commission said it would create a new industrial decarbonisation bank with €100bn (£83bn) in new and repurposed public funds, which it said could indirectly leverage €400bn from the private sector. It outlined a bigger role for the European Investment Bank, including in the provision of guarantees to grid component manufacturers, allowing them to increase production. Experts say hundreds of billions in global investment is needed to build vast networks of electricity grids to hit climate goals. Ribera, who also leads on competition policy, promised changes to the EU’s state aid rules by June to accelerate renewable energy and industrial decarbonisation. But the Climate Action Network Europe said there was “no concrete plan to mobilise genuine additional finance” and “little to turn ambition into action”. The new European Commission, which took office in December with a red-tape-cutting agenda, simultaneously published details on relaxing environmental reporting and due diligence rules for small companies, a far-reaching rethink of laws only agreed in 2023 and 2024. The commissioners presenting the proposals argued they were not weakening Europe’s green transition, but encouraging businesses to join in the transition and adjusting to a new geopolitical reality. “Europe knows how to reform itself,” said Stéphane Séjourné, the commissioner in charge of industrial strategy. “We don’t have a chainsaw,” he added, referring to the power tool that the Argentine president, Javier Milei, recently gave Elon Musk as a symbol of slashing red tape. “But we have competent people leading the charge.” The commission suggested a two-year freeze of its corporate sustainability reporting directive, which entered into force in 2023, while it pursues detailed consultations on exempting small businesses. Similarly, officials said the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which requires companies with more than 1,000 employees to assess the environmental and human rights impacts of their products, would be delayed by one year, while the commission tries to lighten the load on smaller companies. While SMEs are already exempt from the directive’s requirements, many say they will be caught in burdensome rules because they supply larger companies. While business groups broadly welcomed the plans, the European Sustainable Investment Forum said the move created “legal uncertainty” and harmed those who had already prepared reports or taken steps to comply. Anna Cavazzini, a German Green MEP who chairs the European parliament’s internal market committee, said the due diligence directive was being turned into an empty shell and “environmental crimes and human rights violations won’t be prevented”. Christian Ehler, the energy and industry spokesperson for the centre-right EPP group, said further simplification of environmental legislation “must not be a taboo” and “we have to consider whether some [other] environmental legislation from the past mandate is adequate”. The red-tape-cutting agenda has also been extended to the EU’s carbon-border adjustment mechanism, which requires companies importing steel, iron, aluminium and other polluting products into the bloc to pay a carbon tariff, levelling out price differences with EU producers. The commission said it would exempt the smallest importers from the levy, a measure it said would affect 90% of importers, about 190,000 companies, while still covering 99% of emissions. The clean industrial deal was published alongside an “affordable energy action plan” that aims to save €260bn a year by 2040. Environment campaigners welcomed initiatives to reduce bills and hasten electrification, but expressed alarm at a proposal to fund the building of liquefied natural gas export facilities abroad. The Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Lorelei Limousin said the proposal neglected other measures that could bring fossil fuel imports down rapidly, such as cutting energy waste. “This commission is vague on cutting energy waste while, to appease Trump, wants to invest in polluting gas infrastructure overseas that will keep Europe hooked on this expensive and dangerous fuel for decades.” The director general of BusinessEurope, Markus Beyrer, said he was encouraged that the commission had listened to industry, but called for swifter action, saying it was unlikely the measures would be enough to lower short-term energy costs.",European Union; Green politics; European Commission; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Steel industry; Construction industry; World news; Europe,World news
2024-11-14T06:00:04Z,"Shell’s successful appeal will not end climate lawsuits against firms, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/14/shell-successful-appeal-will-not-end-climate-lawsuits-against-firms-say-experts,"A court ruling in favour of Shell does not spell the end of climate litigation against companies, legal experts have said. The oil and gas company celebrated on Tuesday when it won an appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court. In 2021 a lower court ruled that Shell must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world, and led to a growing trend of lawsuits against corporations. However, the Dutch court of appeal ruled that, while Shell did have a “special responsibility” to cut its emissions as a major oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Milieudefensie, the NGO that brought the claim, was disappointed with the ruling because it rejected its key demand. However, the lawyer Roger Cox said he could see a number of important points to build on in the NGO’s legal battle against large polluters. “The court makes it abundantly clear that not only countries, but also companies, have a responsibility to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement,” said Cox. Thom Wetzer, an associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, believes this leaves the door “wide open” for future litigation against corporations in the Netherlands and beyond. The appeal court found no solid basis on which to order Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by the end of the decade. Shell successfully argued that the target was based on a global average and did not take into account the fact that the company did not sell the most polluting fossil fuel, coal. Nor was the court persuaded by Milieudefensie’s suggestions of more tailored emissions reductions for oil and gas. But the court agreed in principle that it was able to order companies to meet absolute emission reductions. Joana Setzer, an associate professor at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said this laid the basis for future claims, particularly once the EU set clear pathways for emission reductions in particular sectors. Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at Grantham, said he believed scientists had an important role in this. “Research in this field is advancing rapidly to bridge the gap between global emissions reduction goals and specific actionable targets.” The court stressed that business environmental rules were getting tougher. Both the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and its later corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDDD), which was finalised earlier this year and takes effect from 2027, impose climate-related obligations on companies such as Shell. According to Wetzer, the original Shell ruling was an important catalyst in changing the political landscape, “which led business to support the CSDDD codification in an attempt to gain legal certainty”. Setzer said these rules provided a more robust framework for holding corporations accountable but the court made it clear that they were not exhaustive. “This creates space for litigants to argue that companies must go beyond baseline regulatory compliance to fulfil their human rights and environmental responsibilities.” The court affirmed that corporations had responsibilities to respect human rights. More than 20 legal cases are examining this issue in relation to climate change, and Fred Kelly, a senior associate at law firm Peters &amp; Peters, expects the judgment to prompt more. Another point of contention was the extent to which companies should have to cut emissions from their suppliers and customers, also known as “scope 3” emissions. The court accepted Shell’s arguments that the specific target Milieudefensie had requested might not contribute to global climate efforts, because any oil or gas it chose not to sell may simply be sold by another company. But Wetzer said that this left the door open for legal claims if companies did not have, or failed to adhere to, more direct scope 1 and 2 emissions. It may even leave room for more nuanced scope 3 claims focusing on fossil fuel production. Although it would not impose a specific obligation on Shell to cut its emissions, the court said it was “reasonable to expect oil and gas companies to take into account the negative consequences of a further expansion of the supply of fossil fuels for the energy transition also when investing in the production of fossil fuels”. It said that Shell’s plan to develop hundreds of new oil and gas fields despite the International Energy Agency having warned against investments in any new fossil fuel extraction “may be at odds with this”. Wetzer said he saw this as a “strong hint” that Shell’s fossil fuel exploration and development should have limits, while Setzer anticipated that the ruling could inspire more project-specific cases. “The court’s critique of Shell’s new fossil fuel investments aligns with the argument that such projects are fundamentally at odds with the Paris agreement,” said Setzer. “Project cases, like the legal challenge to the Rosebank oilfield in the UK, are increasingly paving the way for courts to demand that emissions from fossil fuel use be fully considered before approving high-emitting projects.” Companies are not off the hook, said Wetzer. “Although the pathway to injunction-based cases of the Shell type succeeding may be a bit longer and bumpier than some might have hoped, it is definitely there. So, as before, companies should act in anticipation of this norm being enforceable or face significant legal risk.”",Climate crisis; Shell; Environment; World news; Law; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Greenhouse gas emissions,Environment
2023-10-24T05:33:39Z,"Top ASX firms report social and environment performance by revising pastdata, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/24/top-asx-firms-report-improved-social-and-environment-performance-by-revising-past-data-study-finds,"Australian companies are reporting better social and environment performance but many gains are generated by revising past outcomes, particularly when a chief executive’s own remuneration is tied to the results, a new study has found. The study, “CSR Restatements: Mischief or Mistake?”, examined 674 instances of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting from the Top 500 ASX-listed companies between 2004 and 2020. The researchers found about 17% of a CEO’s bonus pay was linked to sustainability targets alone, potentially lifting payouts by around $200,000 if targets were met. All up, 33.5% of all restatements of CSR outcomes were for one or more CSR goals that were tied to bonuses. Only about 15% of revisions of past outcomes were to correct an error, compared with 69% resulting from measurement changes. After back-dated revisions, the following year showed an average 28.3% improvement of the metric being assessed, a gain that rose further to 36% when a CEO’s bonus was linked to the outcome. “Our results show that CSR contracting is associated with a greater number of CSR restatements, particularly when social performance measures are contained within CEO compensation contracts,” the paper, published in the Journal of Management Accounting Research, found. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Overall, our results suggest that compensation provides an incentive to manipulate CSR performance through restatements.” The authors, associate professor Helen Spiropoulos from the University of Technology Sydney and Rebecca Bachmann from Macquarie University, said CSR reporting was already perceived as “greenwashing” – the selective disclosure of positive environmental or social performance and the withholding of negative information. One motivation for the study was that CSR reporting remained “largely unregulated across the globe”. Separate research has identified that 37% of CSR reports from Global Fortune 250 firms included revisions with a bias towards overstatement, the authors noted. “CSR reporting is [also] an important issue given its increasing occurrence and pressure to conduct business in a way that minimises any negative social and environmental impacts,” the paper said. The authors hope the findings will be considered by the International Sustainability Standards Board. The body plans to draft sustainability reporting standards but has yet to consider issues surrounding metrics and measurement, it said. “Currently, there is significant discretion in how [environmental, social and governance] performance is measured and reported, and one way to show improved performance in the current year, is to adjust or restate last year’s score to reflect worse performance relative to this year,” Spiropoulos said in a statement. Bachman said: “Auditors who will be required to audit environmental performance disclosures under forthcoming sustainability assurance standards should also investigate the legitimacy of restatements.” “The irony is striking – what was intended to be a mechanism to drive positive environmental and social change may instead act as an incentive to manipulate sustainability performance.”",Corporate social responsibility; Business; Australia news; Australian economy; Environment,Environment
2023-11-23T14:00:55Z,"Report critical of big four consultancies was censored by Australian government agency, academic claims ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/24/academic-peter-carey-censored-study-partners-board-pwc-kpmg-deloitte-ey,"A government agency allegedly censored a major study that was critical of the big four consultancy firms because their partners sat on its board, according to the academic who wrote the report. The allegation, which has been disputed by the agency, was made during a parliamentary inquiry into the ethics and professional standards of the consulting industry. It has led to questions about potential “regulatory capture” and possible undue influence. The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), which provides oversight of how companies are audited, commissioned Peter Carey and George Tanewski from Deakin University to study the quality of financial reports. After more than a decade of research, Carey and Tanewski told the inquiry they believed some of the audits performed by the so-called big four – KPMG, Deloitte, EY and PwC – “did not uphold quality”. They also said some unnamed firms “did an excellent job”. When asked to provide more detail about which firms had produced quality audits and which had not, Carey told the inquiry that he would rather not say, before alleging he had been asked not to by the AASB. “We were told we probably shouldn’t put it in the report because each of the representatives of the big four sit on the accounting standards board and they do it voluntarily, which is a problem,” Carey told the inquiry this week. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In response, the Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who leads the inquiry, asked: “We’re in the world of regulatory capture here, aren’t we?” Carey replied: “We are.” Carey also agreed with O’Neill’s suggestion that the academics were “told not to put into your report the facts of the situation because those who would see it might be offended”. The AASB chair, Keith Kendall, told Guardian Australia that “we do not believe that any instructions were given to leave names or businesses out of this report, or restrict what could be published”. “All board members are appointed based on their skills and experience, depending on what advice is needed at the time. Importantly, each member is appointed based on their individual capacity and not as a representative of a firm or our stakeholder community.” The contract pre-dated Kendall’s appointment to the chair position in 2020. Carey suggested the AASB had the potential to be influenced by its board members – who provide specialist knowledge of auditing – because it lacked sufficient funding. “They, cap in hand, ask people and the big four kindly provide support for free. In the absence of government funding, standard setting and proper regulation, you’re going to have this problem,” Carey told the inquiry. Three senior executives from KPMG, PwC and EY were appointed to the AASB in January on three-year terms. When they were announced, Kendall said the appointments would “provide expertise not only in the financial reporting standards space but also for sustainability reporting”. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Kendall or any of the executives. Despite agreeing with O’Neill’s characterisation of “regulatory capture”, Carey praised the AASB for taking the issue of auditing standards seriously and said “they were so worried about the quality they wanted to make it public”. This week, the federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, announced the AASB and two other standards bodies would be merged into a single entity from 2026 to improve oversight of the sector. “Businesses, investors and stakeholders will benefit from engaging with a single entity responsible for corporate reporting … that will deliver collaborative and effective standards and avoid unnecessary costs,” he said. Graeme Samuel, the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission between 2003 and 2011, also raised concerns about the quality of audit work during the inquiry. “If you are performing both consulting and auditing work, you got a conflict of interest that cannot possibly be avoided,” Samuel told the inquiry. “It’s there. It’s a financial conflict that must impact, in my view, on the quality of audit.” Samuel told the inquiry that he had seen instances of auditors becoming aware of “difficulties in the governance of a corporation” and turning a blind eye. Samuel did not name the auditors or the companies. KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC have repeatedly defended the quality of their work.",Consulting (Australia); Australia news; Business; Australian politics,Australia news
2022-09-29T23:01:23Z,Average income of Deloitte’s partners in UK and Switzerland tops £1m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/30/average-income-deloitte-swiss-uk-partners,"Partners at Deloitte in the UK and Switzerland will receive an average income of more than £1m each for the second year in a row, after the accountancy firm enjoyed another successful year. Each partner will receive an average distributable profit of £1,058,000 in the year to the end of May, about 33 times the UK’s average annual pay. This is the first time the sum has exceeded £1m and is an increase of about 24% compared with the same period the year before. Equity partners do not receive a salary but instead receive a share of profits as income, with 672 of them sharing £711m in profits in the 2022 financial year. While the average distributable profit rose, the total payout they received was flat year on year because the 2021 results were flattered by a £196,000 windfall for each partner after the sale of Deloitte’s UK restructuring business to Teneo, an advisory firm. The big four accountancy firms – Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – benefited from an increase in business in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic as companies made a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and looked to introduce newer technology. Deloitte, which has 20,000 UK employees, said “resilient markets and corporate investment” had driven revenues up in the combined UK and Switzerland by 10% to £4.9bn during the financial year, with business growing in all areas. Revenues grew fastest, up 15% year on year, in the consulting division, which advises businesses on changes such as new technology. However, Deloitte has not escaped scandal. In April the UK’s accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, said it was investigating Deloitte over its audit of the bus and rail operator Go-Ahead over wrongly withholding £50m of taxpayers’ money. The regulator is also investigating Deloitte’s audits of the motoring group Lookers and building materials company SIG. Other big accountancy firms have also enjoyed rapid growth in the past year. Last week EY reported that global revenues rose by almost 14% in the year to June. PwC partners also received an average payout of more than £1m in the same period – albeit one flattered by the sale of another business. The post-pandemic M&amp;A boom has waned dramatically over the course of 2022, with global deals so far worth a third of what they were in 2021 as businesses brace for a possible global recession, according to Dealogic, a data company. Nevertheless, accountancy firms are still looking at growth areas such as increased demand for sustainability reporting, as well as the continued introduction of digital technology. Richard Houston, a Deloitte senior partner who also serves as chief executive, said: “Demand for all our services was strong, particularly in cloud technology, digital transformation and M&amp;A services. “Our results have enabled us to make record investments – the highest in over a decade – in reward, promotions and skills. We enter the new financial year with momentum and are well placed to navigate the current economic headwinds.”",Deloitte; Executive pay and bonuses; Financial sector; Business; Accountancy; UK news; Switzerland; World news; Europe,Business
2022-07-07T15:02:18Z,PwC partners to earn £1m each as firm sets new pay records,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/07/pwc-partners-to-earn-1m-each-as-firm-sets-new-pay-records,"Partners at PwC will receive an average of more than £1m in pay for the latest financial year, a record for the “big four” accountancy firm. PwC made an average profit per partner of £920,000 in the year to the end of June 2022, up from the previous record of £868,000 the year before and £765,000 in 2019 before the pandemic, according to unaudited figures. The big accountancy firms have enjoyed a boom in recent years thanks to the flood of corporate mergers and acquisitions following the relaxation of the first wave of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. PwC partners’ pay was topped up by an average of £100,000 each from the $2.2bn (£1.83bn) sale of a business providing tax advice for companies moving staff overseas to US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. That meant the average partner pay for the year broke through the £1m barrier. The 950 members of its top executive tier were briefed on the annual payout this week, according to Sky News, which first reported it. There is some doubt over whether the barrage of dealmaking can continue in the coming months as investors adjust to rising interest rates and become less willing to finance riskier takeovers. Yet accountants – and their burgeoning consultancy arms – are also expecting a continued boom in work advising on sustainability reporting, which is becoming increasingly common for large businesses because of regulations and investor pressure. The record payments have come despite PwC – like its rivals in the big four, Deloitte, EY and KPMG – receiving repeated censure over standards at its auditing business. The UK watchdog last month issued a £5m fine for failures in its audit of the construction firms Galliford Try and Kier. PwC is also facing investigations by the UK’s Financial Reporting Council into outsourcer Babcock, wound-down Wyelands Bank, collapsed investment firm London Capital and Finance, and Eddie Stobart Logistics. So problematic have been the perceived conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work that EY in May said it was drafting plans to spin off its auditing arm. Kevin Ellis, PwC’s UK chair and senior partner, said in a statement that profits per partner would fall in the coming year as the firm invests to defend its position. “Our business is in a strong place thanks to the breadth of our services and clients, the skills of our people, and the investments we’ve made,” he said. “It has been an exceptional year, but we can’t take this for granted. “With economic headwinds facing all businesses including rising costs and the tightness of the labour market, we have to shore up with further investment, particularly in people, skills and technology. “These investments are likely to reduce our profit per partner next year but given the expected boost to financial performance over the medium to longer term, it’s right that we make these investments now.”",PwC; Accountancy; Business; Financial sector; Executive pay and bonuses; Regulators,Business
2020-10-04T09:00:48Z,Blue sky thinking: is it time to stop work taking over our lives?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/oct/04/blue-sky-thinking-is-it-time-to-stop-work-taking-over-our-lives,"Three encounters loom large in the anthropologist James Suzman’s memory of his brief but informative stint in the corporate world. The first was early on, when he told a colleague that he didn’t need to spend the half-million pounds allocated for a task because he could do it for free. His colleague was horrified. “If you don’t spend your budget,” he said, “they won’t think we’re doing anything!” Soon afterwards, Suzman was chatting with a board director about what they’d do if they won the lottery. Suzman thought of the director’s massive townhouse and annual bonus. He was surprised when the man told him that, even with a colossal windfall, he’d continue working. Later, the same director observed to Suzman and the rest of the senior management team that they spent more time with each other than they did with their families. He delivered the line matter-of-factly, as though it were just the way work was. But Suzman knew that it didn’t have to be. Before he took his job, Suzman had spent some 15 years based among the Ju/’hoansi “Bushmen” of eastern Namibia, who were notable for having sustained a foraging society well into the 20th century. And while he lived among them, he witnessed first-hand how the hunter-gatherer life was far from the constant struggle for survival many of us imagine it to have been. In 1966, a landmark anthropology paper had found that the Ju/’hoansi were generally well nourished and lived long, content lives. They used the bulk of their time to rest, or have fun. Astonishingly, they spent just 15 hours a week finding food, and they stored little for the future, trusting in the surrounding desert to provide when required. Any individual surpluses were redistributed among the group. With social sanctions for selfishness and self-importance, their economy functioned in such a way as to eradicate inequality and material desires. Anthropologists concluded that the Ju/’hoansi worked almost exclusively to meet their immediate needs, beyond which their wants were few. By contrast, in the corporate world – the world we know, where we might work 80-hour weeks largely untethered from any question of what is required and what is lusted after – our desires seem limitless, driven by an ever-escalating demand for growth and productivity. To Suzman, the implications of this contrast were seismic. First, it suggested that the assumptions underpinning our modern economy – that we are competitive by nature, that our desires will always exceed our means – were wrong. And second, it meant that for the vast majority of our history, while we roamed the Earth as hunter-gatherers, we enjoyed more leisure time than we do today. In an age of increasing inequality, ill health, dissatisfaction and even desperation around work – and, with the coronavirus pandemic, more uncertainty than ever – it presents a hopeful thought: maybe it doesn’t have to be like this. “Half the value of understanding hunter-gatherer society is to recognise that lots of these things that we think we are hostage to are actually not a part of our nature,” says Suzman, emphatically. “We can trace our work ethic, we can understand why we became obsessed with scarcity, we can understand why it’s different now… Maybe there are other ways of doing things.” Our understanding of work as a means to an end has been so derailed it often feels as though we never stop working. We work for free and monetise our hobbies. We work on our bodies, our relationships, our selves. For many of us, maybe more than might like to admit it, work may be our primary identity. It has been the driving force of my life for nearly 20 years, the unquestioned catalyst for me to move to another country or stay up all night. Given the option of a lighter load, my preference has been for slightly too much – occasionally misjudging the line. “You’re a worker, I’m a worker,” says Suzman freely, when we meet at a café in Cambridge, where he lives. “I identify myself very much with my work. I’m actually rudderless when I’m not working; doing things like a pure leisure holiday, I find unbearable.” At its most fundamental level, says Suzman, work is the process of capturing and expending energy – so it seems fitting that he should have so much of it. He is breezy about his knowledge and persuasive in his arguments, and his mind draws links across human history just about as fast as he can express them. Suzman looks back on his seven years in a corporate role as “fieldwork in big business”. But he still seems to feel conflicted about the experience, not least when he tells me who he worked for: the diamond-mining giant De Beers. He joined in 2007 as its global director of public affairs, wooed by its talk of wanting to go green and give back. Under his leadership, the company was repeatedly recognised by the industry for its sustainability-reporting practices and environmental and social performance. As an anthropologist, Suzman learned the company culture and quickly scaled its ranks, “But the longer I was there, the more I internalised it,” he says. “I began to dislike myself terribly, sitting there thinking: ‘How’s my bonus going to look this year?’” During the 2009 recession, De Beers’s profits plum meted 99%, forcing a company restructure and redundancies that gutted his team. “I was just miserable,” he says. Suzman ended up walking out of the job in 2013. “It was one of the happiest days of my life, marching out of there – and then I went straight back to the Kalahari.” He set up the Anthropos think-tank, offering anthropological approaches to present-day problem-solving (at a corporate rate of up to £1,400 per day – half for NGOs), and later wrote a book, Affluence Without Abundance, about what the western world could learn from the Bushmen. Suzman says his time at De Beers taught him to empathise. “It’s really easy to make a caricature of business people, but they’re cultural creatures – we all try to establish meaning and legitimacy around what we do with our lives.” Many of us are unsuccessful. In a 2015 YouGov survey, 37% of Britons said their work did not meaningfully contribute to the world. In 2017, a Gallup poll of 155 counties found that only one in 10 western Europeans described themselves as engaged by their jobs. This has been framed as a workplace issue – actually, says Suzman, “it is a problem with the nature of work”. It reflects the 20th century boom in what the late anthropologist David Graeber dubbed “bullshit jobs”, creating work for work’s sake. From “human relations” departments that exist to improve attitudes to work and with it productivity, to pay and bonus structures to further favour top earners, Suzman says there has emerged “a whole class of people who were utterly invested in this idea that they were actually creating value”. The key to corporate success is convincing everyone else you’re important and worthwhile, as Suzman learned for himself at De Beers. “You developed vast bureaucracies which were ultimately pointless, but that was the skill: the bigger your bureaucracy, the more power you wielded and the more important you became. I established this vast empire – I don’t think it made a jot of difference to anything when I got out.” For a self-identifying worker, it was an important reminder: if work is a transaction of energy, our own is finite. Not long ago, we dreamed of being liberated from work altogether. In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes imagined a future in which technological innovation, efficiency gains and long-term capital growth might usher in a “golden age of leisure” in which we could satisfy our needs by working no more than 15 hours a week. But a century of efforts to reduce work disappeared after the Second World War. Though labour productivity has increased roughly four- or five-fold in industrialised nations since then, average weekly working hours have remained stubborn at just under 40 hours a week. This is in part a result of our innate drive to keep ourselves occupied, says Suzman: “People like to be busy. This is an absolute fundamental thing: we like to be skilled, we like to whittle, we like to carve.” In his new book, Work: A History of How We Spend Our Time, Suzman takes a discursive path through millennia of milestones to trace our contemporary relationship to work – and concludes that the problem is a “very simple set of assumptions about human nature, which are clearly and demonstrably wrong”. Chief among them is our preoccupation with scarcity – a hangover from the early agricultural state some 12,000 years ago, when we went from foragers to farmers. Somewhat paradoxically, in being able to cultivate and store food, we became fixated on the possibility we might not have enough – even as our productivity was turbo-charged by the agricultural and industrial revolutions. The necessity – not to mention, moral good – of hard work was a cultural mantra that became hardwired over time, and persisted even as the driver switched from survival to financial capital. The emergence of cities 8,000 years ago created a whole new kind of work driven not by our material needs – those were met by farmers – but by desires: for status, pleasure, wealth and power. “Greed became institutionalised with cities,” says Suzman. Our new physical proximity to wealth also exacerbated our anxiety over scarcity, focusing our minds on how we were lacking. “Suddenly there was now this confrontation, this contrast in wealth, and I think that began to shape people. It created this melancholy of constant aspiration.” Signs of this are everywhere, says Suzman, from grand country-house gates in front of a humble semi-detached to the global trade in counterfeit luxury goods. Social media works as an “ostentation-amplifier”, reassuring ourselves of our success but further escalating our material desires. “As a species, when we see inequality, we try to either level it down, which is what the Bushman approach was – or we try to level up to it,” says Suzman. We may not even be conscious of the path we’ve chosen, with people routinely underestimating the extent of material inequality in their home countries. A recent report by Tax Justice found that Britons think accumulating wealth is positive and morally right, and are broadly supportive of the ultra-rich, believing them to have been rewarded for sacrifice and ambition. Tellingly, even the ultra-rich have not made it off the treadmill, tending to work longer hours and spend less time on leisure. But growth has become such an obsession, says Suzman, that, “We now spend most of our energy doing utterly pointless things” – which is damaging not only to our health but to that of the planet through emissions. As an ex-smoker, Suzman likens it to a nicotine addiction. “We pump crap into the atmosphere. It doesn’t make us happy. I can’t work out who benefits.” As Suzman is talking, I consider work as the source of both my greatest satisfactions and my most miserable lows. I’d continue to do my job, and maybe even to periodically burn out, even if I had no material need to do so. My relationship to work may be the most significant in my life – but I am often made uncomfortably aware that the feeling isn’t mutual. For me, I tell Suzman – as I have told successive therapists, and with no small sadness – the hollowness emerges from a system that makes it seem both joyless and endless. “It’s that at the moment,” he agrees. “But it’s that feeling that makes me vaguely optimistic that we won’t put up with this any more.” In just six months, coronavirus has underscored much of what wasn’t working about work, and created the opportunity for change. “Essential workers” have been celebrated and revealed to be undervalued and underpaid. The successful switch to working from home may make punishing commutes – or even inner-city business districts – a thing of the past. Social media has abandoned “every day I’m hustling” in favour of a new catch cry: “You don’t have to be productive during a pandemic.” And the furlough scheme opened many people’s eyes to how the economy could be put to work for everybody. Support for once-fringe ideas that might redress a work-life balance skewed beyond proportion, such as a universal basic income (UBI) or a four-day week, has been voiced even from conservative corners. It is proof to Suzman that as “stupidly intransigent” as humans can be with regards to culture, “they do change when change is forced upon them” – a hopeful thought for the looming climate crisis. What we must do now, Suzman says, is to seize the opportunity to explore new approaches to organising capital. “We know that there’s a problem: there’s the environmental aspect, the misery aspect. What we have to do is acknowledge that we actually have these problems… and take experimentation seriously.” Trialling a UBI, or ways of turning office blocks into housing, are two such possible steps towards a “future world order”, says Suzman. We are, after all, unable to go back. Even the Ju/’hoansi could not return to a hunter-gatherer economy today, says Suzman, but; “I think an economy based on abundance is a cultural possibility, and a choice.” The Ju/’hoansi view of the world as “fundamentally a sharing place… cascaded through everything about their society,” he says. “There’s a recognising that when you take things out of a hierarchy, there’s a great deal more freedom.” In imagining a new way to work, we might start by asking ourselves if our desires really are infinite – and what we are prepared to pay for them. Suzman is hopeful. “I don’t know anybody with infinite desires,” he says. “I think for most people, they’re pretty modest.” Work: A History of How We Spend Our Time, by James Suzman, is out now (Bloomsbury, £25).

2019-07-09T06:00:53Z,Social stock exchange idea highlights India’s move away from foreign aid,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/09/india-social-stock-exchange-could-revolutionise-ethical-impact-businesses-aid-nirmala-sitharaman,"India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has called for the creation of a “social stock exchange”, allowing ethically minded investors to buy stakes in social enterprises, volunteer groups and welfare organisations. The proposal would be a radical experiment in a country characterised by stark inequality and rapid economic growth. If created, the exchange could provide new and cheaper sources of financing for social welfare projects, while showcasing India’s independence from foreign aid as it seeks to enhance its position on the world stage. “It is time to take our capital markets closer to the masses and meet various social welfare objectives related to inclusive growth and financial inclusion,” Sitharaman said in her maiden budget speech on Friday. Sitharaman’s plan for a social stock exchange marks a new focus on sustainability and social impact in business, said Amit Bhatia, CEO of the Global Steering Group for Impact Investment. “Before, the main objective of investors was to maximise return,” Bhatia said. “In the past few years, impact funds have multiplied and every major private equity firm is jumping in.” According to Bhatia, such “impact” assets have risen from $0 to $22tn (£17tn) in the past two decades, and almost all the major S&amp;P 500 companies are doing some sort of sustainability reporting. “It’s an unstoppable trend,” he said. “We have found a higher purpose for capital.” He said a social stock exchange, if launched, would mean the government would have to create a legal definition of “social enterprise”, and businesses would start measuring the social and environmental impact of their work. The exchange has another benefit – it could highlight India’s self sufficiency as it makes a bid for superpower status. In the past decade, successive governments in India, including Narendra Modi’s, have been hostile to foreign-funded NGOs. Critics see international NGOs as a neo-colonial enterprise and a conduit for Westerners to meddle in Indian affairs. Between 2014 and 2018, foreign contributions to India declined 40%, largely because the government cancelled the licences of thousands of NGOs, according to Bain and Company’s 2019 philanthropy report. “India has a very vibrant social entrepreneurship scene,” said Subhash Chandra Garg, India’s finance secretary. “We have almost eliminated foreign aid. We are independent. We are financing our own development.” Garg said that the launch of the exchange was still in its “exploratory stage”. If created, the exchange is likely to be regulated by India’s Securities and Exchange Board and allow charitable organisations to raise capital in the form of stocks or trading units. Critics of Modi suggested the exchange may be used to increase the funds available to political organisations. “Nobody that I’ve spoken to [inside the finance ministry] actually seems to understand what they’ve proposed,” said Mihir Sharma, an economist at the Observer Research Foundation. “The safest thing to assume is it has something to do with professionalising the NGOs.” Modi’s Hindu nationalist government has strong links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a network of right-wing volunteer organisations. The RSS is known in India for undertaking vast social projects such as building toilets in rural areas and cleanliness drives, but have also been criticised for being Islamophobic. Sharma said that like strongmen leaders around the world, Modi’s government was distrustful of academia and experts and looked to right-wing thinkers for policy ideas. “One of the things that was unique about his first term was that he has less trust for western-educated economists than those from within the RSS,” he said. “You could say the demonetisation experiment was very much something that emerged from that group of thinkers. “This budget was part of the broadening of the indigenisation of economic thinking. It’s looking for an Indian solution to Indian problems.”",Global development; Governance; India; South and central Asia; World news; Money; Business,Global development
