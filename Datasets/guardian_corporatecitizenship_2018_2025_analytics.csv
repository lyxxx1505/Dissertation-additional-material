2024-03-27T14:00:27Z,Fears grow Meta will block news on Facebook and Instagram as Australian government faces pressure to act,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/28/meta-facebook-news-tab-instagram-fears-blocked-australian-government-regulation,"Meta will either reduce the amount of news people see or block it entirely on Facebook and Instagram, experts and publishers warn, as the government faces pressure to require Meta to show news content and pay for it. Meta informed publishers nearly a month ago that it would not enter new multimillion-dollar deals for content when contracts expire this year. Since then the Albanese government has kicked off a process to potentially designate the tech company under the news media bargaining code. Publishers received letters from the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, two weeks ago asking for information on whether Meta should be designated under NMBC, which would require Meta to negotiate with news publishers for payment for content shared on its platform or face fines worth 10% of its Australian revenue. Axel Bruns, a professor of communication and media studies at Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Media Research Centre, studied the impact of the six-day 2021 news ban in Australia, and told Guardian Australia it was likely Meta would stick with a ban, as it had in Canada since August. “The absence of news from their services that this produces would give them a pretty good argument to challenge any NMBC requirements to share ad revenue with Australian news publishers in court,” he said. Instagram last week introduced a change that opts users out of having political content recommended to them unless they opt into it. Meta has said it plans to make the change for Facebook too. Bruns said if Meta were not designated under the news media bargaining code, it would probably just continue to reduce the amount of news seen on the platforms. “In fact doing so gives them a good argument against designation too: the less news content plays any significant role [or] has any significant visibility on their platforms, the less there is an argument for sharing ad revenue with news publishers via the NMBC mechanism,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Smaller news publishers, many of whom did not make a deal with Meta when the NMBC was brought in back in 2021, agreed it was likely Meta would remove news. Tim Duggan, the chair of the Digital Publishers Alliance, a group of more than 100 smaller publishers such as Private Media, Broadsheet, Man of Many and others, said in an opinion piece this month that it was likely Meta would do what it did in Canada and block news. He said this disproportionately affected the smaller publishers that were more reliant on social media for traffic and revenue compared with larger news outlets, forcing staff cuts or closures. The alliance is reportedly calling for a “must carry” law that would require Meta to take news on its platforms. The publishers have an ally in News Corp, with the company’s Australian head, Michael Miller, telling Mi3 last week that designating Meta under the code carried risks, and including a “must carry” obligation should be considered. Labor, Liberal and Greens politicians have also sided against Meta since the announcement. Rowland told ABC radio on Wednesday that Meta has “such large revenues and market power and wealth that exceeds the GDP of some nations” and should be complying with the NMBC. “This is a pattern of behaviour by Meta and we are very well aware of some of the other issues that involve Meta at the moment in terms of their lack of responsibility, lack of transparency and accountability, which is only capable of being exercised when you do have that market power,” she said. Dr Michelle Ananda-Rajah, the Labor MP for the Victorian electorate of Higgins, told parliament on Tuesday Meta “should have been strangled at birth” due “to the litany of social harms, from extremism, scams and the weakening of democracies we can add the deteriorating mental health of our children”. The Liberal MP David Coleman told Sky News on Monday that Meta’s conduct had been “appalling” and “disgraceful” and called on the government to get the company to pay. “Well, they have got to get it done. I mean, we got it done, that’s the bottom line. All that matters is the outcome.” Rowland said the government was following the process to designate under the code for a “very strong reason”. “This is a highly litigious organisation with deep pockets. We need to follow this very closely, but of course the government is well aware and is examining a range of issues involving Meta and their lack of good corporate citizenship when it comes to online harms.” The Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown said last week Meta should not be allowed to “bully users, journalists and democratically elected governments by deciding which laws of the land they will choose to comply with” and Meta should be designated. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment. This month the company defended its decision, stating it should not be the role of global tech companies to solve the issues facing news media, and people were not coming to Facebook for news content.",Australian media; Meta; Australia news; Facebook; Instagram; Australian politics; Social media; Media,Media
2023-07-09T09:00:41Z,Meet the DC thinktank giving big oil ‘the opportunity to say they’ve done something’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/09/climate-leadership-council-big-oil-thinktank,"The New York Times op-ed opened on a provocative note: “There is a real danger that the climate debate is deteriorating into a game of name-calling,” it began, “with oil and gas companies all too often portrayed as opponents of climate progress.” The January 2020 article was written by the founder of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), a Washington DC-based non-profit that advocates for scrapping certain fossil fuel regulations and replacing them with a carbon tax, with the proceeds from the tax returned to Americans as a rebate. Among the group’s “corporate founding members” are some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, including Shell, BP and, until 2021, Exxon – companies that have indeed spent decades, and billions of dollars, opposing climate progress. The CLC launched in 2017 with a report by a “who’s who” of pre-Trump Republican officials and insiders, including former Republican cabinet secretaries James Baker and George Shultz. Since then the CLC and its lobbying arm have steadily attracted elite media coverage and supporters, including the current treasury secretary, Janet Yellen. “There is wide agreement among economists that this is the most effective and market-friendly way to reduce carbon emissions,” Yellen told the Washington Post in 2020. The fossil fuel industry has a long history of hiring public relations firms to create front groups to obstruct climate legislation and sow confusion and doubt about climate change. But the CLC is not a front group. The organization’s “carbon dividends” proposal is real. Last month when a bipartisan pair of US senators introduced a bill that lays the groundwork for a carbon tariff, the Prove It Act, the CLC hailed the move as “an important step towards better understanding, and ultimately leveraging, America’s carbon advantage”. To its critics, however, the policy details of the CLC plan and those it supports are secondary to what the group itself offers its oil and gas industry members: a climate change “solution” that they can be for – one that, conveniently, stands little chance of becoming law. As fossil fuel companies continue lobbying against climate legislation, funding anti-climate politicians, bringing home sky-high profits from oil and gas sales, and doubling down on business models anchored on fossil fuel extraction and consumption, public participation in a “climate leadership council” appears to be an asset that corporations can deploy to perform the role of problem-solver while justifying their opposition to other laws and regulations. “There is a part of me that sees this as, ‘We can hold industry accountable a little bit without having to be in a place of discomfort, [without] holding them accountable in the way that climate change, environmental injustice, requires,” said Dana Johnson, the senior director of strategy and federal policy at We Act for Environmental Justice. “I think it gives people the opportunity to say that they’ve done something … It’s safe.” *** Titled “The conservative case for carbon dividends”, the original CLC report called for a steadily rising carbon tax that “might begin at $40 a ton”, with the proceeds returned to Americans in checks estimated to start around $2,000 a year for a family of four. The plan also featured a tariff on imports from countries without carbon pricing to discourage commerce from moving abroad and to give “lower-emitting US manufacturers … a competitive advantage”, said Greg Bertelsen, the group’s CEO, in a statement emailed to the Guardian. The final plank of the CLC’s original plan was the repeal of not just federal emissions regulations but the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate carbon emissions at all. And buried in that section was another line that would be easy to miss: that a carbon tax “would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters”. This otherwise innocuous sentence captured what Richard Wiles, the head of the non-profit Center for Climate Integrity, called the oil and gas industry’s “number one thing”: legal immunity for companies’ contributions to global warming and to the damages of climate change, and for their decades-long campaigns to deceive the public and obstruct legislative action. The CLC removed the liability provision from its proposal in September 2019. “Misinformation on the issue was distracting focus away from the many economic and environmental upsides of the plan,” Bertelsen said. Asked whether the organization would consider resurrecting some sort of liability waiver if it meant gaining industry support for carbon dividends legislation, the CEO said that “we have no plans to revisit the issue”. But the CLC’s agenda might differ from that of its industry backers. “No one is fooled into thinking [that] because they took it off their website,” oil and gas companies will not continue to push for a liability waiver, Wiles said. Even Axios, which has given the CLC steady coverage and space to make its case, noted that “a similar proposal can always be added in the actual legislative process.” *** The CLC’s support is not limited to the fossil fuel industry. Among the group’s corporate founding members were Conservation International and the Nature Conservancy, two environmental non-profits. Today it also counts as organizational partners companies such as Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, PepsiCo and JPMorgan Chase. But the CLC’s partners also include BP, Shell, Total, ConocoPhillips and the mining giant BHP; until 2021, one of its most prominent members was ExxonMobil. In response to questions from the Guardian about the organization’s backing from companies that have helped create and sustain the climate crisis, the CLC sent a statement that echoed the founder’s New York Times op-ed: “Energy companies have the scale, research and development budgets, expertise and infrastructures needed to expand low-carbon energy technologies … and to pioneer new technological breakthroughs.” If fossil fuel giants can indeed contribute to the CLC, the companies have found ways for their membership to contribute to them in return. Exxon’s trajectory is illustrative. Even before the CLC officially revealed its corporate supporters in June 2017, Exxon’s chairman and CEO, Darren Woods, announced the company’s support during its annual shareholder meeting. Not long after, Exxon began peppering public filings and corporate publications with mentions of its membership. In the company’s next “corporate citizenship report”, Exxon wrote that its participation in the CLC was evidence of how Exxon was “engaging on climate change policy”. The following year Exxon’s sustainability report included multiple mentions of its CLC membership. On 8 October 2018, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a monumental assessment warning that keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C “would require rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, including deep emissions cuts. The very next day, as the University of Miami climate disinformation expert Geoffrey Supran noted, Exxon announced it would donate $1m over two years to Americans for Carbon Dividends, the CLC’s lobbying arm. The $500,000 that Exxon would give in 2018 paled in comparison with the $11.15m the company would spend lobbying that year – let alone the $71.9bn it would report in revenue that quarter. Yet the donation nevertheless earned the company headlines in Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, Axios, the Washington Post and CNN, among other outlets widely read by lawmakers, staffers and government officials. In a tweet, Supran called the company’s donation “PR Crisis Management 101: Change the narrative”. Over the following years Exxon continued to tout its support for carbon pricing and its membership of the CLC. In the spring of 2021, a group of Exxon shareholders asked the company to publish a report outlining how its climate lobbying efforts “align with the goal of limiting average global warming to well below” 2C. In explaining why shareholders should vote against the proposal, Exxon’s board said that such a report would be “unnecessary” –in part because the company was already a member of the CLC. In August 2021 Exxon was “suspended” from the CLC after a company lobbyist was caught on tape saying that Exxon had pledged to support a national carbon tax because such a policy was unlikely to ever become law. “A carbon tax is not going to happen,” the lobbyist said. Supporting the concept “gives us a talking point that we can say, ‘Well, what is ExxonMobil for? Well, we’re for a carbon tax.’” While the comments sparked a media firestorm, they were little more than a concise articulation of a strategy that Exxon and its competitors had been executing transparently for years, said Matto Mildenberger, a political science professor at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). “There has been a serious effort by some big fossil fuel interest groups to support a carbon tax because they understand that it’s much less likely to happen,” said Mildenberger, an expert in the politics of climate change. “And even if it does happen, it’s never going to be [politically] possible to increase that carbon tax to a level that would threaten the economic wellbeing of entrenched fossil fuel interests.” Exxon has reached the same conclusion. In 2018 the state of New York sued the oil giant, alleging that it had deceived its shareholders by asserting that the implementation of a carbon tax would not devalue the company’s fossil fuel reserves enough to threaten its business model. “Exxon was essentially saying, ‘We can have a carbon price, and it won’t strand our assets,’” said Benjamin Franta, head of the Climate Litigation Lab at Oxford’s Sustainable Law Programme. The company’s argument, Franta said, was that even with a $40-a-ton tax on carbon–the starting point of the CLC proposal–“our fossil fuel development is so profitable that even if a carbon price is enacted, it won’t strand our projects, and therefore we’re a safe investment.” Exxon won the case. *** One of the CLC’s key selling points for its plan is the organization’s own polling, which suggests bipartisan public support for “charging fossil fuel companies for their carbon emissions and giving the money back to Americans with the goal of cutting emissions”. Crucially, however, these questions are about an idea. As soon as this idea begins to shift from a “talking point”, as the Exxon lobbyist put it, into a tangible legislative proposal, it is likely to be rendered politically toxic. Canada is among the handful of countries to have implemented some sort of carbon dividend. In Canada, UCSB’s Matto Mildenberger and his colleagues found, four out of five Canadians receive more money from the dividend than they pay in higher taxes. Yet many people are nevertheless convinced that the policy makes them worse off. “Even telling people that they had received this money did nothing to change their support for the policy,” Mildenberger said. “Their understanding of [the] costs and benefits are mediated by politics.” Mildenberger’s US surveys have yielded a similar conclusion. As soon as politics enters the equation – an inevitability in any American debate about climate policy – public support for a carbon dividends plan immediately plummets. “The minute you add even the slightest mention of politics into this scenario … that weakens all the effects [of support for the concept],” Mildenberger said. Once you suggest to people that Democrats and Republicans disagree over whether carbon pricing is a good idea, “people just stop trusting much of the information you’re giving them.” To skeptics of the carbon dividends proposal, the fact that it remains trapped in the realm of the hypothetical helps explain the industry’s enthusiasm for it – and its determination to keep it there. Decades of unsuccessful attempts to implement some form of carbon pricing in the United States suggest that oil and gas companies’ rhetorical support for the idea of carbon dividends has little bearing on whether they would back an actual carbon dividends proposal. “They are playing a two-level game here,” Mildenberger said. “On one hand, part of their strategy is to ensure that whatever policy gets written into law, or is voted on, is the lesser evil of the policies that might be voted on. And then they’re still going to try and stop even that policy from being passed because they prefer no policy.” In the late 1980s, for instance, when scientists and environmental advocates began calling for mandatory emissions reductions, “already at that time you [saw] industry spokespeople saying, ‘We need market-based mechanisms rather than mandates,’” said Oxford’s Benjamin Franta. Seemingly in response to that preference for market-based policy, the Clinton administration moved to pass a tax on heat levels in fuel. But by June 1993 the administration was forced to abandon the effort after intensive industry lobbying. Companies and their trade groups publicly opposed the tax, while at the same time maneuvering feverishly (and successfully) to secure extensive loopholes and exemptions in the event that it did pass. The Obama White House also encountered what Franta called the industry’s “bait and switch tactics”. The administration’s cap-and-trade proposal, which Obama repeatedly heralded as market-based, would have limited national carbon emissions and created a new market for emitters to buy and sell permits. Despite previous industry support for cap and trade and months of dealmaking with the administration and congressional negotiators, the bill ultimately died in the Senate after an onslaught of hundreds of millions of dollars of fossil fuel lobbying and campaigning. State-level carbon pricing efforts have run into similarly vehement opposition. In 2017 BP joined the CLC as a corporate founding member and began promoting its membership on its website and in corporate reports. The following year the company spent about $13m opposing a carbon pricing measure in Washington state, even though the carbon tax in the state’s proposal would have begun at $15 a ton – less than half of the starting point of the CLC plan, which BP still claims to support. The sum that BP spent to defeat the Washington effort was 13 times greater than what the company would later pledge to the CLC’s lobbying arm. “Most oil and gas companies recognize the threat of climate change and want to be part of the solution,” the CLC’s founder wrote in that 2020 op-ed. Yet today these same companies are still lobbying to block climate laws and regulations. They’re still helping elect anti-climate politicians. They’re still trying to capture international climate conferences. They’re still developing business plans centered on fossil fuels. They’re still choosing not to channel their immense political power into policies that might threaten their profits. “I don’t know what world people are living in when they think the most powerful companies in the history of mankind are going to suddenly wake up and say, ‘You know what? This oil and gas thing – I don’t know what we were thinking,’” said the Center for Climate Integrity’s Richard Wiles. “There’s just no way. Why? Why would they do that?”",Business; Environment; ExxonMobil; BP; Shell; Oil; Oil and gas companies,US news
2022-09-26T13:44:43Z,Revealed: world’s biggest meat firm appears to have avoided millions in UK tax,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/26/worlds-biggest-meat-company-appears-avoided-millions-in-uk-tax,"The global megacompanies supplying some of Britain’s most popular meat brands, including KFC, Nando’s chicken and Sainsbury’s organic range, appear to have been using offshore companies that allow them to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax in the UK. An investigation by the Guardian and Lighthouse Reports has found that two companies – Anglo Beef Processors UK and Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (owned by Brazilian beef giant JBS) – appear to have reduced their tax bill by structuring their companies and loans in a way that allows them to take advantage of different tax systems, in what one expert has described as “aggressive tax avoidance”. These practices are not illegal, but they have proliferated over the past couple of decades as multinational companies and their accountants spot opportunities to reduce their tax bills. Many argue that complicated financial structures can allow some companies to avoid paying their fair share of tax. And that, they say, leads to falling income for national governments as taxpayers are forced to pick up the tab. In this instance, the meat companies concerned have branches both in the UK and in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which have different tax regimes. By lending money from a company in one country to a related company in the other, and then borrowing it back at a different interest rate, the companies can significantly and legally cut their tax bills. A tax expert suggested the strategies used by Anglo Beef Processors UK and Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation amounted to “aggressive tax avoidance” and, while not illegal, were “inconsistent with good corporate citizenship. And the public, who are customers of all these meat companies, doesn’t like it.” The Guardian and Lighthouse Reports estimated that the two meat companies appear to have avoided paying tax on more than £160m. Both companies said they were tax compliant in all the jurisdictions in which they operate. UK’s top beef producer Anglo Beef Processors UK (ABP UK) runs the ABP Food Group’s UK beef operation and is the UK’s top producer of beef. It is a leading supplier of meat to UK supermarkets through own-label and branded products. ABP UK appears to have transferred interest payments to another company in the ABP Food Group – Trojaan Investering BV – based in the Netherlands, according to Trojaan’s publicly available annual reports published by the Dutch Business Register. In its annual reports, Trojaan Investering BV describes itself as a financing company and says it is part of the ABP Food Group. Its reports also say the company has no employees. Its 2017 annual report detailed a loan of £63m given to ABP UK at an interest rate of 5% and repayable in December 2022. This would equate to £3.15m in interest paid each year by ABP UK to Trojaan, which would be deductible from its UK tax bill. The report shows Trojaan took out interest-free loans from other group companies based in Ireland and Jersey. According to its annual reports between 2013 and 2017, Trojaan made €118m (£103m), almost all of which was from interest on loans to other group companies owned by the ABP Food Group. Between 2013 and 17, its reports appear to show Trojaan paid €1.1m (£960,000) in tax, an average effective tax rate of 0.9%. As an unlimited company, ABP UK is not required to file public accounts. A spokesperson for ABP said: “We have been and remain tax compliant in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We have no further comment to make.” World’s biggest meat company Pilgrim’s UK and Moy Park – both part of the US-based Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation – currently control 25% and 30% of the UK pork and poultry markets respectively, according to their websites, and are both majority owned by the world’s biggest meat producer, the Brazilian beef giant JBS. The UK holding company of Pilgrim’s UK and Moy Park – called Onix Investments UK Ltd – appears to have made interest payments totalling $172.8m (£147m) to a group company based in Luxembourg called Sandstone Holdings over a four-year period between 2017 and 2020, according to publicly available annual reports filed in Luxembourg. According to its annual reports, Sandstone Holdings appeared to lend money to Onix at 6% and 7.5% interest between 2017 and 20, but appeared to borrow money from other companies owned by the group interest-free. Sandstone Holdings recorded profits of $160m (£141m) between 2017 and 2020 and appeared to have paid $299,000 (£220,000) in tax, according to its company reports, an average effective tax rate of 0.19%. Sandstone Holdings had no staff costs in that period, suggesting that it didn’t employ anyone. In response to the use of offshore companies and the deducting of interest payments to them by ABP UK and Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation, Reuven Avi-Yonah, a professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School, suggested there was “no question that this is aggressive tax avoidance”. “These companies get financed by 0% loans and they pay very little tax because they’re holding companies and Luxembourg and the Netherlands apply special taxing rules to holding companies in order to attract business,” said Avi-Yonah, who is also a former consultant to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Alex Cobham, CEO of the Tax Justice Network, suggested that “this gives all the appearance of tax avoidance, designed to prevent the declaration and taxation of profits in the location of the underlying real activity – ie, the place where the profits actually arise. What I may consider abusive is not necessarily unlawful, however, such are the failings of the international tax rules.” A spokesperson for JBS USA and Pilgrim’s said: “Pilgrim’s and its subsidiaries work to ensure compliance with all tax laws and regulations of the countries in which the companies operate, as well as openness and transparency in the approach to dealing with tax authorities. “In the UK, Pilgrim’s has invested approximately £2bn since 2017 in acquisitions and capital expenditures, and it is focused on continued investment in the region.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

2020-07-10T17:44:36Z,G4S fined £44m by Serious Fraud Office over electronic tagging,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/10/g4s-fined-44m-by-serious-office-over-electronic-tagging,"Security firm G4S has been fined £44m by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) as part of an agreement that will see it avoid prosecution for overcharging the Ministry of Justice for the electronic tagging of offenders, some of whom had died. The SFO said G4S had accepted responsibility for three counts of fraud that were carried out in an effort to “dishonestly mislead” the government, in order to boost its profits. Former justice minister Chris Grayling asked the SFO to investigate G4S and rival Serco in 2013, after a departmental review found they had overcharged for tracking the movements of people who had moved abroad, returned to prison, or died. G4S agreed to compensate the Ministry of Justice in 2014, reaching a settlement worth £121m.But it remained under investigation by the SFO until Friday, when it announced a deferred prosecution agreement, pending approval by a judge at a hearing scheduled for next Friday. Under the terms of the agreement, G4S will pay a £38.5m penalty and £5.9m to cover the SFO’s costs. The company was given a 40% discount on its fine after co-operating with the SFO. It has also agreed to enforce new controls, including a programme of “corporate renewal” to prevent a repeat of the scandal, which took place within its G4S Care &amp; Justice division. “G4S Care &amp; Justice repeatedly lied to the Ministry of Justice, profiting to the tune of millions of pounds and failing to provide the openness, transparency, and overall good corporate citizenship that UK taxpayers expect and deserve from companies entering into government contracts,” SFO director Lisa Osofsky said. “The terms of this deferred prosecution agreement will provide substantial oversight and assurance regarding G4S Care &amp; Justice’s commitment to responsible corporate behaviour.” G4S chief executive Ashley Almanza said: “The behaviour which resulted in the offences committed in 2011 and 2012 is completely counter to the group’s values and standards and is not tolerated within G4S.” “We have apologised to the UK government and implemented significant changes to people, policies, practices and controls, designed to ensure that our culture is underpinned by high ethical standards and that our business is always conducted in a manner which is consistent with our values. “We have made significant progress in embedding these standards throughout the group and we are pleased that this has been acknowledged by the SFO and the UK government.” The £44.4m in fines and costs takes the total paid out by outsourcing firms involved in the prisoner tagging scandal to more than £250m. Serco reached its own £22.9m agreement with the SFO last year, six years after repaying £68m to the Ministry of Justice. The SFO said its agreement with G4S was made possible by factors including the company’s disclosure of evidence and its “overall – albeit delayed – substantial cooperation” with the investigation.",G4S; Serco; Serious Fraud Office; Business; Law; UK news; Regulators,Business
2018-10-23T10:00:15Z,Think Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the same? They aren't | Bhaskar Sunkara,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/23/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-democratic-party-2020-differences,"For progressives subjected to daily outrage from the Trump administration, there’s something to look forward to. In 2020, they’ll be spoiled for choice – presumptive candidates in the Democratic field are tacking to the left and both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are acting like people running for president. While a 2020 campaign by Sanders wouldn’t be surprising given that he ran before, Warren has long denied that she has any interest in becoming president. That seems to have recently changed. Warren said last month that she would “take a hard look” at running in 2020. And then, last week, she made headlines by releasing a DNA test to counter Donald Trump’s claims that she was misleading people over her ancestry – a move largely interpreted as preparation for a presidential run. Warren and Sanders have been conflated for years – commentators often talk of a “Sanders-Warren wing” of the Democratic party. But the two are not the same, and though Warren is an ally of many progressive causes, the best chance that we have to not just construct some better policy, but reconfigure a generation of American politics lies with Sanders running and capturing both the Democratic primary and the presidency. Arguing between two seemingly good choices can seem from afar like the bickering of two rival fan clubs. But there are significant differences between Warren’s and Sanders’ approaches to politics and what their respective victories would mean in a country desperately in need of change. To understate things, Sanders’ background is unusual. He was trained in the dying remnants of the Socialist party and cut his political teeth in trade union and civil rights organizing. His lifelong lesson? The rich were not morally confused but rather have a vested interest in the exploitation of others. Power would have to be taken from them by force. Sanders’ message from his early days in third-party politics to today has been remarkably consistent. Back in the early 1970s he denounced “the world of Richard Nixon, and the millionaires and billionaires whom he represents”. Even back then he was reminding audiences: “This is the world of the 2% of the population that owns more than one-third of the personally held wealth in America.” Warren’s career started as an academic, teaching at law schools and establishing herself as an expert on bankruptcy and consumer protection. Believing that markets fundamentally worked, but the rules of the game needed to be fairer, Warren was a registered Republican until 1995. In the six years since she won her Senate seat, Warren has established herself as a credible, progressive Democrat. But her background hints at the difference between her more wonkish approach – seeking to construct better policy but not an alternative politics – and the class-struggle, worker-centric approach of Sanders. Not surprisingly, Warren has been keen to assure business interests that she believes that “strong, healthy markets are the key to a strong healthy America” and that she “is a capitalist”. Warren does have significant support among the Netroots Nation crowd, but it’s telling that she also appears to be getting traction among prominent Democratic party policy types: Anita Dunn, Brian Fallon, John Podesta, Neera Tanden and Matt Yglesias, among others, have had positive things to say about her in the media lately. Sanders – an outsider without ties to many prominent in the liberal politics during the Obama years – gets no such love. Yglesias, in particular, has showed interest in Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act, a plan that, to her credit, is far more ambitious than that of her other Democratic colleagues. It would require the largest businesses to engage in “codetermination” with their employees, giving workers more say in management, and limit corporate political activity and what executives could do with their company shares. But it relies on notions of “corporate citizenship”, and it’s clear in her Wall Street Journal op-ed promoting the act that Warren sees neoliberalism as an ideological shift that can be corrected while retaining many of the existing parameters of capitalism. For Warren, US capitalism used to be good: “Corporations sought to succeed in the marketplace, but they also recognized their obligations to employees, customers and the community.” But then something changed in the 1980s: “Building on work by conservative economist Milton Friedman, a new theory emerged that corporate directors had only one obligation: to maximize shareholder returns.” But it wasn’t a moral failing that brought about neoliberalism, but a structural shift: corporations in the 1970s couldn’t keep up with militant wage demands from unions, the after-effect of the Opec oil shock and increased international competition. Profitability sagged. Without a broader ideological agenda, capital knew that it had to restructure itself and saw labor regulations and unions as impediments. Neoliberal mantras and ideology followed these developments. The only way to undo that U-turn is to rebuild the trade unions and leftwing political movements that could actually bring about a different sort of political economy. And that won’t come from the politics of shared responsibility, or clever policy initiatives, it’ll come from the mobilization of people on the streets, and in their workplaces and communities. Sanders is the only candidate that can open up those possibilities. It will be easy for Sanders supporters to spread their vision to people who feel unrepresented by establishment politics. With his relentlessly disciplined messaging, Sanders has communicated to millions exactly what he is about. It isn’t “corporate citizenship”, it’s creating a “political revolution” to get what’s rightfully ours from “millionaires and billionaires”. More and more people are struggling and looking for an alternative: Medicare for All, a jobs program, tuition-free college and a living wage are all incredibly popular. In large part, this is because of Sanders and the movements he has spent his life supporting and has recently helped revitalize. Whether or not they want to call it democratic socialism, millions of Americans are ready for a political revolution built around their needs. Elizabeth Warren is a progressive who can be an important part of a broad coalition for change, but we need a democratic socialist leading that coalition if we’re to deliver it.

2019-01-25T14:00:13Z,A new message from Democrats: it's time to empower workers in America | Robert Reich,https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2019/jan/25/election-2020-capitalism-democrats-workers,"Over 800,000 federal employees and 1.5 million federal contract workers are now pawns in Trump’s brinksmanship over shutting down the US government. Trump has also frozen federal workers’ pay for 2019, stopping the automatic 2.1% cost-of-living increase all civilian workers would have received under federal pay laws. It’s hardly the first time American workers have been pawns in larger power games. It happens all the time in the private sector. A private-equity firm gains control and eliminates a sizable portion of a company’s jobs. A merger generates a frenzy of payroll cuts. New management threatens to ship jobs offshore if workers don’t accept wage cuts. American capitalism has become more arbitrary and autocratic than at any time in modern history. Not only have most paychecks stopped rising, but economic security has vanished. Few working people feel any sense of control over their lives. This has happened for several reasons. Capital markets are more demanding. Wall Street is insisting that corporations squeeze out every ounce of profit quarter by quarter. It’s easier than ever to outsource jobs to contractors, foreign-based workers, or automated machines, all of which will do them more cheaply. Economic power has become more concentrated in a relative handful of large corporations that can keep a lid on wages even in a tight labor market. Meanwhile, labor union membership has declined precipitously. Most workers no longer have a way to fight back. In the 1950s, over a third of all US private-sector workers were unionized; today, fewer than 7% are. Unionization in the public sector is also dropping, from 38.7% in 1994 to less than 35% today. All of which may explain why, as America begins ramping up to the 2020 presidential election, Democratic candidates are talking about empowering workers. The Ohio senator Sherrod Brown has embarked on a “dignity of work” tour of key voting states ahead of a potential run for the Democratic presidential nomination – along with a 77-page economic plan to reverse “the declining value of work” and “make life better for all workers”. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who may run again, has introduced new bills encouraging employee ownership. California’s senator Kamala Harris, who recently declared her candidacy, has demanded that Amazon “be subject to oversight that protects the dignity of workers”. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has also declared her candidacy, has come up with the most detailed proposals to date. She wants any corporation with revenue over $1bn to obtain a federal charter of corporate citizenship requiring company directors to consider the interests of all relevant stakeholders – including customers, employees, and the communities in which the company operates. Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act also requires that 40% of the boards of such corporations be elected by employees. As the Democratic race heats up, expect more proposals to give workers greater say – including tripartite wage boards, sectoral bargaining, and independent works councils (similar to those that the United States occupying force wrote for Germany in 1946). Candidates will also want to make it harder for companies to reclassify employees as contract workers, and easier for contract workers to establish associations that can bargain for better pay and improved working conditions (are you listening, Uber?) There will be proposals to give workers more say over how their retirement savings are invested and end conflicts of interest by giant asset managers that push companies to buy their own pension products. All told, we may be witnessing a rebirth of the early-20th-century movement toward “industrial democracy”, which held that the best way to rectify the imbalance of power between workers and business was to make corporations more democratic and give workers greater say. Industrial democracy was a direct response to the Gilded Age – an era of gross inequality, unparalleled wealth, searing poverty, powerful monopolies, and political corruption, in which workers toiled for a pittance within often unsafe workplaces. For a time, the idea of industrial democracy was widely popular. Even the conservative Republican Calvin Coolidge, when governor of Massachusetts in 1919, signed a law allowing corporations to nominate and elect employees to their boards of directors. By 1922, employees of Boston’s famous clothing store Filene’s had chosen four of its eleven board members. But the industrial democracy movement waned in the 1950s and 1960s, as postwar prosperity lifted almost all workers’ paychecks. Now that America is back to a new Gilded Age of rabid inequality and arbitrary management, it seems fitting that industrial democracy is back on the table. American workers don’t only need better wages. They also need to be respected. And to be respected, they must be heard.

2018-09-02T23:01:38Z,Higher minimum wage will boost economy of cities – Smith Institute,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/03/higher-minimum-wage-will-boost-economy-of-cities-smith-institute,"A small rise in the minimum wage in Britain’s main city regions would encourage employers to deploy workers more productively and help boost local economies by more than £1bn, says a thinktank. According to the study, by the Smith Institute, employers need the spur of a higher minimum wage to shake them out of a spiral of low productivity and low growth that depresses company revenues and has trapped about 2 million workers on the current minimum wage of £7.38 an hour, or £7.83 for those aged 25 years or older. The leftwing thinktank said the plan – which would be voluntary – would involve increasing rates to the voluntary living wage, which is run by the Living Wage Foundation and recommends employers pay at least £10.20 an hour in London and £8.75 in the rest of the country. Employers including the drug-maker GlaxoSmithKline, Unilever, the retailer Lush and the accountants KPMG, have already adopted the voluntary wage rates with their own employees. They also make a commitment to force suppliers and clients to pay the higher minimum wage. More than half a million workers would secure an average annual pay rise of more than £1,700, and UK city regions would benefit from a £560m boost that could top £1bn if the government handed much of the extra tax generated to city mayors and the newly created combined authorities. The institute, which is named after the former Labour leader John Smith, said a “local living wage dividend” could increase to £1.1bn, when taking into account economic multipliers such as increased local spending by low-paid workers and local authority spending to improve the infrastructure of the region. The Sheffield city region, which is run by the Labour mayor, Dan Jarvis, would see the average annual salary of low-paid workers rise by just over £1,000. Taxes receipts from the wage boost would add £13m to the Treasury’s coffers. Jarvis said: “It is concerning that Sheffield city region has the highest percentage of employees earning below the voluntary living wage of all the regions considered in the report. Ensuring that people are paid a proper wage which meets the cost of living is vital for residents and good for the economy.” The report, which was funded by the Living Wage Foundation, highlights the role that leading local public and private-sector employers such as universities, hospitals, football clubs and city airports, can play in providing leadership on the living wage. While most jobs created in the last two years have been full-time and the numbers of zero-hour contract jobs have fallen slightly, wage rates have risen only slowly. Britain’s productivity also remains well below France and Germany, where workers can achieve the same output as UK workers in two-thirds of the time. The report calls on metro mayors and local authorities to work with these key “anchor institutions” to drive living wage take-up in their towns, cities and regions, and to integrate the living wage into their economic development strategies. Paul Hunter, the deputy director of the Smith Institute, said: “Big employers often like to talk about the positive role they play in their local community. One way that they can go beyond the warm words is to pay their staff the living wage and demand their suppliers do the same. “This is not just about good corporate citizenship. Evidence shows workers paid fairly are more productive. And, as our research shows, the living wage can also provide a boost for the local economy on which established employers are dependent.”",Living wage; Minimum wage; UK news; Work & careers; Society; Business; Local government,Society
2018-12-10T04:28:23Z,Australian Tax Office contractors accused of links to tax havens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/10/australian-tax-office-contractors-accused-of-links-to-tax-havens,"Multinational corporations providing labour and call centre staff to the Australian Taxation Office either share links with tax havens or engage in questionable tax practices, a new report has found. Texas-based firm Stellar, the UK-based multinational Serco and Japanese giant Outsourcing Inc have repeatedly won lucrative contracts with the tax office, typically to provide outsourced labour or help run the agency’s call centres. A report published on Monday by the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research (Cictar), headed by Jason Ward, has raised questions about the firms’ tax practices, prompting calls for the Australian government to do more to scrutinise the tax affairs of its major contractors. The report traces Stellar’s links to tax havens, criticises Serco for its “history of creative accounting, which reduces tax obligations in Australia”, and attacks Outsourcing Inc for a “complete lack of transparency” on questionable transactions and a complex corporate structure. Both Serco and Stellar issued strongly worded statements denying any allegation of tax minimisation, and were yet to see the report when contacted last week. Outsourcing Inc also rejected the report’s findings, saying its corporate structure was not unusual and that it paid the proper amount of tax to the Australian government. Stellar, a privately-owned call centre and outsourcing business, won a $51.25m contract to provide labour to the ATO last year. The company has also won contracts to help operate Centrelink’s call centre and does debt collection work for magistrates courts in Victoria and Perth. Stellar is headquartered in Texas but its corporate structure traces back to Nevada, a favoured tax-friendly jurisdiction in the United States. The Cictar report used bankruptcy filings to link the company’s UK call centre business to the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. It also found the taxable income of the Australian subsidiary “may have been artificially reduced through several questionable offshore related party transactions”. Related party transactions – the internal shifting of money between a corporation’s various subsidiaries, either through loans, interest repayments, or other transactions – can be used to minimise taxable income. Stellar paid little tax in Australia, the report finds, pointing to a tax bill of $2m on a taxable income of $6.6m, from a total income of $132.5m. Serco, better known for running prisons and immigration detention centres, is also a significant ATO contractor. It has helped run the ATO’s call centres and provided labour hire in the past. Guardian Australia revealed last year that Appleby, the offshore law firm at the centre of the Paradise Papers, held serious concerns about taking Serco on as a client. The report raises questions about interest repayments on internal loans and a $24.4m “central recharges” fee, which it says may have been used to reduce taxable income in Australia. “Offshore related party interest payments have frequently been used by multinationals – as demonstrated in the landmark federal court case with Chevron – to reduce taxable income in Australia,” the report said. Outsourcing Inc, a fast-growing company listed in Japan, has recently acquired a majority stake in the Beddison Group, which has three Australian entities with significant government contracts: Hoban, Clicks, and Index. Hoban and Clicks both provide labour hire or outsourced services to the ATO. The report finds the entities are owned through unit trusts, masking their finances from the public. The report described the structure and the lack of transparency as unusual and “disturbing”. “The complete lack of transparency raises serious doubts about what may be hidden and why the corporate structure continues to be so opaque,” it said. In a statement, the Beddison Group said the use of unit trusts was not unusual. It said its profits were distributed to its unitholders, who pay all applicable tax. Outsourcing Inc also paid the proper rate of tax (30%) on any profits. “Therefore, [Outsourcing Inc] is not benefitting from the fact that Clicks &amp; Hoban are trusts or the fact that they are foreign-domiciled,” a spokesman said. “It should be noted that withholding tax has been paid to the ATO by OSI in relation to the FY2017. All of the company’s current tax obligations have been met and will continue to be so.” The report does not allege unlawful behaviour by the three contractors. But Ward said it showed the Australian government was not properly screening its contractors. “It is particularly egregious that ATO contractors lack transparency and have highly questionable tax practices,” he said. “However, these concerns go far beyond the ATO. There must be greater transparency on government procurement across all federal agencies, state governments, local councils, and other public bodies.” The report has also prompted criticism from the main public sector union, the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU). The union’s national secretary, Nadine Flood, said the report raised serious probity and integrity issues. She questioned how companies with “questionable tax practices” could be so deeply involved in the running of Australia’s tax system. “People rightly expect the highest possible levels of integrity in the tax office, and what’s going on here just isn’t meeting the public interest test,” she said. “The Australian community doesn’t like outsourcing and privatisation at the best of times, let alone when lucrative ATO contracts are being given to companies whose own tax practices are under a cloud.” An ATO spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on the individual tax affairs of companies. But she said the ATO adhered to procurement rules, which required contractors to guarantee they complied the nation’s tax laws. “When entering into contracts the ATO require suppliers to provide warranties that they are compliant with Australian tax laws and will remain compliant throughout the term of the contract,” she said. “In addition standard ATO contracts require vendors to comply with all legislative and government policy obligations.” The ATO also engaged probity advisers and conducts more detailed financial checks for larger or more complex contracts, the spokeswoman said. Serco said it worked transparently and in accordance with legal and financial reporting requirements. “We strongly refute any suggestion regarding reduced tax liabilities … Serco does not enter into any arrangements for the purpose of minimising tax,” it said. Stellar said it “complies with all taxation obligations in Australia” and was externally audited. It rejected the suggestion that it paid little tax in Australia, saying its effective tax rate was 33.5% in 2014 and 32% in 2015. It said it no longer had any “affiliation, connection or form of recourse” with the subsidiary linked to the British Virgin Islands. “Stellar has a proven track record of strong corporate governance and good corporate citizenship, which is evidenced by its board and committee structures, comprehensive policy and procedure framework and strict adherence to statutory and reporting deadlines and payments,” the company said in a statement. The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, said the report’s findings were troubling. He said Labor would require all government tenderers to give greater transparency on their tax structures, including by forcing them to state which country they were based in for tax purposes. “Labor would also require listed firms to report tax haven dealings as a material tax risk,” he said.",Tax havens; Tax; Australia news; Australian economy; Business; Business,World news
2018-03-29T14:19:53Z,"Investors push gun companies for 'immediate, positive' steps to end violence",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/29/investors-gun-companies-action-violence,"A group of 142 institutional investors on Thursday called on gun manufacturers, retailers and other companies with ties to the gun industry to take “meaningful action” to address the US’s epidemic of gun violence in the wake of February’s mass shooting in Florida. The statement, which says “the moral case for action grows more urgent each day”, was drafted by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of global institutional investors. It has been signed by US and European investors including the UK’s Hermes that together manage over $634bn in assets. Sister Judy Byron of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment said: “As investors who have been engaging the companies in our portfolios on this issue for many years, we see this moment as an inflection point: companies that want to exhibit corporate citizenship and play a positive role in society need to get off the sidelines and take a public stand in favor of improved gun safety.” The statement identifies a series of commitments that companies should consider to protect their employees, consumers and communities, including ending any commercial relationships or promotional ties with the NRA. Several companies including Best Western, Delta and Hertz ended discount deals for NRA members following the fatal shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, last month. Retailers Dick’s Sporting Goods and Walmart also moved to end sales of guns to anyone under the age of 21. Colleen Scanlon of Catholic Health Initiatives said: “Gun violence in the US is a public health and human rights crisis with extraordinary and escalating human and economic costs, and hospitals are on the forefront of this crisis. While gun manufacturers and retailers are most exposed to the risks and controversies, there is a positive role to be played by all companies to help stem the tide of deaths due to gun violence.” Among other proposals the investors are calling for gun manufacturers to publicly endorse the “Sandy Hook principles” – a set of guidelines drawn up after the murder of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut school in 2012. Those principles include greater restrictions on firearm and ammunition sales, stricter background checks and a re-evaluation of the sale of military-style assault weapons. The investors are also asking for retailers to: Stop the sale, production, design or conversion of military style semi-automatic assault weapons and associated accessories and components, including high capacity magazines, for use by civilians. Limit gun and ammunition sales to purchasers 21 and over. Reinforce background checks as referenced above. End the sale of realistic toy guns and air rifles marketed to children. The statement finishes by saying: “In the coming months we will be engaging with companies we own to urge immediate and positive action that addresses gun violence.” The move comes after the ICCR launched a campaign to push shareholders in the two largest US gun manufacturers, American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, to tighten up their gun safety policies.","US gun control; Business; Parkland, Florida school shooting; US news; Investing",US news
