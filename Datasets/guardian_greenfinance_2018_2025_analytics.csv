2025-05-05T10:05:51Z,UK should not fear trade with China – but needs to keep risks in check | Gerard Lyons,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/05/uk-trade-china-risks-green-finance-national-security,"The US is urging countries to agree new trade deals. The perceived risk is a bipolar world, where countries have to choose between the US and China. What are the implications for the UK? In all likelihood this choice is avoidable. The global economy is so interconnected, fragmentation is more likely than a bipolar world. Supply chains are complex, and involve many countries. Even as nations look to onshore supply chains, achieving this will be a lengthy and expensive challenge. Likewise, with financial flows. Bank for International Settlements data shows global cross-border lending is $38tn (£29tn), with foreign banks’ credit to China at $826bn. In turn, about one-quarter of the US national debt is held by foreigners, with China holding at least $784bn, second only to Japan. It is not just economic and financial ties. Geopolitics suggests many countries will adopt a non-aligned approach, which will vary by issue. It is a delicate balancing act for the UK. The government’s priority is economic growth, but since the pandemic and war in Ukraine, national security decisions are indivisible from economic prosperity. It is not feasible for the UK to decouple from China given it is the world’s second largest economy. Western Europe will remain the world’s slow growth region for the foreseeable future, while the Indo-Pacific will be the fastest. The government’s approach to China is to cooperate, compete and challenge. The unsaid “c” is consistency, which would provide clarity for business. Just as critics of deeper ties have to acknowledge the upside economic potential, there is a need to be cognisant of national security concerns. This might entail a clear red line in the future relationship. This would allow companies to plan ahead and reflects the challenge of calibrating the tension between economic and security issues. On one side of this line should be sensitive areas where the UK aligns with the US, such as defence, security and intelligence, plus other strategic areas. The other side of the red line should be areas to be encouraged such as trade, the vast bulk of business and finance. There should be opportunities to sell far more UK services in to China’s growing consumer market. China is Britain’s fifth largest trading partner, but its cumulative foreign direct investment into the UK is low, being just 0.2% of the total stock from all countries. One area where greater cooperation is possible is in financial services, including the green agenda. In January, China hosted the 11th UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue. It was deemed a success. The City was looking for greater financial connectivity between the two countries, across a range of areas such as dual listings, and greater access of UK-based asset managers and insurance firms into the Chinese market. On the same day that Donald Trump announced his tariff policy, China issued in London its first offshore yuan-denominated sovereign green bond. Given subsequent events it has led to talk in the City as to how much potential there might be for London to establish itself as the global centre for green finance. Why not? The US is pulling back. It is early days. Investor appetite in the UK and globally is high, but there is a shortage of green assets in which to invest. Crucially, there is a wider issue for the City. Do current events present an opportunity to cement the City’s position as the world’s second largest financial centre, and gain at the US’s expense? Global investors are turning away from the US as a reliable partner and a safe haven. The dollar is weaker, but the bigger issue is who gains in where the money finds a home and is managed. Perceived stability may be the UK’s magnet, but it would probably require smarter regulation and tweaks on tax policy to seize the moment. There is now an opportunity in a multi-polar world to make the UK a more attractive location for global investors to do business in and from. Risk management is always key. Fears need to be kept in context, as it is less a case of the UK becoming dependent upon China and more of diversifying, while retaining strong global ties. • Dr Gerard Lyons is chief economic strategist at Netwealth and the senior independent director on the board of the Bank of China (UK).

2024-08-27T13:00:38Z,‘I was frustrated’: The woman who told Labour it didn’t need to spend £28bn on green investment,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/27/i-was-frustrated-the-woman-who-told-labour-it-didnt-need-to-spend-28bn-on-green-investment,"At the start of this year, among the snowy Swiss slopes of the Davos business get-together, Rhian-Mari Thomas was ready to make an elevator pitch to the UK’s future chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The chief executive of the Green Finance Institute (GFI) – a government-backed body that helps create and promote pro-environment financial products in the UK – had grown increasingly concerned about Labour’s £28bn green investment pledge. The party should not have even considered using that much taxpayer cash, Thomas argued. Instead, it should engage with private investors who were already keen to pour money into big green projects. “I was very frustrated,” Thomas recalls, “and I said as much.” Her pitch to Reeves was that the GFI should help steer Labour’s vision for a national wealth fund, ensuring it came at a lower cost to the public purse. She told the then shadow chancellor that Labour needed the finance industry “in the room, to actually identify what exactly the obstacles are and where government money can be most impactful”. Not long after, the £28bn pledge had been cut in half and soon Thomas was chairing Labour’s national wealth fund taskforce, convening heavy hitters such as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, alongside the chief executives of Aviva, NatWest and Thomas’s former employer, Barclays. It led to the creation of the £7.3bn fund, launched just days after Keir Starmer’s landslide election victory in July. It was a professional coup, and a vindication of Thomas’s decision in 2018 to leave banking for a role more aligned with her green roots. Raised in Cardiff in the 1970s, Thomas was heavily influenced by her parents’ efforts to minimise their carbon footprint. The family stopped eating red meat in response to cattle farming practices across the Amazon, and her father – an economist and university lecturer at Cardiff business school – shunned the family car in favour of the local bus. “A lot of people in our neighbourhood thought he’d lost his driving licence,” Thomas says. In her early teens, Thomas set up paper recycling at her high school on Barry Island and led a campaign to reduce the use of harmful chlorofluorocarbons found in the hairsprays that held up the gravity-defying hairstyles of the 1980s. She left home to study physics at the University of Bath, followed by a PhD at Trinity College Dublin. But by the time she was looking for her next challenge, Barclays’s investment bank had come knocking. “All this was new to me,” Thomas says. “I didn’t know the difference between an investment bank and a post office.” But Barclays Capital – then led by Bob Diamond, later to become the bank’s chief executive – was on the hunt for recruits with master’s and doctorate degrees, and offered a whopping one-off payment of £4,000 to students who performed well on its psychometric tests. “This was like riches beyond Croesus at the time,” she says. She was soon navigating leveraged finance and private equity deals. After the credit crunch, she shifted into retail and corporate banking, and later became chief commercial officer at the bank’s credit card division, Barclaycard. But by 2016, Thomas had hit a wall. She had watched as dozens of countries signed the Paris agreement the previous year in an effort to limit global heating. She wanted to do more. “I was just thinking, ‘is this really the best use of my energies, and the expertise and everything I’ve learned to do so far?’” Thomas realised that sustainability debates were too divorced from business concepts – and that the City would change only if there were a credible financial incentive. “For something to take off within a profit-led organisation, it needs to be generating profit,” Thomas says. “And for something to be sustainable, it also needs to be commercial.” In 2017, she launched a green banking council through Barclays that was credited with creating the first green mortgage product, offering customers discounts on more environmentally credible properties. Over time, she acquired a formal role as Barclays’s first head of green banking. “It really wasn’t a question any more. This was obviously what I was going to have to do with the rest of my career,” she says. So when the UK government and the City of London Corporation launched the GFI in 2018, Thomas knew her next move. Under her leadership, the institute has advocated new finance products such as local climate bonds and green rental agreements, and established an environment-friendly mortgage training programme. The GFI has also pushed for government guarantees to back developers’ investments in carbon capture technology, and the creation of special loans which investors start repaying only when green infrastructure – such as electric vehicle charge points – comes into use. If we want firms to stop making money from polluting industries, they need credible alternatives, Thomas argues. “People who work in the City are not stupid people. And if they can see an opportunity to make profitable, risk-adjusted returns for their organisations … they will do those trades all day. So you’ve got to ask yourself, why is that not happening? And it’s a very lazy narrative to say it’s not happening because these people are evil.” But Thomas is “not an apologist for the banks”. “If I felt that going around criticising the banks was the most impactful way of achieving that, I would do that,” she says. “Obviously, I wish they would move faster. But I equally understand how their business models work. And that’s what makes the GFI powerful, as a genuine partner to the finance industry, bridging those conversations with government. Because we need to help with the heavy lifting of removing some of those obstacles.” CV Age 51 Family Lives with long-term partner.

2024-04-25T05:00:17Z,"Nature destruction will cause bigger economic slump in UK than 2008 crisis, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/25/nature-destruction-will-cause-bigger-economic-slump-in-uk-than-2008-crisis-experts-warn,"The destruction of nature over the rest of the decade could trigger a bigger economic slump in Britain than those caused by the 2008 global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, experts have warned. Sounding the alarm over the rising financial cost from pollution, damage to water systems, soil erosion, and threats from disease, the report by the Green Finance Institute warned that further breakdown in the UK’s natural environment could lead to a 12% loss of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2030s. In a report that received input from experts across academia and government, the authors argued that “gradual, year-to year environmental degradation is as detrimental or more so than climate change”. The continued loss of natural habitats in urban and rural areas would compare unfavourably with the financial crisis of 2008, which took about 5% off the value of UK GDP, while the Covid pandemic cost the UK 11% of its GDP in 2020. The academics used three scenarios to construct the report: domestic risks from continued UK environment breakdown; international risks – including destruction to nature in countries which are key UK trading partners; and a health scenario, focusing on the dangers of a fresh global pandemic. All three took into account current trends in environmental breakdown – including water and air pollution, soil health erosion and biodiversity loss – resulting in a hit to GDP worth up to 3%, or about £70bn by the late 2020s. The report then added “acute risks” on top of these trends – including floods, droughts and wildfires – which would result in a 6% loss to GDP in the domestic and international scenarios, and a 12% hit in a health scenario, reflecting the extreme dangers to the UK economy from a renewed pandemic. Ministers are expected to take an interest in the report amid concern over the potential dangers to the economy from nature breakdown. Environment minister Richard Benyon said the report showed that nature “underpins the health of our economy and it is under threat from a global nature crisis”. The former Conservative MP, whose family controls a 5,600-hectare (14,000-acre) estate in west Berkshire, southern England, said the responsibility to conserve nature “lies with all sectors and sections of society, and green finance has a crucial role to play”. He said: “The findings in this report will help people and institutions across the corporate and finance sectors understand that it is in their own interests to go further and faster for the planet to protect it for future generations.” Shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, blamed the government for the UK becoming “one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world”. Saying that the UK needed “to reverse the tide of destruction”, Reed committed Labour to cleaner air and water “and growing nature-rich habitats for wildlife to thrive”. The Green Finance Institute describes itself as the UK and Europe’s “principal forum for innovation in green finance” bringing together banks, academics, philanthropists and government bodies to develop climate-friendly policies and financial products. The report warned that unless action is taken, UK banks will need to reduce their exposure to the worst hit industries or find themselves increasing the risk of losses from bad loans. About 50% of the extra cost will come from the loss of nature overseas that the UK relies on to provide food, natural resources and trade. Partly funded by the government with input from the Treasury and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the authors also relied on advice and information from the Bank of England, Oxford and Reading universities, the UN’s environment programme, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The report said: “The impacts of biodiversity loss and environmental degradation will not be felt alone but will compound with climate risks. Both are happening at once and there are strong feedback effects between the loss of natural capital and climate change.” The study follows a Treasury-backed review in 2021 by the Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta, who found that the world was being put at “extreme risk” by the failure of economics to take account of the rapid depletion of the natural world. Last year, the government agency Natural England launched its Nature Returns programme to coordinate efforts across government and the private sector to explore how the UK can best use land in England “to address climate change whilst producing food and promoting thriving nature”. The agency said it wanted “to mobilise the billions in private investment that government estimates we need to meet our national net zero commitments”.",Conservation; Pollution; Environment; Economics; Business; Climate crisis; UK news; Biodiversity; Water; Water industry; Soil; Green economy; Climate finance; Financial crisis; Economic growth (GDP); Extreme weather; Natural England; Financial sector; Wildlife,Environment
2023-06-22T18:13:24Z,"The Guardian view on Macron’s green finance deal: save lives, not profits | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-green-finance-deal-save-lives-not-profits,"The International Energy Agency in 2021 had an unambiguous message: developing new fossil fuel resources is incompatible with restricting global heating to below 1.5C, a threshold beyond which the most disastrous climate impacts lie. Yet the oil and gas industry isn’t listening. Last year it committed half a trillion dollars for new capital expenditure on future drilling and extraction, while making outrageous profits of $4tn. Business as usual will destroy life as we know it. Energy is fundamental for development and meeting basic needs. But producing it from coal, oil and gas is simultaneously the cause of the climate emergency. Clearly the issues of climate, energy and development must be addressed in an interconnected way. This is very difficult against a post-Covid backdrop when poor nations have record levels of debt. In the wake of the Ukraine invasion, rising interest rates have caused the dollar to surge – raising the cost of meeting loan repayments which are often denominated in the US currency. African nations spend up to five times their health budgets on debt obligations. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, should be congratulated for hosting a summit to reimagine financial solutions to the interlinked global goals of tackling poverty, curbing planet-destroying emissions and protecting nature. But there is still a long way to go. The announcement by the International Monetary Fund that rich countries had met a target, set in 2019, of a $100bn climate fund for poor countries is probably less than meets the eye. The contrast with the trillions of dollars mobilised in an instant, to bail out finance houses in 2008, is stark. It is inexcusable that funds to address global heating cannot be found. “For us it is about saving lives, for others, it is about saving profits,” said Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, chiding the rich world for inaction during a “polycrisis moment”. Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, called for a global financial transaction tax. Kenya’s president, William Ruto, came to Paris after endorsing a report, “Just Transition”, which pointed to Africa’s potential for harnessing renewable energy far outstripping any projected needs. Yet the continent has been barely able to industralise at all, let alone tap its vast green power potential. Leaders in North America and Europe are intent on reshaping their energy systems, but the key materials required are found in the developing world. Even China, which dominates critical rare earth elements and their processing, lacks vital metals. This should allow for a grand bargain, where poorer countries are given policy space to address the three structural deficiencies that hinder their development – a lack of food sovereignty, a lack of energy sovereignty, and low value-added manufacturing – in return for sharing their minerals. Otherwise, parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia risk becoming targets of a new scramble for resources – with clean energy firms behaving as destructively as fossil fuel companies: buying off politicians, wrecking ecosystems and lobbying against environmental regulations. The cash, debt relief and access to western markets needed by developing nations should not feed the engines of extractive capitalism. Mr Ruto said the three weeks taken to create the current “Bretton Woods” financial institutions should be enough to design their replacement. This might sound ambitious but it was Martin Luther King who warned against the “tranquillising drug of gradualism”. This sense of urgency is needed now to stop an environmental disaster.",Energy; Environment; Energy industry; Business; Food; Global economy,Opinion
2025-08-10T17:25:28Z,The Guardian view on climate finance: crumbling under a second Trump presidency | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-climate-finance-crumbling-under-a-second-trump-presidency,"Earlier this month, as Nordic countries were hit with an unprecedented heatwave and wildfires in the US began spurting “fire clouds”, Barclays pulled out of the net zero banking alliance. The story may have seemed less alarming than extreme weather, but it has existential implications, as the finance sector quietly surrenders its former climate commitments. The initiative forms part of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a voluntary network of banks that Mark Carney, formerly the UN’s special envoy on climate action and now Canada’s prime minister, launched in 2021. At the time, the alliance, which encourages banks and asset managers to work towards the goals of the Paris agreement, seemed like an optimistic step in the right direction. Mr Carney described it as a “breakthrough”. But times change. The election of Donald Trump, whose advisers have waged war on “climate fanaticism” and “woke” capitalism, has created an environment of impunity where businesses no longer need to even pay lip service to progress. Fossil fuel companies donated $19m to Mr Trump’s inauguration fund. So far, their investment has paid off. Mr Trump has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, used an “invented” energy emergency to justify the expansion of fossil fuels, opened public lands to drilling, and plans to cut funding for renewable energy. With America reneging on climate action, businesses may feel they can relax. Barclays is the second British bank to leave the net zero alliance after HSBC quit earlier this year. Six of the largest US banks quit just weeks before Mr Trump’s inauguration. Some institutions have come under direct pressure from the right: BlackRock left the net zero asset managers initiative, another GFANZ group, after it was sued by Republicans who claimed its promotion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals had cut coal production. In each of his annual investor letters from 2020 to 2024, BlackRock’s chair, Larry Fink, namechecked climate change. His 2025 letter made no mention of it. The deterioration of GFANZ reveals the weaknesses in relying on businesses to do the right thing. Its goals were always fuzzy: instead of calling for hard limits on the financing of fossil fuels, GFANZ encouraged banks to invest in low-carbon sectors. It has since drifted further from its mission, expanding its membership to companies without net zero commitments. Though it was never supposed to be a substitute for government action, inactive governments welcomed it. Boris Johnson, prime minister at the time of its creation, promised the alliance would help to “build back greener”. Many green finance initiatives have less to do with preventing climate breakdown than minimising investors’ exposure to the risks this creates, such as carbon taxes or curbs on fossil fuels. “Green ethical investing”, writes Adrienne Buller, is a way of betting “on the likelihood of a greener economy, rather than contribute to bringing that economy into being”. When the risk of regulation wanes, as it has under Trump, so too does the impetus for this style of investing. The lesson is that government action (and inaction) will determine the severity of the climate crisis. Governments need to prohibit fossil fuel extraction, reduce profits through progressive carbon taxes, support renewables and confront powerful interests. The myth that businesses are capable of self-policing has led to a dangerous delay.",Green economy; Environment; Mark Carney; World news; Climate crisis; Barclays; Banking; Business; Donald Trump,Opinion
2025-02-24T06:00:05Z,"Britain’s net zero economy is booming, CBI says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/britain-net-zero-economy-booming-cbi-green-sector-jobs-energy-security,"The net zero sector is growing three times faster than the overall UK economy, analysis has found, providing high-wage jobs across the country while cutting climate-heating emissions and increasing energy security. The net zero economy grew by 10% in 2024 and generated £83bn in gross value added (GVA), a measure of how much value companies add through the goods and services they produce. The analysis, by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), found that 22,000 net zero businesses, from renewable energy to green finance, employ almost a million people in full-time jobs. The average annual wage in the businesses – £43,000 – was also £5,600 higher than the national average. The analysis showed economic growth and climate action go together, said the report’s authors, and improve lives and livelihoods. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was criticised in January for suggesting economic growth was more important than net zero, but said more recently: “There is no tradeoff between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century.” The figures contradict claims by Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party that “net zero is crippling our economy”. It has promised to “scrap net stupid zero”. The Conservative party, which put the 2050 net zero emissions target into law in 2019, now says it “leaves us economically worse off” and its new leader, Kemi Badenoch, has called it a “mistake”. The CBI’s chief economist, Louise Hellem, said: “It is clear, you can’t have growth without green – 2025 is the year when the rubber really hits the road, where inaction is indisputably costlier than action. “We are approaching critical points of no return for energy security and emissions reduction. It’s really fantastic to see the growing strength of the net zero economy in the UK and we need to really continue to see that ambition.” The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: “These numbers speak for themselves. Net zero is essential to growth, a strong economy and money in working people’s pockets. Our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower is the route to energy security, good jobs and investment in our communities.” The Conservative and Reform parties did not respond to requests for comment. The report, commissioned by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, analysed the growth attributable to businesses working in areas including renewable energy, electric vehicles, heat pumps, energy storage, green finance and waste management and recycling. The net zero businesses accounted for 1.1% of the UK’s total GVA, making it bigger than the farming and advertising and market research sectors. The net zero sector is also expanding strongly, with the 10% growth in 2024 following a 9% jump in 2023. The UK economy has been criticised for being concentrated in London and the south-east of England, and for low productivity growth. In contrast, the report found the net zero economy is widely distributed around the UK, with the West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and south-west England containing the largest hotspots of activity, and net zero jobs increasing by 20% in Scotland since 2022. Net zero jobs also had 38% higher productivity than the UK average. The report concluded: “The net zero economy is not only driving environmental progress but also delivering transformative economic and social benefits across the UK.” The high energy bills in recent years have been caused by soaring gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Increasing clean energy in the UK would bolster energy security, said Luke Murphy, a Labour MP and the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on climate change: “We don’t want to risk the higher and more volatile energy bills that we’ll get if we continue to rely on fossil fuels. We don’t want Putin’s boot remaining on our neck.” Murphy said while net zero growth was strong in the UK, it contributed 50% more to economies across the EU. Clean energy also contributed a record 10% of China’s GDP in 2024. “There are huge costs to not seeing this transition as an economic opportunity,” he said.",Green economy; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Climate crisis; Energy; Energy industry; Environment; Business; Green politics; Solar power; Renewable energy; Economic policy; Economics; Work & careers; Politics; UK news; Money; Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy efficiency; Conservatives; Labour; Reform UK,Environment

2025-03-03T18:50:19Z,EU gives carmakers ‘breathing space’ on pollution target as EV sales slump,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/03/eu-gives-carmakers-breathing-space-on-green-targets-as-ev-sales-slump,"European carmakers are to be given two extra years to meet this year’s pollution target, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said, in a further rollback of her green deal climate policies. Companies who sell too many dirty vehicles this year will be allowed to compensate by selling more clean vehicles in the two years that follow, under a proposal that would stretch the window of compliance for the 2025 fleet emissions target to 2027. Von der Leyen said the change would grant the industry more “breathing space” but overall targets would not change. Environmental groups said the proposal rewarded companies that had failed to invest in meeting the targets and warned it would slow the transition to cleaner cars, particularly cheap ones. “Weakening the EU clean car rules rewards laggards and does little for Europe’s car industry – except to leave it further behind China on electric vehicles,” said William Todts, the executive director of the campaign group Transport &amp; Environment. Agustín Reyna, the director general of the consumer group BEUC, said the decision would also make electric cars less available and affordable. “This is really the wrong signal to consumers. This is like putting the car in reverse while it’s already at full speed on the motorway,” he said. Carbon emissions from new passenger cars fell by 28% between 2019 and 2023, according to the European Environment Agency, driven by a surge in electric vehicles, which release fewer pollutants than those that burn fossil fuels. But EV sales slumped in 2024, raising the prospect of large fines on carmakers with dirty fleets. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), the industry group that lobbied for looser targets, said the market for zero-emissions vehicles was not picking up fast enough and called for greater support to boost demand, improve charging infrastructure and reduce manufacturing costs. “The transition to zero-emission mobility and a thriving EU automotive industry must progress together – this is non-negotiable,” said Ola Källenius, the president of the ACEA and CEO of the carmaker Mercedes-Benz. The announcement, which is to be proposed in full later this month, would need to be agreed by EU governments and the European parliament. It comes a week after the commission revealed its proposals to gut key green finance rules, which were agreed during its last term. Shares in European carmakers rose after the announcement. Volkswagen was up more than 2%, Renault was up 1.4%, Mercedes-Benz rose 1.6% and BMW was up 1.2%.","Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Motoring; Travel and transport; World news; Business; Automotive industry; Automotive emissions; Ursula von der Leyen; European Commission; European Union",Environment
2025-06-17T06:00:41Z,"World’s largest banks pledged $869bn to fossil fuel firms in 2024, new report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/17/world-banks-fossil-fuel-finance-2024,"The world’s largest banks boosted the amount of financing given to fossil fuel companies last year, committing $869bn to those involved in coal, oil and gas despite the worsening climate crisis and the banks’ own, fraying, environmental commitments, a new report has found. The report, compiled by a coalition of eight green groups, shows that while the amount loaned by big banks to fossil fuel firms had been declining in 2021, last year saw an abrupt reversal. Two-thirds of the world’s largest 65 banks increased their fossil fuel financing by $162bn from 2023 to 2024. Scientists have been clear that no new fossil fuel project can proceed if disastrous climate impacts are to be avoided, with last year the hottest ever recorded amid a slew of disasters driven by global heating. However, many banks have recently watered down or ditched their own commitments to help reduce planet-heating emissions, amid a changing political dynamic that has seen the US again being led by Donald Trump, who has famously called climate science “a giant hoax” and “bullshit”. In February, the US treasury withdrew from a global banking network that aims to increase green finance and reduce climate risk. Four of the five largest fossil fuel financiers last year were American companies, with JPMorgan Chase lending the most at $53.5bn. Bank of America was second, followed by Citigroup. The Japanese bank Mizuho Financial was fourth, with Wells Fargo in fifth. The largest absolute increases in fossil fuel lending last year came from the top American institutions as well as Barclays, the British bank. In the decade since the world’s political leaders committed, in the landmark Paris climate agreement, to restrain dangerous global heating, the biggest banks have continued to pour lending towards drilling projects, pipelines and other fossil fuel activity. In total, banks have financed fossil fuels by $7.9tn since the Paris deal. “By injecting a staggering $869bn into fossil fuel financing in 2024 alone, the world’s largest banks fund the climate chaos that fossil fuel companies wreak on people and communities worldwide,” said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International and a co-author of the report. “Governments must step in and take urgent action to hold financial institutions accountable for their role in the climate crisis.” While most of the world’s top financial firms have pledged to abide by the Paris deal and help tackle the climate crisis, many of them have ignored or walked back these promises in the past year while predicting catastrophic global temperature rises. Last year, six US senators said that JPMorgan Chase may have misled investors by backtracking on its climate commitments. Then, in January, shortly before the inauguration of Trump as US president, the six largest American banks – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – all withdrew from the net zero banking alliance. The alliance is a United Nations-sponsored initiative to spur banks to align their lending and investment portfolios with the Paris goals. It requires banks to set targets and reduce emissions associated with their investments. “This year, banks have shown their true colors – many have walked away from climate commitments and doubled down on financing fossil fuel expansion, even as global temperatures break records,” said Lucie Pinson, director and founder at Reclaim Finance, and another report co-author. “A few European banks may have inched forward, but for most, the lure of dirty money has proven too strong.” The Guardian contacted all of the top lenders to fossil fuels about the report, which is called Banking on Climate Chaos. A Citi spokesperson said that it supports the “transition to a low-carbon economy and, in 2021, made a commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas financed emissions by 2050. “We work with our clients as they seek to decarbonize their businesses and support clean energy solutions as part of our $1tn sustainable finance goal. Our approach reflects the need to transition while also continuing to meet global needs for energy security, particularly in this time of increasing electricity demand.” A Barclays spokesperson said: “Barclays provides finance to meet consumer and businesses energy needs while financing the scaling of clean energy. Last year, we mobilised nearly $100bn more Sustainable and Transition Finance than in 2023 and continue to invest £500m in climate tech start-ups by 2027. These are significant interventions to support our clients to transition.” ENDS",Business; Banking; JP Morgan; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Fossil fuels; Coal; Gas; Oil and gas companies; Energy; Energy industry,Business
2025-06-03T13:00:36Z,Destroying our natural wealth makes us poorer in every sense of the word,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/03/new-approach-to-gdp-could-help-nature-survive-labours-housebuilding-plans,"Boris Johnson was prime minister and Kemi Badenoch was a Treasury minister when they gave their support to a groundbreaking study of the economy and its most consistently tortured victim: nature. It was February 2021 and the eminent Cambridge professor Sir Partha Dasgupta had just delivered a 360-page report to the Treasury on the economics of biodiversity, which brought rigour to a subject often governed by emotion. Johnson and Badenoch seemed to support the analysis, which argued that without financial cost/benefit analysis that included biodiversity in its sums, a growing economy would destroy natural habitats. Dasgupta’s hard-headed number crunching showed that when nature is in decline, there is a financial as well as an environmental deficit. Fast forward to 2025, and Labour has promised to build 1.5m new homes by the end of the parliament and is already behind schedule. An expanding population and a reliance on private housebuilders, which drip feed homes into the market to maintain high prices, has left the UK with a significant shortage. Last year there was an estimated shortfall of 2.5m homes, despite there being 1.4m plots already with planning permission. And while some local authorities have insisted that developers include parks and tree planting in their schemes, along with a high percentage of affordable homes, they complain that appeals by developers to the secretary of state for relief from these responsibilities are often successful. But as the Labour government moves ahead with a planning and infrastructure bill designed to promote growth, there are understandable fears the landmark report has been sidelined. Nature loss in the UK has been significant over many decades, but Labour’s message in the bill is that the developer knows best, and other considerations can take a back seat. It’s why the National Trust has warned the bill is a “licence to kill nature” and the Office for Environmental Protection has advised the government that it is a “regression” in environmental law. Housing projects that protect natural habitats, include public transport and divert wastewater from running into local watercourses are deemed too expensive. Current planning rules already allow developers, in almost all cases, to “value engineer” these elements out of the design. Traditional economic thinking is partly to blame. It excludes the world’s natural resources except when they are dug up or chopped down and become raw materials for various manufacturing industries. Dasgupta sought to change this, providing a way for economists to put a value on nature and calculate whether the type of growth in the economy enhanced or destroyed a broader definition of national wealth. Since 2021, he has been liaising with the Office for National Statistics to produce an alternative to gross domestic product (GDP). Currently, when governments consider how much economic progress they have made in the previous year they use GDP, which adds up the income from buying and selling goods in the public and private sectors to give a measure of national output. This single figure is Rachel Reeves’s guiding light. But the problem with it from an environmental perspective is that GDP includes lots of bad stuff, as well as what we might describe as progress. It calculates oil extraction in the North Sea without considering the implications for emissions and global heating, and classes peat extraction and the paving over of previously wooded land as adding to GDP without any negative cost. Dasgupta’s report found that between 1990 and 2014, the UK’s “produced capital” (including manufactured goods and built infrastructure) rose by a fifth but, in the same period, its stock of “natural capital” declined by 30%. Analysis by the Green Finance Institute charity suggests that the depletion of nature at the present rate will have the effect of cutting UK GDP by 6% by the 2030s, and, it has argued, if we want to get on and implement the Dasgupta review, replacing GDP must be top of the agenda. Parliament’s environmental audit committee added its voice to complaints last month, saying it was concerned that a mission to protect 30% of the land by 2030 would be missed unless a mix of sticks and carrots persuaded private sector landlords to improve biodiversity net gain. There are many MPs and ministers who recognise the need to protect nature and biodiversity as the UK grows both in population and economically. The question hangs over the chancellor as to whether she is on board. Reeves recently waded into the controversy over a bat tunnel straddling the HS2 train link from London to Birmingham to say that never again should the protection of bats hold up important infrastructure projects. Keir Starmer vowed to take on “the nimbys” by reducing legal challenges to infrastructure building – with a new approach stopping “newts and bats” from blocking construction.

2025-03-26T18:08:28Z,"No mention of green issues by Rachel Reeves, but her silence comes as a relief",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/26/no-mention-of-green-issues-by-rachel-reeves-but-her-silence-comes-as-a-relief,"The climate crisis, the UK’s target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions and the green economy received not a single mention in Rachel Reeves’s spring statement on Wednesday. To green experts, this absence came almost as a relief, given that the chancellor was taking an axe to so many other aspects of public spending. There are still no guarantees that green investment will not be quietly cut in the near future. But at a time when the UK’s green sectors are growing at three times the rate of the rest of the economy, according to the CBI, ignoring climate and environment policy means missing vital opportunities. Ed Matthew, UK programme director at the E3G thinktank, said: “The chancellor has left a huge open goal by neglecting the clean economy as the primary driver for growth in the UK. While the broader economy slumped, the clean economy boomed, growing by 10% last year, creating £83bn of added value. “If the government is serious about growth, it must stop tinkering at the edges and ramp up capital investment into the clean economy – the best chance we have for economic recovery.” A host of measures – including some that Labour espoused in opposition, but which are now on the back-burner or under threat – could deliver cost savings for households and businesses, economic opportunities, and revenue for the Treasury. Insulating homes lowers bills, cuts waste, improves health and creates jobs. The government pledged £13.2bn by 2030 for a “warm homes plan” in its manifesto, but Westminster insiders suggest this spending could be under threat due to the chancellor’s “non-negotiable” fiscal rules. Owing to the way the UK’s electricity market has worked since privatisation, electricity bills are set by the marginal wholesale price of gas, which is often the most expensive energy option on the grid. This could be changed, and shifting green levies from bills to general taxation, reforming the market and updating infrastructure would also make electricity cheaper, encourage the switch to electric vehicles and low-carbon power and allow for greater efficiency. Chris Glover, director of total utilities management at the engineering firm Buro Happold, said: “We currently pay around £1bn per annum to curtail renewable energy generation when the grid cannot handle the power. “This eye-watering amount of money is simply passed on to consumers, who end up paying for both the curtailed renewable energy and the gas that replaces it.” Fossil fuel dependence has been a key factor in high inflation, according to the Treasury. But the £8.3bn promised for Great British Energy to spur the development of more renewable generation, though unmentioned by Reeves, is in question. The rural economy is also faltering: a survey this month by the National Farmers’ Union found confidence among farmers in England and Wales at an all-time low. The budget for the sustainable farming initiative, which rewards farmers for taking measures that improve the environment, such as helping to clean the air and water, and protect soils, may be cut in June. Failing to spend sufficiently on protecting the UK against the climate crisis could also prove a costly mistake, as the impacts of extreme weather are expected to worsen. Every £1 spent on flood resilience prevents about £8 of damage, of which £3 is a direct benefit to the government; a report last year from the Green Finance Institute found the degradation of the UK’s natural environment was slowing economic growth and could lead to an estimated 6-12% reduction in the UK’s economy. But those impacts are not immediate, while the fiscal rules are defined by expediency. Simon McWhirter, deputy chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, said: “The spring statement continues this government’s short-term thinking, when what we need are robust spending plans to drive long-term prosperity.”",Green economy; Spring statement 2025; Energy; Climate crisis; Energy industry; Farming; Rachel Reeves; Politics; Environment; UK news,Environment
2025-05-02T05:00:58Z,‘A win-win for farmers’: how flooding fields in north-west England could boost crops,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/02/win-win-farmers-how-rewetting-peatland-boost-crops-cut-co2,"“I really don’t like the word ‘paludiculture’ – most people have no idea what it means,” Sarah Johnson says. “I prefer the term ‘wetter farming’.” The word might be baffling, but the concept is simple: paludiculture is the use of wet peatlands for agriculture, a practice that goes back centuries in the UK, including growing reeds for thatching roofs. “There would have previously been a lot more vast, wetter, boggier areas of peatlands and fens, especially in north-west England and other regions,” says Johnson, the head of peatland nature recovery at the Lancashire Wildlife Trust (LWT). But over the last few hundred years, she adds, those have been converted “into what we know today as conventional drainage-based farming, or for development, or from peat extraction”. In the past British farmers were even paid by the government to drain peatland for agricultural use, especially after the second world war. The UK is now recognising, far too belatedly, how precious those habitats are. “When peatlands are still wet they are a massive store of carbon, but as soon as you drain them that CO2 is going back into the atmosphere,” says Johnson. More than 80% of the UK’s peatlands are damaged or degraded and most lowland peat has been drained and converted to agriculture, at a cost to the environment. “Some of the biggest emissions from farming are from agricultural peat soils,” says Johnson. “Three per cent of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come just from drained lowland agricultural peat – it’s a really small proportion of UK land that is making up a massive amount of our greenhouse gas emissions.” This realisation is driving an international €10m (£8.4m) wetter farming project – Palus Demos – in which previously drained peatlands will be rewetted, with farmers helped to grow crops that thrive in boggier conditions. “It’s not about flooding the land and we’re not asking farmers to take land out of production,” Johnson stresses. “We restore the naturally higher water table to rehydrate the peat soils, but the land remains in agricultural use. We’re trying to find that win-win for the environment and farming.” Demonstration sites are being developed around north-west England, in traditional peat-cutting areas in Ireland’s Midlands and outside Amsterdam in the Netherlands by partners including Natural England, LWT, the University of Amsterdam, Manchester Metropolitan University and others. How does the project rewet the peatlands? “We use a series of measures, such as blocking existing drainage ditches, removing underground field drains and also by installing bunds, which are waterproof barriers made from compressed peat that run under and above ground and allow us to keep the water where we want it to be,” says Mike Longden, the peat programme technical lead at LWT. “We also use weirs and irrigation systems which allow us to move water where it’s needed.” The crops being trialled include foods such as cabbage, blueberries, rhubarb and cranberries, and non-foods including bulrushes, which can be used as a building material and in textiles – Ponda, one of the project’s partners, has developed a process to turn their fluffy seedheads into a sustainable eco-textile used for filling padded jackets – and sphagnum moss, which can be used for horticultural compost. Scalability will be crucial, with farmers and consumers unlikely to be keen on higher production costs or food prices. “Ideally, we want this to be 100% win-win,” says Johnson. “But this is a trial. We don’t know all the answers yet. Looking at the economics is really important. We’re looking at how to make wetter farming as profitable, if not more profitable, than current conventional, drainage-based farming.” LWT is also exploring green finance options, including carbon-offset schemes such as Wilder Carbon and the IUCN Peatland Code, and countryside stewardship payments from the UK government’s sustainable farming incentive (SFI), which could pay for farming at a higher water table, though SFI has been paused. Farmers may find wet, boggy land harder to farm in the short term, making it more difficult to access land to sow crops, manage or harvest, says Johnson, but some were already struggling in certain areas with drained peat soils that had become unproductive. All the land being used for the LWT trials was coming out of production because it was difficult to farm. “It was making farmers no money so they had sort of given up on it,” says Johnson. “If rewetting is a way to bring land back into production, that can also help farmers.” The Europe-wide Palus Demos project started in early 2025, with results expected in 2029. As well as crop yields, greenhouse gas emissions will be monitored to see how much carbon could be saved by converting land from drainage-based use to paludiculture. The results from LWT’s Winmarleigh carbon farm project in west Lancashire have already shown an 86% reduction in CO2 emissions just from rewetting the peat. LWT is now “actively engaged with Defra to consider what could be done differently on agricultural peat soils for farming benefits and environmental benefits”, says Johnson. “We are working with policymakers and engaging with the National Farmers’ Union and other farming groups.” Rewetted peat soils could form part of a “mosaical landscape” alongside more conventional farming, Johnson suggests, in which “core conservation areas could be buffered by wetter farming areas that are still productive and bringing in income for farmers”. If the trials are successful, paludiculture could be implemented more widely. “It would be amazing to see wetter farming rolled out across peatlands worldwide,” says Longden. “In the UK, we have large areas of drained agricultural peat in the north-west but also in East Anglia, the Somerset Levels, the north-east and beyond. “There’s peat right across huge swathes of northern Europe, North America and even in the Tropics. In all these areas, there will be possibilities for wetter farming.”",Farming; Agriculture; Soil; England; Environment; Science; UK news; Europe; Lancashire; Greenhouse gas emissions; Food; Carbon offsetting,Environment
2024-10-13T13:00:56Z,Labour’s new green rules for big companies face resistance in the City,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/13/labours-new-green-rules-for-big-companies-face-resistance-in-the-city,"When Keir Starmer launched the Labour party’s 142-page manifesto in June, the future prime minister was dubbed a man of no surprises. But alongside much-trailed pledges to kickstart economic growth and cut NHS waiting lists were newly adopted plans for new environmental regulations for London’s largest listed companies. “Labour will make the UK the green finance capital of the world,” the manifesto said. And to get there, the party pledged to ensure that FTSE 100 companies – as well the City’s banks, asset managers, insurers and pension funds – adopt “credible” climate transition plans in line with the Paris agreement’s pledge to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. That would be on top of disclosing their carbon footprints. Few bosses dare to publicly disagree with Labour’s intent. And nearly every major UK company at least professes to have some form of climate transition plan in place to reach net zero in the coming decades. But the party could face pressure from City lobby groups, including the influential UK Capital Markets Industry Taskforce (CMIT) and UK Finance. The concern is that mandates and extra regulation could disadvantage UK business and counter years-long efforts to cut red tape and return the London Stock Exchange to its former glory. Indeed, a report published recently by City veteran and former Legal &amp; General boss Nigel Wilson for CMIT railed against allegedly excessive regulations and oversight introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. While it did not refer to Labour’s pending climate rules, the message was clear: “We cannot expect to achieve meaningful growth while we micromanage business through regulators, second-guessing decisions that rightly belong to company boards, and not trusting investors to be able to make their own investment decisions without feeling the need to look over their shoulders.” There has long been anxiety that London’s 326-year-old stock exchange has lost its appeal. The data is stark: the number of companies listed on has dropped by 30% over the past 15 years, from 1,452 in December 2009 to 1,014 in July this year, according to data from AJ Bell. The anecdotal evidence is worrying too. London has been snubbed for blockbuster IPOs, including by UK chip designer Arm, which opted to list on Wall Street last August. Companies such as Paddy Power-owner Flutter and tourism company Tui announced plans to switch their primary listings to rival hubs like New York and Frankfurt this year. Falling valuations have created cheap opportunities for private equity firms to snap up the likes of investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown and cyber-security business Darktrace, taking even more companies off the exchange. Lawyers, bankers, accountants and investors are worried about losing business and investment opportunities to private and foreign markets. That includes members of CMIT, which is headed by London Stock Exchange boss Julia Hoggett, alongside senior City figures including the bosses of asset manager Schroders, pharmaceuticals company GSK, pension savings provider Phoenix Group and the venture capital firm Lakestar. CMIT, unsurprisingly, welcomed news in July that the Financial Conduct Authority was loosening listing requirements in the biggest shake-up of London’s rules in more than 30 years. This included scrapping the two-tier system of standard and premium listings, which heaped extra requirements on companies for a more prestigious label and entry into FTSE-branded indices. It also controversially meant firms would no longer have to hold shareholder votes before approving larger mergers and takeovers. That sparked concerns about an erosion of shareholder democracy. “We can see why the London Stock Exchange decided to do that,” Roger Barker, director of policy at business lobby group the Institute of Directors, said. “But from the perspective of good governance, it was perhaps just taking it a step too far, removing that degree of shareholder accountability.” Whether CMIT will embrace Labour’s environmental regulations with as much gusto remains to be seen. CMIT members and its press team were approached by the Observer for a comment for this article. Lobby group UK Finance, whose listed and unlisted members both fall under the current scope of the climate proposals, insisted environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials of most large UK businesses were already “pretty strong”. However, theyIt is concerned that Labour’s proposals could result in a “one-size-fits-all rulebook” that would be burdensome to the kind of high-growth businesses that Britain hopes to foster. Adding climate transition plans to an “already-heavy menu” of compliance requests “needs to be thought through”, warned Conor Lawlor, UK Finance’s managing director for capital markets and wholesale policy. “If a huge private company has a raft of staff on reporting and accounting teams, it’s proportionate. But if you’re a high-growth company doing something like [AI chip designer] Nvidia, which is the kind of company that the UK is trying to attract … they’re immediately at a disadvantage”. And while it may not cause companies to immediately flee, it could affect the extent to which those companies “scale, grow and invest” in the UK in the longterm, he said. Lobby groups will likely cite new rules forcing regulators to consider whether they are harming firms’ competitiveness on the global stage. And that could be exacerbated by a growing divergence with the US. An ESG-backlash on the other side of the Atlantic has already dealt a blow to international green initiatives, with the likes of JP Morgan and State Street pulling out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group earlier this year. In August, Texas added NatWest to a growing list of firms accused of boycotting its oil industry, in a move that could limit the UK bank’s business with the US state. No one expects Labour’s proposals to reverse the decline of the City’s stock exchange in the short term, but “if London can position itself as a global centre of financing in this area, that is a huge opportunity”, the IoD’s Barker said. The Treasury said: “Ensuring the UK attracts the most innovative companies to list is compatible with the ambition of making the UK the green finance capital of the world. We will set out further detail on those plans in due course.”",Corporate governance; London Stock Exchange; Stock markets; Business; Economics; FTSE; Banking,Business
2025-02-24T13:12:31Z,German election shows how far green wave has receded in Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/german-election-shows-how-far-green-wave-has-receded-in-europe,"In the final days of an election campaign dominated by migration, the likely new chancellor of Europe’s biggest polluter sought to assure voters that its economy ministry would not be occupied by NGOs. Instead, the conservative lead candidate Friedrich Merz posted on social media that it would be led by “someone who understands that economic policy is more than being a representative for heat pumps”. Climate action barely featured on the campaign trail before Germany’s federal elections on Sunday – except when right-leaning parties used it to swipe at the Greens. Merz’s jab was at the tamer end of attacks aimed at the Green party candidate, Robert Habeck, the economy and climate minister who pushed through an unpopular law to promote clean heating, but is a sign of how far the political conversation around climate action has shifted. Centre-right and far-right politicians have accused the Greens of turning Germany into an “eco-dictatorship” for policies that limit the burning of fossil fuels or require the public to change their behaviour. In a fiery speech the day before the election, Merz said he would do politics “for the majority who can think straight, and who also have all their marbles … and not for any green and leftwing nutcases”. Merz later said he was referring specifically to anti-rightwing protesters. It is a far cry from the 2021 election, in which all parties bar the far-right AfD were keen to brandish their climate credentials by committing to cleaning up Germany’s economy by the middle of the century and keeping the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels. By some measures, the Greens have survived a shift in German climate discourse that climate activists call a “witch-hunt”. They had a smaller drop in vote share than their former coalition partners, the market-liberal FDP and the centre-left SPD, despite years of political bashing and a decrease in public interest in climate action. They also lost fewer votes on Sunday than they did at the European elections last year, falling slightly from 15% to 12%. Yet the result, which is likely to leave the Greens excluded from a future coalition, is further evidence that the green wave that swept Europe a few years ago was an outlier, rather than the new normal. Greens have been kicked out of government in Austria, Belgium and Ireland in recent months, echoing a recent trend of incumbents of all political stripes being punished at the polls. In Germany, young voters in particular abandoned the party in large numbers for the resurgent Die Linke (the Left), which won 1.2 million voters from the Greens and SPD. On some counts, Die Linke’s climate policy is more ambitious than that of the Greens. The party wants Germany to reach climate neutrality by 2035 – in line with demands from activists such as Fridays for Future – and it emphasises the need for fairness in the energy transition. Snap analyses suggest its unexpected success was driven by targeting young progressives and running a highly successful social media campaign. “The Left focused on a progressive campaign centred around their core issues like rising rents and the high cost of living,” said Jessica Haak, a political scientist at the University of Hamburg. “This has also contributed to their relatively strong performance in urban centres, where the Greens typically receive substantial support. “In contrast, the Greens adopted a more moderate, centrist stance – especially regarding migration issues – which has sparked internal criticism, particularly from the party’s left wing.” Although climate played only a minor role in voting decisions, the outcome looks likely to slow the speed of Germany’s energy transition. The AfD, which surged into second place with 21% of the vote, openly denies the climate crisis. It has railed against other parties for following a “Left-Green” ideological agenda and its co-leader, Alice Weidel, recently described wind turbines as “windmills of shame”. The election winners, the centre-right CDU/CSU union, have committed to climate neutrality by 2045 but increasingly aped the AfD’s opposition to policies to get there. They have attacked the Greens heavily for efforts to phase out gas boilers and combustion engine cars, or reduce pollution on farms, and blamed them for the country’s economic struggles. At a meeting in Berlin last month, the German conservatives drove a push from the centre-right European People’s party to rip up green finance laws and water down farming rules as part of their opposition to “excessive regulation and bureaucracy”. The push to weaken climate and energy policy in the name of competitiveness could run afoul of Europe’s efforts to increase its independence from Russia, China and – as Merz said in an election debate on Sunday – the US. Manon Dufour, head of the Brussels branch of climate thinktank E3G, said climate action would be a “core pillar” of any credible security and resilience strategy. She said: “Germany can act as an engine for Europe, helping forge a path towards security and resilience. It can also act as a brake, bringing it to a standstill.”",Germany; Friedrich Merz; Green politics; Climate crisis; Environment; Europe; World news,World news
2025-02-22T16:00:11Z,Do you want to buy a British kettle? Go whistle | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/22/do-you-want-to-buy-a-british-kettle-go-whistle,"Britons might never again get the chance to buy an electric kettle made in the UK. Even a £150 kettle from Dualit, the company most famous for making its celebrated toaster in Crawley, West Sussex, is produced by Chinese workers 5,000 miles away. Most consumers think the whereabouts of the factory or assembly plant riveting their latest purchase together is irrelevant, but those who do want it to be produced locally do not have a choice. There have been “buy British” campaigns in the past, and supermarkets, under pressure to show their support for UK farmers, continue to plaster domestic produce with union jack labels. These days it might seem a bit Trumpian to talk about fostering homegrown kettle making. And Malcolm Featherstone, who wants his nascent company to be part of a manufacturing renaissance, stood as a Reform candidate in Harlow, Essex in last year’s general election. Yet, this seasoned business executive, one of three founders behind the British Domestic Appliance Company, is tapping into the climate change debate and the post-pandemic concern about economic security much more than he is a sense of nostalgia for a bygone age. Sadly, he has tried to drum up interest in his latest scheme – manufacturing kettles under the brand Chameleon – to no avail. Featherstone says his experience after three rounds of fundraising is that “no one is interested in putting their money into UK manufacturing”, adding “everyone who is looking to invest is only really interested in two things, green finance and fintech companies”. He hopes to keep his business alive with a prototype and a fresh round of visits to potential investors, but admits “we are stuck at this time”. The company’s pitch should appeal to people who want to reduce carbon emissions and cut waste as the would-be kettle will be made in the UK – reducing transport costs – and like a Dualit toaster, have replaceable parts, also made in the UK. (Consumers would have to be willing to pay a premium, however – at £80 to £90, Featherstone’s kettle would initially be more expensive than its Chinese rivals.) “I didn’t see why every kettle on the shelves in Britain is made in China,” he says. “There are Italian and German kettles, but we seem to have given up.” Avoiding Chinese goods in favour of domestic producers under the America First banner was a feature of the US president’s rhetoric in his first term. Since taking office for a second time, Trump has revived the slogan and said he will impose wide-ranging import tariffs to give extra support. For instance, in the US there are a number of statutes that require firms receiving federal assistance to prefer goods, products and materials made within the country’s borders. The EU has rules on imports to prevent domestic producers being outrun by Chinese imports, something the UK has stepped back from implementing. Meanwhile, slogans urging UK consumers to buy British have never gained the same traction. In 2023, the UK ran a trade deficit in goods of £188bn, offset by a surplus of £173bn on trade in services to leave an overall deficit of £15bn. Maybe, says Featherstone, consumers will begin to look more favourably on UK-produced goods when they consider how complicated supply chains stretching halfway round the world can easily be disrupted, sending prices rocketing in times of economic stress. Concerns about environmental damage from shipments of fast fashion and not-so-durable goods from the far east could also give consumers added impetus to buy British. China’s cheap prices are viewed through an ethical lens that marks Beijing down for using slave labour and pursuing pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong while plotting to subsume Taiwan into a vision of greater China. China, though, has made deep inroads into western domestic markets, making it difficult and costly to buy elsewhere. And attempts to invent or revive mass market British brands have a chequered history. According to official figures, factory output accounts for 8.2% of national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), down from about 30% in 1970, indicating the diminishing role manufacturing plays in the UK economy. Except, a recent report by Oxford Economics and Lloyds Bank argued that with all the add-ons and service contracts associated with the sector included, its impact is far greater than the official measure, concluding it was worth £518bn in 2022, or nearly a quarter (23%) of UK GDP. Labour’s long-awaited industrial strategy is expected to appear this summer and is likely to give support to homegrown manufacturing. Tackling high energy prices should be a cornerstone of new policies when, according to government data, a small UK manufacturer pays 25p per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with 19p in France and Germany. The cost drops to 9p in the champions of renewable energy, Denmark and Finland, and 8p in the US. Chinese firms pay less than 1p per kWh. Maybe Featherstone and business people like him will find backers when the costs underpinning their enterprises are lower. It would benefit the nation if the manufacturing sector can claim more winners.",Business; Manufacturing sector; UK news; China; Donald Trump; Foreign policy; Economics,Business
2025-01-15T12:07:19Z,Major banks are abandoning their climate alliance en masse. So much for ‘woke capital’ | Adrienne Buller,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/15/woke-capital-net-zero-banking-alliance,"Last week, as flames began tearing through greater Los Angeles, claiming multiple lives and forcing more than 100,000 people to evacuate, JP Morgan became the sixth major US bank to quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) since the start of December. A smaller story, certainly, but the departure of top US banks from the NZBA in the weeks since Donald Trump’s re-election nonetheless speaks to a seismic political shift prompting major financial institutions to turn away from the climate-related commitments they made in the optimistic years after the Paris agreement. The NZBA is a voluntary network of global banks committed to “align lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050”. It is part of the umbrella Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), which counts among its membership dozens of “alliances” covering the various segments of global finance. For its part, the NZBA requires new members to submit science-aligned targets within 18 months of joining, alongside disclosing plans for and status updates on meeting them. At its height, the coalition boasted 40% of global banking assets. And at the time of its launch, its co-founder, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, described the NZBA as the “breakthrough in mainstreaming climate finance the world needs”. So far a breakthrough remains at large. In evaluating the NZBA, the benchmark that ultimately matters is that of curbing global emissions and fossil fuel expansion. On both of these points, it’s not clear that the alliance has had any effect. Banks’ targets have been met with widespread criticism concerning lack of transparency and inconsistent or questionable methodologies, and recent research shows little to no difference between the financing and engagement impact of NZBA members and non-members. A separate study found banks that self-present as eco-conscious lend more to polluting industries than those that don’t. Impressively, there has been an overall uptick in fossil fuel financing since 2021 – after the group was formed. But this raises a critical question: if these alliances were voluntary, non-binding, and seem to have done close to nothing to hinder banks financing fossil fuel expansion, why are banks bothering to quit? The answer is always, in finance, a calculus of risk. At the time of NZBA’s founding, banks faced considerable reputational risk for being seen as climate laggards. The wind was in the sails of governments and institutions touting climate action, and banks acted accordingly. Today, on the back of record fossil fuel profitability, a protracted backlash against “woke capital” and the second coming of Trump, the calculus has changed. The mood music on Wall Street is the threat of litigation for being seen as anti-Big Fossil. Weeks after Trump’s re-election, the “big three” asset managers – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – were sued by a Texas-led coalition ostensibly for using climate strategies to crush coal production in an alleged breach of antitrust law. In a series of publications in 2024, the Republican-led House judiciary committee claimed it had evidence of a “climate cartel” among big financial firms, criticising GFANZ and Climate Action 100+, another voluntary alliance, for encouraging investors to use their position as shareholders to push companies to disclose their emissions and set climate plans – which, according to the committee, amounts to “collusion”. It’s unclear what the conclusions of these reports mean for implicated firms, but the implied – and chilling – threat is one of legal action for breaching antitrust laws. Even without that thread, however, parties hostile to the green finance wave have found avenues for applying pressure: the asset management giant BlackRock, having previously made considerable efforts to pitch itself as a climate leader, left its equivalent alliance to the NZBA, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, last week, after the loss of billions in public pension assets from red states that attacked the firm as too environment and sustainability minded. What, then, should we make of this gradual crumbling of the “sustainable finance” infrastructure? As Daniela Gabor, a professor of economics, has argued, the prominence of the agenda after the Paris agreement might best be read as an effort by the private sector to weaken a groundswell in public demand for climate action by governments, heading off the threat of stricter regulation and ensuring that the “big green state” remains squarely focused on “mobilising” private capital rather than investing directly itself – even if this approach might be more costly and less effective. Optimistically, the faltering of the project could therefore create new openings for more ambitious and effective policy. However, this was always an agenda that was equally attractive to governments. Private sector alliances such as GFANZ reflect a view of climate policy as technocratic exercise – crowding in finance here, de-risking a carbon capture project there. Treating it as such allowed governments to dodge the thornier issues of climate policy, from its direct relationship to economic inequality and outsized corporate power, to confronting the entrenched interests of the fossil fuel industry – whether through unwinding trillions in annual subsidies or directly regulating against fossil fuel expansion. As Hans Stegeman, the chief economist at Triodos Bank, put it to me: “For too long, policymakers have placed excessive hope in private finance to resolve issues they hesitate to address through regulation or public policy.” As the climate crisis accelerates and increasingly far-right politicians make gains around the world – often on platforms that rally against the apparent elitism of climate politics – ignoring these issues is no longer a viable strategy. In a statement published on 31 December, GFANZ announced it would drop its requirements for members to publish firm targets, allowing “any financial institution working to mobilise capital and lower the barriers to financing energy transition to participate” and earlier this month announced it would no longer work as an umbrella organisation, but a stand-alone body working to “mobilise” climate finance. For a project that still retains many prominent European banks within its ranks, the crumbling to pressure and change of direction was remarkably swift. More cynically, it might be read as an admission that all these “targets” and “disclosures” never meant much at all. Adrienne Buller is director of The Break Down and the author of The Value of a Whale: on the illusions of green capitalism This article was amended on 16 January 2025 to reflect the fact that GFANZ will no longer work as an umbrella organisation for other climate finance groups.",Climate crisis; Banking; World news; Environment; Business; UK news,Opinion
2024-02-28T23:30:00Z,UK accused of ‘moving goalposts’ on climate finance commitments,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/feb/28/uk-accused-of-moving-goalposts-on-climate-finance-commitments,"Ministers have been accused of “moving the goalposts” to meet the UK’s international climate commitments after £1.7bn of an existing aid budget was reclassified as providing poorer countries with environmental funding. The government’s official aid watchdog says that even with these accountancy changes, Downing Street still might not meet the £11.6bn target due to the scale of cuts to overseas aid budgets. MPs did not disguise last year that they were undertaking a reclassification of what aid could be regarded as contributing to the climate target, but this is the first time the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) has put a figure on the scale of the changes or passed comment on its validity. The report states: “To meet the UK’s climate finance commitment, the government opted to adjust its accounting methodology, essentially moving the goalposts for achieving the £11.6bn,” adding that without the changes ministers had no chance of meeting the target. “All of these changes meant that the government counted an extra £1.724bn towards the target, while countries expecting support from the ICF [international climate finance] pledge did not receive any additional money to tackle climate change.” The report also describes the reclassifications as large and representing 15% of the total UK climate pledge, adding the government’s reputation as a leader in this field has been damaged. The UK’s £11.6bn pledge arose from various UN climate conferences and was widely praised at the time as setting the UK as a leader in climate finance donations. It was the UK contribution to meeting the worldwide pledge to mobilise $100bn annually for climate finance, a global pledge first made in 2009. The UK made the specific £11.6bn pledge at the UN general assembly in 2019, saying the money would cover the five years to March 2026. The ICAI report said the government still needs to find 55% of the £11.6bn in the final two years of the pledge. At least £2.6bn of the pledge is now not due to be spent until the final year, 2025-26, after a general election. Such backloading would place great budgetary pressure on any incoming Labour government aid programme. The ICAI chief commissioner, Dr Tamsyn Barton, who led the review, said: “We are concerned that by altering its accounting methods and identifying existing spend as international climate finance to include that funding in the total, rather than providing new money, the UK is offering less additional assistance than was originally promised. It may also not be as suited to the needs of the most vulnerable countries at risk from climate change, notably the least developed, conflict-affected and small island developing states.” Ministers found the £1.7bn by reclassifying core contributions to multilateral development banks as green (worth over £750m), classifying as green finance a fixed proportion of 30% of humanitarian programmes operating in the 10% of countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis (£470m) – meaning no additional financing for those hardest hit. Something described as a scrubbing exercise found an extra £200m in green finance. The report adds that as part of the reclassification more of UK aid funding has been translated into loans rather than grants via multilateral development banks, a method less appropriate for the poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries. “There is also insufficient transparency about the new accounting, making it difficult to hold the government to account for its climate finance commitments,” the report adds.",Climate finance; UK news; Aid; Global development; United Nations; Climate crisis; Environment; World news; Politics; Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai),Global development
2024-04-10T23:01:14Z,UK heat pump adopters open up homes to encourage others to ditch gas boilers ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/11/uk-heat-pump-adopters-open-up-homes-to-encourage-others-to-ditch-gas-boilers,"UK householders considering swapping their gas boiler for an electric heat pump could see how they work by visiting an early adopter in their area. A new service aims to help would-be heat pump owners to book a visit with households that already have one installed, through a website launched by the innovation charity Nesta. The site, VisitAHeatPump.com, allows users to locate one of 150 households that have signed up to host interested visitors to look at their low-carbon heating systems. Currently London and central Scotland have the highest concentration of heat pump hosts, while East Anglia is “becoming a heat pump hotspot” with 11 hosts advertising on the platform so far, Nesta says. Katy King, a director at Nesta, said the service would make it easier for prospective heat pump owners to see how the devices worked in a real-life setting, and ask any questions they may have. “We hope that if more people can see heat pumps in real-life settings, then more people will have confidence that a heat pump is the right fit to heat their home,” she said. “Changing the way we heat our homes is one of the most meaningful things we can do to cut carbon emissions. Many homeowners are keen to make green improvements but don’t get the opportunity to see how low-carbon technologies, such as heat pumps, work in action.” The government has identified heat pumps as a crucial technology to help cut carbon emissions from heating, which makes up more than a third of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Ministers aim to have 600,000 pumps installed a year by 2028, but take-up has been hampered by high costs and scepticism of the new technology. In response, the government has increased its grant scheme to £7,500 to help bring down costs to levels more comparable to conventional gas boilers. Martin Callanan, the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, said: “This fantastic new service will help families work out whether a heat pump is right for them, and we’ll continue supporting households to make the switch with our £7,500 grant. We already know that heat pumps are three times more efficient than gas boilers and demand is soaring, with applications to our boiler upgrade scheme up 75% on last February,” he said.",Renewable energy; Geothermal energy; Energy industry; Energy; Environment; Business; Household bills; Family finances; Consumer affairs; UK news; Money; Heat pumps,Environment
2024-07-26T16:14:49Z,Ed Miliband says Labour will honour pledge of £11.6bn in overseas climate aid,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/26/ed-miliband-labour-honour-pledge-11bn-overseas-climate-aid,"Labour will honour a pledge of £11.6bn in overseas aid for the climate crisis, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, told an unusual meeting of Cop presidents past and present on Friday, as he sought to re-establish the UK at the heart of international climate discussions. As the Labour government prepares for this year’s climate-emergency summit in November, Miliband hosted Mukhtar Babayev, the Azerbaijan government minister who will lead Cop29, and Ana Toni, the top official on the climate for Brazil, which will host Cop30 in the Amazonian city of Belem in 2025 in a meeting to discuss what steps are needed to make a success of the next two UN climate Cops, as the “conferences of the parties” under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are known. Unusually, Alok Sharma, the former Tory cabinet minister who presided over the widely praised Cop26 summit held in 2021 in Glasgow, was also present. Miliband committed to honouring the overseas aid pledge, although there are concerns that it will be “challenging”. The pledge was made by Boris Johnson before Cop26 in Glasgow, but he and his successors as prime minister were slow to disburse the promised funds, and in February the government’s aid watchdog found that 55% of the pledge remained to be spent, making the target “challenging” to meet. The Tories were preparing to ditch the pledge, according to the former minister Zac Goldsmith. But Miliband said it was vital for countries stricken by climate disaster to be assured of funds from the developed world, and for rich countries to show leadership, if the world is to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Miliband said: “We are almost at the halfway point in this critical decade to halt climate change, and the case for urgent and unified global action is greater than ever. We must lead by example with action starting at home – which is what we are doing through our bold 2030 clean power mission, our commitment not to issue new oil, gas or coal licences, and our £11.6bn commitment to international climate finance, sending a powerful signal to the world that we are serious about the leadership role the UK can play in driving global climate action.” Developing countries and civil society experts welcomed the affirmation. Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “This move will be warmly welcomed by developing countries. The UK used to be seen as a credible leader on climate change around the world but sadly that has been lost in recent years. The new government needs to recognise its responsibilities on the global stage and delivering its climate commitments is essential if the world is going to properly tackle the injustice of the climate crisis.” Harjeet Singh, the global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty initiative, said: “This confirmation is a welcome step forward. As one of the largest historical polluters, the UK bears significant responsibility to contribute its fair share in supporting developing nations.” Babayev, who faces the task of chivvying developed countries into upping their climate finance commitments from billions to trillions, welcomed the pledge. “We thank the UK for its commitment to demonstrate leadership this year – as the host of Cop26, the UK understands well the critical importance of Cop29 for global climate action.” Toni also called on the UK to set out a strengthened target on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “As the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, the UK’s commitment to systems transformation towards clean energy and green finance is both symbolic and crucial,” she said. The two future Cop presidents met Miliband at Lancaster House in London and separately met King Charles, who held a reception for businesses and climate advocates at Clarence House. The King attended the Cop28 summit in Dubai last year, but was prevented from attending the previous conference by Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. It is not yet known whether he will attend Cop29, though he is likely to be invited to Cop30. Sultan Al Jaber, the president of Cop28 in Dubai last year, met the King at Clarence House but did not meet Miliband. Developing countries also want assurances that more aid will be forthcoming after 2026, however. Catherine Pettengell, the executive director of Climate Action Network UK, said: “The UK must urgently rebuild credibility on the global stage, and particularly with our partners in low and middle-income countries suffering the worst impacts of climate change. At a minimum this means fulfilling the existing UK commitments, as well as going beyond this as soon as possible.”",Environment; UK news; Cop29; Climate aid; Climate crisis; Ed Miliband; Alok Sharma; Labour; Politics; Energy,Environment
2024-03-26T13:48:40Z,New blow to British smart meter rollout as number of faulty machines leaps to 4m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/26/smart-meter-rollout-number-faulty-machines-leaps-great-britain,"Nearly 4m energy smart meters in homes and businesses are faulty, government figures have shown, in a further blow to the “troubled” rollout of the technology. Data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero reported that, at the end of last year, 3.98m meters in Great Britain were not working properly. The department had initially reported that there were only 2.7m faulty meters in June 2023 but the figure for June has been revised up – to 4.31m – because of reporting errors from some suppliers. The latest data has raised concerns that customers may have been overcharged on their gas and electricity bills, and has prompted the government to write to the industry regulator, Ofgem, urging action against energy providers who are not supporting customers and meeting legal obligations. Smart meters are seen as an important part of the transition to net zero by allowing homeowners to more easily track their energy use and take steps to reduce consumption. They send real-time data on customer usage to suppliers remotely when in “smart mode”. However, when they are not connected properly, customers have to rely on estimated bills, which is resulting in some paying too much for their energy. A spokesperson for the industry body, Energy UK, said: “Technical problems can prevent some meters from operating in smart mode and while this can be for reasons outside their control, suppliers still have an obligation to replace them when this happens.” It added that the best way to avoid inaccurate bills through estimated readings was to send manual meter readings until their supplier is able to fix the issue. Last week Lord Callanan, minister for energy efficiency and green finance, wrote to Ofgem saying the number of faulty meters fell short of what the government expected to see, and urged the regulator to take action. He added that the level of underperformance of some operators showed that legal requirements put in place to ensure meters operated in smart mode were not being universally followed. Last year, the public accounts committee called on ministers to set out how they plan to convince the public to take up a smart meter more than a decade into the “troubled” rollout of the technology. About 60% of all domestic and business meters now smart. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “The vast majority of smart meters are working correctly. “However, we are concerned that reporting errors by a minority of suppliers have uncovered more meters not operating in smart mode than previously thought.” Smart Energy GB, a government-backed non-profit set up to help with the smart meter transition, said there are now almost 35m smart meters in Great Britain “and the vast majority are operating as intended”. It added that there had been an overall improvement in the proportion of smart meters operating in smart mode since 2022, increasing from 87.3% at the end of 2022 to 88.6% at the end of 2023.",Energy industry; Gas; Household bills; Smart meters; Business; Consumer affairs; Commodities; Energy; Energy efficiency; Ethical and green living; Environment; Money; Utilities; Oil and gas companies; Ofgem; Regulators; UK news; Energy bills,Business
2023-08-19T05:00:10Z,"Reforesting Scotland doesn’t need multimillionaires, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/19/reforesting-scotland-private-funding-land-reform,"Land reform campaigners have challenged claims that Scotland has to rely on multimillionaires spending up to £2bn on new forests and peatlands to rescue the country from the climate crisis. An analysis by Community Land Scotland accuses NatureScot, the conservation agency, of using crude and unsubstantiated figures to call for a big increase in private funding to reforest the Highlands and uplands. NatureScot and the Scottish Greens minister Lorna Slater announced in March that they had signed a deal with private financiers to leverage up to £2bn in loans over the next decade to help fund an expansion in new forestry and peatland restoration. They argued that investment could plant 185,000 hectares (457,000 acres) of woodland to store about 28m tonnes of CO2 over the next 30 years – a figure equivalent to half Scotland’s annual CO2 emissions. To the alarm of conservation groups and land reformers, the deal will involve a small private bank in Edinburgh and two investment firms, Palladium and Lombard Odier, which hope to profit from their loans by selling carbon credits based on the carbon sequestrated by the new woodlands and restored peatland. The private bank, Hampden, said it was unlikely to reveal the identities of its clients who invest in these funds. The memorandum of understanding it signed with NatureScot has detailed clauses requiring secrecy on the projects’ finances. NatureScot officials are adamant these investments will be carefully designed, in collaboration with local people, in consultation with the land reform agency the Scottish Land Commission, and in strict accordance with a charter on “high integrity” carbon investments released by the Scottish government. Brendan Turvey, NatureScot’s low carbon manager, said the scale of the challenge to fund the peatland and woodland restoration was so great it was akin to “a national emergency”. “We’ve no option but to embrace new financial models to meet these targets. There’s not enough public money, full stop, to deliver all the things we need to do to get to net zero,” he said. “We need to act now if these are to help us get to net zero by 2045.” One study estimated the cost of restoring all Scotland’s damaged peatlands, which release carbon as they dry out and degrade, was between £3bn and £4bn over the next 10 years. NatureScot had only been given £250m to do so. Scotland was also far off hitting a target to plant 20,000 hectares of new woodland every year. “We have not moved at the pace we need to move at: as the reality of climate change has become more obvious, we’re now trying to pick up the pace,” Turvey said. The analysis for Community Land Scotland by Jon Hollingdale, a forestry consultant, said in reality it would reinforce Scotland’s highly unequal land ownership patterns and enrich existing land owners, while undermining the case for better use of subsidies and taxation to fund nature restoration. Ailsa Raeburn, the chair of Community Land Scotland, said private finance may have a role to play but said it was essential “we understand any upsides and the downsides to utilising large scale private finance and, in an unregulated environment, we guard against a rush to monetise Scotland’s natural assets which risks leaving its people and communities behind”. NatureScot’s green finance figures are based on estimates published in October 2021 by the Green Finance Institute (GFI), a London-based thinktank, that the UK faces a “green finance gap” of between £44bn and £97bn on all nature investments over the next decade, if it intends to reach net zero by 2050. The GFI report said that was the gap between how much the UK’s central and devolved governments plan to spend on forestry, peatland restoration and rewilding, compared with the amount actually needed to reach their forestry and peatland restoration targets. The central estimate, it said, was a finance gap of £56bn for the UK as a whole. For Scotland, that gap was estimated by GFI to be about £20bn – a figure cited repeatedly by NatureScot and Slater in their official announcements, and since embraced by landowners’ organisations. The agency said in March its pilot projects would focus on a proposed collaborative reforestation project in the Scottish Borders known as the Wild Heart expansion project, beginning in spring 2023, and an as yet unspecified project to restore remnants of the Atlantic rainforest on Scotland’s west coast. Turvey said those projects would test whether this finance model was viable. NatureScot had to correct the memorandum of understanding after wrongly claiming the Scottish Land Commission, which is an independent body, was on the oversight board. And its timetables are already slipping. There is no agreement yet between NatureScot and the Wild Heart project to leverage the £200m to £300m in private financing the agency said is available for spending there. Hollingdale said the figures used by GFI and NatureScot to justify that £20bn and the £2bn private finance target were based on a series of faulty assumptions. He said GFI’s estimates wrongly included the cost of buying the land needed to plant forests and resuscitate degraded peatlands. Most of those would be carried out by existing landowners, he said. If investors bought land specifically for carbon sequestration, that land would be a financial asset, not a cost. He estimated that if buying the land was taken out of the equation, the actual finance gap for woodland would be roughly 30% of the figure given by GFI – a gap which could be met by government subsidies. NatureScot’s statement in March that the £2bn investment would store 28m tonnes of carbon were also deeply flawed, according to Hollingdale. To reach that figure within 30 years would require a large amount of planting in the next few years, because broadleaf trees take decades to store CO2 in significant amounts. Rhian-Mari Thomas, GFI’s chief executive, said its 2021 report was the first attempt to quantify the finance gap, using “best estimates”. She added: “We naturally welcome third-party efforts to build on the data and contribute to this important body of work.” • This article was amended on 19 August 2023. The proposed reforestation project in the Scottish Borders is not known as the Wild Heart Borders forest trust, as stated in an earlier version; it is the Wild Heart expansion project, which would involve the Borders Forest Trust. It was further amended on 20 August 2023: the central estimate for the “green finance gap” is £56bn, not £56m.",Scotland; Climate crisis; Land rights; Conservation; Trees and forests; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Land ownership; UK news,UK news
2024-02-28T09:38:48Z,Cash-strapped London council starts crowdfunding drive to pay for green upgrades,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/28/cash-strapped-london-council-starts-crowdfunding-drive-to-pay-for-green-upgrades,"Deep cuts to government funding have led a council in south London to ask its residents to invest their own money, for a financial return, to build cycle hangars, LED street lighting and green upgrades at schools and leisure centres. Amid a financial crisis hitting town halls across England, councillors in Southwark have resorted to a crowdfunding scheme to raise £6m over the next six years to help fund climate-friendly projects. In a creative response to the double challenge of financial constraints and maintaining investment required to tackle the climate emergency, the scheme plans to raise £1m for the coming financial year with the offer of a 4.6% return for investors. An overwhelming majority of English local authorities are planning deep cuts to services and maximum possible council tax rises to remain financially solvent, despite an extra £600m cash injection from the government. “Certainly that’s the context,” said Emily Hickson, the Labour-run council’s deputy cabinet member for green finance. “Southwark is not different to any other council in the country: we’re all struggling with the lack of central government grants and keeping up with inflation. “We are in the black and that’s because we are being innovative.” The scheme allows investments of as little as £5, and had raised more than £50,000 within hours of its launch on Tuesday. It is open to individuals and businesses regardless of residency, with a fixed return of 4.6% a year over a five-year term. Potential investors are warned, however, that their capital is at risk and they may lose some or even all of the money they put in. Figures from the Local Government Association on Wednesday show two-thirds of English councils are planning cuts to neighbourhood services this year – such as waste collection, road repairs, library and leisure services – as they struggle to plug funding gaps. As years of underfunding from central government collide with higher inflation and rising demand on services, it estimates councils are facing a £4bn shortfall over the two financial years to 2024-25. It warned that 85% of councils were planning to make cost savings to balance their budgets for the coming financial year. Southwark council said this month it needed to find savings and efficiencies to close a budget gap of £6.7m for the coming financial year amid rising pressure on services and increasing costs. It is also planning a maximum allowed council tax increase of 4.99%. Since 2010, the council has lost government funding in cash terms of more than £146m. Earlier this month, Southwark came under fire for tearing out communal spaces and children’s playgrounds to make room for new homes, which were then left boarded up when the council ran out of money. The local authority’s crowdfunding scheme will be managed by Abundance Investment, a financial platform focused on ethical and sustainable community investment projects that is managing more and more programmes on behalf of English local authorities. After launching its first in 2020 for Warrington council in Cheshire, nine local authorities have launched crowdfunding drives using the platform to meet climate targets, including West Berkshire, Camden and Cotswold district council. Hickson said the Southwark scheme would involve a cheaper interest rate for the local authority than borrowing through the government’s public works loan board, which offers councils cheap long-term loans to finance local projects. It would also have the benefit of engaging residents directly with the council’s climate emergency plans. “It’s pretty small. It’s not the way councils around the country are going to solve their budget crises,” Hickson said. “It should enable us to do this on an accelerated time span. These types of projects do need to happen.”",Austerity; Local government; Green economy; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Crowdfunding; Environment; Public finance; Government borrowing; UK news; London,Business
2024-02-15T12:00:14Z,The Price Is Wrong by Brett Christophers review – why capitalism can’t save the planet,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/15/the-price-is-wrong-by-brett-christophers-review-why-capitalism-cant-save-the-planet,"Vladimir Lenin once defined communism as “Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country”. His words may strike a chord with today’s green rebels who see clean energy as a force for transformative change. Yet these revolutionaries have yet to see their revolution. Last year was the hottest in recorded history and, most likely, in the last 100,000 years. While renewable energy is booming, it’s not growing fast enough to prevent climate breakdown. The reasons for this, and what can be done about it, are explored by Brett Christophers, a professor of economic geography at Uppsala University in Sweden. Christophers has made his name through a series of books that attempt to expose capitalism’s grubby secrets, such as last year’s Our Lives in Their Portfolios about the asset management industry. His aim is to make readers understand that they have been lulled into a false sense of security by an economic doctrine that promises its adherents salvation. In the same way, the Price Is Wrong rejects the orthodox reasoning that a mix of technological innovation and market wizardry will be enough to save the Earth. The question at stake is whether the world’s climate mitigation targets can be met by efforts to “green” the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions: electricity. Christophers is pessimistic because the transition from dirty to green fuels is currently lubricated by capitalism itself. His scepticism here is not new. Many on the left say that it is in capitalism’s nature to be destructive of the environment, the climate included. However, the author has a more sophisticated argument. While it is true that low-cost and abundant solar and wind energy is increasingly within our grasp, the mistake is to presume that simply because renewable power has become relatively cheap, it will get built. Capitalists invest because profits are high and stable, not when prices are low and uncertain. In a world awash with the proceeds from fossil fuel extraction, Christophers thinks renewables and their volatile, wafer-thin margins don’t stand much of a chance. In a previous life, Christophers was a management consultant and he bombards the reader with facts and figures. In 300 pages, he details how privatisation and competition have failed to produce the desired economic and environmental results. In 1985, fossil fuel-fired power plants generated 64% of electricity globally; in 2022, it was 61%. And for all the talk of markets, it is state subsidies that prop up green industries. The US’s NextEra Energy, the world’s largest producer of wind and solar power, admits it “depends heavily” on federal support. Because the world has not cracked the problem of effective storage, renewable energy is routinely wasted. In 2020, nearly a fifth of wind power generated by Scottish windfarms was discarded. Then there is evidence that the electricity market has been subject to manipulation. Consider how, between 2020 and 2022, hard-pressed UK consumers faced higher bills after traders announced they would shut off generation ahead of the busiest periods, before offering higher-priced energy to meet the shortfalls they helped create. Bloomberg reported there was nothing illegal in this £470m shakedown. It was political economist Karl Polanyi who introduced the distinction between real and “fictitious” commodities. Electricity, says Christophers, is an example of the latter, a resource fundamentally unsuited to being priced up and traded. Such an insight might have helped the high priests of green finance realise that the elaborate market structures being erected to produce a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sit on unsound foundations. Only the state, concludes Christophers, has “both the financial wherewithal and the logistical and administrative capacity” to deliver the trillions of dollars in annual investment in solar and wind that could keep the planet from burning up. The message is that active involvement in shaping the future is crucial, and such a task is too important to be left to markets.

2023-12-27T07:55:10Z,UK students launch Barclays ‘career boycott’ over bank’s climate policies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/27/uk-students-launch-barclays-career-boycott-over-banks-climate-policies,"Hundreds of students from leading UK universities have launched a “career boycott” of Barclays over its climate policies, warning that the bank will miss out on top talent unless it stops financing fossil fuel companies. More than 220 students from Barclays’ top recruitment universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and University College London, have sent a letter to the high street lender, saying they will not work for Barclays and raising the alarm over its funding for oil and gas firms including Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and BP. “Your ambitious decarbonisation targets are discredited by your absence of action and the roster of fossil fuel companies on your books,” the letter said. “You may say you’re working with them to help them transition, but Shell, Total and BP have all rowed back.” Large oil firms have started to water down climate commitments, including BP, which originally pledged to lower emissions by 35% by 2030 but is now aiming for a 20% to 30% cut instead. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for plans to use algae to create low-carbon fuel, while Shell announced it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year, despite earlier promises to slash its emissions. The letter calls on Barclays to end all financing and underwriting of oil and gas companies – not only their projects – and to boost funding of firms behind wind and solar energy significantly. In May, more than 500 students and recent graduates made a similar pledge aimed at insurers that they said supported controversial fossil fuel projects. That letter was directed at the world’s largest insurance market, Lloyd’s of London, and addressed to individual firms including Beazley, Hiscox, Chaucer and Tokio Marine Kiln. “New recruitment of the younger generation will be another headache for Barclays as long as it continues to finance companies building new oil and gas infrastructure, since it relies heavily on Stem [science, engineering, technology and mathematics] applicants from Oxbridge and other top universities,” said Michelle Hemmingfield, a representative of Students Organising for Sustainability UK, which spearheaded the letter. The career boycott is the latest headache for Barclays, which was targeted by climate campaigners at its AGM in May and faced pressure over its sponsorship of Wimbledon, as well as over its ties to the National Trust. The lender has also been hit by grassroots campaigns, including by a pensioner who refused to pay her council tax because of a link to the bank. A Barclays spokesperson said: “Aligned to our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we believe we can make the greatest difference by working with our clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model, reducing their carbon-intensive activity whilst scaling low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and capacity. “We have set 2030 targets to reduce the emissions we finance in five high-emitting sectors, including the energy sector, where we have achieved a 32% reduction since 2020. In addition, to scale the needed technologies and infrastructure, we have provided £99bn of green finance since 2018, and have a target to facilitate $1tn in sustainable and transition financing between 2023 and 2030.”",Barclays; Banking; Fossil fuel divestment; Business; Fossil fuels; Investing; Financial sector; Environment; Energy; UK news; Protest; ExxonMobil; Insurance industry; Graduate careers; Universities,Business
2021-12-08T18:58:38Z,The Guardian view on green finance: doing business as if the planet mattered | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/08/the-guardian-view-on-green-finance-doing-business-as-if-the-planet-mattered,"Last week, Shell walked away from 170 million barrels of oil off the coast of Shetland, declaring the “economic case for investment” too weak. As might be expected with such a politically sensitive venture, there has been much speculation about what other factors might have been at play, whether pressure from Nicola Sturgeon or from Whitehall. But let’s try another question: how did Shell ever decide that there was an economic case? After all, the energy giant does not deny that its entire business will have to change. It advertises its “target to become a net zero emissions” company by 2050, publishes a “sustainability report” and partners with environmental organisations around the world. Yet little of this environmental awareness shows up in the hard numbers. The company’s latest accounts features this disclaimer: “Shell’s operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions do not reflect our net zero emissions target.” In other words: whatever the oil giant says is not what it thinks. This is not an accusation of corporate hypocrisy, of saying one thing and doing quite another. Here is something far more troubling: the multinational is openly admitting that its core assumptions have not changed to reflect the greatest single threat to our planet, our economy – and its business model. It operates on the premise that oil prices will remain high at $60 a barrel, even though working towards net zero would force them to drop, as industries and consumers shift to alternative sources of energy. The International Energy Agency has issued a net zero scenario that projects the price of a barrel of oil will slump to $36 by the end of this decade and $24 by 2050. Prices so low might deter Shell from all kinds of exploration and drilling projects. It might also wipe millions off the value of the firm. Company reports are audited and Shell’s auditor is another giant, EY. Yet EY does not quibble with Shell’s assumptions – it simply says “it is neither possible nor appropriate” for it to challenge them. This is, frankly, nonsense. EY is one of the biggest financial firms on the planet and is as capable as the Guardian of looking at the independent forecasts for what green transition means for oil prices. Moreover, the regulator for auditors has demanded they “address, and where relevant report” on climate change. This isn’t to single out Shell; it is just one obvious example. In a recent review, the thinktank Carbon Tracker recently found that 70% of companies and 80% of auditors failed to disclose climate risk in their financial reports. The government is consulting on reforms to the often scandal-hit audit industry. This would seem an obvious issue for Kwasi Kwarteng to take up. Let’s value companies according to hard limits being imposed on us by the planet, rather than according to the fictions dreamed up by fossil fuel industries.",Environment; Shell; Business; Oil; Commodities; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Scotland; UK news; Climate crisis; Fossil fuels; Green economy,Opinion
2024-02-27T06:00:13Z,"UK’s net zero economy grew 9% in 2023, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/uk-net-zero-economy-grew-in-2023-report-finds,"The UK’s net zero economy grew by 9% in 2023, a report has revealed, in stark contrast to the 0.1% growth seen in the economy overall. Nevertheless, the report pointed out that strong future growth from green businesses was being put at risk by government policy reversals, lack of investment and competition from the EU and US. Thousands of new green companies were founded in 2023 and overall the sector was responsible for the production of £74bn in goods and services and 765,000 jobs, according to the report by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Hotspots of net zero businesses and the well-paid jobs they provide occur across the country, rather than being concentrated in London and the south-east, the report found. It also highlighted strong net zero activity in some of the most deprived areas and in marginal constituencies that will be focal battlegrounds in the coming general election. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is vital to limiting the damage from the climate crisis. Doing so would not only bring an economic boost but also cut energy costs for households and businesses and ensure energy security by ending the UK’s reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets, the report authors said. Peter Chalkley, the director of ECIU, said: “Against the backdrop of economic stagnation, the net zero economy is bucking the trend, but it’s clear that the policy U-turns of the past year have damaged investor confidence at a time when the US and EU are investing billions to compete for clean industries. The question now is: will political parties provide the leadership, stability and investment needed to generate further growth – or shy away from the global race for net zero?” Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI, said: “The transition to net zero presents unprecedented opportunities for the UK to become a more resilient and productive economy while also tackling climate change. [Businesses] really don’t want to see net zero issues politicised.” Rishi Sunak, the Conservative prime minister, has weakened net zero policies including the rollout of electric vehicles and heat pumps and backed new oil and gas drilling, against the advice of scientists. The UK has also recently fallen down an index of attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, recently halved a pledge to invest £28bn a year in the green economy. Adriana Curca, manager of CBI Economics, said: “We quite often tend to think about the costs involved in the net zero transition, but there are a lot of economic opportunities, having a real potential to drive sustainable long-term growth.” The new report analysed the green economy, including renewable energy, building energy efficiency, electric vehicles, carbon capture technology and green finance. It found net zero jobs were on average £10,000 better paid than the UK average of £35,400, and 50% more productive, generating £114,300 in economic activity overall. The number of net zero businesses rose by 4,000 to 23,745 in 2023. The report found hotspots of net zero activity in some of the most deprived parts of the country, including Hartlepool, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, all of which are in the 10% most deprived local authorities. It also found that half of the top 50 net zero hotspots in England and Wales were in the top 50 most marginal Conservative seats to be contested at the general election, including High Peak, Cheadle, Derby North, and Lancaster and Wyre. Adriana Curca: “These [net zero] jobs go a long way towards improving living standards in those areas.” Thomas Farquhar at cleantech business Heatio said: “The UK net zero economy offers huge opportunities for new, innovative businesses to grow. Frustratingly, we are lagging behind the rest of Europe.” Farquhar said only 1% of UK homes had transitioned to low carbon dioxide heating, compared with 66% in Norway; and only 5% of suitable UK homes had installed solar panels, compared with 16% in the Netherlands. The UK’s National Infrastructure Commission said on Friday that the “government needs to move faster to ensure that the necessary [energy] infrastructure can be delivered over the next decade”. The International Monetary Fund said in December that the “economic benefits of accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy vastly outweigh its cost”. A London School of Economics report published in January concluded that “too much current investment continues to be in the unsustainable economy”, such as oil and gas and new homes and offices that are not energy-efficient. It said: “The UK needs to increase annual public investment by around 1% of GDP – £26bn at current prices – to make up for decades of underinvestment. There will be upfront investment costs, but targeted and temporary borrowing for good public net investment is fiscally responsible.” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “We welcome these findings, which are testament to our world-leading plans to transform the energy industry towards more clean and renewable energy. We have a clear strategy to boost UK industry and reach net zero - with over 80,000 green jobs being supported or in the pipeline since 2020, and over £200bn in public and private low carbon investment since 2010.”",Green economy; Climate crisis; Economic growth (GDP); UK news; Business; Environment,Environment
2021-06-30T23:01:51Z,Rishi Sunak to announce £15bn green finance plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/01/rishi-sunak-to-announce-15bn-green-finance-plan,"Rishi Sunak will announce plans to transform the City of London into a hub for green finance on Thursday as the government pushes to boost its competitiveness on the global stage after Brexit. The chancellor is expected to use his first speech to City financiers at the annual Mansion House address to announce details of a £15bn UK programme of government bond issuance, with the proceeds being spent on environmentally friendly projects. Aiming to turn Britain into a world leader for low-carbon financial services, Sunak will also launch a separate green savings bond for UK consumers, which he will say is to be used to help fund infrastructure schemes and create more green jobs across the UK. The green savings bonds will be available through National Savings &amp; Investments (NS&amp;I), offering consumers an opportunity to support green projects while receiving a fixed rate on their savings over a three-year term. The state-owned savings bank will launch the bonds later this year, with a minimum investment of £100 and a maximum limit of £100,000 per person. Although state spending is not dependent on the government raising funding from investors for specific projects, the chancellor will say the money raised from selling the two green bond issuances will help to finance low-carbon schemes such as zero-emissions buses, offshore wind, and investments to boost biodiversity and natural resources such as tree planting. Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said there was a danger that the government’s green bonds scheme was “all talk and no action” and would stand as another legacy of ministers doing too little to address the climate emergency. “We need far more details and a watertight guarantee that these bonds are spent properly on the green jobs and initiatives that will curb climate breakdown,” she said. It comes as ministers prepare to host the COP2 climate conference in Glasgow later this year. As part of the green bond programme, the government will report on the social benefits of the projects, so that investors will have data on the number of jobs created and businesses or households who have benefited. The Treasury said Sunak would use the annual speech to tell finance chiefs and young industry leaders that he wanted to “to sharpen our competitive advantage in financial services”. The annual speech at which the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England address City financiers would usually take place in the evening at a formal dinner in the Square Mile. However, it has been downgraded this year due to social distancing restrictions, with a morning gathering of about 40 people planned instead. In the speech, Sunak will say: “As the baton passes to a new generation of leaders in finance, I feel optimistic about the future. Ambitious at home. Confident internationally. With a plan to make this country the world’s most advanced and exciting financial services hub for decades to come, creating prosperity at home and projecting our values abroad.”",Rishi Sunak; Politics; Bank of England; Business; Environment; UK news,Politics
2024-01-30T19:45:57Z,Labour vows to cut financial ‘red tape’ and ‘unashamedly champion’ UK sector,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/30/labour-vows-to-cut-financial-red-tape-and-unashamedly-champion-uk-sector,"Labour has pledged to “unashamedly champion” the UK’s financial services sector, as it promised to cut down 10,000 pages of regulations and ruled out a windfall tax on bank profits. However, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, signalled that Labour would not bow to intensive lobbying from the private equity industry, telling the Guardian she still planned to close a £500m tax loophole benefiting Britain’s private equity executives. In a 24-page document seen by the Guardian, Labour said it would aim to harness the strengths of the financial sector, which it claimed the Conservative party had taken for granted. “Britain’s financial services lead the world … But too often that success has been in spite, not because, of the actions of the government, which has lacked commitment to its success and stoked instability,” the report said. “We will unashamedly champion our financial services sector as one of the UK’s greatest assets,” Reeves added. Labour, which will formally unveil the plans to City bosses at its business conference in London on Thursday, said the move would involve cutting the industry’s “regulatory burden” including by streamlining some “excessively procedural rules” in the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA’s) 10,000-page regulatory handbook. It will also find and scrap overlapping rules set by the FCA, the Bank of England and the Competition and Markets Authority, and create a “Regulatory Innovation Office” that could help regulators share data, and will monitor the watchdog’s work. Reeves defended the move to cut down on City rules, saying it was not about watering down protection for consumers or the UK’s financial stability. “It is important to have a proper review to make sure that the rules and regulations that we’ve got are fit for purpose and don’t cut across each other. So it’s about having smart and sensible regulation that works for consumers, and also works for the sector.” Labour’s charm offensive comes as the City faces growing threats from rival financial hubs including New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, particularly post-Brexit. London’s stock market has seen an exodus of companies, with Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, saying this week it was considering moving its primary listing to New York “as soon as practicable”. The UK’s £275bn financial and professional services sector accounts for about 12% of the economy and is a huge tax generator. While the report, titled Financing Growth, is silent on Labour’s tax plans for the sector, Reeves said confirmed that banking executives could rest easy. “We have no plans for a windfall tax,” Reeves said. Some bankers have been concerned that Labour could end up following in Italy’s footsteps and launching a tax raid on profits, which have been bolstered by rising interest rates. Banks were criticised last year for raising rates on mortgages and loans more quickly than those offered to savers. Reeves also said she was not backing down on her plan to scrap a discounted tax rates for “carried interest” in the private equity industry, referring to the share of profits that fund managers make on successful deals. Dealmakers pay 28% capital gains tax on those profits, much lower than the 45% income tax levied on higher earners. “That is one of the three tax-raising policies that we have announced along with closing the non-dom tax loophole and applying VAT and business rates on private schools,” the shadow chancellor said. The report takes a swipe at the Tories’ record on supporting the financial sector post-Brexit and says a Labour government would work with the EU to remove “unnecessary barriers” for firms. In an attempt to revive the UK’s flagging stock market, Labour said it would launch a campaign to encourage consumers to buy up the shares of British companies and encourage pension schemes to push more cash into small private companies, venture capital and infrastructure investments. For consumers, the party said it would focus on forging on national financial inclusion strategy, to support vulnerable households. That would involve quickly rolling out regulation of controversial buy now, pay later products, and giving regulators power to guarantee face-to-face banking for branchless communities across the UK. Labour also said it would partner with City firms to make the UK a “global hub for green finance”, and ramp up the decarbonisation of the country’s housing stock, by expanding green mortgages and partnering with City firms to create loan products that can better fund retrofitting. It would also force City firms and the UK’s largest listed companies on the FTSE 100 to publicly declare their carbon footprint and adopt “credible” climate transition plans. The shadow Treasury team said it aimed to spread the wealth, with plans to expand the financial services into regional hubs, beyond London and Edinburgh, and it would establish a “Skills England” body to seek out and foster talent in those areas. “None of the ambitions of the next Labour government can be achieved without a strong financial sector playing its part in reviving investment,” Labour said. “It’s time we took pride in what Britain does best.”",Financial sector; Labour; Business; Politics; UK news; Tax and spending; Private equity; Rachel Reeves; Financial Conduct Authority; Small business; Pensions industry; Bank of England; Regulators; Competition and Markets Authority,Business
2024-01-04T05:00:23Z,"Deforestation effect of UK consumption unsustainable, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/04/deforestation-effect-of-uk-consumption-unsustainable-say-mps,"UK consumption is having an “unsustainable” impact on the world, and contributing particularly highly to deforestation, a report by MPs has found. Products such as soya, cocoa, palm oil, beef and leather may be products of deforestation, and the environmental audit committee has found that the UK’s deforestation footprint per tonne of product consumed is higher than that of other countries including China, calling it “unsustainable”. A deforestation footprint is similar to a carbon footprint. It signifies how much deforestation occurs per tonne of product consumed. Scientists have worked out the deforestation footprints of various countries by analysing trade patterns for goods which are linked to high levels of forest destruction. The government recently announced that the above products produced by illegal deforestation would be banned from the supply chain. But this only applies to a small part of the problem, because much deforestation is legal in the countries in which it occurs. The report, released on Thursday, quotes Client Earth saying the ban creates “perverse incentives” for export countries to remove laws that protect forests, so the deforestation becomes legal and as a result the import of associated products to the UK is not banned. The legislation, announced in December, has not yet passed through parliament. The UK ban has been criticised for not including popular commodities such as coffee. MPs on the environmental audit committee are calling in the report for ministers to develop a target to reduce the UK’s impact on global deforestation as well as a Global Footprint Indicator to demonstrate this impact to the public. The report highlights that forests host 80% of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity, support the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people and provide vital ecosystem services to support local and global economies. Deforestation contributes 11% of global carbon emissions. A study by the RSPB and WWF found that UK imports of just seven forest-risk commodities – soya, cocoa, palm oil, beef and leather, paper, rubber and timber – accounted for a land footprint of 88% of the size of the UK each year. In the same study, research showed that 40% of the UK’s overseas land footprint was in countries at high risk of deforestation, weak governance arrangements and poor labour standards. The report also asks the government to bring in legislation to ensure all forest-risk goods bought by public bodies are certified as sustainable and not driving deforestation in sensitive areas. This would ensure that the UK government is not itself buying goods that are linked to unsustainable deforestation, and set an example for other industries. It has asked for the UK timber regulations to ensure that all imported timber is sustainably harvested, rather than just preventing illegally harvested timber from entering the country. MPs expressed alarm at the risks faced by the Indigenous people who protect many at-risk forests across the globe. Their voices are often ignored and they are disenfranchised from their land, frequently expelled from their ancient territories. The committee heard from Global Witness that one person is killed every other day defending land and the environment. The report says: “Indigenous peoples are protectors of the world’s forests and can possess detailed knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem trends. It is therefore critical that they are facilitated to participate fully in negotiations to address deforestation activity.” The chair of the committee, Philip Dunne MP, said: “UK consumption is having an unsustainable impact on the planet at the current rate. UK markets must not be flooded with products that threaten the world’s forests, the people whose livelihoods rely on them and the precious ecosystems that call them home. Yet despite the recent commitment before and at Cop28 to invest more in reforestation measures and the Amazon Fund to help halt the speed of global deforestation, the UK needs to take tangible steps to turn the dial at home. “The government’s ambition and stated commitment at Cop26 to halt deforestation by 2030 was very welcome, but it is not on track now. Its legislation for a regime to require certain products to be certified as ‘sustainable’ before they can be sold in UK markets was welcome, but the implementing legislation has still not come forward. There is little sense of urgency about getting a rapid grip on the problem of deforestation, which needs to match the rhetoric. “Countries all around the world contribute to deforestation, and the international community of course needs to do much more to tackle deforestation. Yet on some measures the intensity of UK consumption of forest-risk commodities is higher than that of China. This should serve as a wake-up call to the government. To demonstrate genuine global leadership in this critical area, the UK must demonstrate domestic policy progress, and embed environmental and biodiversity protections in future trade deals.” A Government spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the way globally with new legislation to tackle illegal deforestation to make sure with rid UK supply chains of products contributing to the destruction of these vital habitats. “This legislation has already been introduced through the Environment Act and is just one of many measures to halt and reverse global forest loss. “We are also investing in significant international programmes to restore forests, which have avoided over 410,000 hectares of deforestation to date alongside supporting new green finance streams.”",Deforestation; Environment; UK news; China; World news; Greenhouse gas emissions; Cop28,Environment
2023-08-07T08:30:16Z,Major UK gas boiler maker to start electric heat pump production in Hull,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/07/ideal-heating-to-kickstart-electric-heat-pump-production-in-hull,"One of Britain’s biggest boiler makers is to start manufacturing electric heat pumps to keep pace with what it describes as the biggest transformation since the switch from coal to gas devices in the 1930s. Ideal Heating has invested £50m in transforming the manufacturing facilities at its Hull headquarters, which have produced fossil fuel boilers for more than a century. As well as making about 500,000 gas boilers a year, the company will begin making thousands of heat pumps and invest in a “state-of-the-art” centre to train up to 5,000 staff a year to install and service them. The boilermaker expects to manufacture up to 60,000 heat pumps a year from the factory’s new production line, which could rise as forecast demand for heat pumps grows in the coming decades. Shaun Edwards, the chief executive of Ideal Heating’s parent company, Groupe Atlantic, said the investments sent “a clear signal” about the company’s commitment to “remodelling our business to meet the needs of our customers today and into the future”. “With the start of heat pump production and the many other investments we’re making, we’re now pushing strongly forward with renewable technologies that will play an ever-growing role in heating the UK’s homes and commercial premises,” Edwards said. “The transition to low-carbon heating solutions including heat pumps is the biggest transformation in the business since we moved from coal to gas-fired boilers in the 1930s,” he added. The company’s support for heat pumps puts it at odds with many boilermakers who back an industry lobby group accused of trying to delay the take-up of heat pumps. Lord Callanan, the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, visited the Hull factory on Friday to mark the start of Ideal Heating’s heat pump production. The government has set an ambitious target for 600,000 heat pumps to be installed in the UK every year by 2028, which will require thousands more skilled and qualified engineers. However, public take-up of a government grant worth £5,000 towards the cost of a new heat pump has been “disappointingly low” to date. In a letter to ministers, the House of Lords environment and climate change committee said a shortage of installers and “insufficient independent advice” had contributed to slow take-up of heat pumps. The committee also warned that public awareness of low-carbon heating systems was “very limited” and promotion of the scheme had been “inadequate”. Climate campaigners claim that public perception of heat pumps has been damaged by a media campaign undertaken by a lobby group representing boiler makers. The group has also piled pressure on the government to scrap new measures to speed up the rollout of heat pumps. The Guardian revealed last month that the Energy and Utilities Alliance (EUA), an industry association that represents boiler manufacturers and other gas companies, including some that have branched out into heat pumps, made a submission to a government consultation calling for measures forcing the industry to install more heat pumps to be delayed to 2026. Ideal Heating, which is a member of the EUA, declined to comment on its lobbying activities.",Manufacturing sector; Renewable energy; Energy efficiency; Energy; Energy industry; Energy; Technology; Ethical and green living; Environment; Business; UK news,Business
2022-10-24T15:55:56Z,‘He’s a believer’: will Sunak rebuild green agenda torn up by Truss?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/24/will-rishi-sunak-rebuild-green-agenda-torn-up-liz-truss,"The fact that some environment groups and green Tory MPs are welcoming the prospect of Rishi Sunak as prime minister perhaps shows how far the Overton window has shifted in recent weeks. Sunak has never been considered a fully signed up member of the green agenda, and even allies admit he saw the “costs rather than the benefits” of environmental action while chancellor. But after just over a month of a Liz Truss government, many see a Sunak premiership as a welcome relief. Under Truss, years of good relations with groups such as the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts and the National Trust were trashed, Tory infighting was provoked over her insistence on fracking, and her first actions in power included trying to ban solar generation from most of England’s farmland and weakening environmental protections in the retained EU law bill, investment zones and rowing back on nature-friendly farming payments scheme. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, said: “Sunak said he wanted to stick to the 2019 manifesto, which was pretty good on this stuff, and Liz Truss wanted to junk it.” Spiers hopes a new government could heal relations with green groups: “We need a secretary of state in Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] who can demand respect – perhaps George Eustice or Tracey Crouch. After five years of really good relations between the environment groups and Defra was thrown away in six weeks, it would be good if he could rebuild.” Green Tories backed Sunak too. Philip Dunne, the chair of the environmental audit committee in parliament, is a relative rebel on the environment and held his colleagues’ feet to the fire over sewage dumping in England’s waterways. He thinks Sunak has listened to his more eco-minded colleagues: “In the hustings in the summer, when there were lots of candidates, we had a conservative environment network hustings for each of them and they all made their environmental pitches. He was straightforward in saying he’s a believer in net zero Britain, he had a specific proposition for getting homes insulated more quickly and is pretty strong on nature. “I was persuaded he is part of the broad consensus in the Conservative party that we need to leave the environment in a better state than we left it.” The former chancellor’s environmentally minded colleagues are asking him to show his commitment to the cause by getting rid of, or at least reworking, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s retained EU law bill, which would remove hundreds of environmental protection laws. Dunne said: “The EU law issue has potential to be significantly damaging, I am sure he will be looking very carefully at it.” Those who served under Boris Johnson and believe in the environmental measures in the 2019 manifesto think Sunak would follow through on the promises made in it. Rebecca Pow, a former environment minister who resigned after Partygate, said: “I’ve always known that Rishi completely understands the issue … He supported the findings of the Dasgupta review [on the economics of biodiversity] and then commissioned further work to find out what exactly our natural assets are. “He was also the person at Cop26 who committed to making us the green finance centre of the world ... If he becomes prime minister [banks and businesses] will have the certainty that all the environment acts we just passed will go ahead.” One former minister, who did not want to be named, said: “He would broadly follow the 2019 manifesto and definitely keep Elms [the nature-friendly farming subsidies], so much closer to the Johnson regime than Truss.” It may be a low bar for a prime minister but many are saying Sunak listens to experts and follows evidence. “I think his whole approach would be less ideological and he has a great ability to pick up and comprehend complex detail quickly,” the former minister said. Victoria Prentis, who was the farming minister in Defra under Johnson and is now a Department for Work and Pensions minister, said Sunak had been listening to those passionate about the environment, including his daughters, and that he “really gets farming”. But Sunak has certainly never been a passionate environmentalist. He has always voted in line with his party on the environment – that is, largely against measures to prevent climate breakdown – and it is not something he has ever felt strongly enough about to rebel on. He did, however, vote for more regulation of fracking in 2015. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, hopes environment groups will have a better relationship with Sunak than they did with Truss. “Very early on Liz Truss launched this attack on nature – we will have to see what Rishi Sunak does but he seems to be a bit more open to evidence, reason and logic,” he said. There was a glimmer of hope on Monday afternoon when Sunak made the environment a key pledge in his speech to Tory MPs. As climate and cost of living activists occupied parliament, he said he would deliver on net zero carbon emissions, adding his would be an “environmentally focused government”. But Truss has created a lot of work for Sunak to restore any green credentials the Conservative party once had. Bennett said: “The first thing he should do is rip up the repeal of the retained EU law bill which of course threatens at least 570 pieces of environment legislation. Secondly he should scrap proposals for investment zones – they are a polluters’ charter setting up a race to the bottom for towns and cities in the UK, a competition of who can have the worst environmental standards. “Thirdly, he should deliver the agricultural transition as promised in the 2019 manifesto, rewarding farmers handsomely for delivering for nature. He should also put the ban on fracking back in place as it is a total lie that it would do anything for energy security. Instead he should unleash investment for insulation in the UK.” Another concern is that Sunak has the backing of vocal climate action sceptic MPs including Kemi Badenoch, who has called the net zero target “unilateral economic disarmament”, and Steve Baker, the founder of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Tory MPs. Baker, when asked whether Sunak would be good for the environment as prime minister, archly said: “He will be amazing on everything.”",Green politics; Rishi Sunak; Climate crisis; Environment; Politics; Conservative leadership; Biodiversity; Greenhouse gas emissions; Conservation; Conservatives; UK news,Environment
2023-11-03T11:17:30Z,UN to seek assurances UK will not renege on net zero pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/03/un-to-seek-assurances-uk-will-not-renege-on-net-zero-pledge,"The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will be seeking assurances from the UK that there will be no reneging on climate promises, after Rishi Sunak’s rowing back on green measures. The UN is concerned that countries may be backsliding on pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply, to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Top UN officials called for countries to put aside geopolitical tensions in order to make progress on tackling the climate crisis at the crucial Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, which begins on 30 November. Amina Mohammed, deputy secretary general, said the UN was “absolutely” concerned about backsliding on climate commitments because “there is a lot of it”. Countries made pledges last year, at the Cop27 summit in Egypt, and at the landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, where the 1.5C limit was strongly affirmed. Many countries have since appeared to waver, through expanding fossil fuel access after the invasion of Ukraine, or by failing to set strong targets. In the UK, the prime minister has said the legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 still stands, but recent actions, such as postponing the phase-out of petrol driven cars and gas boilers, make it doubtful the UK will meet its emissions reduction commitments for 2030. In the US, Joe Biden has licensed new oil and gas developments, despite taking a strong stance on the climate crisis. The EU has also recently failed to toughen its commitment to emissions reduction, currently set at a 55% cut by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, and China and India continue to invest in coal. “Certainly, the secretary general will be leaning in to have those conversations with countries like the UK, the US, China, many [others]. It doesn’t stop,” Mohammed told the Guardian. “We have to keep them in the room [discussing climate action]. We need to get out of everyone the best of the ambition that is expected from us.” She said backsliding was a problem. “We have to call that out and it has to reverse itself. There is a lot of it. And this is what brings more mistrust into the room, that suddenly the goalposts may be changing.” Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN’s top climate official, said in the same interview: “Those [countries] who have the ability to go further, fastest [on cutting emissions] must, and those that can, that aren’t – I think they’re already being called out.” The Cop28 meeting will take place at a time of rising global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mohammed said the climate summit was happening “in very difficult times”, but called on countries to put these tensions aside for the two-week Dubai meeting. “[We need] the signals that come from ministers, to give negotiators a green light to bring ambition into this and find solutions. It’s very easy not to find the solutions and to get lost in the geopolitical tensions that are around. But if we could get leadership [from heads of government], we could probably get a lot done,” she said. Stiell added: “We know what needs to be done, we know how it needs to be done. It does boil down to this well-worn phrase of the political will to actually action the elements that are on the table, that are being negotiated right now. It’s turning those words to action, and it’s incumbent on every minister that will be participating in Cop28 and every head of state.” He said countries must reduce emissions far faster: “Parties cannot wait, the science tells us that very clearly. They are moving too slowly.” Sunak will face a difficult summit at Cop28, given doubts over the UK’s commitments. King Charles is to make a keynote address to the summit, at the request of the hosts. He takes a keen interest in the climate talks, and hosted the Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, at a public reception and private meeting in Buckingham Palace earlier this year. Claire Coutinho, the UK’s energy security and net zero secretary, will attend Cop28, the government confirmed. She said: “No major economy has cut emissions faster than the UK. We’re proud that we’ve overdelivered on every target to cut our emissions to date. “However, tackling climate change is a global challenge, as the UK only accounts for 1% of worldwide emissions. I look forward to representing the UK at Cop28, where we will be working to get more progress around the world on green finance, forests, and clean energy. In the UK, we have more ambitious climate change targets than our peers and we will be using what we have learned to help others on our shared path to net zero.”",Climate crisis; Cop28; Cop27; Cop26; Environment; United Nations; Rishi Sunak; UK news; Politics; Fossil fuels,Environment
2023-10-05T16:06:39Z,Delayed consultation on net zero construction ‘a blow to UK homeowners’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/05/delayed-consultation-on-net-zero-construction-a-blow-to-uk-homeowners,"Delays to the government’s planned consultation on net zero regulations for housebuilding will mean more households being hit with hefty bills for energy, housing experts have said. The future homes standard (FHS), which will stipulate that housebuilders construct new homes to be low carbon, was supposed to be opened for consultation in March, but that slipped to a promise of publication in the summer. At the Tory party conference this week Martin Callanan, the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, told a private gathering that the consultation would not be out until next year. This was later clarified to promise an opening of the consultation by the end of this year. Lord Callanan tweeted: “The government will publish the consultation on the future homes standard for new homes this year. We will implement the FHS in 2025, ensuring new homes are ready for net zero.” The delay would cause further problems for homeowners, said Juliet Phillips, senior policy adviser at the thinktank E3G. “The standard is an essential tool for ensuring all new homes are warm, healthy and highly efficient. Delay to the consultation, which was originally due this spring, had led to concern that the standard had been kicked into the long grass. As a vital policy for ensuring all new homes are green and cheap to run, any further delay to the standard would be costly for homeowners – and the planet.” Louise Hutchins, head of policy at the UK Green Building Council, added: “The best developers have spent years and millions gearing up for modern green building standards. This continued delay and uncertainty on new higher standards only benefits those who took a punt that the government would drag its feet on tackling the climate emergency.” An investigation by the Guardian this week found that housebuilders had benefited by at least £15bn over the last eight years by not having to construct homes to low-carbon standards. Installing heat pumps, solar panels and high-grade insulation on homes while building them is much less expensive than retrofitting them later. But if homes are built to these standards, the costs, which were roughly £5,000 a house before the Covid-19 pandemic and are now about £8,000 a house, are borne by the housebuilder. About 1.5m homes are estimated to have been built without these low-carbon fittings since 2015, when the Conservative government scrapped the zero carbon homes standard. Abandoning the standard has saved housebuilders £15bn by the most conservative estimate. The cost of retrofitting these homes is likely to reach £30bn to £45bn, and will fall on homeowners or taxpayers. Housebuilders and property developers are among the biggest donors to the Tory party. The same Guardian investigation also found that at least 10% of donations to the party since 2010 had come from the sector. Opposition parties called the findings a scandal. Helen Morgan, communities and local government spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “The Conservatives have proven time and again that they cannot be trusted with protecting our environment. “They have bent over backwards for their developer donors and delayed vital measures to cut bills. All these delays will ensure are higher energy bills for years to come and yet more families having to choose between heating and eating.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “Just as the government slashes vital environmental regulations and kicks low-carbon building measures into the long grass, tens of millions of pounds find their way into Tory coffers. This vicious cycle will destroy nature and frustrate progress on the climate emergency when it’s needed more than ever.” She added: “We know every home has the potential to be its own power station – with mandatory solar panels on all suitable new roofs, insulation and energy efficiency measures providing people with warm homes and cheap energy bills. If the government won’t enforce those regulations, it should make way for one which will.” Hutchins said that seeking further delays to the future homes standard could backfire on the housing industry. “Those who have been secretly lobbying the government behind the scenes for delays, or even scrapping a move to better standards, risk turning public opinion against the industry as the water companies have done so spectacularly,” she said. Phillips, of E3G, called for the new future homes standard to come as soon as possible. “We’ve already had to wait a decade for the government to bring forward a new standard to ensure new buildings are fit for the future. Any further delay would be unacceptable,” she said.

2023-09-13T19:31:24Z,Tory plans to rip up river pollution rules in tatters after two defeats in Lords,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/13/tory-plans-rip-up-river-pollution-rules-in-tatters-after-two-defeats-in-lords,"Ministers’ plans to weaken river pollution rules are in tatters after they suffered two defeats in the House of Lords. Labour had made clear that it would oppose the “reckless” plans by the Conservatives to rip up EU-derived laws on nutrient neutrality, which force developers to mitigate pollution from new developments. Because the attempt to scrap the rules by the Tories was introduced at a late stage in the passage of the levelling up and regeneration bill, it will not return to the Commons, leaving the government with its policy in disarray. Craig Bennett, of the Wildlife Trusts, welcomed Labour’s decision to oppose the attempts to scrap the nutrient neutrality rules, which meant a government defeat was inevitable. “The government was proposing the most significant weakening of environmental legislation in 30 years, and it was crucial that Labour stepped up not just to stop it, but also to expose the utterly false choice between housing and pollution that Rishi Sunak was offering,” he said. “The millions of people that are fed up of the pollution in our rivers will be very grateful.” Michael Gove, the housing secretary, and Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, had pushed for the end of what they termed “defective” EU laws, which require developers to offset any extra nutrient pollution they cause in sensitive areas under the habitats directive. These areas include the Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. This came despite Tory promises not to weaken environmental standards after Brexit and amid fury over the state of English rivers, not one of which passes tests for safe levels of chemical or biological pollution. The Guardian revealed this week that the government ignored its own nature watchdog’s advice on scrapping the pollution rules. Correspondence from Natural England to Lady Young of Old Scone, a Scottish Labour member of the house, showed that the nature watchdog had said the rule changes were not necessary and that the current scheme was working to deliver homes and reduce nutrients. The advice from Natural England recommends making developers pay for the pollution: “Our experience in similar schemes suggests that upfront, fixed-rate contributions from developers could be faster and offer more certainty in enabling planning permissions to be granted and support emerging green finance markets.” After the government’s plan was defeated on Wednesday night, Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “We are delighted that Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green party all recognise that sustainable development and nature protection can go hand in hand. The government’s old-fashioned approach to development by deregulation has no place in a nature-positive parliament.” Labour’s deputy leader and the shadow deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, said the defeat in the Lords showed “the Tories have utterly failed in their attempt to score cheap political points with a flawed plan … We stand ready to sit down with the government, housebuilders and environmental groups to agree on a workable solution to build the homes we need.” The attempt to ease the rules, by amending the levelling up and regeneration bill, was defeated by 203 votes to 156, a majority of 47. The Green party peer Jenny Jones, who helped to lead the rebellion in the Lords, said: “If the government are so desperate to add to the unacceptable levels of pollution in the water, they can bring the measures back in a separate bill, as part of the king’s speech. “They can then consult properly and justify it to a public who are already fed up with polluted local rivers and beaches. And If I was prime minister, I wouldn’t relish having a conversation with King Charles about the horrendous state of the country’s waterways.” At prime minister’s questions earlier, Rishi Sunak said Labour under Keir Starmer could not be trusted to build more homes. He said Labour’s opposition to the government’s plans was “typical of the principles-free, conviction-free type of leadership that he offers”. “Flip-flopping from being a builder to a blocker,” Sunak said. “The British people can’t trust a word he says.” But the opposition leader’s spokesperson rejected the charge, saying the government’s plans were “rushed and flawed”.",Rivers; Pollution; House of Lords; Conservatives; Labour; Environment; Politics; Wildlife; Michael Gove; Natural England; UK news,Environment
2021-03-28T13:50:15Z,Nigel Farage appointed to advisory board of green finance firm,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/28/nigel-farage-appointed-to-advisory-board-of-green-finance-firm,"He has criticised Greta Thunberg for “alarmism” and wind power as “economic insanity” – but Nigel Farage appears to have made a U-turn on climate change, after signing up as a lobbyist for a Dutch green finance firm, in his first commercial role outside frontline politics. Dutch Green Business Group, which is listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange, said it had appointed Farage to its new advisory board. The eurosceptic and former Ukip leader will “facilitate introductions to politicians and business leaders in the UK and around the world” while also acting as a spokesman for the company, it said in a press release. Farage left formal electoral politics earlier this month after stepping down as leader of his new party, Reform UK. Since Brexit he has tried to forge a portfolio career that has included providing investment tips and recording paid-for video messages via an online platform. His new employer, which aims to plant trees to capture carbon, is part of the rapidly growing but controversial carbon offsetting industry. Carbon offsetting theoretically allows polluting activities to be “carbon neutral”, but many environmental campaigners argue that it offers a front for polluters to continue their business without directly addressing their emissions. Farage’s new employers claim on their website that they will “harness free market forces and the access to capital needed to rapidly accelerate the reforestation of Earth”. Reforestation “represents an exciting opportunity for the capital markets and for private individuals”, according to the website. It added that it will “act in great service to all life and to the Creator”. Farage has a long record of scepticism about climate action. In 2013, he told the European parliament that “we may have made one of the biggest and most stupid collective mistakes in history by getting so worried about global warming”. Contradicting the overwhelming consensus of the global scientific community as well as international bodies such as the United Nations, Farage claimed that “science was not settled” on the climate, and said that “measures we are taking to combat what may or not be a problem are damaging our citizens”. He has also criticised “alarmism” in comments on the need for climate action from Prince Charles and Thunberg, the activist. Yet in 2019, Thunberg’s campaigning – the “Greta effect” – was itself credited by another carbon offsetting group with driving significant increases in business as people and companies sought to minimise their climate impact. Farage has since blamed the “explosion” of the population in countries such as China for increasing global emissions, rather than the generally higher per capita emissions of citizens of richer countries. Under Farage’s leadership Ukip consistently argued against climate action. Farage himself has repeatedly criticised UK investments in wind power, describing it as “collective economic insanity”. Selwyn Duijvestijn, Dutch Green Business’s chief executive, said: “We have not engaged Nigel for his political contacts. We have brought him in because of his unique abilities to communicate relevant ideas to a global audience.” Dutch Green Business lists one reforestation project on its website, the Miro Sustainable Plantation project in northern Sierra Leone. In an update on Sunday, the company said it was also looking at a possible project in Paraguay. Farage, who was a commodities trader before taking up his political career, said carbon offsetting was “rapidly transforming the financial dynamics of the green arena”. “I know I can make a real difference to the speed and progress of this ambitious business which is delivering unique free market, nature-based solutions,” he said.",Nigel Farage; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Netherlands; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Europe; UK news; Business,Politics
2023-09-12T11:00:28Z,Ministers ignored Natural England’s advice on plans to rip up pollution laws ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/12/ministers-ignored-natural-england-advice-plans-rip-up-pollution-laws,"The government ignored its nature watchdog’s advice in weakening rules on pollution from housebuilders in England, the Guardian can reveal. Michael Gove, the housing secretary, and Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, recently announced they would be ending what they termed “defective” EU laws, which require developers to offset any extra nutrient pollution they cause in sensitive areas, under the habitats directive. These areas include the Lake District and Norfolk Broads. Ministers are aiming to remove the legal requirement via an amendment in the House of Lords, which requires local authorities to ignore potential pollution risks when approving developments. It will be debated on Wednesday. Gove and Coffey’s amendment proposes that instead of forcing housebuilders to invest in local wetland sites to soak up any extra sewage pollution and mitigate damage, this legal requirement would be scrapped and taxpayer money would instead be used to double the funds for a scheme by Natural England to reduce nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates in waterways. These nutrients choke the life out of rivers and cause damaging algal blooms. Despite the increase in funding to Natural England, no officials from the quango came forward to endorse the announcement at the time. Now correspondence from the nature watchdog to Lady Barbara Young of Old Scone, a Scottish Labour member of the house, shows the watchdog said the rule changes were not necessary and that the current scheme was working to deliver homes and reduce nutrients. The advice from Natural England recommends making developers pay for the pollution: “Our experience in similar schemes suggests that upfront, fixed-rate contributions from developers could be faster and offer more certainty in enabling planning permissions to be granted and support emerging green finance markets.” It also said the European Union habitats regulations, which were carried over into UK law after Brexit, and which this amendment would undermine, had worked in delivering homes and reducing pollution. “There are a number of well-established schemes that implement the [habitats regulations] with regard to housing, where a case by case approach has been replaced by a more strategic scheme – familiar cases include the Thames Basin Heaths scheme, mitigating housing pressure operating across 13 local planning authorities, and the national district level licensing scheme which has replaced the need for individual newt licence solutions for great crested newts.” Natural England pointed out that its nutrient mitigation scheme had thus far offered credits to developers to enable more than 3,500 homes and two temporary prisons, with a pipeline of schemes for a further 4,500 homes in place for this financial year. It said that in total all providers across England had created sufficient mitigation for approximately 16,000 homes, with a well-advanced pipeline to enable an additional 35,000 new homes. Although the government said current rules choked small and medium housebuilders, Natural England said the scheme “has deliberately prioritised [small and medium-sized] housebuilders, so for example in the Tees catchment we were able to meet demand for credits for all small developments (50 homes or less)”. Despite this advice, the government went ahead with plans for the amendment. Wildlife groups have accused ministers of ignoring Natural England. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The government brought forward outrageous plans to weaken environmental law in the final stages of the levelling up bill, without any public consultation. Now it is plain that they have ignored their own advisers as well. The result is poorly conceived plans that will not work, but will leave lasting damage to rivers and to UK environmental protection.” Dr Richard Benwell, the chief executive of the environmental coalition Wildlife and Countryside Link, added: “Natural England’s advice reveals that this regression – which would expose protected river habitats to more pollution, while letting polluters off the hook – is totally unwarranted. Environmental charities are united in opposition to these plans, and we hope all parliamentarians who care about rivers and nature will resist them.” Peers are trying to squash the bill. The Duke of Wellington, a crossbench peer, has laid an amendment that would nullify the government’s one, and he has support from other Tories. Lady Jenny Jones of the Green party is hoping to force a vote against Gove and Coffey’s amendment which would delete it from the bill. The Office for Environmental Protection has also written to the secretaries of state, calling the move a “regression” in environmental standards. Young added: “The government’s proposal would force local authorities to ignore pollution, even when it is plain to see. In the process, it would take a wrecking ball to the habitats regulations, the UK’s most important nature laws. The advice I have received from Natural England shows that both are unnecessary and that effective other measures are available to release much needed houses and protect their environment. I plan to oppose these provisions when they come to parliament tomorrow.” A government spokesperson acknowledged Natural England had suggested alternatives to ripping up the EU-derived law and said: “We believe the approach we are taking will best deliver our objectives of unlocking much needed homes, continuing to offset the small amount of additional nutrient pollution caused by new housing, and shifting our focus from mitigation to site restoration. Over 100,000 homes are held up due to retained EU laws and will be unblocked between now and 2030, delivering an estimated £18bn boost to the economy while protecting the environment.”",Pollution; Housing; Construction industry; Michael Gove; Thérèse Coffey; Rivers; England; Business; Communities; UK news; Politics; Environment,Environment
2023-07-21T13:03:52Z,Tories and big business are in the driver's seat on climate action. Here’s what the left must do | Richard Power Sayeed,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/tories-big-business-climate-action-left-market-eco-friendly-policies,"Earlier this week, 100-odd energy companies sent a letter warning the prime minister that his lack of new climate policies will threaten their profit margins. Then, the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, announced a new attempt to end the de-facto ban on onshore wind energy in England, and Liz Truss backed him. Neither of these calls made a huge splash in the news, because big business and rightwingers calling for green policy is no longer news. Instead, this is what normal looks like when capitalism starts to go green. The response from the left is often dismissive: social democrats warn that citizens won’t let governments push through climate policy unless it’s redistributive – a so-called just transition – while socialists have a long list of reasons why, despite some concessions, capital ultimately won’t give up its carbon addiction. Both insist that if we are going to avoid climate catastrophe, we need an enormous transfer of wealth from the richest in society to everyone else, as well as a transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. That’s the green new deal. But the widespread fear that political leaders will do nothing to stop global heating isn’t proving true. The energy transition is accelerating, with one influential report this month arguing that the Cop28 goal to triple renewables capacity by 2030 is within reach. The idea that capitalism can’t stop the climate crisis no longer looks certain. But now we face a new problem: the climate action that’s happening is unmistakably inequitable. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s extension of tax credits, US taxpayers are effectively subsidising the dividends of clean energy’s wealthy investors. China’s solar energy miracle is bound up with economic growth and a political system that are both brutally unequal. The EU’s clean energy deal is ambitious but shifts some of the costs to poorer households. And these inequalities are both a reason that green finance is potentially lucrative and why it’s expanding so rapidly. So we’re going green, but we’re not getting a new deal. This is a huge missed opportunity. Because, while conservatives like Zac Goldsmith often claim that the market is facilitating this transition, it’s really the state that’s doing the heavy lifting. Around the world, governments have taken on the financial risk of the transition and are often funding it as well. But too often they refuse to leverage this. They don’t demand, say, that new green jobs are unionised, or mandate a reasonable ratio between the pay of workers and bosses. This is where the left must focus, with a relentless demand for better jobs, higher wages, lower consumer prices and maximum fairness. If we lose that argument for equality, then so much is at risk. I think about the small town in Lebanon where I lived and worked in the late 2000s. On arriving, I was struck by how many car mechanics there were, but I quickly realised that wasn’t really so surprising. If public transport is always a bus, commercial haulage is always a lorry and individuals generally get around in shared taxis or on mopeds, then on many streets every other shop front is going to be a mechanic. It’s the same across most middle-income countries – and also parts of the US. Picture the people who work in those garages. Picture their dependants and their suppliers. If the energy transition happens without historically unprecedented levels of economic redistribution – which is not what we’ll get if we carry on sliding into green state capitalism – then those people’s incomes will be devastated. Electric vehicles rely heavily on computers and new battery technology, so any significant repair job means a trip not to a local mechanic that’s run by your neighbours but to a corporate garage that’s staffed by digital experts. Faced with the prospect of a deeply unequal energy transition, some people will feel relief: at least it would mean humanity escaping climate catastrophe. But consider the disruption that those car mechanics will experience, and imagine it affecting sector after sector, across the world and over a period of just three decades or so. The appalling levels of unemployment it would unleash, the macroeconomic impact that would have and the terrible upheaval it would trigger. The backlash will be long, but its main consequence won’t be coalmines or carbon-intensive plants reopening. That’s too expensive. Instead, governments will send in the troops. Think of Kazakhstan last year. After fuel price controls were abolished there was massive popular unrest and the prime minister was removed. But Russian troops propped up the regime – and in the long term the price controls were abolished. We have been warned about an “eco-fascist” future of murderous borders intended to repel the projected 1 billion climate refugees – and those border policies are well under way. But we also need to sound the alarm about a different looming disaster: governments using violence to impose mitigation measures that create profit for some and misery for the rest. You could call it eco-authoritarianism. The good news is that we already have a solution. After all, there existed for much of the 20th century capitalist societies whose interventionist governments led rapid economic change, and which had strong trade unions, generous welfare states and robust political participation. They were called social democracies. We previously wondered how governments could solve the climate crisis, and now we also have to ask how they can achieve that without creating new problems. So the question has changed, but the answer is the same: we need a green new deal.

2023-07-18T05:00:46Z,Locals in this British seaside town could revolutionise green energy – if the government lets them | Rebecca Willis,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/18/british-seaside-town-revolutionise-green-energy,"The seaside town of Whitehaven, in the north-west of England, found itself at the centre of a political storm in May, when the levelling up, housing and communities secretary, Michael Gove, gave his approval for the UK’s first new deep coalmine in more than 40 years just outside the town. But Whitehaven may soon be known for more than climate-wrecking coal. That is the ambition of Project Collette, a £3bn proposal for a windfarm off the Cumbrian coast to be part-owned by the local community – instigated by the Green Finance Community Hub in collaboration with the engineering firm Arup and community energy specialists Energy4All – and with the potential to power nearby industry. If Cumbrians could stand on the sandstone cliffs and look out at wind turbines they owned, and that had provided jobs for local people, that might just build the political support and engagement that is so vital to reaching our climate targets? People worry about the climate crisis. It regularly features in opinion polls covering respondents’ top concerns. But in more in-depth discussions with people, my research team at Lancaster University have discovered a vicious circle at play. The more people learn about the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, the more they look to the government for leadership. Yet they tell us they don’t have confidence that the government will provide that leadership. There is a danger that people fall into a fatalism trap: it’s too big for me alone, they say, and yet I don’t believe politicians will step up. There is a route out of this trap. Politicians need to put forward bold policies for the climate that link to people’s aspirations and provide tangible benefits, such as local jobs. If they did that, our research suggests that people would both reward them and step up to the mark themselves to work toward local solutions. That’s where ventures such as Project Collette come in. Imagine increasing the supply of zero-carbon electricity through solar farms and wind turbines that are part-owned by local people or local councils. Green jobs would no longer be something dreamed up by Westminster thinktanks, but tangible, visible schemes employing you or your neighbour. The locally owned profits could be invested in local priorities, like insulation schemes for all homes and improved green spaces. Locally controlled renewables would also help ease people’s concerns about nearby developments. A strong majority of the population supports wind power and other renewables. But research indicates that people’s support does not only depend on whether they like the look of the technology, but on whether they have a say in planning local schemes, and who they think is benefiting from the project. This vision is a stark contrast to how the energy sector is run at the moment, dominated as it is by commercial energy companies with distant headquarters. Under our hyper-liberalised market, community involvement is just about possible – if you are very determined. The UK’s first community-owned windfarm, Baywind, was built more than 25 years ago in 1997, just down the coast from Whitehaven. More recently, Bristol city council backed a successful proposal to build another community-led wind project in deprived Lawrence Weston. But it’s unbelievably difficult for non-profits to navigate the treacherous route through the planning system, financing and complex regulatory requirements. As a result, examples such as the above are the exception, not the rule. They make up a tiny fraction of total output. Under the current system, Project Collette may never be more than a pipe dream. It’s hardly surprising, then, that the Labour party has seized on the need for reform. When Keir Starmer launched his climate plans in June, buried beneath the headline policies was an intriguing “local power plan” that would make initiatives like Project Collette mainstream. Under its proposals, the publicly owned GB Energy would partner with communities and private developers to finance local energy projects, with communities owning a share and the profits ploughed back. This should have broad cross-party support. Back in 2014, at the request of Ed Davey, then a minister in the coalition government, I co-chaired a taskforce looking into how the government could encourage, or require, commercial companies to offer a share in ownership to local people. We developed a good plan that the government accepted as part of a wider package of support for community energy. But events, not least the 2015 election, the backbench Conservative rebellion against windfarms and then the Brexit wranglings, overtook us, and the opportunity was lost. Since then, such community projects have stalled. What better way for any government to demonstrate that it is putting its trust in people than giving them a direct say in decision-making? In 2020, the UK parliament’s own climate assembly proved the value of involving citizens in developing plans for net zero. Brussels and Milan now have their own permanent citizens’ assemblies to help take decisions on climate. The UK could be the first country to create a permanent assembly to advise on net zero, as part of wider plans for constitutional reform. To the people of Whitehaven, net zero, not to mention green jobs, seem like distant, abstract concepts, compared with the very tangible, if controversial, offer of jobs in coal mining. If we are to maintain and build political and public support for climate action, we need to focus on interventions that benefit people and place. I look forward to standing on those Cumbrian cliffs and seeing the turbines of Project Collette turning in the steady sea breeze.

2023-03-30T15:44:34Z,UK energy strategy casts doubt on Drax’s carbon capture project,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/30/uk-energy-strategy-casts-doubt-on-drax-carbon-capture-project,"The energy company Drax will immediately enter talks with the government after its energy strategy cast doubt over its £2bn carbon capture project and plunged the company’s share price into turmoil. The government’s wide-ranging plan to secure Britain’s energy supplies inadvertently raised questions about the future of one of the country’s biggest electricity generators after appearing to rule out the project to capture carbon emissions at the Drax biomass plant in North Yorkshire from the race for subsidies. The company suffered one of the biggest falls on the FTSE 250 as shares tumbled 12% on Thursday morning. However, Drax assured investors that it would enter formal bilateral talks with the government immediately to “move the project forward”. Drax chief executive, Will Gardiner, told investors that the government planned to expand the “Track 1” process later this year, and that its project would be eligible. Funding for the carbon capture project is considered crucial in securing future revenues for Drax beyond 2027 when its existing subsidy for burning wood pellets in its power plant will come to an end. However, a delay in joining the Track 1 process could still leave a funding gap until 2030. The energy security and net zero minister Graham Stuart said in parliament on Thursday that the government “totally understands that we need to work with Drax on a bridging option between 2027 and 2030 and the secretary of state has charged our officials working with Drax on what those options look like”. The share price losses were quickly wiped out, and the stock rose 6% after the assurances. The strategy named eight carbon capture projects in the first track of a government subsidy scheme which could begin trapping and storing carbon emissions from 2027; including three in Teesside and five in the north-west of England and north Wales, but leaving out Drax’s project in the Humber. Ministers are under pressure to cut subsidies for biomass generators amid growing concern that burning wood to generate electricity is far from green and may even increase CO2 emissions. The government also named 20 hydrogen projects which will receive funding awards including three spear-headed by Scottish Power and two for SSE. Drax’s market turmoil emerged as leading business groups criticised the government plan for its lack of clarity and ambition in accelerating Britain’s green industries. The government published multiple policy papers, totalling 1,000 pages, but many of the strategies set out had been previously announced, and much of the government spending had already been committed. “Despite the volume and detail of today’s announcements, there is nothing obvious within these plans which matches the ambition of the US’s Inflation Reduction Act,” said Alexandra Hall-Chen, a policy adviser at the Institute of Directors. “It remains an open question as to whether the UK can offer the incentives for green investment that can sustain it as a leader in the global green economy.” The government’s document deluge includes separate but interconnected plans to secure energy supplies, reduce carbon emissions to net zero, and establish the UK as a leading centre for green finance. The government has launched a consultation on plans to require all large companies with more than 500 employees or £500m in turnover to disclose their plans to reach net zero. Currently the Financial Conduct Authority requires listed companies and large asset owners to disclose their plans, but the government stipulation would level the playing field across the economy to make it easier for investors to make greener decisions. James Fotherby, a policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, described the decision as “encouraging” and urged the government to “provide a clear timetable and further details on the implementation of the sustainability disclosure requirements to tackle greenwashing and inform investors’ financial decisions”.",Drax; Energy industry; Biomass and bioenergy; Renewable energy; UK news; Energy; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Yorkshire,Business
2023-02-26T18:30:27Z,The Guardian view on Germany’s economic miracle: it was built on debt relief | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-economic-miracle-it-was-built-on-debt-relief,"Seventy years ago this Monday, the London Debt Agreement saw half of Germany’s (then West Germany’s) borrowings, accumulated after two world wars, written off. The debt cancellation, worth more than a fifth of national GDP, was driven by the United States, the UK and France. Eventually, South American, Asian and African nations signed up – including, in a bitter twist of history, colonial precursors of today’s bankrupts. Germany’s economic miracle was built on debt relief. Unlike today, Germany was allowed to repay a large part of its debts in its national currency. Meanwhile, the cost of servicing the country’s external debt was capped at 5% of export revenues. In 2021, the comparable figure was 16% for poor, indebted nations – money that should be used for schools and hospitals. Creditors in the 1950s were expected to take a haircut if the German economy faltered. The country was allowed to industrialise by replacing imports with home-manufactured goods, while creditor nations agreed to reduce their own exports. Unlike the current International Monetary Fund bailouts, West Germany’s state was allowed to get bigger. Social welfare spending zoomed upwards. Wealthy nations put the Wunder into postwar Wirtschaftswunder. They are either the most important creditors, or home to the most important creditors, for poor countries. The institutions they run – the World Bank and the IMF – only began forgiving poor nation debts, with strings attached, in the late 1990s. Yet the generosity shown to Germany is denied to today’s developing nations. There is no space for them to regain industrial strength and control. Firms in the global north make windfall profits in global manufacturing, even though they rarely make the products. The big powers aren’t in a hurry to encourage poorer countries to develop away from sectors such as agriculture and mining, where bountiful surpluses are extracted by rich-world multinationals. Europe was integrated through trade – with the anti-Soviet West Germany at its core – yet, in Latin America and Africa, outside powers seek the opposite outcome through bilateral trade agreements. It’s no surprise that impoverished nations end up stuck in development dead ends. The secret of making poor nations rich has been known since Henry VII, in 15th-century England, began taxing the export of raw wool to subsidise the manufacture of woollen textiles. Poor countries face a hostile political and economic environment. With the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, their currencies are depreciating, making it harder for developing nations to purchase goods priced in dollars and pay back dollar-denominated loans. Rebeca Grynspan, of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, has warned that such “debts will never be realistically repayable” – with G20 restructuring talks this weekend deadlocked. Poor nations face too high a cost for the climate emergency that the rich world created. Countries should be spending cash to indigenise production, while keeping within planetary boundaries. Instead, they are trapped into shelling out vast sums to their creditors. What would help them is unconditional debt relief and adequate grant-based green finance. Private bondholders, not China, would be the biggest losers. Banks, institutional funds and investors advanced $250bn to the 55 most climate vulnerable countries, while Beijing lent $47bn. Bonds are governed by either English or New York law – and the UK and US should pass legislation requiring bondholders to take part in internationally agreed debt relief. The globalisation currently being orchestrated by the world’s richest countries is suffocating poor nations. What the German experience revealed is that removing the economic straitjacket would allow developing countries to breathe again.",Debt relief; Germany; Africa; International Monetary Fund (IMF); Climate aid; Economics; Global economy,Opinion
2023-02-18T19:00:06Z,NSW Labor pledges $1bn state-owned investment company for renewable projects if elected,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/19/nsw-labor-pledges-1bn-state-owned-investment-company-for-renewable-projects-if-elected,"A New South Wales Labor government would create a $1bn state-owned energy security company to drive investment in renewable energy projects and lower prices in the state, the party’s leader, Chris Minns, has said. On Sunday, Labor will pledge to establish a NSW “energy security corporation”, an investment vehicle for renewable energy projects in the state, should the party win the 24 March state election. The promise comes a day after the Coalition announced a “clean energy superpower fund”, which includes money already announced to upgrade the transmission network and energy storage, plus $23 million for new rooftop solar and small-scale batteries. Labor’s NSW ESC will be funded initially via $1bn from the existing Restart NSW fund, and will partner with industry on projects including renewable storage such as pumped hydro, commercially-viable technologies to provide grid stability, and community batteries. It will operate similarly to the federal government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup NSW Labor has said industry had sought government certainty in helping meeting the 2030 targets set under the Coalition government’s $32bn Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap to have five renewable energy zones up and running by 2030, with 2GW of storage. “We want the state to be able to invest in solutions that ensure reliability in the system and keep the lights on and create new jobs for the state,” Minns said in a statement. “Privatisation does not work. It has been a disaster for New South Wales and under Labor it stops. “This is not a Band-Aid solution. Whilst it will take time for the benefits to be realised, this is a serious, long-term step towards fixing the mess left by the Liberal-National government.” The ESC will be different from the re-establishment of the Victorian State Electricity Commission (SEC) announced by premier Daniel Andrews prior to the Victorian state election in November last year. The SEC will own its renewable energy assets, while the role of the ESC will be to provide finance and in some cases partner with the private sector on projects. The Clean Energy Council said New South Wales Labor’s announcement is striking the right balance. “We would expect that by targeting areas of reliability, affordability and medium- to long-term storage, the public-sector contributions by the NSW Energy Security Corporation will help lower power prices, create jobs, keep the lights on and reduce our emissions,’ CEO Kane Thornton said. “We are in a global clean energy arms race. The world has changed markedly in just six months, global competition for green finance, equipment and human capital is intensifying, and we will need to boldly assert ourselves to secure a share of this massive green growth opportunity.” On Saturday, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced the establishment of a $1.5bn clean energy superpower fund, and an additional $23m in investments under the roadmap for rooftop solar and small-scale batteries. The NSW treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, said investment in rooftop solar and batteries are a “no-brainer” to drive down energy bills, and will make it easier for homes to export energy to the grid. “The clean energy superpower fund will bust through these constraints, helping to roll out the storage and network infrastructure that the grid needs to unlock the renewable energy of the future.”",NSW election 2023; New South Wales politics; Australia news; Chris Minns; Labor party; Renewable energy; Energy,Australia news
2022-05-02T10:12:29Z,Sunak urged to issue green bonds with higher returns if climate goals missed,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/sunak-green-bonds-higher-returns-climate-goals,"Rishi Sunak is being urged to issue a new generation of green bonds that would offer higher returns to investors if the UK government fails to hit its climate change targets. The Social Market Foundation (SMF) said its plan for sustainability-linked bonds would provide ministers with a greater incentive to meet carbon-reduction goals and would help boost the UK’s prospects of being a global financial hub for green finance. A report to be published on Tuesday by the thinktank calls on the chancellor to follow the example of Chile, the first country to peg the borrowing costs on its government debt to tackling global heating. Scott Corfe, the research director at the SMF, said: “Financial services will be key for delivering on net zero, and green finance could be one of Britain’s great economic success stories in the 2020s. Already, 200,000 financial services workers are in green jobs – a number that will undoubtedly grow over the coming years. “Government needs to work in partnership with the financial services industry to make Britain the leading hub of sustainability-linked finance. Leading by example, the chancellor should issue a new generation of sustainability-linked government bonds which would tie interest payments to the country’s net zero targets. Not only would this support green financial services but the prospect of financial penalties for missing net zero targets would strengthen the government’s commitment to decarbonisation.” Corfe said Sunak should start small in order to test investor interest but added the Chilean example suggested demand would be high. In March, Chile issued a $2bn (£1.6bn) sustainability-linked bond, which was four times oversubscribed. Returns to investors depend on the country adhering to its climate change pledges, including that it emits no more than 95 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent by 2030, and renewables account for 60% of electricity production by 2032. If Chile misses a target, it incurs a financial penalty. Sunak is keen for London to be a centre for green finance and last year announced a programme under which the proceeds from green bonds would be used for environmental projects. The Treasury says two bond issues had already raised £16bn but it would need to be confident new forms of funding would result in strong, sustained demand and represent value for money to taxpayers. “The UK is a world leader in green finance and the chancellor set out a clear pathway at Cop26 for the UK to become the world’s first net zero-aligned financial centre,” a Treasury spokesman said. The SMF said issuing a sustainability-linked bond would show the government was “fully committed” to decarbonisation. The threat of financial penalties for overpromising and underdelivering could prove “a powerful way of holding government true to its word on net zero”. The interest rate, or coupon, on a standard government bond is set when it is auctioned to investors, with the interest rates on index-linked bonds adjusting in line with inflation.",Rishi Sunak; Business; Climate crisis; Green economy; Environment; Politics; UK news; Chile; Government borrowing,Politics
2022-12-11T14:00:35Z,Albanese government looking at laws to force big business to disclose climate efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/12/albanese-government-looking-at-laws-to-force-big-business-to-disclose-climate-efforts,"Banks and other big businesses will be forced to come clean with the public about what they are doing to cut emissions under plans put forward by the Albanese government. The government is also looking for ways to crack down on “greenwashing” – or when businesses try to win over consumers by overhyping their environmental practices. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will say in a speech in Sydney on Monday that Australian firms “need to make credible disclosures to remain competitive in global capital markets”. “There’s now broad acceptance that proper disclosure of these financial risks and impacts isn’t a nice-to-have extra,” he will say, according to speech notes distributed by his office in advance. “This information is need-to-know – essential to mobilising the weight of our financial system behind the net zero transition.” Treasury will release a consultation paper on Monday on the development of an Australian climate risk disclosure system. The government argues business and investors need clarity and certainty to manage climate risks and invest in new opportunities. It wants large business and financial institutions to provide “more information and greater transparency on how they are responding to climate change and supporting the transition to net zero”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government says the reporting requirements are expected to be mandatory for large entities and phased in over time. It also plans to apply “appropriately tailored requirements to comparable commonwealth public sector corporate entities and investment funds”. The director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change, Erwin Jackson, welcomed Australia “catching up” on climate-related disclosures. He said this could “support the unlocking of the billions of dollars of investment that are going to be needed on the transition to net zero”. Jackson said climate disclosure arrangements in Australia were a “dog’s breakfast”. “We have very large number of companies voluntarily disclosing at the moment but one company discloses one thing and another company discloses another thing and it’s really impossible for investors to get clear information to compare companies,” he said. “The sooner investors have clarity on the robustness of companies’ plans, the sooner they’ll be able to back those companies and industries on delivering the new industries and the new jobs that are going to be created as we address climate change.” The government has also asked Treasury to develop a comprehensive strategy to deepen Australia’s green finance markets and seize opportunities presented by surging global momentum in sustainable finance. Chalmers will say global investors increasingly see “a new harmony between profit and planet”. Australia should respond “by making our country a world leader in sustainable finance, taking a larger slice of the growing green investment pie”, he will tell the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute. Chalmers says the government is focused on “confronting and cracking down on greenwashing – ensuring the credibility of sustainability-related financial targets, products and investments – because credibility is everything”. He flagged the need to “develop coordinated strategies to prevent greenwashing in the corporate sector and financial markets” in a letter to the Council of Financial Regulators. The newly released letter to the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, in his capacity as chair of the CFR also seeks support for “standardised, internationally-aligned climate-related financial disclosure requirements for large businesses and financial institutions”. Treasury has asked for public submissions by 17 February.",Australian politics; Jim Chalmers; Climate crisis; Environment; Australia news; Business; Business; Greenhouse gas emissions,Australia news
2023-03-23T10:00:40Z,London last summer was the trailer for a climate disaster movie. Here’s how to stop that coming true | Sadiq Khan and Chris Skidmore,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/23/london-climate-disaster-sadiq-khan-chris-skidmore,"There is no greater challenge facing our capital, our country and our world than the climate crisis. The only way we can keep the hope of limiting global heating to 1.5C is if we commit to further and faster action as cities and countries. That’s why we must work together wherever possible – across the political divide – to help achieve net zero by cleaning up our rivers and air, insulating our homes, unlocking a revolution in renewable power and ending our toxic reliance on polluting vehicles. Last summer, London faced record-breaking 40C weather, causing wildfires and the busiest day for the London fire brigade since the blitz. The year before, we saw the devastating impact of flooding, leaving tube stations filled with water, roads impassable and people losing their homes. All these things are a trailer for a movie we really don’t want to watch, which is why national and local leadership is so important. The net zero review, published earlier this year, serves as a critical blueprint for success in this mission, and it recognises the important role of local leaders. But the review also made clear that reaching net zero is not just about avoiding climate catastrophe, but about grasping the opportunity to reap the economic benefits of green economic growth. This is especially true of megacities, such as London. London is the capital of green finance and trading and we are both determined to keep London at the forefront of the international climate movement. We want London and the UK to lead the way as much as possible. This includes continuing to leverage the power of the C40 network of global cities to help inspire and spearhead global action. In London, we have already seen significant progress. The city has delivered the largest electric bus fleet in western Europe, seen a fivefold increase in protected cycling lanes since 2016, invested tens of millions in making homes and businesses more energy efficient, and delivered record amounts of investment in green jobs, skills and infrastructure as part of its green new deal. This action has been helped by the certainty of having a legal target to reach net zero in national law, but also because London has been determined to lead the way, bringing forward the net zero target in London to 2030, faster than any comparable city. However, neither of us are under any illusion that achieving our goals will be easy. The same old naysayers in politics and punditry may have stopped overtly questioning the science of climate change, but they remain hostile to the actual action needed to prevent it destroying our world. They are becoming climate delayers. Even with the war in Ukraine revealing another reason to reject fossil fuel reliance, there are still those who seem to think we should shelve plans for our renewable power future. And, in London, the planned expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) – a policy proved to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions – has been attracting extreme opposition from a small group of anti-green campaigners. Of course, there are some Londoners with genuine concerns about Ulez. They are worried about what it could mean for them, particularly during this cost of living crisis. That’s why it’s right that there is help for those who need support, with a large scrappage scheme for low-income Londoners, small businesses, charities and disabled Londoners. Ulez was first introduced in 2019 because it was not acceptable to maintain the status quo of allowing highly polluting vehicles to pump out toxic fumes, leading to premature deaths and a whole range of illnesses. The Ulez so far has ensured 4 million Londoners can breathe cleaner air. We now need to protect the health of all Londoners and reduce carbon emissions further. Of course, this kind of change can be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary if we are to make our cities cleaner, healthier places to live, work and raise a family. The net zero review was clear that tackling the climate crisis and air pollution brings with it multiple benefits, including saving our health and social care sector up to £5.3bn by 2035. Cities around the world are recognising that without action, the welfare of their populations will be increasingly threatened, and London must be no different. We should celebrate the international commitments to tackle climate change that we have agreed in recent years, and we should be proud of the commitments shown by mayors as part of the C40 network of major cities. However, treaties and agreements are just pieces of paper. We always knew that the actual implementation of climate action would be the hard bit, as we are seeing in London now. Rather than backing down, the challenges we face must make us ever more determined to work together, forge cross-party agreement and overcome the influence of the doubters and delayers. As politicians from different political parties, we want to set an example of what’s possible. We want to work together to remind investors that net zero is a huge opportunity, and that London is always open to it. We want to work together to inspire other politicians, at home and abroad, to follow our lead by putting tribal politics to one side. We want to work together so that we don’t let down younger generations who are, rightly, demanding faster action. And we want to work together to prove to our fellow citizens and colleagues that a better way is possible – and that the long-term health of our people and planet can come ahead of short-term politics.

2022-12-01T15:35:54Z,‘Citizen rewilders’ invited to buy shares in Scottish Highlands projects,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/01/citizen-rewilders-invited-to-buy-shares-in-scottish-highlands-projects,"Ordinary people are being invited to invest in projects to rewild the Scottish Highlands by a company that is restoring nature on two estates and seeking to expand its rewilding portfolio. “Citizen rewilders” can invest a minimum of £50 and up to £200,000 in £10 shares in Highlands Rewilding, which hopes to provide a 5% annual return on the investment over 10 years. Since its initial funding by 50 large investors, Highlands Rewilding has purchased two estates: Bunloit, 513 hectares (1,270 acres) of broadleaf woodland and grassland on the banks of Loch Ness; and Beldorney in Aberdeenshire, a 349-hectare riverside site of overgrazed pasture and coniferous plantations. Dr Jeremy Leggett, its founder and chief executive, said: “This seems to be the only way, currently, that Scottish citizens can co-own land where nature recovery is being pursued for profit.” The company, which last month won an RSPB award for its nature recovery work, hopes to generate income primarily from the sale of carbon credits and biodiversity credits, which big corporations are increasingly interested in buying to demonstrate that they are “nature positive”. Other revenue streams include ecotourism, high-value nature-friendly farm produce, and ecobuilding. While there is suspicion that some “green lairds” wish to exclude people from Scottish land to rewild it, Highlands Rewilding says community involvement is a key part of its restorative mission – enabling local people to co-own, work or live on the rewilding land they buy. “We’re hoping in our dreams that there will be lots of sign-up from local communities where we work,” said Leggett. “The mass ownership model that Highlands Rewilding is running is unique and popular. It’s not a corporate thing where a giant company is coming in and buying a massive tract of Scotland.” On Bunloit, the focus is on restoring and creating new broadleaved woodland, while Beldorney is a “blank canvas” for nature recovery, with the removal of non-native conifers and riparian rewilding along the River Deveron. Beldorney also has 10 ruined crofts in which new rural populations could be established. Leggett, a former climate campaigner for Greenpeace who previously led the solar company Solarcentury, hopes to raise £8m to expand its projects and acquire new land. “There’s a cost of living crisis and for citizen rewilders £50 is a lot of money but the big equity investors are now seriously interested in this space,” he said. “By the end of February I’m hopeful we’ll have landed the first serious institutional investment, which would be a gamechanger.” The Green Finance Institute has calculated that there must be £15bn-£27bn of private investment over the next 10 years for the Scottish government to achieve its ambitious carbon and biodiversity targets. “That’s an Everest of a target and we’re not even in the foothills yet but this is an effort to get into the foothills,” said Leggett. According to Leggett, natural capital investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery is at a similar stage to the solar industry just before it took off but with one difference: no corporations are resisting the calls to cut carbon and restore biodiversity. Instead of oil and gas companies, “the incumbents are traditional landowners who have historically done an awful lot to trash biodiversity”, he said. “The zeitgeist from landowners is now, ‘This has got to change.’ Even the estate agents in Scotland are not selling properties anymore based on how many red deer stags you can slaughter, but on their natural capital potential.” The citizen rewilding offer is only available to UK residents, with overseas residents required to offer a minimum investment of £10,000. The Financial Conduct Authority considers investment in Highlands Rewilding to be high-risk because it is a startup business.",Rewilding; Scotland; Investments; Environment; Wildlife; Conservation; UK news; Money,Environment
2023-03-29T23:01:47Z,UK government gambles on carbon capture and storage tech despite scientists’ doubts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/government-gambles-on-carbon-capture-and-storage-tech-despite-scientists-doubts,"The UK government will defy scientific doubts to place a massive bet on technology to capture and store carbon dioxide in undersea caverns, to enable an expansion of oil and gas in the North Sea. Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary, will on Thursday unveil the “powering up Britain” strategy, with carbon capture and storage (CCS) at its heart, during a visit to a nuclear fusion development facility in Oxford. Shapps said the continued production of oil and gas in the North Sea was still necessary, and that the UK had a geological advantage in being able to store most of the carbon likely to be produced in Europe for the next 250 years in the large caverns underneath the North Sea. “Unless you can explain how we can transition [to net zero] without oil and gas, we need oil and gas,” he said. “I am very keen that we fill those cavities with storing carbon. I think there are huge opportunities for us to do that.” Shapps pointed to the £20bn the government is planning to spend over 20 years on developing CCS, which he said would generate new jobs and make the UK a world leader in the technology. Among the 1,000 pages of proposals to be published on Thursday will be boosts for offshore wind, hydrogen, heat pumps and electric vehicles. A green finance strategy, to be set out by the chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, will be aimed at mobilising private-sector money for investments in green industry, and there will be a consultation on carbon border taxes, aimed at penalising the import of high-carbon goods from overseas. But the plans contain no new government spending, and campaigners said they missed out key elements, such as a comprehensive programme of home insulation and a full lifting of the ban on new onshore wind turbines in England. Ministers are also thought to have rejected or modified scores of the 130 policy recommendations made by Tory MP Chris Skidmore in his review of the net-zero strategy, published in January. For instance, oil and gas companies will not be forced to stop flaring, and the ban on sales of new gas boilers from 2035 will not be brought forward. Meanwhile, the government is in the midst of a new licensing round for North Sea oil and gas development, which will run until next June, and oil and gas companies, which have made record profits in recent months, are proposing new developments, encouraged by tax breaks for investment in fossil fuel assets under the windfall tax. Proposals under consideration include a potentially massive new field called Rosebank, which campaigning group Uplift said could receive an effective subsidy of £3.75bn under the windfall tax. Scientists told the Guardian that an overdependence on CCS was ill-advised. More than 700 scientists have written to the prime minister asking him to grant no new oil and gas licences, describing CCS as “yet to be proved at scale”, and the UN secretary-general called on governments last week to stop developing oil and gas. Bob Ward, head of policy at the Grantham Institute, said CCS technology would be needed for certain industries, but that using it to enable the continued use of fossil fuels was a mistake. “What does not make sense is to carry on with further development of new fossil fuel reserves on the assumption that CCS will be available to mop up all the additional emissions. While the costs of CCS will come down, it will make fossil fuel use even more expensive, and it will not eliminate all the risks resulting from the price volatility and energy insecurity of fossil fuels. A successful and competitive economy in the future will be powered by clean and affordable domestic energy, not unreliable and insecure fossils fuels,” he said. “CCS is not required if the government moves to renewables as quickly as possible – especially as I am unaware of any CCS that works,” added Mark Maslin, professor of earth science at UCL. Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate at Manchester, said: “When it comes to energy emissions, the claimed prospect of CCS continues its long-established role in supporting the development of the oil and gas industry and in further delaying real cuts in emissions. Given the huge cost, very high-life cycle emissions and appalling record of working as promised, there is little, if any, merit in pursuing CCS as a major plank of UK energy strategy.” Emily Shuckburgh, director of Cambridge Zero at Cambridge University, who organised the letter by scientists, said: “Advancing CCS is important because there are some sectors that are hard to decarbonise which will require it if we are to rapidly reach net zero. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that the level of greenhouse gas emissions this decade will determine whether temperature rise can be limited to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. In that context, the focus of our energy strategy must be on scaling up proven renewable technologies, developing energy storage, supporting energy efficiency and reducing demand.” The government’s plans could also face legal challenge. The “powering up Britain” strategy is in large part a response to a high court ruling last year, when a judge agreed with campaigners that government policies at the time were inadequate to meet the legally binding commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The court ordered a rethink, with a deadline of the end of this month. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, which led the case, said lawyers would closely examine the documents and return to court if the proposals did not add up. “These plans look half-baked, half-hearted and dangerously lacking ambition,” he warned. “These announcements will do little to boost energy security, lower bills or put us on track to meet climate goals.” Alok Sharma, Tory MP and former president of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, said: “The announcements made are a very welcome step in the right direction and rapid delivery is now vital. However, what we still need to see is that big bazooka moment, commensurate with the scale of the challenge. We cannot afford to wait for the government to set out the UK’s strategic response to green growth initiatives from other nations, like the US Inflation Reduction Act, which is helping to hoover up billions in private-sector investment right now.” • This article was amended on 30 March 2023: an earlier version said that carmakers would not be set a target for the proportion of electric vehicles they sell.

2023-03-24T16:00:24Z,UK planning to launch watered down net zero strategy in oil capital Aberdeen,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/24/uk-government-launch-revamped-net-zero-strategy-oil-gas-capital-aberdeen,"The government is planning to launch its revamped net zero strategy from the UK’s oil and gas capital, Aberdeen, in a clear signal of its intention to boost the fossil fuel industry while cutting key green measures, the Guardian has learned. Next week’s launch was originally called “green day” in Whitehall, but has been rebranded as “energy security day” and will focus on infrastructure. Campaigners have called the move a travesty. Plans to extend offshore drilling for oil and gas will be cited as necessary to keep the lights on, and justified by investment in nascent carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is as yet untested at scale. The revamped net zero plans, including a green growth strategy, will contain major sops to the UK’s fossil fuel industries and will miss out on key green measures. The Guardian has learned that the plans, still under wraps before Thursday’s launch, will include the following: Ministers will refuse to force oil and gas companies to stop flaring by 2025, as recommended in the review of net zero by Chris Skidmore earlier this year. Ofgem will not gain important powers to include the net zero target in its regulation of the energy sector, effectively defanging the regulator. No overarching new office for net zero, as recommended in the Skidmore review. No compulsion on housebuilders to fit rooftop solar to new housing. No comprehensive nationwide programme for insulation of the UK’s draughty housing stock, as green groups have been calling for. Instead, the strongest insulation measure is likely to be a consultation on the private rented sector. The Treasury, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and the Department for Business and Trade are at war over whether to introduce carbon border taxes. Major roles for carbon capture and storage technology and hydrogen, which could boost the oil and gas industry with questionable gains for the environment. The potential licensing of a massive new oilfield, Rosebank, under cover of investing in carbon capture and storage technology, which campaigners warn is “greenwash”. Green experts and campaigners were “astounded” at the rebranding of what had been widely trailed as “green day”, and by the plans to unveil it in Aberdeen, the centre of the UK’s oil and gas industry. Tom Burke, a co-founder of the E3G thinktank, said: “This is Fawlty Towers politics – don’t mention the environment! It’s a sop to the right wing. It’s clear this is not a strategy, just an assembly of lobby interests.” He said the UK economy would suffer. “The real problem for the UK is that the US, with the Inflation Reduction Act, and the EU have started the race for a green economy. That race has gone off and we are not in the race. Green day was supposed to be an opportunity to get back in the green race, but this is just supporting [fossil fuel] lobbies.” A last-minute change of venue is still possible, though Aberdeen is the favoured option, and rows are ongoing over whether the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will lead the launch. The launch next week will include several key elements and involve at least four government departments. Ministers are compelled to publish a revamped net zero strategy by the end of this month, after Friends of the Earth and other campaigners won a court case last year that found the previous strategy inadequate. Green measures in the strategy are likely to include an expansion of renewable energy, includingoffshore and onshore wind – the latter currently in effect banned in England – and it will also include plans to produce green hydrogen. Electric vehicle manufacturing will be a focus, with the potential for a mandate requiring companies to sell more of them, as will heat pumps. Ministers will also respond to each of the 130 recommendations of the net zero review, conducted by the Tory MP Chris Skidmore, and will publish a 70-page green growth strategy, and a green finance strategy from the Treasury. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will also make fresh commitments on the UK’s carbon footprint. While the government sets out its energy security strategy, a decision on a licence for the massive new Rosebank oilfield has reached the desk of Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, the Guardian has learned. If it goes ahead, new estimates by the campaign group Uplift show that Rosebank, expected to cost £4.1bn to develop, could receive an effective taxpayer subsidy worth £3.75bn through tax breaks and the loophole in the government’s windfall tax that spares oil and gas investment. This would mean that Equinor, the Norwegian state-owned company behind the potential field, would pay only £350m to develop Rosebank, which is three times the size of the Cambo oilfield. Equinor made £62bn last year, and about 80% of the oil from Rosebank is likely to be exported, rather than bolstering the UK’s energy security. A spokesperson for Equinor said the company did not recognise the Uplift estimate, and cited a separate industry report that found the Rosebank project could bring £26.8bn to the UK through tax payments and investments into the UK economy. The spokesperson said: “Rosebank has the potential to strengthen energy security with oil and gas that is produced with a much lower carbon footprint than current UK production.” Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: “Approving Rosebank would be an unbelievably bad deal for Britain. UK taxpayers would effectively cover almost all the costs of developing Rosebank by giving Equinor billions in tax breaks. The oil would most likely be exported, and Norway would take the profit.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “The Conservatives’ latest energy relaunch is daylight robbery, a colossal waste of taxpayers money, and climate vandalism on an epic scale. Funnelling billions from the British people to foreign-owned oil and gas companies already making record profits is one of the worst deals in British history and an insult to millions facing the cost of living crisis.” The potential Rosebank decision and the energy security launch proposals come after climate scientists issued their “final warning” this week that the world would breach the crucial threshold of 1.5C of global heating without urgent action. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an end to new oil and gas development in response. Relying on CCS technology to bring down emissions was “greenwash” and would benefit the oil and gas industry, said Greenpeace. “Carbon capture is not zero carbon; is unlikely to see dramatic cost reductions or be scalable; and is often used for greenwashing by oil and gas companies so they can carry on polluting. It doesn’t do what it says on the tin and certainly should not be prioritised as part of a green industrial strategy.” Chris Venables, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “There can be no energy security while the UK remains dangerously reliant on volatile global oil and gas markets. A real plan to bring down eye-watering energy bills by protecting the public from expensive fossil fuels must have renewable energy at its heart. Luckily, the government has a whole range of incredibly simple tools at its disposal to speed up the rollout of cheap, clean power. If those remain collecting dust on the shelf next week, it will be almost impossible for industry and business, never mind environmentalists and fuel poverty groups, to take this new plan seriously at all.” The Guardian has approached the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero for comment.",Green politics; Environmental activism; World news; Environment; Climate crisis; Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Aberdeen; Scotland; UK news; Politics,Environment
2023-07-20T12:23:12Z,"Gas boiler lobby trying to delay UK’s heat pump plans, leak shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/20/gas-boiler-lobby-uk-heat-pump-plans-leak,"Lobbyists for the gas boiler industry are trying to delay the introduction of new government measures to speed up the take-up of heat pumps, a leaked document shows. The move, in a draft document obtained by the DeSmog investigative journalism group and seen by the Guardian, appears to be part of an intensive two-year lobbying effort by a key gas boiler industry organisation, which has been critical of heat pumps, and promoted hydrogen for home heating to government and opposition parties, despite strong evidence of its unsuitability. The Energy and Utilities Alliance (EUA), an industry association that represents boiler manufacturers and other gas companies, including some that have branched out into heat pumps, has made a submission to a government consultation calling for measures forcing the industry to install more heat pumps to be delayed to 2026. Under the consultation on the clean heat market mechanism, published in March, ministers are proposing that, from 2024, manufacturers of fossil fuel boilers would face a quota for heat pump installations relative to their gas or oil boiler installations, with fines for failure to sell enough heat pumps. But in the draft, obtained by DeSmog and seen by the Guardian, the government targets are said by EUA to be “unachievable” because of the short timeframe, the difficulty manufacturers would face in gearing up to meet the regulations, and the potential cost of the fines, which the organisation has calculated at a potential £300m to UK industry. EUA wrote, in a document titled HHIC Clean Heat Market Mechanism Consultation Response: “EUA does not believe that the proposed clean heat market mechanism will achieve its stated aims with the policy as currently designed. The central proposal that boiler manufacturers are able to dictate the products homeowners install in their homes is flawed.” HHIC stands for Heating and Hot Water Industry Council, a trade body whose aim is to “define practical solutions for decarbonising heat and hot water in UK homes and businesses”, to which EUA is a parent organisation. Mike Foster, the chief executive of EUA, confirmed to the Guardian that EUA was seeking a delay to the introduction of the clean heat market mechanism to 2026. He told the Guardian that 2026 was a “sensible timeframe” because the government’s current proposals would hit gas boiler companies with fines for failing to install enough heat pumps, without putting in place the mechanisms necessary to allow them to sell more. Only about 30,000 heat pump installations are likely to qualify for grants under the government’s upgrade scheme, but if boiler companies fail to install about 60,000 in private homes, they will be penalised. The limit on grants would act as a “ceiling” on the number of heat pump installations in private homes, Foster said, making fines on the gas boiler industry almost inevitable. “Why would you retrofit without a grant when there are grants available?” he asked. “Who would want to fit one without accessing a grant?” The EUA, with the help of a Birmingham PR firm, the WPR Agency, has also undertaken a campaign in the media that highlights some of the potential difficulties with installing heat pumps, evidence amassed by DeSmog suggests. EUA members are strongly identified with the gas boiler industry, with members including Cadent, which runs the UK’s largest gas network, and many leading boiler manufacturers and suppliers, including Baxi, Vaillant and Wolseley. EUA members carry out about 98% of the UK’s heating installations, the vast majority of which are for gas boilers. Gas boiler makers and installers are facing an effective end to their industry, as it is currently constituted, if the UK moves to heat pumps as the main source of low-carbon home heating. They could turn to manufacturing and installing heat pumps, and some of the EUA’s member companies, including Baxi, Vaillant and Wolseley, have done so, but these are a tiny part of their current market. Many companies also are working to repurpose their boilers to use hydrogen. This is viewed by experts as problematic, because more than 40 studies have found hydrogen to be unsuitable for home heating, as it is expensive, there are issues with its efficiency, and using it in the UK’s leaky gas networks presents potential safety problems. Many current sources of hydrogen are also high-carbon. Foster, a former Labour MP, has used the media to promote hydrogen for home heating and criticise heat pumps. He has written articles for or been quoted in newspapers including the Sun, the Telegraph and the Express, and broadcast media such as GB News, LBC and BBC news. He wrote in the Times against the clean heat market mechanism: “If there is the demand for heat pumps then manufacturers will sell them anyway. But if the public don’t want them, are you really helping by forcing companies to try and sell them? This feels like Soviet-style planning where you end up with warehouses full of Ladas that nobody wants.” On the Politics.co.uk website, he wrote last year, about data on the cost of heat pumps: “These numbers make it crystal clear that the way to decarbonise homes currently using natural gas boilers is to switch to a net zero gas, not rip out the boiler. It is economically irrational to fit heat pumps, so converting the gas networks to hydrogen is the only sensible approach.” Foster told the Guardian he was not against heat pumps. He said EUA had not lobbied the government against a ban on gas boilers, and said that in a personal capacity as chair of a fuel-poverty community-interest company he had approved projects to fund more than 11,500 heat pump installations. He said: “EUA is not and has never been anti-heat pump. The only people suggesting this are those who know very little about decarbonising home heating or have some alternative agenda. EUA members make and sell heat pumps. EUA believes a wide range of technologies is needed to meet net zero – including heat pumps, heat networks and hydrogen. EUA does also highlight the many misleading claims around heat pumps and those promoting ‘a one-size fits all’ to the complex issue of decarbonising homes.” On hydrogen, he said that heat pumps were not suitable for all homes, and hydrogen offered a potential alternative. “EUA’s stance, to explore hydrogen for heating, is in line with that of the government,” he said. “The CCC [Committee on Climate Change] also identify a role for hydrogen, as does the Scottish government and the National Grid, in their future energy scenarios. Our view is also shared by some of the UK’s biggest trade unions – GMB, Unite, Community, Unison and Prospect. Advocates of ruling out hydrogen as an eco-friendly energy source at this early stage are not serious about net zero, whereas we are.” However, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, recently appeared to cool on hydrogen for home heating. In a significant shift of stance, he told Politico earlier this month that although hydrogen could be used for heavy industry, it was unlikely to be used for homes. He said: “I came in [to office] thinking, because this was the narrative that was around, that one day hydrogen will fuel homes. I think that’s unlikely to be the way forward.” In April, around the time EUA was drafting its plea to the government to delay measures that would promote heat pumps, WPR, the agency retained by EUA, sent a press notice to journalists detailing opposition by the EUA to the government plans for a clean heart market mechanism, describing “some news of outrage from the heating and energy industry over policy that organisations believe is ‘selling British manufacturers down the river’.” WPR until recently boasted on its website of campaigning to “spark outrage at the cost and demand consumer choice over the heating technologies people put in their own homes. We demonstrated that, while consumers support climate change efforts, the government needs to take seriously concerns around choice and affordability.” That wording has in recent days been changed to “spark conversation”. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “We changed the wording to better reflect the work we are doing for the EUA – that the country does not have to make a binary choice between heat pumps and hydrogen, we will need both to become net zero.” The spokesperson added that the agency was not against heat pumps: “We work for manufacturers of heat pumps and are aware that they are a fantastic solution in the right properties. However, as manufacturers of heat pumps themselves admit, they aren’t suitable for every home or every property. As with bodies such as the Climate Change Committee, and individuals such as the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, we believe we will need both heat pumps and hydrogen if we are to become net zero, which we must.” Sarah Becker, of the Global Witness campaign group, said the promotion of hydrogen for home heating was based on manufacturers and installers seeking the least disruption to their business model. “The people who are pushing for hydrogen heating aren’t genuinely interested in tackling climate breakdown – they’re looking for a lifeline for the gas industry,” she said. “They aren’t just talking up a false climate solution, they’re also working hard to undermine the right ones. Heat pumps will play an essential role in reducing our fossil fuel dependence and making our homes and buildings renewables-ready.” Creating confusion in the minds of consumers has a serious impact on the uptake of heat pumps, according to Prof Martin Freer, director of the Birmingham Energy Institute. “The homeowner [in the UK] is confused by the mixed messages from government, industry and the [installation] sector around which low-carbon heating solution is best. This same confusion does not exist in countries such as Italy, Poland, France, Germany or the Netherlands.” Foster said: “I don’t know how anyone could accuse me of sowing confusion, as I am clear that three [technologies] will be needed: heat pumps, distributed heat networks, and hydrogen for home heating. That is what the government has said. Why would the government be spending time investing in hydrogen otherwise?” Foster added that he believed many critics of the EUA were lobbyists at the Regulatory Assistance Project, paid to undermine the UK’s gas industry. Jan Rosenow, of the Regulatory Assistance Project, a thinktank that has drawn attention to the more than 40 studies finding hydrogen would not be viable for home heating, said: “It is quite ironic that lobbyists paid by the fossil fuel industry accuse me of being a lobbyist. I have never taken any money from the heat pump industry or lobbied on behalf of any other industry. I’m an analyst with one agenda only: to decarbonise the energy system affordably and fairly to address the climate crisis. I never have and never will represent any special interests in my work.” The Labour party press office did not respond to the Guardian’s queries.",Gas; Fossil fuels; Energy efficiency; Energy; UK news; Environment; Hydrogen power; Heat pumps,Environment
2022-03-05T08:00:19Z,Corporate tree-planting drive in Scotland ‘risks widening rural inequality’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/05/tree-planting-drive-scottish-highlands-risks-widening-inequality,"A drive by wealthy companies to plant forests in the Scottish Highlands to offset their carbon emissions risks creating even greater inequalities in rural areas, a major report has warned. The analysis says a surge of Highland estate sales to major corporations and cash-rich investors, such as Aviva, Standard Life and BrewDog, has driven up land prices sharply and increased the elitism and exclusivity of land ownership, while they aim to limit climate heating. John Hollingdale, a community ownership expert, argues that much stricter rules on land ownership, tax breaks and forestry subsidies are needed to ensure the rush to meet government forestry and net zero targets has the widest public benefit. The Scottish and UK governments have targets to plant 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of new woods and forests across Britain a year. Scottish Forestry, a government agency, is midway through a three-year programme worth £217m to plant 46,500 hectares (115,000 acres) of new woodland by April 2025, roughly equivalent to 93m trees. In a report for Community Land Scotland, a land reform body, Hollingdale said those investments were further subsidised by exemptions from inheritance tax, business property tax relief, and income and corporation tax on profits for commercial woodland, as well as non-domestic rates exemptions. Calum MacLeod, policy director for Community Land Scotland, said: “The paper’s detailed analysis and recommendations shows that green finance mechanisms need to be fit for purpose in terms of a just transition by making land use sustainable in ways that significantly benefit local communities.” Standard Life Investments, Aviva and BrewDog are the best-known examples of companies that have spent tens of millions of pounds in the last year buying land for forestry, peatland restoration and woodland creation to offset their carbon emissions or sell climate-focused investments to their clients. Known as natural capital or green finance investments, corporations have come under intense pressure to absorb or offset their carbon emissions to hit the Paris climate accord goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C by 2050. To the alarm of land reform campaigners and the National Farmers’ Union, that has led to land prices more than doubling in some areas of Scotland, as the competition for upland estates and farmland intensifies. Purchases by big companies such as the beer company BrewDog remain relatively rare but they reinforce another more subtle trend, Hollingdale argues. Increased funding for forestry and its tax advantages means existing owners can increase the value of their land and businesses by moving into woodland creation. While that has environmental benefits, it can make owners less likely to sell, pushing up land values by increasing scarcity. Hollingdale’s report warns this trend also prices out local communities hoping to buy their land to increase local employment, tourism, ecological management and micro-businesses. In 2020, the Scottish Land Fund, which funds community buyouts, stopped taking applications after five months because its £10m budget was oversubscribed. That has since been doubled to £20m, but surging land prices may soon swallow up that increased funding. Hollingdale recommends green financing projects are regulated to ensure they support genuine carbon offsetting; that ministers remove tax exemptions which distort land prices, and increase sales taxes on agricultural buildings; and that land owners are required to produce management plans and introduce public interest tests for large estates. Hamish Trench, the chief executive of the Scottish Land Commission, an official body focused on reforming highly concentrated patterns of land ownership, believes there is a “real risk” green finance investments will further concentrate the ownership of land and its benefits. In 2019, the commission said, just 87 owners – made up of private owners, charities and state-run bodies – controlled 1.7m hectares of rural Scotland. Trench said it was essential the financing was used in the public interest. “How do we harness this new finance coming in so it actively supports the mixed and community ownership model? We see an opportunity to do that,” he said. Sarah Jane Laing, the chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, which represents many large landowners, said this trend was still in its infancy but had tremendous economic potential. There were still numerous opportunities for community groups and social enterprises to buy land, often with public or private support. “Significant funds could flow into Scotland – benefiting nature, people and jobs,” she said. “Green investment has the potential to provide landowners of all types with revenue streams and community owners and farmers may well benefit from these emerging opportunities. However, these are very early days for all landowners.”",Scotland; Climate crisis; UK news; Environment; Communities; Society; Inequality; Trees and forests; Aviva; Standard Life; Business; BrewDog; Food & drink industry,UK news
2022-07-04T06:00:37Z,Environment Agency chief hits out at greenwashing by businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/04/environment-agency-chief-hits-out-at-greenwashing-by-businesses-emma-howard-boyd,"Widespread greenwashing by businesses is compromising efforts to prepare for climate impacts such as floods and heatwaves, the chair of the Environment Agency will say in a speech on Monday. Emma Howard Boyd, addressing the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment Annual Forum, will warn businesses are embedding liability and storing up risk for their investors by giving the false impression they are addressing the climate crisis. The danger is, she says, that people “won’t realise this deception until it is too late”. Howard Boyd addresses concerns over greenwashing after the climate change committee said last week in its annual progress report that the government was failing to enact the policies needed to reach the UK’s net zero targets. Lord Deben, chair of the committee and a former Conservative environment secretary, said the government had set strong targets on cutting emissions but policy to achieve them was lacking. “The government has willed the ends, but not the means,” he said. Howard Boyd, who leaves the Environment Agency in September, is interim chair of the Green Finance Institute. She will say that nearly £650bn of public and private infrastructure investment planned by 2030 is at considerable risk unless increasingly severe climate impacts are considered in planning and delivery. “As with the government’s ambition for net zero by 2050, delivering on climate resilience and nature recovery requires robust, consistent and trusted data,” she will say in her speech. “If we fail to identify and address greenwashing, we allow ourselves false confidence that we are already addressing the causes and treating the symptoms of the climate crisis.” Howard Boyd is set to praise the work of activist NGOs including ShareAction, Make My Money Matter and ClientEarth for their work calling out greenwashing. Earlier this year, the Bank of England’s first climate stress test suggested that UK banks and insurers would end up taking on nearly £340bn-worth of climate-related losses by 2050 unless action was taken to curb rising temperatures and sea levels. Howard Boyd says there is underinvestment in climate adaptation. Action was needed and she is calling for a collaboration between the public and private sectors. “Around the world, just 5% of climate finance goes towards resilience and virtually none of that comes from the private sector,” she will say. Howard Boyd wants to see more government involvement to drive investment in climate adaptation, starting with a Treasury-commissioned review to assess the economics of climate resilience. “This would help us understand how preparedness for climate shocks supports sustainable economic growth, establishes an overarching ambition for adaptation investment and a plan to achieve it,” she will say.",Climate crisis; Environment; UK news; Environment Agency,Environment
2022-09-26T14:21:27Z,Farmers threaten to quit NFU as leader backs scrapping of nature subsidies,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/26/farmers-threaten-to-quit-nfu-as-leader-backs-scrapping-of-nature-subsidies,"Farmers are threatening to quit the National Farmers’ Union after its leader said she supported the UK government’s apparent move to scrap post-Brexit nature subsidies. This weekend, the Observer revealed that the government was poised to abandon the “Brexit bonus”, which would have paid farmers and landowners to enhance nature, in what wildlife groups have described as an “all-out attack” on the environment. Instead of the environmental land management scheme (Elms), Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) sources disclosed, they are considering paying landowners a yearly set sum for each acre of land they own, which would be similar to the much-maligned EU basic payments scheme of the common agricultural policy. Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, said she welcomed the departure from Elms. “My absolute priority is ensuring that farmers can continue to produce the nation’s food – so I do support maintaining direct payments in order to build a scheme that really will deliver for food production and the environment,” she said. She later doubled down on this point, telling the BBC that she believed private money should be used to pay farmers for wildlife recovery, rather than public funds. She said: “We have got literally billions and billions of pounds in green finance that is looking to invest in wild environments. We should be making the private sector work effectively.” Prominent members of the NFU have spoken to the Guardian, saying they were minded to quit if the leadership failed to clarify its position and support payments for environmental protections. Jake Freestone, a regenerative farmer and Worcestershire county chairman for the union, has won awards for his soil quality after practicing nature-friendly farming. While he said he is not yet at the point of quitting, he appeared disappointed with the NFU’s apparent views on Elms. “We do need to focus on the environment as well as food production and what does worry me is if we are going to throw out a lot of environmental protection on the basis of food security. But we are quite happily farming productively here and also providing good environmental protection – if you don’t have wildlife and pollinators and farmland birds, what do you have?” he said. “The challenge we have is the NFU have a lot of diversified members with a lot of different interests.” Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said many of his fellow farmers were leaving the NFU over its perceived anti-nature stance. “I know of lots of NFU members who are very unhappy or have already left,” he said. “Unfortunately many farmers are members because they feel there hasn’t been any other farming body in the past that is a voice for farming. I know many farmers who are leaving the NFU and joining organisations like the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), NFFN and others, as the NFU doesn’t represent their views or voice. “Many farmers are starting to realise the NFU does not represent or champion their voice or farming system.” Mark Tufnell, the chair of the CLA, which represents 30,000 landowners, said he hoped the government would stick with Elms. He said: “There is concern that there might be a change in direction, it’s harsh to come in at a very early stage and say it isn’t working as it hasn’t been given a chance.” On the NFU’s policy, he said: “You would have to ask the NFU. We have actively stated since about 2017 that we have always felt it is very difficult to justify a flat-rate payment to farmers and landowners just for the sake of owning land. The benefit of Elms is the more public goods you provide, the more you get paid, and you can stack the amounts you do in the public scheme with the private element.” The NFU has been lobbied by some influential voices who are against Elms. Celebrities including the TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson, former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey and former cricketers Ian Botham and David Gower have written to the government asking them to scrap environmental regulations. Writing as “rural voices” who do “real work” that includes “cultivating the soil, looking after sick animals and bringing in the harvest”, they said environmental regulations on farmers “seek to appease the insatiable demands of a few self-righteous campaigners”. On Monday, Batters said: “We’re pleased the government is reviewing the framework for future farming regulation to help ensure farm businesses are supported through the current economic challenges and can make progressive decisions to boost growth and farming’s contribution to the nation. “The NFU has always supported the ‘public money for public goods’ policy but we have called for a delay as the scheme was not fit for purpose and ready to roll out in its current form.”",Farming; UK news; Environment; Rewilding,Environment
2022-05-25T08:39:30Z,Egypt says climate finance must be top of agenda at Cop27 talks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/egypt-climate-finance-top-of-agenda-cop27-talks,"Financial assistance for developing countries must be at the top of the agenda for UN climate talks this year, the host country, Egypt, has made clear, as governments will be required to follow through on promises made at the Cop26 summit last year. Egypt will host Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in November. The talks will take place in the shadow of the war in Ukraine, as well as rising energy and food prices around the world, leaving rich countries grappling with a cost-of-living crisis and poor countries struggling with debt mountains. Most of the world’s biggest economies, and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, have yet to fulfil the pledges they made at Glasgow last November to strengthen their targets on emissions cuts. Work to turn the pledges of climate finance from rich countries into projects on the ground helping poor countries has also been slow. Rania Al Mashat, Egypt’s minister for international cooperation, said: “For us, what we want this Cop[27] to be about is moving from pledges to implementation. And we want to highlight what are the practical policies and practices, the processes that can actually push the pledges [into action], to bridge that gap.” She added: “We want this Cop to be about the practicalities: what is it that we need to do to operationalise the pledges into implementation?” Some countries have difficulty gaining access to finance, she noted, and that must be addressed with new ways of “de-risking” finance, to attract private sector investors. This could be done through governments providing guarantees or other assurances to private lenders, or co-investing with them. “One of the successes from Glasgow which will always be remembered is how the private sector was mobilised in a very important way,” Mashat told the Guardian. “So instead of just billions, the word trillions started coming up. “However, these trillions from the private sector commitments or pledges can never make their way to the countries that need them most, unless we have more synergy between [public sector] development finance and private capital to create de-risking tools.” Mohamed Maait, the Egyptian finance minister, also spoke of the need to address bigger finance issues, such as the “huge burden” of mounting debt that many poor countries are facing. “Most developing countries are in debt. Can we do something to engage those countries? Can we reduce this burden and assist them towards net zero?” he said. Maait made it clear that tackling the debt burden, which inhibits countries from taking measures that would reduce emissions, and making investments that would help them cope with the effects of the climate crisis, would be a key priority for Egypt. “We need to sit down together and come up with a solution – the alternative is to let the risks increase, the challenges increase, and people’s suffering increase,” he said. Helping poor countries cut their emissions, and become more resilient to the effects of extreme weather would benefit rich countries too, he added. “The risks of climate change are not for one country but for all of us,” he said. Rich countries would also need to find ways to compensate poor countries for not extracting more oil and gas, he said. He gave the example of Senegal, where major gas discoveries are expected that could transform the economy – but would also constitute a vast “carbon bomb”, of the kind that if exploited would lead to temperatures far exceeding the 1.5C temperature limit targeted in Glasgow. “Senegal were hoping this discovery would help them. Now you are coming to say, climate change means stopping the finance,” said Maait. “That is very worrying.” Developing countries had done little to create the climate crisis but risked being penalised in ways that rich countries have escaped, he warned. “Poor countries’ responsibility for this problem is limited. Unless we can get a good solution to this, it will be very difficult. We need to ensure we do not add to suffering, to debt, and that countries can fulfil their ambitions.” Poor countries could feel as if they were being “punished”, he added. “We [need] a situation where we ensure you are not punished but are encouraged to go green.” He also cautioned against rich countries providing climate finance in the form of loans that require repayment or incur interest. “Don’t tell me you are going to offer green finance at the same cost as traditional finance,” he said, speaking at a small gathering in the City of London. “This will not work.”",Cop27; Environment; Egypt; Africa; Middle East and north Africa; World news; Climate finance; Global development; Climate crisis,Environment
2021-10-29T06:00:22Z,Forget fine art: investors urged to put their money into rewilding ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/29/forget-fine-art-investors-urged-to-put-their-money-into-rewilding,"Forget gold, vintage wines and fine art: investors and landowners are being urged to put their money into Tamworth pigs, Dalmatian pelicans and ponds dug by beavers. The Real Wild Estates Company says it has tens of millions of pounds already pledged to acquire land to rewild, restore biodiversity, store carbon – and make a healthy return for investors. The “natural capital” startup, which was launched at the rewilded Somerset farm belonging to the environmentalist and fund manager Ben Goldsmith, aims to create more than 100,000 acres of wild land across Britain by 2030. Ben Macdonald, head of the nature restoration for Real Wild Estates, said: “When you come back to Britain from places such as Yellowstone, it’s like walking into an art gallery where the paintings have been ripped off the wall. Our duty is to put those paintings back. I’d love to see a Norfolk Broads with Dalmatian pelicans, and Caledonian forest where lynx are keeping the deer in check.” Macdonald, the author of Rebirding, a study of rewilding, said nature was in a state of emergency and recovery could only happen at scale, by persuading big landowners and investment funds to devote large tracts of land to wildlife restoration. Real Wild Estates will be hired by landowners and investors to acquire land and oversee rewilding for profit. It expects rewilded land to generate diversified income streams from tourism, glamping and rewilding safaris, and from the government’s post-Brexit environmental land management schemes, as well as from payments for biodiversity and carbon offsetting whereby companies pay to sequestrate carbon through nature restoration. The cost of carbon offsetting is expected to grow dramatically in the next decade, particularly with corporations keen to reduce their carbon emissions to net zero but lacking an understanding of how to do it. Developers will pay landowners to rewild to meet the new environment bill’s requirement that new housing estates lead to a “net gain” in biodiversity. Julian Matthews, founder of the Real Wild Estates Company, said that rather than British firms paying for flawed carbon offsetting projects in distant countries where forest restoration schemes could not be easily verified, his company would help businesses sequester carbon and restore nature closer to home. “Is it not better to bring the sequestration to where the carbon originates from? Let’s put it into our own landscapes,” he said. Critics of rewilding say it removes food production as well as rural jobs – and traditional farmers – from the land. However, Real Wild Estates said it would be targeting “marginal” land that produced little food, and a key part of its business model was to provide more rural employment. According to the charity Rewilding Britain, there has been a 54% increase in jobs on 32 estates in England that have embraced rewilding, with new roles including safari guides and hybrid ecologist-stock managers to look after free-roaming pigs, cattle and horses and the wider landscape. The 1416.4 hectare (3,500 acre) Knepp estate in West Sussex employed 23 people as a conventional farm, but after being rewilded it has a staff of 47, with a further 200 people employed in companies that rent its converted farm buildings. Its ecotourism business last year brought in almost £1m. Matthews said: “There is one job per 7km/sq in the Highlands – there are no jobs for rural communities. We aim to bring back jobs.” According to his company’s modelling, one contract farmer employed to manage 400 hectares could be replaced in five years by a rewilding scheme employing 35 people. A report by the Green Finance Institute calculates there is a funding gap of up to £97bn between the government’s commitments to restore biodiversity and reach net zero in Britain and the public money available. According to Green Finance Institute analysts, this gap will have to be met by private investment. Backers of Real Wild Estates include L’Oréal, which is investing in the new company through its regeneration fund, a €50m pot to help restore 1m hectares of degraded ecosystems and capture up to 20m tonnes of CO2, potentially creating hundreds of jobs. According to Matthews, investors are keen to put their money into in the “natural capital space”, with consumer demand for wilderness and wellbeing holidays, public desire for action to save nature, and new payments for restoring soils, preventing floods and sequestering carbon enshrined in the environment bill. Matthews said he was inspired by his experiences watching nature restoration and rewilding in southern Africa. “We all think this is new but it’s been happening around the globe very successfully for a long time. My goal with the Real Wild Estates Company is to make restoring nature profitable and viable. “Rewilding isn’t about having wolves outside your door, it’s getting back to what our grandparents would have seen as perfectly normal. If I can’t make this work I need to be shot, because we’ve got real tailwinds behind us to make this happen.”",Conservation; Environment; Trees and forests; Wildlife; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Business; Investing; Investments; Money; Biodiversity; Rural affairs; UK news; Climate crisis; Rewilding,Environment
2022-07-24T14:54:42Z,Want an electric car but fear the cost? Here’s how to flick the switch,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/24/want-an-electric-car-but-fear-the-cost-heres-how-to-flick-the-switch,"Consumers are more and more eager to go electric. The number of electric vehicles (EVs) on British roads is soon set to exceed France after a huge surge in sales. But while a growing number of motorists want to switch, many are also wondering if they can afford it. Although they are cheaper to run, EVs are more expensive to buy than other vehicles, leading many to believe they are out of their price range. And while the number of EVs sold in the UK has now exceeded half a million, research from the Green Finance Institute says that most purchases are by corporate fleet companies, and not individuals. A report from the thinktank says: “Consumer adoption of EVs is still in its infancy, and a number of barriers deter larger numbers from switching in the short term. “Higher upfront cost of the vehicles, the pace of improvement in battery range, concerns about access to reliable charging infrastructure and perceived complexity of transitioning means many are hesitant about making an EV their next car,” Last year the average pre-tax retail price of a medium-sized EV was €33,300 (£28,914) compared with €18,600 for a petrol car, according to BloombergNEF. Added to that, the cost of living crisis is putting more pressure on households. Banking group Close Brothers says research suggests many people are changing their mind about buying due to the current need to tighten belts. But there are ways to get on the road without shelling out huge amounts. Leasing Personal contract hire (PCH), best known as leasing, is, in effect, a very long-term rental. You don’t get to keep the car at the end of the term – instead, you make monthly payments to keep it for a set period. This is usually the cheapest way to get on the road but, typically, it has limits on the number of miles that can be done in a year, according to Dan Powell of motoring site AutoVillage. The pros are clear: a new car every few years, and the depreciation on the vehicle is not the problem of the driver, but the lease company. Leasing terms are mostly between two and four years, but the drivers are typically liable for repair costs that are their fault, says Jeff Fairbotham of Zoom EV. How much a lease costs depends on the price of the vehicle, the length of contract, mileage, the value of it at the end of the term and whether certain options, such as maintenance, are included. There can be additional costs if the lease is ended early, or if you exceed mileage limits. “You never own the car, and you may be stung for additional money if you go over your annual mileage allowance, or if the car has more than fair wear bumps and scratches,” says Gill Nowell of insurer LV=. Comparison site Auto Lease Compare gives the best price for a Nissan Leaf at £261 a month on a four-year contract at 5,000 miles a year. Hire purchase and PCP Similar in some ways, hire purchase and personal contract purchase (PCP) can both end up with the driver owning the car. Hire purchase contracts are split between the deposit and instalments over the term of the agreement. Once the final instalment is paid, the car is yours, usually over a period of up to five years. Again, the price of a deal is altered by the term, and what the initial deposit is. PCP is the most popular type of car financing in the UK, and differs in that the driver can keep the car, trade it in, or hand back the keys at the end of the term. If they want to keep the car, they pay a final “balloon” payment. “Instead of paying off the entire value of the car over the term of the agreement, you only pay off the depreciation. As a result, the deposit and monthly payments tend to be lower than a traditional hire purchase agreement,” says Powell. Drivers will have to stick to mileage limits with the PCP contract and will have to pay if they hand back the car with any damage. What Car? lists a Skoda Scala at £239 a month on a PCP contract at 5.9% APR, with a 15% deposit, over four years as its best available deal at the moment. Salary sacrifice For people who work for a company with a salary sacrifice scheme for EVs, considerable tax savings can be made in a way similar to pensions or cycle-to-work schemes. After an agreement is signed and a car is selected, a set amount is deducted from pre-tax pay. The employee then pays benefit-in-kind tax, which is 2% for EVs this tax year. Salary sacrifice packages can offer all of the things a driver needs to get on the road – the car, insurance, maintenance deals, breakdown assistance – under one payment. Simon Down, a tax director at accountants Deloitte, says people sign up for a set period and agree an annual mileage. “Underneath it’s essentially a car lease. A business … gets a lease provider to provide the cost and the maintenance, and all the other kinds of bits you need to keep on the road.” A £31,000 EV taken out for three years in a salary sacrifice scheme will end up costing the employee £420 a month after the tax savings are included and the benefit-in-kind tax paid, according to Deloitte’s calculation. A lease agreement on the same car, with maintenance and insurance having to be paid, would cost £619. There are usually penalties if you leave the job and end the scheme early. “The government has used the company car tax system for a number of years to influence certain behaviour. I think they want it clear that there is a need to get to zero emissions. At the moment there is quite a strong incentive to switch to electric cars,” says Down. Taking it month by month Drivers who don’t want to commit to long leases have the option of taking them by the month with a Netflix-style subscription. A new generation of companies has emerged which has insurance, tax, maintenance and other essentials included under the one price. Contracts usually renew each month, so, as long as you keep on paying, the car stays with you. Elmo offers a Fiat 500e for £449 a month, or a Renault Zoe for £469. Both have a limit of 800 miles, and come with a £95 one-off admin fee. Onto, which includes public charging in its prices, offers a Renault Zoe for £489 a month with a limit of 750 miles, or a Vauxhall Corsa-e for £549. Onto’s founder Rob Jolly says it has 6,000 cars with subscribers. Base prices start at £379 a month, with mass-market cars around £500 a month. Why it’s all change for the Spotify generation … Owning your own vehicle is quickly becoming an unnecessary demand for consumers. The development in recent years of different types of subscription models shows that ownership is not as important to a new generation of drivers. Erin Baker of AutoTrader says younger motorists see cars differently to their parents. “The younger generations coming up and entering the market – probably 18- to 35-year-olds – are increasingly happy to look at subscription models where there is no more than a monthly cost. “They are used to sharing their lifestyle, they share their music choices on Spotify, they share streaming choices, they share their lives on social media, so they are less bothered about having a private car that is their own. “And that coincides well with not seeing cars as the same status symbol as older generations did.” Cars are not seen with the same level of “badge snobbery,” according to Baker, with brands such as Kia, Tesla and Hyundai replacing BMWs and Jaguars on people’s wish lists.","Motoring; Money; Consumer affairs; Motoring; Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars; Tesla; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Ethical and green living; Travel and transport",Money
2022-09-20T17:35:52Z,Will China’s plan for a ‘green silk road’ live up to environmental promises?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/20/china-plan-green-silk-road-environmental-promises,"In July 2019, China rolled out the red carpet for the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina. Flown to Beijing by the Chinese government, she was greeted with an honour guard and banquet and received by the president, Xi Jinping, and the prime minister, Li Keqiang. Three days later, she returned to her capital, Dhaka, with nine agreements worth billions of dollars to build power plants and provide other development assistance. Hasina’s short visit benefited both countries. Big new infrastructure projects would help lift living standards in Bangladesh, but also enable China to strengthen its influence on its fast-growing neighbour of more than 160 million people. Those loans and agreements made up one very small part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – the world’s largest infrastructure programme since the US Marshall plan helped rebuild Europe after the second world war. Launched as a Xi flagship project in 2013, it involves China flooding the world with investments to construct a trillion-dollar-plus modern Silk Road network of many thousands of individual projects along major transcontinental corridors spanning Asia, Africa and eastern Europe. Between 2000 and 2017, China invested about $843bn in 165 countries and more than 13,000 projects, many of them related to the BRI. They include high-speed railway lines, coal and hydropower plants, ports, roads, bridges and tourism developments. Chinese money has flooded in for dams, hospitals, mines, pipelines, IT cables and the construction of new cities and parliament buildings. The bulk has gone to transportation and power projects and, according to a report by Morgan Stanley, by 2027 China’s total investment could approach as much as US$1.3tn. But while many world leaders have welcomed the BRI as a way to raise cheap loans and receive grants not available from the World Bank or wealthy countries, they are becoming more cautious as the full environmental and social costs of China’s loans become apparent and their countries risk being swamped with debt. Biodiversity threats Many BRI projects have involved pushing roads and rail freight lines through some of the world’s biologically richest places. In one study, the World Wildlife Fund and HSBC warned that the BRI could impact many critical biodiversity spots, endangering 265 threatened species such as Amur tigers, oriental white storks and giant pandas. The University of Queensland researcher Divya Narain, the lead author of a study published in Nature about biodiversity safeguards for the BRI, says the initiative is potentially the “riskiest environmental project in history”, poised to transform global transport and trade. “It will have extraordinary impacts on the environment as its corridors and other projects crisscross some of the most pristine and vulnerable ecosystems in the world,” she says. Narain has calculated from the World Bank BRI database of projects that 33 transport mega projects, including 9,500 miles (15,000km) of rail and road, are proposed or planned, and that 48 major hydropower dams are planned or under construction under the BRI. And many finished projects have already been hugely damaging, Narain says. A giant dam on a Mekong River tributary in Cambodia and a major rail line running from China to Laos both led to deforestation and the forced eviction of thousands of families. Coal power plants in Pakistan, Kenya, Indonesia and Serbia have sparked protests over pollution, while road and rail projects in Malaysia and elsewhere have plowed through fragile ecosystems. A railway in Kenya that crosses Nairobi national park and is planned to extend into Tsavo national park, one of Africa’s most important wildlife reserves, has been strongly opposed by conservationists. Much damage has been done because Chinese funds for BRI projects, unlike loans attached to World Bank or most rich countries’ aid programmes, lack restrictions meant to protect biodiversity, says Narain. Chinese companies and financial institutions working abroad have only to adhere to the “host country principle”, which means they often only have to comply with local environmental and social regulations. Narain found that just one of 35 Chinese financiers identified as backing a series of projects demanded any safeguards to protect nature. She concluded that, unless this changed, BRI infrastructure projects would remain damaging. A major study of 13,427 China-funded projects published by AidData at William &amp; Mary university in Williamsburg, Virginia, found that more than one in three projects had encountered “major implementation problems” such as corruption or environmental protests. A growing number of projects, the study reported, have been cancelled, downsized or mothballed, including a new airport in Sierra Leone and large port expansions in Tanzania and Myanmar. Strong backlash to the BRI has come from critics in wealthy countries, who point out that China is the world’s largest funder of heavily emitting coal power stations. According to a 2019 report by the Ohio-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, China was funding via its BRI projects more than a quarter of all new coal power plants being developed elsewhere – even as the World Bank and wealthy countries were pledging to end virtually all coal financing. Green silk road Stung by criticism that the BRI threatened UN climate goals, China has announced a flurry of new initiatives to rebrand it as a “green silk road”. In April 2019, Xi stated that the BRI must embrace sustainability “to protect the common home we live in”. In 2020, he said that China would aim to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. In 2021, at the UN general assembly, Xi pledged to end support for new coal power projects abroad. This was followed in March 2022 with a new directive from China’s National Development and Reform Commission that appeared to commit Chinese banks and developers to raise construction and financing standards. A “green” BRI should be in place by 2030, while by 2025 the environmental risk prevention of BRI projects would significantly improve, the new directive said. But analysts like Narain point out that the new guidelines mean little as the BRI is not governed centrally and no Chinese bank that is financing BRI projects has any binding requirements to protect biodiversity or lower emissions overseas. “These guidelines remain aspirational and do not require banks to put mandatory environmental standards in place,” she wrote in an email. “Unfortunately, this is still the case.” Additionally, the BRI’s vast scale and reach, and the ease with which loans for major projects have been approved by Chinese state banks, have led to accusations that it is a geopolitical instrument of foreign policy meant to make China the most powerful country in the world under the pretext of infrastructure construction. Sources in China accept that BRI projects often bypassed environmental regulations and damaged local biodiversity, especially in the early days. But as rivalry with the US over climate and global leadership has grown, China has become increasingly attentive to green standards. “At the BRI’s peak, China was running around signing [memorandums of understanding] on projects that should never have been constructed,” says Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington and the author of a report on a major China-Laos BRI rail project. “Now I think that China, at a serious level, is doing a rethink. They are facing political backlash and financial risk associated with environmental harm. A lot of local communities [around the world] are unhappy. They are rethinking the BRI model,” he says. “Issuing new guidances will not translate immediately into green practices,” says Christoph Nedopil Wang, founding director of the Green Finance &amp; Development Center and associate professor at Fudan University in Shanghai. “Guidance is not the same as law, and developers do not necessarily understand. [Nevertheless] China is genuinely trying to bring its construction and financing standards up to another level,” he says. “I am 95% certain that no more coal power plants will be built by China. There will be exceptions, but globally there is no support now for coal. All fossil fuel [projects] are being phased out. Hydro dams will be phased out. Renewable energy is moving from the fringe to the core of BRI. It is accelerating. But biologist William Laurance, director of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science at James Cook University in Cairns, Australia, remains skeptical. “BRI will still have a major impact on ecosystems: China has said that it will be low-carbon, green and sustainable, but it is anything but that,” he says. “New roads will still decimate forests, transport routes will still destroy biodiversity on a grand scale. China says it will follow environmental guidelines, but history has shown these protections are nonexistent.” Despite such suspicions that most Chinese projects will barely be affected by the “greening” of the BRI, the country has not financed any new foreign coal plants under the BRI since the beginning of 2020 and many projects have been canceled or suspended, says the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea). According to a briefing paper by Crea analyst Isabella Suarez, 15 coal plants that would have produced about 12.8 gigawatts of electricity have been cancelled so far, but 18 projects with a combined capacity of 19.2 gigawatts might still proceed because the backers have already secured the permits and financing or they are tied to industrial development. “China may continue to fund or build new coal projects under the BRI because a loophole means that some projects already planned may go ahead,” she says. Rival plan Earlier this year, the US and other G7 countries, fearing that the BRI has enabled China to take the global geopolitical lead by financing hard infrastructure projects in poor countries, launched a rival plan that aims to invest $600bn in the next five years alone. Details of what is called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) are still vague. But rather than loan countries money to build roads, railways, ports and dams, early indications suggest it will try to counter China’s influence in developing countries by financing “soft” projects such as industrial-scale solar plants, a vaccine manufacturing centre in Africa and digital infrastructure linking Asia and Africa. So far, the US and EU have pledged to raise $200bn and $317bn, respectively. For now, the PGII promises to be less likely to damage the environment than the BRI. But with geopolitical rivalry between global power blocks intense and growing, the fear is that the PGII – even with higher construction standards – will seek to rival the BRI in scale, with an inevitably massive influence on the global environment.

2021-10-28T09:08:25Z,Rishi Sunak defends halving domestic flight taxes in Cop26 run-up,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/28/rishi-sunak-defends-halving-domestic-flight-taxes-in-cop26-run-up,"Rishi Sunak has defended cutting domestic flight taxes in the run-up to next week’s Cop26 summit, after being accused of going “headlong in the wrong direction” about tackling climate emergency at a pivotal point for Britain. Labour said it was an “astonishing” announcement from the chancellor in Wednesday’s budget, given the UK government will urge many world leaders, set to arrive in Scotland within days, to speed up decarbonisation plans in their own countries. Sunak halved the tax on domestic flights, which are already far cheaper and more polluting than train journeys. Air passenger duty was increased by £4 on “ultra-long” flights of more than 5,550 miles, from £87 to £91. Overall, the changes were a tax giveaway of £30m a year. After criticism from environmental groups, the chancellor batted away claims it could lead to 400,000 more domestic flights every year. “What we’re doing on air-passenger duty is going back to a system we used to have, which means we don’t essentially double-tax people for flying inside the UK – so in that sense it’s a pro-union policy,” Sunak told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said the new ultra long-haul band was fair because it meant “the further you’re flying, the more emissions, then you will pay a higher rate”. Sunak was asked why he did not simply increase the levy for longer haul flights and leave domestic air-passenger duty at its current level, instead of cutting it significantly. “We could have done, but we wanted to deliver on a previous commitment to reform air-passenger duty to return to the system that we used to have so people flying within the UK are not taxed twice, which we never thought was right,” the chancellor said. “It supports the union, it supports regional airports, which are big employers. But also aviation in general only accounts for about 7-8% of our overall carbon emissions and, of that, I think domestic aviation is less than 5% – so it is a tiny proportion.” Asked if the UK should be showing moral leadership on the issue, given it will be pressing other countries to drastically increase their commitments to tackling climate change by trying to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, Sunak said: “We’re a country that has decarbonised faster than basically any other advanced nation over the past 10, 20, 30 years, so I think our track record on this is pretty good, actually. “In my small responsibility on the finance side, last week the UK was named the world’s best place for green finance anywhere in the world … I feel pretty confident about our leadership on this issue.” However, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who stood in for Keir Starmer in the Commons on Wednesday after he had tested positive for Covid, said: “We wouldn’t have gone ahead with that cut. “I find it astonishing that the week before Cop26, when we are supposed to be showing global leadership, we have cut air-passenger duty on domestic flights. We should be encouraging people to use our train network for those journeys, not cutting APD on domestic flights.” She added: “If you’re a banker on a short-haul flight sipping champagne, you would have been cheering at the budget yesterday. If you’re on a modest income and you’re worried about the rising cost of living, frankly there was very little to cheer.”",Autumn budget 2021; Rishi Sunak; Airline industry; Airline emissions; Cop26; Climate crisis; Business; Environment; Politics; UK news,UK news
2021-09-06T09:00:17Z,"Europe’s top 25 banks failing on green pledges, campaigners warn",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/europes-top-25-banks-failing-on-green-pledges-campaigners-warn,"Europe’s 25 largest banks are still failing to present comprehensive plans that address both the climate crisis and biodiversity loss, putting their sustainability pledges in doubt, campaigners have warned. While some lenders such as NatWest are demonstrating leadership on specific issues – such as net zero targets and policies restricting financing for new fossil fuel – research by investment campaign group ShareAction found none of the banks it reviewed were taking action across all key areas. These are: biodiversity; exposure to high-carbon sectors; policies restricting services to sectors such as oil and gas; and linking executive pay to progress on climate issues. ShareAction said banks should expect protest votes against their directors unless they shape up and start following best practices of their peers. “Where investors are dissatisfied with banks’ responses, ShareAction encourages investors to vote against directors and to file and vote for shareholder resolutions on climate change and biodiversity at banks’ 2022 AGMs,” the campaign group said. The study found that executive pay policies are failing to encourage major change across Europe’s largest lenders. In many cases, pay is only linked to cutting carbon emissions from the bank’s offices and branches rather than curbing loans for carbon heavy industries. NatWest, ING and Credit Agricole are the exception, according to the report, either incentivising their chief executives to set climate targets impacting the loans they extend to certain sectors, or linking pay to specific climate commitments such as the implementation of their coal policies. While 20 of Europe’s 25 largest banks have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, only Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest and Nordea have committed to halving their financed emissions by 2030 to ensure they are on track to meet those goals. Financed emissions are linked to the companies or projects to which banks offer loans or underwriting services. The report added that Barclays was also the only bank that had a policy covering capital market underwriting, in which investment banks help companies raise money through the issuing of shares, despite the practice being responsible for 65% of banks’ fossil fuel financing. “Our research shows that there is a large disparity between the credentials of leaders and laggards on each environmental issue,” said Xavier Lerin, ShareAction’s senior banking analyst. “There is no excuse for banks which have not yet adopted the leading practices of their peers, though it should also be noted that, in many cases, even the leading practices in the sector continue to fail basic litmus tests on climate and biodiversity.” Banking lobby group UK Finance said the sector fully supports the government’s goal of reach net zero climate emissions by 2050 and has a key role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. “Lenders are putting climate responsibility at the core of their strategies, making net zero commitments and have already introduced a range of green finance options across their operations”, it added.",Corporate governance; Banking; Climate crisis; Environment; Business; Biodiversity; Fossil fuel divestment; Fossil fuels; Conservation; Energy; Wildlife; Greenhouse gas emissions; NatWest Group; Crédit Agricole,Business
2021-06-04T09:00:36Z,Private finance won’t decarbonise our economies – but the ‘big green state’ can | Daniela Gabor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/04/private-finance-decarbonise-economies-green-state,"The pandemic, we often hear, is forcing a rethink in economics. We are leaving behind one model: the austerity-obsessed small state that outsources the job of macroeconomic stability to unelected central banks. Central banks, in turn, worked to target inflation under a regime of benign neglect for unemployment; it was assumed, meanwhile, that the bond market should and would discipline governments into fiscal rectitude. Now, the Biden administration’s “once in a generation” spending plans suggest a paradigm shift is under way. It puts governments, through fiscal policy (taxing and spending), back in the driving seat. In this sense, macroeconomics has the potential to become more democratic. But are we celebrating too soon? The big test of the paradigm shift, possibly the fundamental test, is how we go about decarbonising our economies. There are two ways to organise the low-carbon transition: through the state itself or through the financial sector. What might be termed the “big green state” approach involves massive public investments in green infrastructure and industries. When private finance recently lamented Biden’s infrastructure plans, it was objecting to a big-state route to decarbonisation that rejects the rhetoric of public-private partnerships. Indeed, the “big finance” approach wants the state – through its fiscal and central bank arms – to simply guide the private sector by changing price signals. In this scenario, the state plays a smaller role, making carbon expensive by forcing companies to pay for polluting. For instance, Germany recently introduced a €25 (£21) tax per tonne of carbon emissions on petrol, diesel, heating oil and gas. Higher carbon prices, the wisdom goes, will incentivise producers and consumers to transition to green energy. Private finance is there to lend the money that this transition requires. The numbers behind private green investment seem to add up: there is now $30tn (£21tn) in ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) assets. The green “rush” is expected to accelerate as central banks move to decarbonise their operations and reduce subsidies to carbon-intensive activities. Take the Bank of England’s plans: under its new environmental mandate, it argues that the transition to net zero must be largely financed by private finance (as opposed to the state), in an orderly fashion that requires central banks to subsidise green and only “escalate” to penalising carbon financiers if, over time, companies fail to meet commitments towards decarbonisation. The strategy of cuddling carbon financiers is at the heart of the Cop26 conference that takes place this year in Glasgow. The hot new private sector gig for high-level public employees is green finance. But the world of “green finance” has injustice and inequality built in. It reduces democratic government action to higher carbon taxes, which often place the burden of decarbonisation on the poor. Government spending is to be directed to “derisking” private infrastructure, to cover the gap between the fees paid by users of essential public services and the commercial rates of return expected by private investors. Yet having privatised public services while hiking carbon taxes on ordinary people threatens a political backlash, which will reduce politicians’ appetite for meaningful decarbonisation measures. It will also reinforce the pressures to trust global asset managers to set the pace of green investment, even though the financiers’ “environmental, social and governance” (ESG) rush is rife with greenwashing: PR exercises that stick green labels on high-carbon activities. This greenwashing is a feature, not a bug, of big finance-led decarbonisation. It allows private finance to both enjoy the green subsidies promised by central banks and to protect profits from democratic forces that may, one day, transition from cuddling to penalising carbon financiers. The big finance approach owes its political appeal to fiscal fundamentalists who point to Covid-19-related surges in public debt to argue that the state simply cannot afford to green the economy. Instead, financiers dangle trillions of ESG investments in front of politicians, seducing them into believing the market will take care of the climate crisis. This validates unambitious carbon politics, as we see all too clearly in the EU’s sustainable finance initiative, which created a green public standards system. Four years after it was launched, this classification system for “sustainable” activity is now under serious threat of greenwashing from member states that want to include natural gas and other dirty activities within its scope. In turn, European commitments to develop in parallel a system that works towards penalising dirty lending have evaporated. Surrendering to vested carbon interests is easier when politicians cannot rely on a plausible green macroeconomic paradigm; instead they are still confronted, on a daily basis, with threats that inflation-concerned central banks will withdraw their protective hand from government bond markets. Indeed, central banks worried about the inflationary pressures triggered by economies reopening are now furiously debating how quickly to allow borrowing costs to rise. Climate activists should be prepared to fight the battle against fiscal fundamentalists with a simple message: the government is not a household. It has central banks on its side, and if there is a macroeconomic lesson the pandemic has taught us, it is that central banks can do a lot. In high-income countries, central banks have bought almost all debt issued by governments in 2020. They can and should continue to work closely with governments to accelerate decarbonisation. We cannot rely on private finance to lead us out of a climate crisis it has systematically contributed to. We have to disempower carbon financiers, and we do that by making the democratic state – not investors – lead the way forward.

2021-08-12T05:00:10Z,"UK spending far more on polluting policies than green ones, says WWF",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/uk-spending-far-more-on-polluting-policies-than-green-ones-wwf,"The UK government is spending many times more on measures that will increase greenhouse gas emissions than on policies to tackle the climate crisis, according to an analysis of the spring budget. Only £145m in the March 2021 budget was devoted to environmental spending, most of it on the post-Brexit emissions trading scheme for industry, according to an analysis by the conservation charity WWF. But the cost of tax breaks to companies to encourage investment came to more than £34bn, while maintaining the fuel duty freeze – for an 11th consecutive year – is costing about £4.5bn in lost revenues. Tensions over the government’s commitment to net zero emissions, and the potential cost of policies to meet the target, are said to be one of the chief bones of contention between the prime minister and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The two are said to have had at least one blazing row recently. In all, WWF found that measures in the 2021 budget that would increase emissions were worth about £40bn. The findings come from a new “budget tagging tool” developed by the charity with help from Vivid Economics, which measures the impact of policy decisions that affect the environment. Isabella O’Dowd, the head of climate at WWF, said: “The spring budget showed a disconnect between the government’s rhetoric and the reality of what it’s doing. The ambition [on emissions-cutting targets] is great, but now we really need to see the policies that will deliver.” She said the landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published on Monday, which found the world was heading for more than 1.5C of global heating within the next two decades, showed how urgent it was for ministers to act. The UK will host vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, this November in Glasgow, aimed at bringing all countries together with new national commitments to cut emissions in line with the ambition of the Paris agreement of holding temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown are likely to become more devastating. “With nature in freefall and the climate in crisis, the clock is ticking for the planet,” said O’Dowd. “It’s not yet too late to prevent global warming rising above 1.5C – that is in our hands. But the UK government must play its part by keeping every climate promise it has made.” She said separate estimates showed the UK could benefit to the tune of about £90bn in the form of new jobs, health benefits and infrastructure if the government took a greener approach to investment and spending. A spokesperson for the Treasury said the government rejected the WWF analysis. “These misleading claims fail to recognise the £12bn we already pledged to spend in support of our 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution. The budget built on that with further funding allocations and ambitious plans on green finance, and the UK Infrastructure Bank, which will help finance green projects across the UK.” In the budget, Sunak announced a new measure that would allow companies to claim their spending on certain productivity investments, plus an extra 30%, against any tax they owed. This “super-deduction” was spoken of at the time as a measure that could help to spur green investment. However, there is no guarantee that any of the investment covered by it will be green, and critics have pointed out that companies investing in new fossil fuel development could claim the tax break. WWF urged the government to put in place a “net zero test” so that all policies would have to be proven to contribute to the net zero emissions target, or at least be compatible with it, in order to be adopted.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Green economy; Green politics; Environment; UK news; Cop26; WWF; Climate crisis; Conservatives; Rishi Sunak; Boris Johnson; Politics,Environment
2021-10-16T07:00:11Z,Boris Johnson’s climate credibility at stake in run-up to Cop26 summit,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/16/boris-johnson-climate-credibility-at-stake-cop26-summit,"Boris Johnson faces a significant test of his leadership before the Cop26 climate summit as the chancellor and business secretary are at war over the imminent plan for reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions. The government is poised to publish its long-awaited net zero strategy on Monday, setting out how the UK will meet its targets to cut CO2 emissions by 78% by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050. This will also include the heat and buildings strategy for insulating draughty homes and phasing out gas boilers, along with a massive expansion of offshore wind, and building electric vehicle charging networks. But green campaigners are concerned that the strategies, put forward by Kwasi Kwarteng are being hamstrung by opposition from Rishi Sunak, who is refusing to provide adequate funding. Failure to put forward a viable and well-funded blueprint for reaching net zero would destroy the UK’s credibility at a crucial time, campaigners have said, just weeks before the UN Cop26 climate talks, which begin in Glasgow at the end of this month. Ed Matthew, campaign director at green thinktank E3G, said: “To achieve an ambitious outcome at Cop26, the government has to lead by example. If they don’t have their own house in order on how to reach net zero, how are they going to persuade the rest of the world to get on track? The whole diplomatic strategy is absolutely dependent on having a credible plan in place in the UK.” Kwarteng has spoken publicly in favour of decarbonising electricity generation by 2035, and is pushing net zero behind the scenes. This is a new departure for the business secretary, who comes from a strongly free-market viewpoint, as one of the authors of Britannia Unchained. But insiders claim the pandemic has changed his outlook, and that he has undergone elements of a “green” conversion – though he is also still intent on licensing new oil and gas in the North Sea. “With the pandemic and the energy crisis, he is seeing a need for government intervention,” said one close observer. “Energy security is now a key theme, and building renewables can help with that.” But Sunak, who controls the purse strings, is understood to be strongly opposed to devoting new cash to the climate effort. He was notably silent on the climate, net zero strategy and Cop26 in his speech to the Tory party conference earlier this month. “It’s astonishing that he did not mention climate change: the single greatest threat the UK economy is facing, and with Cop26 approaching,” said Matthew. “Without the Treasury, we can’t be on track for net zero, because we need not just the policies but investment – this is the litmus test.” A government source denied any split and told the Guardian: “This is a whole government approach: every department has signed up to net zero and the prime minister is the biggest proponent of this agenda. The preparation of the strategy with the Treasury has been smooth.” The Treasury is also due to publish on Monday its own net zero findings, in the form of a review that is expected to set out the costs of reaching net zero. The Treasury net zero review is controversial among green experts, as the Guardian understands it will not take account of the many benefits of cutting emissions, including green jobs, lower energy bills and health improvements from cutting air pollution, as well as reducing the impacts of extreme weather. “It’s as if the Stern review never happened,” said one expert, referring to the landmark 2006 study by climate economist Nicholas Stern, which found the short-term costs of cutting emissions were far outweighed by the economic benefits. “They have stuck to their old pre-Stern models of cost.” Green campaigners believe the Treasury review will be seized on by climate sceptics in the Tory ranks. They are also concerned that lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has persuaded the government to make hydrogen a leading part of its net zero strategy. That would be a mistake, they argue, as some forms of hydrogen are not low-CO2, but require fossil fuels to be converted into hydrogen and the resulting CO2 stored, in contrast with genuine green hydrogen methods, by which hydrogen is manufactured using renewable energy. “Hydrogen boilers are greenwash,” said Matthew. “They will massively increase energy bills. If they’re considering hydrogen, that’s a bad sign.” Kat Kramer, global climate lead at the charity Christian Aid, said: “The government is currently promoting false solutions that effectively subsidise the fossil fuel industry. It is crazy that they plan to use taxpayers’ money to promote hydrogen made from fossil gas rather than renewables, and for capturing carbon from burned fossil fuels and storing it underground.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to meeting our world-leading climate commitments and the prime minister’s 10-point plan set out £12bn of investment for green industries. “ But they stressed the importance of private sector investment, adding: “Government alone cannot achieve net zero, which is why we are working with the private sector to boost investment and leading the world in green finance.”",Cop26; Climate crisis; Climate science; Boris Johnson; Rishi Sunak; Conservatives; Kwasi Kwarteng; United Nations; Environment; Politics; UK news; Greenhouse gas emissions,Environment
2021-06-13T17:55:37Z,Boris Johnson doesn’t quite get his big moment in the Cornish sunshine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/13/g7-summit-boris-johnson-doesnt-quite-get-his-big-moment-cornish-sunshine-analysis,"Delivering his closing press conference in the Carbis Bay hotel on Sunday, pale golden sand and azure sea visible behind him, Boris Johnson sought to play down the unseemly diplomatic spat that had marred his moment on the world stage. “Actually, what happened at this summit was that there was a colossal amount of work on subjects that had absolutely nothing to do with Brexit,” he insisted. Yet just hours earlier, his foreign secretary had been describing alleged comments by the French president about the status of Northern Ireland as “offensive”. French sources flatly denied that Emmanuel Macron had been suggesting Northern Ireland was not part of the UK – they said he was merely pointing out it is not part of Great Britain (and, indeed, Northern Ireland has a special status under the protocol – which is of course why it exists). Whatever the truth, Johnson’s bilateral meetings this weekend were repeatedly kiboshed by discussion of the ugly standoff over checks on products exported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Rather than play down the row, the prime minister repeatedly leaned into it – saying he needed EU leaders to “get it into their heads,” that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, for example. The UK insists the EU is being too legalistic in how it interprets the protocol; but other G7 countries could have been excused for coming away with the impression that “Global Britain” cannot even get on with its nearest neighbours, and signs up to deals only to try to wriggle out of them later. Away from sausage wars, there were new commitments from the G7 on boosting girls’ education, preventing future pandemics and safeguarding biodiversity. And there was a renewed sense that global cooperation is suddenly achievable again, in a way that was simply impossible in the Trump era, as illustrated by the minimum global tax deal struck by G7 finance ministers last week. But on the two most pressing issues the world faces – the climate emergency and the pandemic – campaigners were bitterly disappointed by the scale of ambition on display. The 1bn vaccine doses the G7 agreed to donate falls far short of the 11bn the World Health Organization’s Tedros Adhanom says are necessary to protect 70% of the world population. He would also like to see the donation deadline brought forward to next summer, from Johnson’s target of the end of 2022. On climate, the G7 reiterated a decade-old promise to “mobilise” $100bn a year in financing, first made at the Copenhagen summit, which has already been about 80% reached. Leaders did commit to increasing their contributions to hit that total – but it was hardly the green Marshall Plan some reports had trailled. They said they would “develop a plan” for a clean, green financing mechanism intended to rival massive Chinese investment into developing countries – but details were scant. Like several announcements over the weekend, the headline appeared not to be backed up with policy detail. At his press conference, Johnson bristled at the idea that the UK’s aid cuts may have undermined his moral authority to press other G7 countries to be more generous, whether on green finance or vaccines. He insisted no leader had brought up the issue of the cuts with him at the summit: and wrongly stated that the UK remained the second biggest donor in the G7 (it is the fifth). But somehow, whether it was lack of diplomatic groundwork in advance, or the lack of trust created by the Brexit row, Johnson’s moment in the Cornish sunshine didn’t quite come off. When it comes to Cop26 in Glasgow in November, when it is not just the wealthiest nations but the whole world the UK must cajole and persuade to back an ambitious climate deal, the challenges will be even greater, and the stakes very much higher.",G7; Boris Johnson; Politics; UK news; Brexit; European Union; Foreign policy; Emmanuel Macron; Northern Ireland; Cop26; Coronavirus; Vaccines and immunisation,World news
2021-07-01T16:17:26Z,"Post-Brexit talks on City access to EU have stalled, Sunak reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/01/post-brexit-talks-on-city-access-to-eu-have-stalled-rishi-sunak-reveals-mansion-house,"Talks to secure City of London access to the EU have stalled, Rishi Sunak has confirmed in his first Mansion House speech to financiers, as he set out sweeping reforms designed to help Britain’s finance industry embrace global opportunities after Brexit. Addressing a hand-picked gathering of 40 young financial workers at a slimmed-down version of what was, in the days before the pandemic, a landmark annual gathering, the chancellor said a deal on a comprehensive post-Brexit financial services settlement with the EU had not happened. “Now, we are moving forward, continuing to cooperate on questions of global finance, but each as a sovereign jurisdiction with our own priorities,” he said. Sunak said Britain would diverge from Brussels’ rules on financial services as he set out a vision for the City. Suggesting the UK would pivot away from Europe, he said he would build instead on deals such as a partnership on financial services signed with Singapore earlier this week – with plans to grow business in the Indo-Pacific, the US and China. He also issued a message to Beijing, however, that deeper economic ties would not come at the expense of Britain abandoning its principles. The annual Mansion House dinner, normally a lavish black tie event at which the City’s leading lights mingle with the ministers of the day, was replaced this year with a low-key breakfast livestreamed on the Treasury’s Twitter account. The gathering was Sunak’s first as chancellor, after the cancellation of last year’s dinner. Speaking from inside the lord mayor’s residence at Mansion House, said Britain now had the “freedom to do things differently and better, and we intend to use it fully”. While his predecessors would have stood over banqueting tables laden with wine and port in the building’s neoclassical Egyptian Hall, the teetotal chancellor gave his address at a lectern with a glass of water. He said a more nuanced relationship was needed while attempting to benefit from the nation’s fast-growing financial services market with assets worth more than £40tn. Former chancellors have used the event to court Chinese business. Sunak sounded a more cautious note, but while dismissing Tory MPs who want to reduce ties with Beijing, he stressed Britain needed a “mature and balanced relationship”. “That means being eyes wide open about their increasing international influence and continuing to take a principled stand on issues we judge to contravene our values,” he said. “After all, principles only matter if they extend beyond our convenience.” He also set out a roadmap for financial sector reforms he said would boost Britain’s competitiveness after Brexit, but said the UK would continue to cooperate with Brussels and set high industry standards. Experts have warned that splitting away from EU rules could make it harder for City firms to do business with continental clients. It comes amid concerns in government over a gradual leaching away of finance business to EU financial centres such as Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin, after Brexit ended unfettered access to the single market for global banks based in London. Amsterdam overtook London as Europe’s largest share trading centre earlier this year, in a symbolic blow to Britain’s status as the most important regional hub for international finance. Government efforts had focused on securing “equivalence” for UK finance industry regulations as part of talks with Brussels, in which the two sides recognise each others’ rules as equivalent to their own. Centred on access for UK-based clearing houses – financial market infrastructure providers which sit in-between banks’ trading activities – Sunak said there was “no reason of substance” why they should not continue to serve EU clients. “The EU will never have cause to deny the UK access because of poor regulatory standards,” he said. It is understood, however, that talks between London and Brussels have stalled, with the chancellor believing the ball is in the European Commission’s court to advance the negotiations, and that the time is right to move forwards with sweeping post-Brexit reforms. As part of a pledge to maintain the City’s competitive position after leaving the EU, the Treasury launched consultations on reforms to the insurance industry, the regulation of wholesale capital markets and rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange. He also promised that tax rates on banking profits should not rise significantly from current levels. The chancellor also confirmed the government would sell green bonds to British consumers, aiming to make the UK the best place in the world for green finance. The Treasury plans to sell £15bn of government bonds, as well as offer savings bonds to consumers through NS&amp;I. • This article was amended on 2 July 2021, to change “leeching away” of finance business to leaching away.",Financial sector; Rishi Sunak; Economic policy; Business; Brexit; Regulators; UK news,Business
2021-07-08T13:46:11Z,Businesses and experts reveal plans for carbon offset regulator,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/08/business-and-finance-group-reveals-plans-for-carbon-offset-regulator,"A new independent body is to regulate carbon offsetting and try to allay fears of greenwashing raised by the controversial practice, under plans put forward by a group of businesses and experts. The regulator, proposed by the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, would begin operating later this year and oversee the issuance of carbon credits, in projects such as tree-planting or forest protection schemes, to businesses who want to buy them to make up for the impact of their own greenhouse gas emissions. However, green campaigners attacked the plans, which they said would not lead to genuine reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Charlie Kronick, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “This plan fails to get to grips with the real challenges of carbon credits – it’s a trader’s charter, written by and for the companies that want to buy and sell pollution, not cut it. It ignores what leading scientists have made clear, that offsetting can’t be used instead of action to directly cut carbon emissions. Polluting companies will be rubbing their hands at the idea that this get out of jail free card allows them to greenwash their ongoing emissions at exactly the time the world needs to dramatically cut them.” The carbon offset market could provide a tenth of the effort needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with staying within 1.5C of global heating, according to the taskforce. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England and envoy to the Cop26 climate talks, said: “[Carbon offsets] could provide a modest but meaningful contribution to the 1.5C goal. Carbon offsets have many benefits. They are complementary, first and foremost [to companies’ efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions] – companies must focus on absolute emissions reductions. Carbon offsets can be catalytic, used to fund projects that would otherwise not be funded, such as new technologies.” The taskforce drew up its roadmap after an extensive public consultation, with more than 130 expert responses. The roadmap sets out legal principles to guide the market and criteria for ensuring that carbon credits are genuine and that they represent real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Bill Winters, chair of the taskforce and group chief executive at the banking company Standard Chartered, said: “Our consultation shows that diverse stakeholders across the world want to see a unified voluntary carbon market, with high-quality credits and legal standards, overseen by a strong and independent governance body. This market will allow participants to trade with confidence, safe in the knowledge that this activity is making a difference to the planet and its people, while complementing their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.” Carbon offsets are controversial because many of the carbon credit schemes used by companies to offset their emissions over the past two decades have been found problematic in various ways. Some fraudulent schemes have been uncovered, in which carbon credits did not exist or did not represent an actual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Other schemes, including schemes investigated by the Guardian earlier this year, have been found to fail to protect forests, allowing logging to continue while selling carbon credits based on keeping forests standing. Frédéric Hache, executive director of the Green Finance Observatory, said: “The elephant in the room is that offsets are fundamentally not about mitigating climate change, or even about removing past emissions, but about enabling future emissions, about protecting economic growth and corporate profits. Carbon offset markets have had an appalling track record for the past 13 years. At a time when Canada is burning, can we really afford to waste another 13 years?” Campaigners also criticise carbon credits based on tree planting, because trees take decades to grow and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while the emissions that companies release into the atmosphere cause global heating straight away. Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at Carbon Market Watch, said the roadmap released on Thursday did not solve these problems: “The taskforce leaves most issues to a future governance body, and allows active market players to participate in that body. This creates a clear and highly problematic conflict of interests, especially since we’re still far away from seeing a clear break from the market’s existing shortcomings.” Though the carbon offset market has been tainted by fraud and failure, there have also been more robust schemes for carbon credits, including a system regulated by the UN called the clean development mechanism, and a system called the Gold Standard, which requires companies seeking credit for their carbon-cutting activities to register and pass various tests. Carney was criticised over a claim earlier this year that the investment firm he works for, Brookfield, was “net zero” because its substantial investments in coal and oil sands were balanced by investments in renewable energy.",Carbon offsetting; UK news; Climate crisis; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mark Carney; Greenpeace; Business,Environment
2021-08-13T10:15:10Z,Treasury blocking green policies key to UK net zero target,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/13/treasury-blocking-green-policies-key-to-uk-net-zero-target,"The Treasury is blocking green policies essential to put the UK on track to net zero emissions, imperilling the UK’s own targets and the success of vital UN climate talks, experts have told the Guardian. A string of policies, from home insulation to new infrastructure spending, have been scrapped, watered down or delayed. Rows about short term costs have dominated over longer term warnings that putting off green spending now will lead to much higher costs in future. The UK’s credibility as host of the Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow rests on a clear net zero strategy – but publication has been postponed until near the eve of the summit, giving the UK little leverage to bring other countries to the negotiating table with the tougher carbon targets needed. Meanwhile, steep cuts to overseas aid have severely damaged the UK’s standing internationally, experts on the UN talks said. Jamie Peters, director of campaigning impact at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Treasury has been helping to fuel the climate emergency for far too long. The reality is that a rapid transition to a zero carbon future would be far less expensive than delaying the green measures we so urgently need, and that will create significant economic opportunities and new jobs.” Civil society groups, thinktanks and political insiders said the Treasury had refused to commit to the spending needed to shift the UK’s economy to a low-carbon footing. Complaints about the potential short-term costs of net zero policies have been one flashpoint during weeks of high tension between the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the Guardian understands. Kate Blagojevic, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, said: “There are strong reports that Rishi Sunak is intent on blocking climate spending at exactly the moment we need it most, and that his fingerprints sit heavily on moves to delay or block crucial investment to cut emissions from buildings or gas boilers.” The lengthy charge sheet against the Treasury includes: scrapping the green homes grant insulation scheme; freezing fuel duty while slashing electric car incentives; mulling cuts to air passenger duty on domestic flights, while making above-inflation train fare increases; failing to cut VAT on green home refurbishment; underfunding the new infrastructure bank; and delaying the phasing out of gas boilers. There have also been glaring omissions and delays. For instance, the transport strategy failed to back road pricing, which many believe will be essential to reducing emissions, which have remained stubbornly high as more people buy SUVs. Both the hydrogen strategy and heat and buildings strategy have been delayed until autumn, as has the overarching net zero strategy. Not all of these policies were under direct Treasury control, but the Treasury holds the purse strings and can effectively veto plans by other departments that require government investment or might raise costs for consumers. “The Treasury is at the root of this,” said Ed Matthew, campaign director at E3G, a green thinktank. “They are completely obsessed with short-term costs. It’s bonkers.” Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The Treasury has this huge institutional resistance to medium term economic benefits [that entail short term costs]. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider it.” Ministers and advisers are understood to be anxious that costs such as switching to heat pumps from gas boilers, estimated from £5,000 to £20,000 for some households, or the higher purchase price of electric cars, will hurt consumers’ pockets. But the independent committee on climate change has said the costs of net zero are affordable and falling, at about 1% of GDP by 2050, while green investment will generate new jobs, and policies can be devised that shift the costs from lower-income households and distribute them fairly. Moreover, as this week’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out, extreme weather is already here and will get worse. As recent flooding has demonstrated, the costs of inaction will far outweigh the costs of action. Even observers normally sympathetic to the government find the Treasury’s reluctance concerning. Josh Buckland, author of a report for the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The Treasury is absolutely crucial to net zero. It has taken some welcome steps thus far to drive green finance and investment, but the jury is still out on how far it is willing to go given wider pressures on the public finances.” Buckland, a former environmental adviser to Johnson, believes that Sunak, known to be a fiscal “hawk” and free-marketeer, is not ideologically opposed to climate action. He said that while the Treasury was traditionally reluctant to commit spending on any issue, Sunak “also has a lot of priorities as we recover from the pandemic”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, disagrees. “Their ideology is standing in the way – they think that it can be done by the market and it can’t. They are held back by thinking this can all be done by the private sector, when all the evidence is that this has to be done by the public and private sectors.” Recent calls by Conservative MPs including Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay to halt the race to net zero, which have received a warm welcome in sections of the press, have suggested that some MPs may also sniff electoral advantage in being seen to be anti-green. Blagojevic said: “The chancellor’s position may be politically expedient for him in trying to court the small number of Tory MPs intent on delaying climate action. Ultimately, though, history will not look kindly if he is the chancellor who tried to hobble our chances of reaching a low-carbon future, with all the growth, good jobs and stable better future it offers.” If the UK is to meet its net zero targets, ministers will have to face down backbench critics. E3G’s Matthew said: “It’s becoming understood [by the government] that you can’t just leave it to the market to deliver net zero, as that isn’t going to happen. For a Conservative government, that’s an inconvenient reality.” Last year, as the world was plunged into recession after the first lockdowns, Johnson appeared to grasp this when he promised to “build back greener”. Since then, however, few spending plans to reduce emissions have been brought forward, other than the green homes grant. Johnson also produced a 10-point plan setting out areas of focus, including nuclear power and offshore wind, but this was dismissed by many experts as a wishlist rather than a strategy. The Treasury said: “The government is committed to tackling climate change and the prime minister has set out an ambitious 10-point plan to help us achieve that. The Treasury is playing a crucial role in this effort, by allocating £12bn to fund the 10-point plan, setting up the UK infrastructure bank to invest in net zero, and announcing plans to issue £15bn in green bonds over the next year.” As the UK prepares to host Cop26, the government will be trying to persuade other countries to set out clear policies on emissions cuts for the next decade, a task much harder if ministers have no policies of their own. Ultimately, says Venables, only one person can sort this out: “The prime minister needs to get stuck in, to make the difficult decisions, and soon.”",Green economy; Tax and spending; Cop26; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Politics; UK news,Environment
2021-05-02T06:45:25Z,"Fifty years after Apollo, space is about to transform our life on Earth beyond recognition | Will Hutton",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/02/nearing-giant-leap-for-mankind-space-possibilities-are-transformational,"The Apollo 11 space mission captured our imaginations in 1969. And it was achingly evocative to hear the recordings of Michael Collins, who died last week, talk about how looking at Earth from space rammed home just how precious our planet is. Last week also marked three other milestones for space. A record $8.7bn has been raised by venture capitalists in the last year to support companies in commercial opportunities from space; France’s Eutelsat joined the UK as a shareholder in the satellite communications company OneWeb; and China launched the first part of its own space station to host three “taikonauts”. We are moving beyond the wonder of watching Collins’s colleagues, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, walk on the moon to something transformational. Space is at an inflection point, about to join electricity, the computer and the railway as a great general purpose technology that will transform economies and societies. To those who dare, whose capitalism and governments have the right alchemy of entrepreneurial zest and public purpose, and who possess the sheer chutzpah to see the possibilities, will fall great prizes. Britain could be among them. Worried about the impact of nearly 10 billion people in 2050 burning fossil fuels that would lift the Earth’s temperature insupportably? Relax. Space is on hand. By then, power-station spaceships in fixed orbit with vast solar mirrors will capture the sun’s rays 24/7, turn them into microwaves and beam them to solar panels on Earth. Sci-fi romanticism? It’s already in the realms of possibility – and is one of the aims of the Chinese space station, with China promising to deliver space electricity as soon as 2030. It also informs the thinking behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX. His reusable rockets can carry material into space to build such power stations at a fraction of current costs. Musk is the man behind Tesla. The global car industry dismissed his vision of battery-operated cars as fanciful. Now Tesla is the coolest car range around, whose stock market value is worth more than the rest of the car industry combined. Getting material into space cheaply – satellites, spaceship power stations and factories – is one of the technologies accelerating the opening up of the territory. I’d back his vision a second time round. Factories? The only way to manufacture flawless fibreoptic cable, print exact copies of body parts such as hearts and lungs, create ultra-light metal alloys from materials such as magnesium that can be used in our bodies, and – more fancifully – reproduce an exact simulacrum of meat is to do it where there is no gravity. Within a generation, there could be space factories manufacturing all of this and more. Back on Earth, we will be transported in satellite-guided autonomous vehicles powered by satellite-generated electricity, eating meat manufactured in space. GPS navigation systems are already satellite-enabled, and that is only the beginning. Space imagery is getting clearer and more precise; satellite imaging identified the vast concentration camps used by China for its forced “rectification” programmes for Uyghurs. It is also possible from space to see who is illegally fishing and mining; which factories are using child labour; what infrastructure is reaching the end of its life; identify what rock formations might contain vital precious metals; anticipate droughts and floods; spot movements of troops and military hardware. Companies are proclaiming their commitment to the UN’s sustainability goals, but don’t, and can’t, fully audit more than a fraction of their global supply chains. The answer is simple: do it from space. Communications are being transformed. Air-traffic control systems for monitoring the whereabouts and the guidance of planes and drones will become wholly reliant on satellites. Universal 5G will best be delivered by the inclusion of constellations of low Earth-orbit satellites – like those to be provided later this year by OneWeb, the space company controversially bought off the receivers last year by the British government, which holds a golden share in the company. This was Dominic Cummings’ finest hour – even if he tried to justify it as a new freedom conferred by Brexit. So how come France can buy a stake, too – to join Japan and, it’s anticipated, Saudi Arabia? But without Cummings’ passionate conviction about Britain needing to have a space communication presence, a reluctant Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would have killed the initiative. Next month the government is to publish its space strategy. It needs to be informed by the same daring that drove the OneWeb purchase. Britain is not China or the US, and leaving the EU has narrowed the possibilities of playing in the big league. But, nonetheless, Britain has assets. Alongside OneWeb are companies specialising in niches – manufacturing nano-satellites and antennae, and monitoring air quality. Leicester and its university is one of Europe’s leading centres for space exploration and manufacture, alongside Harwell in Oxford, and there are plans to make Fawley, Aylesbury, the north-east and Glasgow space innovation sites. The Satellite Applications Catapult (declaration: I am a non-executive director) is doing all it can to promote space-driven commercial activity, researching possibilities and brokering alliances. It has, for example, formed a consortium aiming to promote space-generated solar power, and, with Oxford University, is creating a centre to use satellite-gathered data not only to inform a green finance initiative but to create the AI for Planet Earth Institute, a kind of incipient Jenner Institute – not for frontier vaccines, but to promote sustainability. The public-private framework that worked so well in making Britain an international centre for vaccine manufacture in just 18 months should be applied for space as well. Britain needs to identify two or three areas in which it aims to be global number one – space-based solar power, Earth observation to mitigate climate change, and nano-satellite manufacture. Then we need to deliver on these goals with muscle and energy. We can’t pass this moment up. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Space; SpaceX; Satellites; Solar power; Science; Technology; Energy; Elon Musk,Opinion
2021-08-12T05:28:28Z,Thursday briefing: Pingdemic eases for double jabbed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/12/thursday-briefing-pingdemic-eases-for-double-jabbed,"Top story: ‘Two jabs tip odds in our favour’ Hello, Warren Murray here with your dose of daily news. From Monday, fully vaccinated people in England and those aged 18 or under will no longer be legally required to self-isolate after contact with a positive Covid case. They will instead be advised to take a PCR test and only have to isolate if it comes back positive. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said “getting two doses of a vaccine has tipped the odds in our favour”. The existing rules have led to more than 14m instructions to stay at home. The new regime should also end mass disruption of schooling by allowing the “bubble” system to be abandoned. Meanwhile it has emerged that one in four employers have not been giving staff paid time off for Covid vaccinations. The conciliation service Acas made the finding after a survey of 2,000 businesses. Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights secretary, said there should be government pressure on employers to do the right thing. The CBI said the majority of businesses were doing so and “we’d encourage all companies to demonstrate this same level of consideration towards their employees”. Fewer than one in five people working in cities across the UK had returned to the office by the end of July, figures from the Centre for Cities thinktank reveal. Its report also found nightlife bouncing back in Blackpool, Sunderland, Leicester, Middlesbrough and Wakefield. But night-time footfall in London, Luton and Slough remained unchanged since clubs reopened and social distancing rules were removed. In New Zealand, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said the international border will stay closed until at least the end of the year; while Australia’s capital, Canberra, has gone into lockdown. More developments at our live blog. * * * ‘Fantastic news’ – A breast cancer drug previously rejected for routine NHS use in England has now been recommended by health officials after a discount was agreed with the manufacturer. The decision on abemaciclib – sold by Eli Lilly as Verzenios – has been described as “fantastic news for thousands of women” as it can extend survival and put off chemotherapy in cases of incurable breast cancer. It is given with fulvestrant and targets breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in patients who have not responded to other treatment. * * * Spending climate – The UK government is putting more into worsening the climate crisis than tackling it, according to an analysis of the spring budget. Only £145m was devoted to environmental spending, mostly on the post-Brexit emissions trading scheme for industry, according to the WWF. But company tax breaks to encourage investment came to more than £34bn while the fuel duty freeze is costing about £4.5bn. Tensions over the government’s commitment to net zero emissions are said to be a big bone of contention between the prime minister and the chancellor. A spokesperson for the Treasury said the WWF ignored £12bn pledged for a green industrial revolution as well as “ambitious plans on green finance, and the UK Infrastructure Bank, which will help finance green projects across the UK”. * * * Next minister? – Kemi Badenoch is being tipped to replace Gavin Williamson as education secretary at the next cabinet reshuffle, while the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, says the incumbent should be sacked now for failing children during the pandemic and presiding over a “yawning gap” in attainment between private and state school pupils. Starmer poured cold water on the idea floated in government that letter grades for A-levels should be replaced with numerical 1-9 grading to fix things. “If you just brand it 1-9 it doesn’t solve that problem. The question the government has to answer is: why was the attainment gap so big before? Why is it even bigger now?” * * * ‘Happy to support the bat population’ – The National Trust has revealed the lengths to which it has gone to keep the bat residents of a historic manor house in Norfolk happy during a £6m reroofing project – including specially adapted tiles which they can happily scoot up without slipping off. David White, the National Trust project manager, said it had been a joy – and not a headache – to adapt normal working practices for the bats of Oxburgh Hall. “We’re very keen to support the bat population not just at Oxburgh but at all of the trust’s historic houses.” * * * Slice of history – An ardent royalist has bought the topping from a slice of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s wedding cake for £1,850 at auction, more than 40 years after the couple married. The large piece of cake icing and marzipan base features a detailed, sugared design of the royal coat of arms in gold, red, blue and silver. It was given to Moya Smith, a member of the Queen Mother’s staff, who preserved it with cling film and dated it 29 July 1981. The buyer, Gerry Layton from Leeds, said: “I thought I would like to add it to my estate, which will be going to charity after my death. I also thought that I could put it up as a raffle prize with some of the money going to Centrepoint, which Princess Di was patron of.” The Briefing has always thought marzipan’s longevity rules it out as being food and now here is proof. Today in Focus podcast: Delta blow in Australia Australia appeared to be a model case for how to control the spread of Covid-19, but the arrival of the Delta variant has changed everything. Lunchtime read: ‘I worry my daughters will never know peace’ Families fearful of what will happen to girls and young women as the Taliban gain ground are joining the tens of thousands of displaced Afghans. Sport England head into Thursday’s second Test against India under a cloud after Stuart Broad was ruled out for the remainder of the season and Jimmy Anderson emerged as a major doubt with a thigh injury. Goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was the hero as Chelsea beat Villarreal 6-5 in a penalty shootout to win the Uefa Super Cup. A prominent horse racing trainer has pleaded guilty to involvement in what US prosecutors have called a global scheme to systematically drug horses and cheat the betting public. Even Lionel Messi seemed wowed by the power of Paris Saint-Germain’s new strikeforce, as he described the prospect of combining with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé as “madness”. And Jamaican hurdler Hansle Parchment has tracked down and thanked a Tokyo 2020 volunteer who paid for his taxi to the Olympic Stadium, where he subsequently won a gold medal. Business US aerospace company TransDigm had submitted a 900p-a-share takeover bid for its British rival, Meggitt, trumping an 800p offer from another US bidder, Parker Hannifin. Meggitt, which makes parts for fighter planes, employs 9,000 people worldwide, including 2,300 in the UK, and is the latest to fall prey to overseas bids because of low post-Brexit valuations for British businesses. The bid helped push the FTSE250 index to a record high yesterday, while the senior FTSE100 index looks like heading up 0.2% this morning. The pound is flat at $1.383 and €1.182. The papers The Guardian print splash today is “Revealed: the pandemic boom in child poverty, neglect and abuse”. A Guardian investigation into the state of children’s services has revealed a sharp rise in social services referrals during lockdown, plus spiralling costs for mental health support, a bulging backlog in the family courts and councils buckling under the weight of extra work. Self-isolation and home schooling have placed families under increased financial pressure through unemployment or lost wages, as well as inflaming mental health and addiction problems. Lockdowns have increased domestic violence while safeguarding concerns for children and young people have gone undetected with schools and nurseries closed. The Daily Mail leads with “British ‘spy sold terror secrets to Putin’”, about the arrest of an employee at the UK embassy in Germany. Similar in the Mirror – “Russia spy sold secrets” – which also has major pictorial coverage on the front for the stabbing death of a father-of-two in London. “Embassy security fears after spy arrest” says the Telegraph. The front of the Times carries that one as well though its top story is “Charles ‘sees no way back to public life for Andrew’”. “Plan to keep schools safe from Covid-19: air purifiers” – the i headline seems a bit sarcastic, whether or not intentionally, about the pilot in Bradford, which it says could be rolled out nationwide. “Return to the dark ages” – the Metro splashes on world news, namely the Taliban’s grim advance in Afghanistan. “Rishi warned on ditching pension pledge” – that old favourite, the triple lock, is back in the news in the Express.

2021-04-03T12:00:37Z,The dirty secret of  so-called 'fossil-fuel free' buildings,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/03/dirty-secret-fossil-fuel-free-building-embodied-carbon-building-glass-steel-blocks,"Hanging plants smother the walls of a new office block proposed for Salford, giving it the look of something from an abandoned post-Covid city, reclaimed by nature. The ivy-covered tower, designed by Make Architects, has been trumpeted as “fossil-fuel free”, set to run on 100% renewable energy and reach net zero operational carbon, with tenants enjoying the “biophilic” benefits of dangling foliage. But not everyone is convinced. “It’s strange to see something described as ‘fossil-fuel free’ when it is made of concrete, steel and glass,” says Joe Giddings, coordinator of the Architects Climate Action Network (Acan) campaign group. “The production of these materials entails burning a huge amount of fossil fuel. “The climate emergency is not a game and we can’t just spin our way through it. We need to think about where our materials come from, how they’re made and interrogate the whole supply chain – from construction to demolition and reuse.” In the race to reach net zero carbon by 2050, a commitment to which the UK is legally bound, Acan sees the biggest unchallenged obstacle as the energy consumed by construction. Much is made of the proposed energy efficiency of buildings once they are occupied, but so far very little attention has been paid to the carbon emitted in getting them built, and eventually dismantled – from extracting raw materials and manufacturing components, to the toxic byproducts of demolition leaking out in landfill. Acan estimates that this “embodied carbon” accounts for up to three-quarters of a building’s total emissions over its lifespan, a proportion that is only going to grow as the energy grid becomes increasingly decarbonised with the rise of renewables. With the built environment contributing about 45% of the total carbon emitted in the UK, the embodied energy of construction has become the vital element to focus on. “Government regulation is really lagging behind,” says the architect Simon Sturgis, founder of carbon consultancy Targeting Zero. “Over the next 60 to 70 years the most immediate problem will be construction emissions, and it’s something that is not even considered by the building regulations at the moment. “It is quite straightforward to address: very significant carbon reductions can be made for very little cost.” Sturgis recently co-authored a section of the new London Plan, which mandates a “whole life-cycle carbon” assessment for new developments for the first time – a policy used in the Netherlands since 2013. No targets have been set, but developers of big schemes referred to the mayor will now have to calculate the projected emissions of their proposals over their entire lifespan, including construction, demolition and disposal, and show how they have tried to reduce the carbon consumption. “It’s about choosing things slightly more carefully,” says Sturgis. “Using less concrete and more timber, or specifying recycled aluminium for window frames. “It’s also crucial to understand the relationship between improving operational emissions and the carbon costs of doing so. Triple-glazed windows might reduce heating requirements, but their embodied carbon is vast.” He is highly critical of glass-walled office towers, arguing that, while they may boast environmental credentials, they have a huge amount of built-in obsolescence, given that their glazing systems are often only guaranteed to last for 30 years. You would expect these towers to last at least a century,” he says, “but they have a big embodied cost when these deep, triple-glazed units will have to be replaced so often.” As it stands, there is no incentive for manufacturers to make their components last longer. Despite the lack of regulation, there is a growing consensus in the industry that more has to be done. The major professional bodies – including the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institution of Structural Engineers and the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers – have all provided guidance on embodied carbon assessment, and called on the government to intervene. The environmental engineer Clara Bagenal George, of Elementa Consulting, recently produced a guidance document for assessing the embodied carbon of building services equipment (including heating, lighting, plumbing, etc), a crucial part of the jigsaw that has largely been ignored until now. “When you do a retrofit project, the services equipment can represent 80% of the embodied carbon,” she says. “It’s the hidden element, which often needs upgrading over time.” Building services and plants typically use a high proportion of steel, aluminium, plastics and copper in their construction, as well as rare earth elements for key components, such as permanent magnets in motors and phosphors for lamps. Solar panels, for examples, often contain lead, cadmium and other toxic chemicals that cannot be removed without breaking apart the entire panel, while there are difficulties in recycling the glass due to impurities. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimated there was about 250,000 tonnes of solar panel waste in the world in 2016, and has projected the amount could reach 78m tonnes by 2050. Insulation is another testy topic. The most efficient, foamed plastic type of insulation is also the most polluting, with as much as a tenfold difference in embodied carbon between synthetic and natural alternatives, says Sturgis. In the absence of national policy, it seems hard-nosed financial incentives are encouraging developers to act. With the increased prevalence of green finance options, and conditions recommended by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, proof of a climate-conscious approach is becoming necessary to secure certain sources of funding. British Land, developer of the Leadenall Building (the “cheese grater” tower) in the City of London, recently introduced an internal levy on its carbon emissions, essentially taxing the carbon of its own projects to create a fund that is used to retrofit its existing building stock. It has also linked its employees’ annual bonuses to the embodied carbon figures, which has already resulted in a preference for refurbishment over demolition. The government’s new future homes standard makes no mention of embodied carbon, but there is a growing group of MPs calling for change. Last week, the environmental audit committee launched an inquiry focused specifically on the carbon footprint of construction and the sustainability of the materials used. It follows on from a report last month in which the committee recommended introducing embodied carbon targets for the construction of new homes, so as to increase demand for low-carbon materials. It also recommended cutting VAT on refurbishment, which has long been urged by the industry, as it is often the deciding factor in whether to demolish or retrofit: at present, new builds are VAT-exempt but renovations are not. “One positive of the pandemic is that it has made people realise that rapid change is possible, and often desirable,” says Sturgis. “Government departments are all scrambling to find out more about zero carbon. It seems that Boris Johnson has realised that Joe Biden is all over the climate agenda, so he’d better get all over it too.”",Green building; Climate crisis; Planning policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; The RIBA; Energy efficiency; UK news; Sustainable development; London; Construction industry; Architecture,Environment
2021-07-01T05:24:44Z,Thursday briefing: Covid concerns over Euro 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/01/thursday-briefing-covid-euro-2020,"Top story: Downing Street says matches will go ahead as planned Good morning, Graham Russell here to welcome you to today’s briefing. Concerns have been raised about the safety of the later stages of Euro 2020 and other major sporting events after it emerged almost 1,300 Scotland fans have tested positive for Covid after travelling to London for the match against England. Opening games up to 60,000 fans “send a message to 60 million fans at home that the danger has gone away” and could “create the potential for spreader events in virtually every household”, warned Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the Sage subcommittee advising the government. The Euro 2020 final and semi-finals are to be held at Wembley. The news came as 26,068 positive test results were reported across the UK on Wednesday, with 3,887 in Scotland – the highest daily total north of the border since the start of the pandemic. Downing Street said it would study the data but that the remaining Euro 2020 matches would go ahead as planned. In vaccine news, some GPs are administering second jabs up to nine weeks earlier than the official NHS advice, and giving them to 16-year-olds, prompting concern about a postcode lottery. Doctors say their unofficial and “pragmatic” policy is boosting the immunisation drive. There are also calls to expand the list of official Covid symptoms, amid concerns cases are being missed. The UK lists only three symptoms for Covid, while the US has 11, and the World Health Organization 13. The man who was filmed manhandling Chris Witty has apologised and says he has lost his job over the incident. “If I made him feel uncomfortable, which it does look like I did, then I am sorry to him for that,” said Lewis Hughes, claiming he would have let go of the “shy” chief medical officer if he had asked him to. * * * Trump Org charges – Criminal charges have reportedly been laid against Donald Trump’s company after a three-year investigation. The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, face tax-related offences, which remain sealed but are expected to involve alleged violations related to benefits for top executives, possibly including use of apartments, cars and school tuition, people familiar with the case said. No charges are expected to be brought against Trump personally, though separate, unrelated investigations are under way in New York. * * * EU citizens unsettled – Home Office helplines for EU citizens applying to remain in the UK were reportedly jammed last night in the minutes before the midnight deadline. At two minutes to midnight, the Home Office was showing a 44-minute queue, though the Home Office said it was allowing those in the queue before midnight to continue with their application. It came after rights watchdog the Independent Monitoring Authority warned of reports workers were being threatened with the sack or being removed from housing waiting lists if they did not know their status by tomorrow. * * * ‘I am furious’ – The surprise overturning of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction has caused outcry, with figures including E Jean Carroll saying the move would deter women from coming forward in future. Cosby’s trial, held after more than 50 women came forward with stories of being drugged and assaulted by the comedian, was the first significant celebrity conviction of the #MeToo era. The organisation Women in Film said: “Today’s news is a setback in the fight for justice for sexual assault survivors.” A court in Pennsylvania ruled a previous prosecutor had struck a “non-prosecution agreement” with Cosby, and so he should not have been charged. The court also barred a retrial. * * * Batley and Spen – Voters go to the polls today in a closely watched byelection that could have repercussions for Keir Starmer’s leadership of the Labour party. The leader’s spokesman yesterday played down the prospect of a victory by saying it “has always been a marginal seat”. There are concerns George Galloway could attract enough votes to allow the Conservatives to scrape home. Nevertheless, another defeat would be greeted with horror by Labour MPs in potentially vulnerable red wall seats. * * * Diana statue – Princes William and Harry will appear side by side today to unveil a statue of their mother at Kensington Palace in what is expected to be “a very personal moment for the family”. A small ceremony will be held on what would have been Diana’s 60th birthday in the Sunken Garden, one of her favourite spots at her former home. Five gardeners have spent 1,000 hours and planted more than 4,000 flowers to get the “calming” spot ready. * * * Today in Focus podcast: How a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong died Apple Daily was a beacon of free speech. Now it has been forced to close by China’s sweeping national security law. Does its demise signal a new chapter in Hong Kong? The Today in Focus team speaks to a journalist at the paper, plus Helen Davidson, reporting from Taipei, and China affairs correspondent Vincent Ni. Lunchtime read: ‘I never saw autistic girls in books’ “In job interviews, I was saying that I wanted to see more books with disabled characters in them that were not traumatic, boring or educational, but fun and full of life.

Here, she speaks to Alison Flood about how she got her big break (kind of by accident). Sport Andy Murray dipped into the bottomless reserves of willpower that have sustained him for so long and emerged, somehow, with another win to reach the third round of Wimbledon by defeating Oscar Otte of Germany in five sets. The raw power of Aryna Sabalenka eventually overwhelmed Katie Boulter’s guile and resilience in the women’s draw, but Emma Raducanu capped an otherwise excellent afternoon for British players in the singles with a successful debut. Gareth Southgate has predicted that Harry Kane is poised for liftoff at Euro 2020 after his late goal in the emotional 2-0 victory against Germany in the last 16 at Wembley. Tottenham have appointed Nuno Espírito Santo as their new manager after a protracted search to find a permanent replacement for José Mourinho. England clawed their way to a five-wicket win in the second one‑day international at Taunton with 15 balls to spare, coming out on top in a close contest against India thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Sophia Dunkley. Joe Root has promised that England will leave “rest and rotation” behind them and is aiming to take advantage of the development by pushing his way back into the Twenty20 squad after a two-year absence. Tadej Pogacar landed the first real blow in the battle for final victory in the 2021 Tour de France, winning the 27.2km individual time trial from Changé to Laval. The women’s 400m world champion Salwa Eid Naser will miss the rearranged Olympic Games this summer after she was handed a two-year ban over missed drug tests between March 2019 and January 2020. And Simone Biles and her family have opened up about her time in foster care and the process of being adopted by her grandparents. Business The pubs, cafes and restaurants may have been closed – sparking an industry crisis of its own – but about 90% of British households increased their calorie intake during the pandemic, a study has suggested, with home working a factor.

The papers Lots of slips and jabs across today’s front pages. The Times leads with a report that Covid booster jabs and flu shots are to be given simultaneously from September, as does the Mail. Both also feature Wimbledon slip-ups – of Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray respectively – amid concerns the court is too slippery. The Guardian focuses on safety fears over mass sporting events during the pandemic, and gives its main picture to the unprecedented heatwave sweeping North America. The Telegraph continues its education campaign, saying headteachers have been told not to send home an entire school bubble if one Covid case is reported. It also features the jab-in-each-arm plan, and this time it’s Nick Kyrgios falling over on Court No 1. Metro sympathises with England fans who will not be able to travel to Rome to see the quarter-final against Ukraine. “Three Lions go to Rome alone” is the headline. The Sun also goes with the footie, mocking up Harry Kane as Michael Caine’s 60s character aiming to do an “Italian Job on Ukraine”. Uncommon bedfellows as both the Mirror and the Express splash on Harry and William getting together for today’s statue unveiling (“Reunited for mum” and “Heal the rift for Diana’s sake, Harry” are the headlines). The FT reports on the US and Japan conducting military drills in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan.

2020-11-17T22:30:24Z,"Boris Johnson announces 10-point green plan with 250,000 jobs",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/17/boris-johnson-announces-10-point-green-plan-with-250000-jobs,"Boris Johnson has announced plans for the government’s self-styled green industrial revolution, bringing praise from environmental groups but also questions about the scale of new funding, and the planned expansion of nuclear and hydrogen power. In a move aimed at retaking the initiative after a politically turbulent few weeks, the prime minister said the 10-point plan would create up to 250,000 jobs, with much of the focus aimed at the north of England, Midlands, Scotland and Wales. But Labour called the plan “deeply, deeply disappointing” in ambition, saying it would neither properly tackle the climate emergency nor the jobs crisis caused by coronavirus. One of the points is the previously trailed pledge to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, 10 years ahead of the previous schedule. Another existing promise is to quadruple the amount of offshore wind power capacity within a decade. Greenpeace said the measures marked a notable step forward for tackling the climate emergency, saying: “This landmark announcement signals the end of the road for polluting cars and vans and a historic turning point on climate action.” However, the group warned the scheme also had flaws. “It’s a shame the prime minister remains fixated on other speculative solutions, such as nuclear and hydrogen from fossil fuels, that will not be taking us to zero emissions anytime soon, if ever,” said Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics. The programme is billed as costing £12bn, with Downing Street saying £8bn of this is new. However, Labour said it believed only £4bn was new spending. The 10-point plan comprises: A ban on combustion engine sales by 2030, with grants for electric cars, and funding for charge points. The sale of some hybrid cars and vans will continue until 2035. A previously announced pledge to quadruple offshore wind power by 2030, to 40GW, enough to power every UK home. Moves to boost hydrogen production, with the promise of a town heated entirely by hydrogen by the end of the decade. Investment of £525m towards new nuclear power, based on “the next generation of small and advanced reactors”. £1bn next year for funds to insulate homes and public buildings, using the existing green homes grant and public sector decarbonisation scheme. An extra £200m invested in carbon capture initiatives. Support for greener energies in the aviation and maritime sectors, with £20m committed to the latter. 30,000 hectares of trees planted every year, as part of nature conservation efforts. Moves to promote public transport, cycling and walking, although no new schemes were announced. A pledge to make London “the global centre of green finance”. While Johnson said the plan would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, while “making strides towards net zero by 2050”, Labour said it was “a pale imitation” of the green stimulus package needed. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, whose plan for a green Covid recovery involves £30bn spent over 18 months, said the No 10 proposals were low on ambition and contained several “reheated pledges”. “People are losing their jobs now,” Miliband said. “This isn’t fundamentally a green stimulus, it’s nowhere near the scale of what is required. “This announcement doesn’t remotely meet the scale of the jobs emergency or the climate emergency. France and Germany are investing tens of billions of euros. This provides, at best, £4bn of new money over several years. “What we needed was a really bold green economic stimulus, and what we got was a pale imitation of that. It’s deeply, deeply disappointing.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, condemned the plan as vague and underpowered. She said: “This is a shopping list, not a plan to address the climate emergency, and it commits only a fraction of the necessary resources.” Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, said the plan was “a fantastic platform” ahead of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow next year. She said: “But technology alone can’t cut emissions and restore nature. The government will need to follow this up with an ambitious pledge to cut emissions by 2030 in line with the Paris agreement.” The Confederation of British Industry’s acting director general, Josh Hardie, said the plan “represents a clear statement of intent from the government”. He said: “It gives a springboard to the huge opportunities for UK-wide investment and green jobs that a true low-carbon economy can bring.” Nicola Shaw, the UK executive director of National Grid, said:“The prime minister has set out great ambition for the net zero transition including commitments on offshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. We also welcome the earlier ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles and the support for the rollout of electric vehicles which will help improve the country’s air quality. “Now, industry and government must work together to turn this ambition into reality, with transformational investments to deliver real change, which will create jobs in every part of the country.”",Green politics; Climate crisis; Environment; Boris Johnson; UK news; Politics; Nuclear power; Motoring; Automotive industry; Renewable energy; Wind power; Greenhouse gas emissions; Carbon capture and storage (CCS),Environment
2020-11-25T10:08:20Z,"Mathias Cormann talks up 'green recovery' in OECD pitch, despite record in office",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/25/mathias-cormann-continues-to-talk-up-collective-green-recovery-in-vision-statement-for-top-oecd-job,"Australia’s former finance minister Mathias Cormann is continuing to talk up the importance of a “collective green recovery” on the campaign trail to be the next secretary general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In a “vision statement” for the position obtained by Guardian Australia, Cormann says undertaking “effective global action on climate change is a must and we must get to zero net emissions as soon as possible”. “Climate policy responses will increasingly need to factor into long-term planning,” Cormann says. While arguing that different countries and regions across the world will have “different opportunities to make the strongest possible contribution to our collective emissions reduction outcomes”, Cormann says, through the OECD under his leadership, “we can come together to share ideas about our collective green recovery effort on our journey towards a low-emissions future”. “As secretary general I will strive to make the OECD a place that inspires collaboration and action in support of a sustainable future”. Cormann says the economic recovery efforts to Covid-19 are “a key opportunity to target support towards investments that drive the development and commercialisation of new technologies”. The green recovery pitch is outlined in a vision statement document which has been sent by Australia to all ambassadors with a vote in the OECD selection process. Ambassadors have also been sent an official biography and a “letter of motivation” which cites Cormann’s experience as finance minister during the Covid-19 pandemic as evidence he can navigate complex economic challenges. As well as the pandemic response, Cormann also highlights his experience as the government Senate leader to make a case that he can bring diverse groups together “across policy and ideological differences”. The OECD has previously criticised Australia for its performance on climate change. Its membership is dominated by European countries and Australia’s climate change contribution has been queried by those with more ambitious emissions reduction commitments. In an attempt to undercut Cormann’s current diplomatic offensive with European countries, the Australian Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has also written to the ambassador of every nation that has a vote in the OECD nomination process to warn that appointing him as secretary general would be “a blow to tackling climate change”. Bandt points to Cormann’s vote to “repeal Australia’s successful carbon price” in 2014 and his attempts as a senior Abbott government minister to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. In 2011, Cormann characterised a carbon tax on Twitter as “not effective action on climate change” and “an act of economic self-harm which does nothing to help global emissions”. In 2016, he said Australia’s economy was “in better shape because we scrapped Labor’s carbon and mining taxes and implemented our plans for jobs and growth”. Bandt has told ambassadors: “As finance minister, he tried to abolish the very same green finance bodies he will no doubt be promoting as evidence of his green credentials for the job.” More recently, Bandt said Cormann has been a senior member of the Morrison government that has pushed for a “gas-led recovery”. “Unfortunately, Mr Cormann’s record on climate change has been to block action at every turn during his years as a senior minister in the Australian government,” Bandt wrote. Labor has supported Cormann’s nomination for the position, but on Wednesday the party’s Senate leader Penny Wong told the ABC if the former finance minister was ultimately knocked back by selectors, “I would venture this view, which is that the fact that Scott Morrison has been so isolated on climate, refused to be part of the solution, simply continues to be part of the problem – that would be a big reason why.” The Morrison government has been pressed by some business groups, environmentalists and the Climate Change Authority to use the recovery from the coronavirus recession to direct economic stimulus towards the transition to a low-emissions future. But while the prime minister is gradually warming up on the idea of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 – with a noticeable shift in rhetoric after Joe Biden won the American presidential contest – the Coalition has declared it will instead champion a “gas-led” recovery from the pandemic. Cormann is using an RAAF aircraft to travel around Europe – at a rate likely to be about $4,300 an hour – and has been given a support team of about eight staff. The taxpayer-funded travel has created political controversy. Cormann has already held meetings in Turkey, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, and has further visits planned to Austria, the Slovak Republic, Hungary and France. Guardian Australia has been told Cormann also plans to travel to the South American countries of Chile and Colombia to press his case. In his first public defence of the taxpayer-funded campaign on Wednesday, Scott Morrison said Cormann’s travel was “funded by the government because we’re taking this bid very seriously”. “The reason we need him to do that in the air force jet is because Covid is running rampant in Europe,” the prime minister said during an interview with the Sydney radio station 2GB on Wednesday. “I mean, there really wasn’t the practical option to use commercial flights in the time we had available, because of Covid. I mean, if Mathias was flying around on commercial planes, he would have got Covid. The risk of that was extremely high.”",Mathias Cormann; Australian politics; OECD; Australia news; Climate crisis; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Australian Greens; Coalition; Adam Bandt; Energy,Australia news
2020-11-24T05:41:58Z,Greens push OECD  to reject Mathias Cormann's leadership bid,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/24/greens-push-oecd-to-reject-mathias-cormanns-leadership-bid,"OECD members are being lobbied to block Mathias Cormann’s leadership bid because of the Coalition’s climate record, as the Australian government defended its financial backing for the former minister’s jet-setting campaign around Europe. After Guardian Australia reported Cormann’s use of a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft was likely to cost about $4,300 a flying hour, the foreign affairs and trade department said: “If we want international institutions such as the OECD to thrive, we must step forward and offer to lead them.” But in an attempt to undercut Cormann’s outreach to European countries, the Australian Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has written to the ambassador of every nation that has a vote in the OECD nomination process to warn that appointing him as secretary general would be “a blow to tackling climate change”. Cormann has recently embraced the language of a “green recovery” from the pandemic and has defended the Coalition’s climate record. But Bandt’s two-page letter – seen by Guardian Australia – urges the OECD’s 36 members excluding Australia to support a candidate with a better track record. Bandt points to Cormann’s vote to “repeal Australia’s successful carbon price” in 2014 and his attempts as a senior Abbott government minister to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. “As finance minister, he tried to abolish the very same green finance bodies he will no doubt be promoting as evidence of his green credentials for the job,” Bandt wrote. More recently, Bandt said Cormann has been a senior member of the Morrison government that has pushed for a “gas-led recovery”. “Unfortunately, Mr Cormann’s record on climate change has been to block action at every turn during his years as a senior minister in the Australian government,” Bandt wrote. “I ask that your country supports an OECD secretary general candidate who has a strong record on acting on climate change, and someone who can provide genuine leadership as the OECD focuses on a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.” Labor has appeared reluctant to criticise the Cormann campaign because it has pledged support for his OECD candidacy but said on Tuesday the Morrison government should put as much effort into getting stranded Australians home by Christmas. The opposition’s health spokesman, Chris Bowen, said Labor had shown “a greater maturity and willingness to put the national interests first” than the Coalition did when it blocked Kevin Rudd’s bid to run the United Nations. Bowen said it was a matter for the government to justify and explain the use of the RAAF jet. Fellow Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten said thousands of Australians wanted to return home and he wished Scott Morrison would “spend as much time worrying about them as perhaps Mathias Cormann getting some votes in Europe”. “For every flight that Mathias Cormann gets flying around Europe, how about you bring home another thousand Aussies before Christmas?” It is understood Cormann flew to Europe on 8 November and is spending several weeks travelling around the continent to promote his candidacy, but the government is not expected to report the full costs of the campaign until the end of the process. The government has set up a website to promote his candidacy. Cormann met in recent days with European Commission representatives in Brussels after talks in Germany, Luxembourg and Slovenia, according to his social media posts. The ABC reported his initial journey to Europe involved a Canberra to Perth to Muscat flight on the RAAF jet, with a refuelling stop in the Maldives. He arrived in Turkey to begin the campaigning. Cormann has also been to Denmark and Spain. It is unclear how much has been spent on hotels, flights and other costs. When asked to disclose the total campaign budget Dfat pointed to Morrison’s announcement last month that Cormann would be Australia’s candidate. Dfat indicated it was supporting the campaign because Cormann was Australia’s candidate and because the government wanted to play a greater role in the OECD. “The OECD is a pillar of global economic governance and a core multilateral organisation,” Dfat said. “Australia has benefited significantly from participation in the OECD over nearly 50 years of membership. While we have played an active role in areas of interest, we have not yet had a leadership role.” The OECD has criticised Australia for its performance on climate change. Its membership is dominated by European countries and Australia’s climate change contribution has been queried by those with more ambitious commitments. Cormann talked up the importance of pursuing “a green recovery with an increased reliance on renewables” last month when he addressed a business conference organised by Germany. When asked by Guardian Australia about those remarks, Cormann said: “Of course we are in favour of an environmentally friendly green recovery.” He argued Australia had “a very strong track record when it comes to economically responsible effective action on climate change” and insisted the domestic debate had been about “the how” not whether. The defence media unit has not yet responded to a request for comment on the costs of Cormann’s use of the RAAF jet. Records from the final six months of 2019 indicate flying the Dassault Falcon 7X comes at a cost of $4,305 a flying hour.",Mathias Cormann; OECD; Australia news; Australian politics; Global economy,Australia news
2021-07-20T07:47:14Z,US seeks cooperation with China on climate but not at any price,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/us-seeks-cooperation-with-china-on-climate-but-not-at-any-price,"In the next four months or so, the world will find out whether it is possible for one branch of the US federal government – the state department - to accuse Chinese officials of committing genocide, and for another branch – led by the special envoy on climate change, John Kerry – to persuade China to transform the way its dirty economy operates. Is it possible simultaneously to compete for mastery of the world and to collaborate to save that world? The outcome of this diplomatic experiment will become known at the British-hosted Cop26 in Glasgow convened to try to put the world on course for only 1.5C of warming. All countries are expected to produce their nationally determined contributions – how much they will reduce their carbon footprint. British officials insist Cop26 is about more than China and the US, but without these two players, jointly responsible for 40% of global green house gas emissions, nothing meaningful is achievable. At issue are conflicting perceptions of modern China’s willingness to work with the west, its trustworthiness, and how best to influence a new superpower that fervently believes delivery of domestic economic prosperity is the basis of its legitimacy. There is also the issue of how well central government’s writ runs. In China, after all, “the mountains are high and the emperors far away”. The hugely energetic Kerry has insisted it is possible to secure his climate goals with China, but in a separate silo to his diplomatic colleagues. He argues that his turf “is a freestanding international crisis, which all of us need to deal with, no matter what”. Kerry even took the trouble to hold a January press conference to insist climate change negotiations were sui generis, and need not be contingent on concessions in other domains. He wanted to kill at birth the notion that China could buy America’s silence on human rights as the price of cooperation on climate. China’s actions on climate would not be allowed to give it any leverage over other issues, Kerry insisted. During his successful cooperation with China in the run-up to the UN Paris climate accord in 2015, he often got Ryan Hass, his close ally in the state department, to insist “US climate negotiators never were authorised to trade away other issues in pursuit of Chinese cooperation on climate”. When Kerry visited Shanghai in April, he vowed that his relations with Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate envoy and an old ally, were his sole concern. The two of them agreed a joint statement on the “climate crisis”, a phrase the Chinese government had not used before. The Chinese have been more sceptical about the possibility of ringfencing climate talks. The foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, in January warned: “Unlike flowers that can bloom in a greenhouse despite winter chill, China-US cooperation in specific areas is closely linked with bilateral relations as a whole.” But now some US progressives, alarmed at the slow pace of the climate talks, have urged the Democrats to adopt the strategy Kerry has disavowed. They demand that Biden prioritise cooperation with China on climate change, and soft-pedal on its anti-China rhetoric. “Nothing less than the future of our planet depends on ending the new cold war between the US and China,” 40 progressive groups warned in a letter to Joe Biden last week. The letter provoked outrage among the China hawks who dominate Washington. Rebecca Peters from the London thinktank Chatham House sees the case for caution. “A big difficulty is that, as the strategy consolidates in Washington around competition as the defining feature of the US relationship with China, we are risking a lot. China needs to do more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and its dependence on carbon intensive industries, but centring America climate policy around confrontation will not produce the necessary changes we need.” Malin Oud, China director at the Wallenberg Institute, says: : “The big question is whether pragmatic cooperation on climate is possible, or are we, as Biden would have it, engaged in an epic global contest between democracy and autocracy, or is it possible, like the EU tends to do, to say we should see China as necessary cooperation partner on climate cooperation, an economic competitor and then a systemic rival so we compartmentalise these issues.” Others, such as the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, wonder whether foreign diplomats can sway Chinese thinking or the trajectory of its carbon emissions, and say it is “more a case of letting domestic imperatives drive China’s creeping environmentalism”. That is the view of many British diplomats. “The most effective thing we in the west can do to encourage China is to set an example,” said one diplomat, something British ministers admit they failed to do at the G7 by still not meeting the pledge to provide $100bn (£73bn) a year green finance, a pledge first made in 2009, and now seen as totemic by some developing states. Speaking at a recent Chatham House seminar Byford Tsang, senior policy adviser with the climate diplomacy team at E3G, a European thinktank, insisted China was transitioning. “China has come a long way since the era of the Cop summit in Copenhagen 11 or 12 years ago when it was seen as an obstructor, and regarded climate targets as a device to hold back the developing world. Xi Jinping’s announcement at the UN general assembly last year about a Chinese phase-out of carbon put China at the time a step ahead of many developed countries, including Korea, the US and Japan.” The announcement, Tsang said, was designed to put climate centre stage in Chinese foreign policy, no longer seen as burden on economic development, but instead through green tech an opportunity. “Xi sees climate as a way of developing a more credible, respected and loveable image of China.” So when Xi unilaterally announced at the UN last year that China was planning for its carbon emissions to peak by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, it was truly monumental, and according to Carbon Tracker, the single most impactful announcement ever made by a state, worth a reduction of 0.3% in global emissions. But just as European leaders were caught by surprise so were many Chinese officials. Now western diplomats anxiously question whether Chinese high-level rhetoric is being matched by actions, not just within China, but in how it frames its international interventions including the flagship belt and road initiative. The disappointment came with the subsequent 14th five-year plan covering the period to 2025 [ published in March]. In the 75,000-word text, “carbon neutrality” was mentioned just once. The two key binding targets – 18% carbon intensity and 13.5% energy intensity reductions from 2021-2025 – left ample room for an absolute growth in emissions. Many within China had pressed for a cap, but were rebuffed. Xi, at the Biden-hosted climate leaders’ summit in April, went a little further saying that China would strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period to 2025 and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period”. Tsang says this is not enough. “To reach the global target, China has to move on its current targets so China should set its emissions peak well before 2030, and instead as early as the middle of this decade. It would have to stop the building of all new coal power plants as soon as possible, and end all unabated coal production by 2040-45.” But that is not happening, climate analysts argue. The figures show China is in the in the throes of a post-Covid “smokestack recovery”. China’s CO2 emissions have grown at their fastest pace in more than a decade, increasing by 15% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021, a report for Carbon Brief showed. The post-pandemic surge meant China’s emissions reached a new record high of nearly 12bn tonnes in the year ending March 2021. That is some 600m tonnes (5%) above the total for 2019. Indeed if China’s emissions through 2021 as a whole match the growth seen over the past 12 months, no further increases would be possible during 2022-2025 if China’s carbon emissions are to peak in 2025. Lord Stern, and many other experts, have said it is by 2025, and not the later Chinese deadline of 2030, that Chinese emissions must peak if it is to meet net zero target in 2060. China’s economy is inherently skewed to big industry, especially steel and cement, but there is a clear political conflict inside China between those that still advocate coal as a reliable source of energy security against the west and those that regard energy decarbonisation as a viable alternative. Trying to work out which side is winning is hard. But British diplomats highlight a clutch of encouraging signals suggesting advocates of Xi’s brand of ecological civilisation is in the ascendancy. They point to a speech by Xi in March saying meeting the 2030 target was “a big test of our ability to run the country”. Construction on the world’s largest coal chemical project in Yulin has just been summarily ended. China’s much delayed emissions trading scheme, the world’s largest and covering 13% of global emissions, will finally be introduced in July. China’s banks are trying to inject green thinking into infrastructure lending. Prof Astrid Nordin, the Lau chair of Chinese international relations at King’s College London, believes the Chinese leadership has genuinely come to see fighting climate change as in its national self-interest. “The east coast of China – where all the wealth exists – is vulnerable to rising sea levels and the north is very vulnerable to desertification. Poisoning of land and pollution of water has left a wake of illness and disease. Environmental pollution may become a core source of protests, and even risk the foundations of one-party rule.” Xi, she argues, believes the Chinese tradition of thought and planning provides a narrative that makes his country better equipped than the wayward west to combat climate change. There is still hope Xi, possibly at the next UN general assembly in the autumn, will announce an earlier target for emissions to peak. But there are a myriad of ways between now and Glasgow in which Kerry’s model of compartmentalised diplomacy could collapse. China, for instance, has been accused of running its solar industry using forced labour linked to an ongoing genocide. Nearly 40% of the world’s polysilicon, a key component of solar panels, is manufactured in China’s northwest Xinjiang region. China’s explosive growth is also leading to calls among British MPs for China no longer to be treated as a developing country. Though this may sound like a symbolic change, the impacts on China’s climate ambitions would be far-reaching. Xi may say as he did in a speech this week that China will, “forever belong to the family of developing countries”. That claim is no longer true. A further problem is the pursuit of energy efficiency intersects with the competition over technology. Michal Meidan, director of the China energy programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, has explained “geopolitical tensions” and “technological rivalry” between China and western countries could hinder the collaboration needed to improve Beijing’s storage capacity. Finally climate change could play into the US-China rivalry contest for world leadership. Beijing has explicitly said the Chinese model “can provide a new path for all developing countries to modernisation”, and regards its belt and road initiative as living proof. At the G7 the west came up with B3W, “Build Back Better World”, an explicitly green alternative to BRI. Barbara Woodward, the British ambassador to China, at a peace forum ahead of the Chinese Community party’s 100th centenary challenged the Chinese foreign policy specialist Prof Yan Xuetong for claiming China was exercising “benevolent authority” rather than “hegemony”. She said: “Leadership is not about establishing authority. Leadership is about effecting change. And in a world of interdependence, change comes through cooperation. And cooperation puts a premium on trust and goodwill. Good leaders lead by listening, and not dismissing genuinely held views and concerns. By not responding to scrutiny with fragility. By setting the right tone and injecting the right substance for international engagement.” Meaningful dialogue was important to avoid a case of “chicken talking to duck”, a Chinese phrase referring to talking but not communicating. So disputes over China’s continuing carbon splurge could yet seep out, and then start to reinforce, and merge with the matrix of issues over which China and the west are in open contest. At this point chicken and duck will need to find a common language.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; John Kerry; China; Joe Biden; Xi Jinping; Xinjiang; World news; Cop26; Environment; US news; Asia Pacific,Environment
2020-07-23T23:01:00Z,MPs to check if the government's green plans are fit for purpose,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/24/mps-to-check-if-the-governments-green-plans-are-fit-for-purpose,"MPs plan to scrutinise the government’s green economic plans and industrial strategy to test whether they are still fit for purpose in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The government will face two separate inquiries into its plans, by the Treasury and business department parliamentary select committees, to question whether its existing policies will help or hinder sustainable post-pandemic economic growth. The fresh examination comes following a damning report from parliament’s financial watchdog which accused the government of an “astonishing” failure to plan for the economic impact of a possible flu-like pandemic. The cross-party public accounts committee concluded that government schemes were drawn up “on the hoof” weeks after the Covid-19 outbreak, and that the delay risked leaving sectors of the UK economy behind. The fresh investigations will focus on whether the government’s existing plans for green finance, a decarbonised economy and a sustainable industrial strategy go far enough to help companies recover from the financial shock of the pandemic. The Treasury select committee initially opened an investigation into the government’s plans to “decarbonise” the UK economy last summer, but plans to reopen the inquiry to question how the UK’s response to coronavirus should take the UK’s climate targets into account. The government’s green spending plans have already come underattack by green groups which have pointed out that the proposed £3bn to spur a green economic recovery falls well short of Germany’s £36bn investment, and French government’s £13bn plans. Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, said “clearly much has changed” in the economy since the committee began its investigation, “so now is the time to ask whether the government can seize the opportunity presented by the crisis to further green the economy to achieve net zero by 2050”. “Whether the level of Treasury support should depend on how much companies pollute, or if it should directly fund green infrastructure, are some of the issues that we would like evidence on,” Stride said. The Treasury committee has called for evidence on whether the Treasury’s financial support packages should distinguish between polluting and non-polluting companies, whether there should be direct funding for green infrastructure as part of its coronavirus spending package, and whether the government’s policies should change in the wake of the coronavirus to fuel the UK’s 2050 climate targets. At the same time, the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee plans to open a new line of investigation within its “super-inquiry” into the UK’s post-pandemic economic growth, to test whether the government’s plans pose any barriers to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Darren Jones, the chair of the BEIS committee, said its inquiry will examine whether the government’s current industrial strategy is “genuinely strategic”, and whether it is focused on “the right sectors, issues and policy areas”. “Fundamentally, we want to look at whether the government’s industrial strategy is properly designed and implemented to encourage the growth of a more productive, inclusive and sustainable economy which generates wealth, innovation and high-quality jobs,” Jones said. “We are keen to hear the views of businesses, from SMEs and bigger companies too, about their thoughts on the barriers to growth and whether the industrial strategy is working for them in terms of providing the right environment to deliver sustainable investment, a skilled workforce, and high-quality jobs,” he added.",Green economy; Economic policy; Industrial policy; Economics; Coronavirus; Business; UK news; Environment,Environment
2019-02-28T17:00:43Z,Out on its own: Australia the only country to use climate funding to upgrade coal-fired plants,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/01/out-on-its-own-australia-the-only-country-to-use-climate-funding-to-upgrade-coal-fired-plants,"Australia is the only developed country that allows climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants, green finance experts say. Experts say allowing Vales Point coal-fired power station to register with the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund, rebadged this week as a “climate solutions” policy, puts Australia out of step with the World Bank, Europe and the US, which have all rejected using climate financing for coal power retrofits. The World Bank has issued US$13bn in green bonds since 2008 to stimulate spending to combat global warming. China has used green bonds to help build new coal-fired plants to replace older, dirtier stations on the grounds it reduces nitrogen-based emissions causing the country’s oppressive air pollution. But it announced in December it would no longer consider “clean coal” plants – which still emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas – investments in green technology. Sean Kidney, chief executive of the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative, says China’s shift leaves Australia out on its own. “If you were committed to meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the Australian government says it is committed to, this is just lunacy,” Kidney says. “No investors in the western world will accept any green bonds that incentivise anything like coal station retrofits. From an investor’s perspective, coal is a dead duck.” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, says Australia is moving across the trend by considering giving taxpayer support to coal. In addition to the potential support through the climate solutions fund, the government is considering underwriting the cost of building new coal-fired power stations. In the past fortnight, mining giant Glencore has said it will cap coal production in response to pressure from shareholders, while Rio Tinto stressed it was the only large mining company with no fossil fuel investments, having sold its final coal assets to Glencore last year. “At a time when private-sector capital is increasingly looking for low carbon and decarbonisation opportunities, it would seem to be swimming against the tide to put government taxpayer funding into these [coal] activities,” Herd says. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that limiting global warming to 1.5C – a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement – would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. While global markets increasingly recognise a decline in coal use is inevitable, the shift away from it has been fitful. The Global Carbon Project found global emissions were likely to have hit a new high in 2018, in part due to an increase in coal burning in China. It bucked a global decline in emissions from coal in 2015 and 2016. Though it has been registered, Vales Point coal plant is yet to bid for money from the emissions reduction fund due to a dispute over whether it needs to reduce its carbon intensity to less than the grid average to win a government contract. The plant’s owners say the project would reduce emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant’s emissions over that time. The environment minister, Melissa Price, has backed the interpretation of the Clean Energy Regulator, which says the project does not qualify in its current form. The company disagrees, noting former environment minister Greg Hunt said the fund could be used to “clean up” power plants and that published guidelines explicitly said coal could win backing. The methodology is being reviewed by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee. Even if Vales Point is not successful, critics such as the Australian Conservation Foundation say there is nothing preventing other coal-fired plant owners from applying for a climate subsidy. Major companies are being paid from the fund for other fossil fuel projects: South African miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant the company says it would have built regardless; Rio Tinto has received $2m for a diesel-fired power plant at a bauxite mine. With prime minister Scott Morrison announcing the Coalition would top up the $2.55bn fund with an additional $2bn over a decade, economists and environmentalists have called for emissions from fossil fuels to be dealt with through different policies and for the fund to focus on projects that restore or protect natural habitat. Experts say the scheme will be improved if the government tightens the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was promised to limit emissions from big industry but which has largely allowed major companies to nominate their own pollution. National emissions have increased each year since the emissions reduction fund replaced the abolished carbon price scheme in 2014. Money from the fund is distributed via reverse auction, with land owners and businesses bidding for contracts to reduce emissions cheaply. Analyses have found some projects under the fund have merit but it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere.",Emissions trading; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Business; Australia news; Coalition; Liberal party; Australian politics,Environment
2021-11-23T11:08:43Z,"Boris Johnson’s much-criticised speech to the CBI, in full",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/23/boris-johnsons-much-criticised-speech-to-the-cbi-in-full,"Boris Johnson’s speech to the CBI has been called a “mess”, the “most embarrassing by a Conservative prime minister” since his most recent PMQs performance. It is said to have capped off a “pretty bad bloody fortnight” and left the prime minister struggling to command the confidence of his party. In it he referenced Peppa Pig, “funkapolitan” cafes and his time as motoring correspondent of GQ. Then he lost his place. So how bad was it? Here is the official transcript, judge for yourself: “Great to be here in Tyneside, the number one exporting region of the UK. Great to be with the CBI. And I want to begin with a massive thank you to British business for keeping going, for looking after your employees, for rising to the challenge, for responding to the call for ventilators in those first dark days. Dozens of you – kitchen appliance makers, hairdryer makers, Formula One motorcar manufacturers – turning your production lines over in days to try to save lives. For making the masks and the gowns and the gloves at such speed, turning things round from that awful moment when we realised we simply didn’t have the domestic production. So we have gone from being able to supply 1% of our domestic needs to 80%. And thank you British industry, enterprise, commerce, for producing not just one but perhaps half a dozen vaccines. Because, without you, let’s face it, we would simply not be here. And nor would tens of thousands of people in our country and millions around the world who owe their lives to your resourcefulness and inventiveness. And while I’m on the subject can I ask: who has had your booster? You all look far too young and thrusting to need a booster but get your booster as soon as you can because it is by vaccinating our country that we have been able to get your staff back to their place of work, to open our theatres, our restaurants and to get back for longer now than any other comparator country to something like normal life; even if we are still bumping elbows and wearing masks. I am not going to pretend that everything is going to be plain sailing – we can see the state of the pandemic abroad, the supply chain issues that we’re facing, the pressure on energy prices that we’re all facing, the skills shortages. But don’t forget, folks, my friends, it was only last year they were saying we would have an unemployment crisis now on the scale not seen since the 1980s or 1990s. They were forecasting 12% unemployment. And what have we got? Thanks to you – thanks to the resilience of British business – we have employment back in work at pre-pandemic levels. It was only last year that we experienced the biggest fall in output in a century as we were forced to lock down the economy. Well, look at us now. Thanks to you and thanks to British business bouncebackability, we are forecast to have the fastest economic growth in the G7. And I was there in the 70s and 80s and 90s. And I remember mass unemployment and the misery and the drain of the human spirit. And I would much rather have our problems today, which are fundamentally caused by a return in global confidence and a surge in demand. Because now we have a massive opportunity to fix these supply-side problems, to transform whole sectors of our economy and to tackle the chronic problems underlying the UK economy. The woeful imbalance in productivity across the country, but also the imbalance between British business between the go-getting world-beaters represented by so many people in this room and the long comet tail whose potential is, frankly, yet to be realised; that don’t have the skills – particularly the IT skills, as Rishi the chancellor so often points out – that don’t have the banks behind them, that don’t have the investment. And that is the mission of this country: to unite and level up; of this government, to unite and level up across the whole country. And I’ve got to be honest with you, it is a moral mission. As you get older, the funny thing is you get more idealistic and less cynical. It’s a moral thing but it is also an economic imperative. Because, if this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, and, if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, then there would be absolutely no stopping us. And we would achieve what I believe we can, and become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe. And, today, fate has handed us an opportunity to do that. When the first Industrial Revolution began 250 years ago, it was British industry that had first-mover advantage. For hundreds of years, we maintained that pace. Right up until the beginning of the 20th century, we were producing more coal, smelting more iron, building more ships and boilers and making more machines than virtually any other country on Earth. And today, we are on the brink of another revolution: a green industrial revolution. And again, there are many ways in which we have first-mover advantage. And today, I want to tell you in the CBI how Britain is going to win in the new green industrial revolution – provided we act and act now. I have had some pretty wonderful jobs in my life. But among the most purely hedonistic I would rank motoring correspondent of GQ magazine. I drove Ferraris, Maseratis, Nissan Skylines, Proton Sagas. You name it, I drove it. And I learned to admire the incredible diversity of the UK specialist motor manufacturing sector, which is actually the biggest in the world. And I have spent hours in the traffic listening to the porridge-like burble and pop of the biggest and most sophisticated internal combustion engines ever made. And I have heard that burble turn into an operatic roar as I have put my foot down and burned away from the lights at speeds I would not now confess to my protection officers. In that time, that great era, I only tried two EVs – electric vehicles: an extraordinary wheeled rabbit hutch that was so tiny you could park it sideways and I tried the first Tesla for sale in this country for GQ, that expired in the fast lane of the M40 – they’ve got a lot better. And when, a few years later, as mayor of London, I tried to get London motorists to go electric and we put in charging points around the city, I must confess that they were not then a soaraway success. And they stood forlorn like some piece of unused outdoor gym equipment. But 10 years after that, the tipping point has come, hasn’t it? UK sales of EVs are now increasing at 70% a year. And, in 2030, we are ending the market for new hydrocarbon ICEs – ahead of other European countries. And companies are responding. Here in the north-east, Nissan has decided to make an enormous bet on new electric vehicles and, together with Envision, there is now a massive new gigafactory for batteries. And around the world, these cars are getting ever more affordable. And at Glasgow two weeks ago, the tipping point came, as motor manufacturers representing a third of the world market – including the EU and America – announced that they would go electric by 2035. And, of course, Glasgow was far bigger and more important than that: 250 years after we launched the first Industrial Revolution, we are showing the world how to power past coal. When I was a kid, 80% of our electricity came from coal. And I remember those huge barges taking coal up the Thames to Battersea power station and those four chimneys belching fumes into the face and lungs of the city. By the time I became mayor, Battersea was a wreck; closed for being simply too polluting and good for nothing except the final shootout in gangster movies. But, in 2012, we were still 40% dependent on coal. Today, only 10 years later, coal supplies less than 2% of our power and, by 2024, it will be down to zero. And Battersea, of course, is a great funkapolitan hive of cafes and restaurants and hotels and homes, thanks to the vision of the former mayor. And every time I made that point to leaders in Glasgow – about the speed of the switch that we’ve made from coal – I could see them thinking about it and I could see them thinking ‘right, OK, maybe this is doable’. And, when I was a kid, literally 0% of our energy came from wind. And it seemed faddish and ludicrous to imagine that we could light and heat our homes with a technology that dated from ninth-century Persia, I think. And yet, today, look at the coast of the north-east where we are today: row after row stretching out to the North Sea, of beautiful white mills, as we claim a new harvest rich and green from the drowned meadows of Doggerland. And, on some days, we derive almost half this country’s energy needs with the biggest offshore wind production anywhere in the world – and growing the whole time. And that tipping point having been reached, the pace of change is now going to accelerate like a new Tesla. Because I can tell you, as a former motoring correspondent, EVs may not burble like sucking doves and they may not have that arum arum araaaaaagh that you love. But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari. And we are now embarked on a new epoch and, in just a few years’ time, after almost a century of using roughly the same technology, we are going to change radically. We are going to change radically our cars, our trucks, our buses, our ships, our boats, our planes, our trains, our domestic heating systems, our farming methods, our industrial processes, our power generation, and much else besides. And I can tell you the force driving that change, it won’t be government. And it won’t even be business – though business and government together will have a massive influence. It will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, the disciples of David Attenborough – not just in this country but around the world – who can see the consequences of climate change and who will be demanding better from us. And I confidently predict that, in just a few years’ time, it will be as noisome, offensive to the global consumer to open a new coal-fired power station as it is to get on a plane and light up a cigar. And, as the world reaches this pivotal moment post-Glasgow, it’s vital that we recognise not just the scale of the challenge, but the opportunity now for British business and industry. Because, in the end, it is you – it is businesspeople – who will fix this problem. Governments don’t innovate, governments don’t produce new products and get out and sell them in the market place. And, though governments can sell, governments can spend tens if not hundreds of billions, we know that the market has hundreds of trillions. And yet we also know that government has a vital role in making that market and in framing the right regulation. And to ensure that you, the British business, succeeds in this new world, we have set out a 10-point plan for government leadership; a new Decalogue that I produced exactly a year ago when I came down from Sinai and I said to my officials, ‘the new Ten Commandments thou shalt develop’: 1. Offshore wind 2. Hydrogen 3. Nuclear power 4. Zero-emission vehicles 5. Green public transport, cycling and walking 6. ‘Jet zero’ and green ships 7. Greener buildings 8. Carbon capture and storage 9. Nature and trees 10. Green finance And for each of those objectives, we are producing a roadmap so that you in the private sector can see the opportunities ahead and what you need to do. And we are regulating so as to require new homes and buildings to have EV charging points – with another 145,000 charging points to be installed thanks to these regulations. We are investing in new projects to turn wind power into hydrogen and the net zero strategy is expected to trigger about £90bn of private sector investment, driving the creation of high-wage, high-skill jobs across the UK as part of our mission to unite and level up across the country – not just in the green Industrial Revolution, of course, but in all sectors of the economy. And to help you and to build the platform to give you the advantage you need, we are now waging a cross-Whitehall campaign to solve our productivity puzzle and to rebalance our lopsided economy, fixing our infrastructure with investment on a scale not seen since the Victorians. And we must begin with energy and power generation if we are going to have, allow our manufacturing industry to succeed, we must end the unfairness that UK, high-energy intensive manufacturing pays so much more than our competitors overseas. And that’s why we are going to address the cost of our nuclear power and we are all now paying for the historic under under-investment in nuclear power. Which country first split the atom? Which country had the first civilian nuclear power plant? It was this one. And why have we allowed ourselves to be left behind? Well, you tell me. So we are investing not just in big new nuclear plants but in small nuclear reactors as well. And we are consulting on classifying this essential technology as “green investment” so that we can get more investment flowing in and ahead of the EU. Lenin once said that the communist revolution was Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country. Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin, Tony, before the CBI, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country. We are electrifying our cars, we are electrifying our rail – last week we announced three vast new high-speed lines, cutting the time from London to Manchester by an hour and creating a new Crossrail of the North, cutting the time from Manchester to Leeds from 55 to 33 minutes, a Crossrail for the Midlands, cutting journey times from Birmingham to Nottingham from one hour and 14 minutes to 26 minutes. But these plans are far richer and more ambitious than some of the coverage has perhaps suggested. To solve this country’s transport problems, you can’t just endlessly carve your way through virgin countryside. You have to upgrade and to electrify; you have to use the tracks that already exist and bring them back into service. And we are doing the Beeching reversals – that’s putting in lines that were taken out, sadly, in the last century. You have to put other transport networks as well, you have to put in clean buses, you have to improve – 4,000 new clean green buses we’re putting in. And, of course, you have to fix the roads as well. We cannot be endlessly hostile to road improvements. And we have to do it now, we have to fix it now. I know that there are some people who think that working habits have been remade by the pandemic and that everyone will be working only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday in an acronym I won’t repeat. I don’t want to be dogmatic about this, but I have my doubts. And it is not just that young people need to be in the office to learn, and to compete, and to pick up social capital, there are also sound evolutionary reasons why mother nature does not like working from home. So I prophesy that people will come back, Tony, they will come to the office and they will come back on the roads and the rail. But people also want choice and that is why we must put in the gigabit broadband – as we are – which has gone up massively just in the last couple of years from 7% when I became PM to 65% at the beginning of next year. And, with safer streets, with great local schools, with fantastic broadband … [Lost it] [Uhhh] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] [Forgive me] … people will have the confidence to stay nearer the place they grew up to start business and business will have the confidence to invest. And then, of course, there is one thing that business wants and that this country needs far more than a hundred supersonic rail links, far more than broadband, and that is skills and the people that you all need to staff your business. It’s an astonishing fact that the 16- to 18-year-olds in this country are getting 40% less time and instruction than our competitors in the OECD, and so we’re turning that round. We are focusing on skills, skills, skills; investing in our FE colleges, our apprentices, in the knowhow and confidence of young people. And, since – as everybody knows – 80% of the 2030 workforce are already in work, we are giving every adult who needs it the chance to get a level-three skill – £3,000 for a lifetime skills guarantee. We are supporting bootcamps for everything from IT to entrepreneurship. And, at this pivotal moment in our economic history, we are taking advantage of our new freedoms to deliver freeports, as well as free trade deals, and to regulate differently and better to lengthen our lead in all the amazing new technologies of the 21st century: AI, cyber, quantum computing and all the rest – and all the applications of those technologies to the areas in which we excel. So you get fin tech, ed tech, bio tech, med tech, nano tech, ad tech, green tech. So you sound basically like 15th-century Mexico. And that is what this country is doing. There are only three countries that have produced more than 100 tech unicorns. And they are, as you will know, well which are they? Let’s see who’s been paying attention to any of my speeches in the last few … which, which three nations have produced more than 100 tech unicorns? [Audience-member: The United States, China and the UK.] Correct. They are the US, China and the UK. And the wonderful thing about the more than the 100 tech unicorns is they are dispersed now far more evenly across the whole of the UK than the tech unicorns of some of our rival competitor economies. And that is a fantastic thing. We want to see the dispersal of this growth and development across the UK. That’s why this government has doubled investment in scientific research – and, again, we want to see the benefits of that research across the whole of the country. But, in the end, and this is the most important message of all, there are, there are limits to what governments can do. And I just want to be absolutely clear about this – because this has been an extraordinary period. There has been the financial crisis of 2008 – where government had to intervene on a massive scale, then Covid – when government had to intervene on a massive scale. But government cannot fix everything and government sometimes should get out of your hair. And government should make sure there is less regulation and, indeed, less taxation. And the true driver of growth is not government, it is the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector And Tony, yesterday, I went as we all must to Peppa Pig World. Who’s been to … hands up anybody who’s been to Peppa Pig World? Not enough. I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place – it had very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass-transit systems, I noticed. Even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World – I’m surprised you haven’t been there – was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly, well a sort-of Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC would now be exported to 180 countries, with theme parks both in America and in China, as well as in the New Forest. And a business that is worth at least £6bn to this country – £6bn and counting. Now, I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? Peppa Pig? And no government in the world – no Whitehall civil servant in the world – could conceivably have come up with Peppa. So my final message to you, as we stand on the brink of this green industrial revolution and we prepare to use our new regulatory freedoms in what I believe will be a very strong post-Covid rebound, we are blessed, we are blessed not just with capital markets and the world’s best universities and incredible pools of liquidity in London and all the … the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, we are also blessed with the amazing inventive power and range of British business. And that, above all, is what fills me with confidence, members of the CBI, for the days ahead. Thank you very much for your kind attention this morning, thank you.”",Boris Johnson; Confederation of British Industry (CBI); Business; Politics; UK news; Conservatives,Politics
2021-04-19T06:00:24Z,So what has the rest of the world promised to do about climate change?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/so-what-has-the-rest-of-the-world-promised-to-do-about-climate-change,"Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia, home of the world’s biggest industrial polluter, the state-owned oil company Aramco, has long been regarded as a climate villain, accused of collaborating with other energy-producing states at international negotiations to water down ambitions and obstruct progress. Its 2015 NDC set a target of reducing emissions by up to 130 MtCO2e (million tonnes of CO2 equivalent) by 2030 compared with a business-as-usual scenario, a target that many analysts have described as inadequate. Assessing progress towards this modest goal has also proved impossible – the kingdom has not published any official projections of its emissions nor even defined the business-as-usual baseline it is measuring against. Independent assessments have concluded that based on the scant information that is available, the country is not on track to meet its pledge. Yet under the influence of its young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its dependence on oil in the decades ahead in recognition its supplies are not infinite, demand is falling and the world is searching for less destructive alternatives. To that end, it has announced a slew of environmental initiatives, including plans to generate 50% of the kingdom’s energy from renewables by 2030 and to plant 10bn trees, that have raised hopes it will take a more ambitious plan to Glasgow in November. In remarks to a state media agency, Prince Mohammed drew a direct link between the climate crisis and the health of Saudi citizens, signalling a potential shift in the Saudi attitude towards environmental issues. Analysts say achieving serious cuts in Saudi emissions would require significant changes that will be politically unpopular. Earlier grand announcements including plans to build massive solar farms have also failed to translate into meaningful action. But the Gulf state appears to be recognising that weaning itself off fossil fuels is becoming a political and economic imperative, as well as an environmental one. Michael Safi South Africa South Africa published a draft updated NDC last month (March), with ambitious targets to limit its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 398-440 MtCO2e by 2030, but many campaigners and analysts raised significant concerns about its continuing commitment to coal, which supplies 85% of South Africa’s power. A combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and a long term economic shift away from extractive industries and manufacturing has already helped South Africa move towards meeting some of its emission goals, but further progress will depend on massive investment in the country’s power sector, improvements in energy efficiency, a green transport strategy and a carbon tax. Gwede Mantashe, minister of mineral resources and energy, last month announced plans for a £2bn investment in renewables to accelerate a shift from coal power generation, but again there are concerns that few of the measures outlined in the updated draft NDC are likely to be implemented in a timely fashion, if at all. “South Africa’s target is far too weak … Our government’s answer is basically that they are going to continue polluting a lot for decades to come, but a little less more than they were going to do before,” said Dr Alex Lenferna, secretary of South Africa’s Climate Justice Coalition. South Africa has suffered rolling power cuts over recent years, which have dealt a crippling blow to an already struggling economy, and are forecast to continue for at least five years. But money is short. South Africa has already accessed about $2bn a year in 2018 and 2019 to meet adaptation and mitigation needs but will need four times more annually by 2030 to meet the targets laid out in the NDC. Jason Burke in Johannesburg China While China’s leader, Xi Jinping, pledged in September 2020 that China will increase its NDC commitments in order to peak the country’s carbon emissions before 2030, details of how it would get there have not yet been released. That “increased ambition” so far is not seen as ambitious enough; Climate Action Tracker, for instance, still rates China’s commitments as “highly insufficient”. Reality paints a bleak picture. Recent major infrastructure investments as part of a Covid-19 stimulus package, and the new carbon emissions from furious steel, cement and glass production, coupled with three straight years of rollbacks on regulations restricting approvals of new coal-fired power plants, have clouded China’s ambitions. Greenpeace findings released at the end of March suggest 46.1 GW of new coal capacity was greenlit in 2020, more than the combined total in the three previous years. For Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace East Asia, clarity is still needed about whether or not China will introduce additional ambition over Xi’s pledge last autumn, something that would be key to determining whether China could peak closer to 2025 than 2030. “One should really pay attention to the new ambition as opposed to the release of the [new] NDC, obviously the new ambition is the weighty stuff,” Li said. But a joint statement issued by the US and China on Saturday has given some cause for optimism. Li welcomed the development. “The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: it sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue [China and the US] will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume.” Michael Standaert in Shenzen Mexico Mexico was once considered an international climate leader. It was the first developing country to submit an NDC in 2015. Its NDC pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 22% and black carbon emissions by 51% by 2030. Conditional reductions of 36% and 70% were also promised. But its 2020 NDC disappointed climate campaigners, who said the country isn’t pursuing more ambitious targets. “It should have been more ambitious to begin with [and] their target is to reduce emissions to business as usual,” said Carolina Herrera of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who called Mexico’s NDC “utterly deficient” and “disappointing”. Mexico’s NDC promises nature based solutions such as protecting coastlines and reforestation, and plans also include refurbishing hydroelectric projects. The country also promises to slash emissions to 50% below 2000 levels by 2050. But meanwhile, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has actively moved against clean energy. His government cancelled clean energy auctions. He pushed an electricity industry law through Congress in March, which forces the state-owned electricity company to dispatch energy from its own (often dirty) power plants over privately owned renewable producers. The president also promised to revive the coal industry and has pushed the construction of a behemoth refinery in south-eastern Tabasco state. “They’re favouring the public fossil fuel sector at the expense of renewable energy and, frankly, their own citizens,” said Herrera, manager for green finance and climate change at the NRDC’s Latin America Project. David Agren Australia Australia’s most recent NDC just repeated the 2030 emissions reduction target set at the Paris summit: a 26-28% cut below 2005 emissions levels. No rationale has been given. The government had been advised to set a target equivalent to a 45-60% cut. Instead it just mirrored the reduction number set by the US under Barack Obama, but pushed the timeframe back five years. Prime minister Scott Morrison has not set a net zero emissions target, saying only that the country would “preferably” reach that mark by 2050. Quite how that may happen is not clear. The government has not introduced substantial climate policies, and official government projections suggest it will fall short of what is widely considered an unambitious 2030 target. There has been some progress. National emissions are already 18% below 2005 levels (largely due to cuts when the Labor opposition was in power) and cheap renewable energy is transforming the power grid at a rate faster than expected. But Australia still gets most of its electricity from burning coal, and emissions from the transport, mining and agriculture sectors are forecast to increase over the decade. The Morrison government says it is taking a “technology, not taxes” approach to the climate crisis, but to date has committed just A$18bn over a decade to technologies including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and soil carbon. Critics have pointed out it has not explained how or when this approach will deliver emissions cuts. Adam Morton in Sydney Brazil More ambition is needed, say representatives from agribusiness, finance and academia, and business leaders. “Brazil was expected to present a more ambitious target than the previous one. We didn’t do that,” Carolina Genin, director of the climate programme at World Resources Institute Brasil, said. “In absolute terms, our ambition is lower.” The 2020 NDC kept the pledge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 37% by 2025, and 43% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. But climate experts warned that the new NDC increases emissions by at least 400 MtCO2e, compared with the targets submitted in 2015. To maintain the same absolute level of emissions, Brazil should update the cut to 57% by 2030, experts say. Jair Bolsonaro’s government, however, thinks the opposite. In the proposal submitted in December 2020, it said its NDC is “among the most ambitious in the world” and that, “as a developing country and a nation of late industrialization, Brazil’s historical contribution to climate change has been low”. The proposal has one page for the NDC and eight for the information annexe, which is shorter than that from neighbours such as Argentina, Peru and Colombia. It also lacks details on how targets will be met, according to Genin: “We expected progress in sectoral goals, which were in the first NDC and do not appear in the second. These are important goals such as zero illegal deforestation, a commitment to restore 12 million hectares, among others.” Brazil has been successful in combating deforestation of the Amazon in the past, a key factor in the country’s contribution to climate mitigation, “but the picture reversed dramatically in recent years”, Genin added. Ricardo Salles, the minister of the environment, said it can reduce by 40% in one year the fast-paced deforestation of the Amazon – but only if the country receives US$1bn in foreign aid. Flávia Milhorance in Rio de Janeiro Nigeria Nigeria plans to achieve emissions reductions by massively expanding solar energy production in the country, investing in alternative renewable energy and improving processes used to produce oil and gas. It will use more natural gas and limit gas flaring. It also hopes to bring solar power to 5m households or roughly 25 million people. For now, however, these remain ambitions. In 2015 Nigeria pledged a 20% reduction in its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in relative terms, based on what it is projected to emit. The pledge was updated in 2017, spelling out Nigeria’s commitments in more detail, but the fundamentals of its pledges were the same. Since 2015 progress has been very slow, with some reports of regression. Nigeria’s pledges were based on the economy growing by 5% a year, roughly where economic growth was at the time of the agreement. The economy has been in recession twice since 2015, in one of the toughest periods in a generation for Africa’s largest economy and oil producer. This is in part caused by steep drops in crude oil prices on which Nigeria still heavily relies. A major part of Nigeria’s economic plan has been to expand the agriculture sector and make it more productive, implementing policies which critics say will increase emissions. Emmanuel Akinwotu in Lagos Canada The government of Justin Trudeau has cast itself as climate champions. In 2015, Canada initially committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. A reduction of that scope would see emissions in the country from the current rate of about 730 megatonnes down to 511 megatonnes. But the reality is far different, with a report this week showing emissions have only dropped 1% below 2005 levels – far off course. “The trend is very clear: we’re still on track to miss our Paris pledge by quite a lot,” said Jessica Green, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto who specialises in climate governance. “We just don’t see what the interim steps are that will put us on the path to meet those targets.” Governing Liberals have introduced legislation that would legally bind the government to net zero by 2050, but the bill has not yet progressed throughout parliament. The bulk of Canada’s emissions come from its tar sands – one of the world’s largest petroleum reserves. Emissions from the tar sands continue to rise each year. A recent court victory has received hopes for a nationwide carbon tax, which the government plans to raise to $170/tonne by 2030. But Green cautions the fight will probably be “politically difficult”, and one that might not be as effective as other policy measures, including electrifying parts of the country’s power grid that remain reliant on fossil fuels, making public transit free – and shutting down the tar sands. Unlike many other industrialised nations, Canada has never met any of its emissions reduction targets – a custom the governing Liberals promised to end. “I think that there’s kind of more openness to this idea that the government needs to really intervene more strongly,” said Green. But at the same time, there are still a lot of political challenges to make that a reality.

2019-07-02T05:00:21Z,"Firms must document climate impact on profits, Treasury says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/firms-climate-impact-on-profits-treasury,"Britain’s leading companies, investment funds and pension schemes must show by 2022 how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances, under government plans to boost the UK’s green credentials. Firms must document within the two-and-a-half-year deadline how extreme weather and changes to climate rules, such as a ban on plastic packaging, could hit their profits. The Treasury is also urging City banks to play a bigger role in supporting the UK meeting its legal target to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Under a new government strategy, banks will be pushed to invest in sustainability and come clean about their own exposure to the climate crisis. The Treasury said its green finance strategy would help the City emerge as a green finance capital by funding green investment, an education charter, a green home finance fund and by establishing a new green finance institute. The institute succeeds the green finance taskforce that was launched in 2017 and will encourage investment in sustainable businesses such as renewable energy firms. Financial services firms will also be expected to disclose how climate emergency risk impacts their activities by 2022. John Glen, the City minister, said the green finance strategy would help establish London as “a pre-eminent international centre for green finance”. He said: “The UK has a long history of leading the way in tackling climate change, but we need to do more to protect our planet for future generations.” The Treasury’s flurry of green finance initiatives has emerged as it prepares to face questions from a committee of MPs over its role in supporting the government’s climate targets. The Treasury select committee launched an inquiry last month to scrutinise the role played by Treasury officials, regulators and financial services firms after Theresa May’s announcement that a net-zero carbon emissions target would be enshrined in law. Philip Hammond responded to the policy by saying a net-zero carbon economy would cost £1tn to create. The claim was quickly rebuffed by No 10 in a rare rebuke to the chancellor. John McDonnell recently outlined plans to give the Bank of England powers to help scrutinise the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. The shadow chancellor has promoted the idea of a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a key member. The new body would be supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. McDonnell said: “From the government, this is too little and too late. It’s also totally ineffectual and toothless. “While it’s true that the finance sector will need to play a huge role in securing a sustainable economy for the future, it seems like the government is still stuck in the mindset of fiddling around the edges and hoping the free market will solve the climate emergency.” Climate emergency campaigners have supported the concept of a Green New Deal that mostly involves state support for a switch to low-carbon energy use and greener infrastructure. Hammond said he preferred to encourage the private sector to back green companies through a green finance institute, headed by former Barclays executive Rhian-Mari Thomas. He pointed to the already burgeoning market for green bonds, which act like mortgages for businesses that want to pursue environmentally friendly projects. All the main city regulators said they backed the chancellor’s move, saying a new stewardship code that required investors to check the “environmental, social and governance issues, including climate change” of UK businesses would make them more sustainable.",Business; Climate crisis; Investment funds; Pensions industry; Philip Hammond; Politics; UK news; Extreme weather; Environment; World news,Business
2019-05-19T21:00:14Z,Tories urge leadership contenders to prioritise climate emergency,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/19/tories-urge-leadership-contenders-to-prioritise-climate-emergency,"Moderate Conservatives including Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd are urging contenders for their party’s leadership to put the battle against the climate emergency at the forefront of the contest. The 60-strong One Nation group of senior Tories, created as a bulwark against what they perceive as their party’s lurch to the right, is calling for the environment to form a central part of the leadership debate. Morgan said: “The people of the UK know that climate change is an emergency and young people are desperately worried about the future of the planet they will inherit. “There are huge opportunities for the UK to lead the way in green finance and environmental innovation and to show that decarbonising an economy doesn’t mean it has to stop growing – let’s get on with it.” The Tory leadership campaign is already well under way, despite the fact Theresa May has not yet announced an exit date. With her authority shattered, several MPs, including Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and the development secretary, Rory Stewart, have said they will run. Many others have declined to rule it out, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, the chief secretary to the treasury, Liz Truss, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, joined their number on Sunday. Asked by Sky’s Sophy Ridge whether he would run, he said: “I am focused on the job.” The prime minister has promised the backbench 1922 committee she will meet them in early June, after MPs have been given a fourth opportunity to vote on her Brexit deal. If the bill is rejected, as many in government anticipate, the 1922 Committee would be expected to announce a formal leadership contest, which could run through the summer. Boris Johnson is the clear favourite. A YouGov poll for the Times conducted last week suggested he is the first choice for 39% of Conservative members, with Dominic Raab the only other candidate making it into double figures, with 13%. However, candidates must first appeal to MPs, who have the opportunity to whittle the field down to two before members are given the final choice. The One Nation caucus of Conservative MPs, which is relaunching in parliament on Monday, has urged contenders to pledge to tackle pressing issues aside from Brexit and in particular, bring environmental issues to the fore. Led by Morgan, Rudd, former cabinet office minister Damian Green and veteran MP Nicholas Soames, the group plans to hold a series of leadership hustings, in an attempt to act as a counterweight to the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG). Other supporters of the caucus include the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, who form part of a group inside cabinet dubbed the “Gaukward Squad” for their role in trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The group has announced it will not back any candidate who advocates a no-deal Brexit. Moderate Tories are concerned about the contest turning into what one cabinet minister called a “virility contest” on Brexit. The climate emergency has shot up the political agenda in recent months, aided by the Extinction Rebellion protests and the campaign spearheaded by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, who is also widely expected to run for the leadership, referred to the situation as a “climate emergency” during a debate called by Labour to demand more urgent action from the government. “Every Conservative must feel that this is a cornerstone policy,” said Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. The sacking occurred during an investigation into sexual harassment allegations, which were found to be “plausible”.",Conservatives; Conservative leadership; Climate crisis; 1922 Committee; Environment; UK news; Politics; Brexit; Article 50; European Union; Europe; World news; Extinction Rebellion,Politics
2020-11-17T22:41:23Z,The key areas of Boris Johnson's 'green industrial revolution',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/17/the-key-areas-of-boris-johnsons-green-industrial-revolution,"Boris Johnson’s £12bn plan for a “green industrial revolution” spans renewable energy, nuclear power and countryside restoration. However, some of the objectives are likely to be difficult to reach, and the plan has been criticised for a lack of ambition in key areas. Offshore wind Offshore wind has plunged in price in recent years, spurring an increase in windfarm construction even as government incentives have been slashed. However, the UK’s electricity grid has not kept up with the pace of change, and no commitment to offshore wind can be complete without explaining how the grid will be updated. Green groups are also concerned that a rush to new offshore windfarms will harm marine and coastal habitats, unless there is more coordination in their planning. Industry experts are also worried that the boom in offshore wind will fail to benefit UK companies and will be led by those overseas that import components. While the government claims that jobs will be created here, many of them are likely to be low-value “muck-shifting” construction work rather than in high-value manufacturing, unless there is more support for manufacturers. The government promises to produce enough offshore wind to power every home, but the electricity needs of the average family are likely to increase markedly as people switch to electric vehicles and heat pumps instead of gas boilers. Onshore wind is cheaper than offshore wind, but the construction of onshore windfarms in England has all but ground to a halt, owing to planning reforms under David Cameron. Hydrogen Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future for two decades, but despite advances in technology, the prospect of a hydrogen fuelled economy is still some way off. The International Energy Agency says investment in the technology now is a good idea, as part of a green recovery, but green groups are concerned that fossil fuel companies may see in hydrogen fuel an excuse to keep exploring for natural gas. That is because currently the main source of hydrogen is as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. They warn that if hydrogen is to be truly low-carbon, the industry must invest instead in other forms of hydrogen production, such as producing the fuel from water. Nuclear Hinkley Point in Somerset is the UK’s only new nuclear power plant currently under construction, and has been plagued by lengthy delays and rising costs. When the plant finally comes on stream, it is likely to be the most expensive source of power in the UK. Plans for a second new reactor in Wales were finally abandoned in September by the Japanese company Hitachi, and proposals for a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk are under review. If the government wishes to expand nuclear power, it will have to prove that it can be economical. Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank, said: “The only way to build another big nuclear reactor is if the government puts electricity bills up twice to pay for it – first to buy the concrete and steel to build it and then again to buy its electricity at far higher price than renewable generators will be charging. [And] the main problem with small modular reactors is that no one has one for sale – not even Rolls-Royce. They are actually offering to design one but only if the government will guarantee a £32bn order for 16 and pays half the £400m cost of the design. One word for deciding to go ahead on this basis is ‘brave’, a more appropriate word might be ‘foolhardy’.” Electric vehicles The move to bring forward the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles has been widely trailed, and car manufacturers are now accelerating the shift to electric engines. What is so far missing is a plan for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Building such infrastructure could generate tens of thousands of “shovel-ready” jobs, but who will pay for it? Cash-strapped local authorities currently shoulder much of the cost for the limited infrastructure available, but it is a patchwork system with widely varying costs for drivers across the country. There is also no answer yet to the question of how heavy goods vehicles will be shifted away from fossil fuels. Public transport, cycling and walking Lockdown this spring provided a clear demonstration of what environmentalists have been arguing for years: that our towns and cities have been ruled by the motorcar, to the detriment of public health and the climate, but with better planning a healthier way of life is possible. More people would cycle and walk if it was easier and safer to do so, but the strength of the car lobby has been demonstrated by the uproar in many areas over low-traffic neighbourhoods. Covid-19 has also led to people forsaking public transport, and many will be difficult to entice back – though if the shift to home-working becomes permanent, this may be less of a problem. Making streets more accessible to cyclists and pedestrians will inevitably mean discouraging private car use in most of our towns and cities, and that will require muscular intervention by central and local government to face down the motoring lobby. The question is whether this government will have the courage needed to follow through on this commitment. Aviation and greener maritime Aviation and shipping have been left out of the UK’s carbon targets, as they have been left out of international climate agreements. But as carbon dioxide from other sources has been reduced, they represent an increasing share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen fuel, in the form of ammonia, offers hope for shipping – but that prospect is still years off, and the shipping industry has shown little sign of wanting to reform itself in the meantime, despite its many opportunities for reducing emissions. As the Guardian has revealed, the vast majority of emissions from aviation are produced by a minority of flyers. Most people in the UK do not fly in any given year, and when they do it is usually for a single family holiday. A frequent flyer levy would help to discourage people from taking more flights, without penalising the majority of people who fly rarely, but the government appears to have rejected this option – perhaps not wishing to place further burdens on an industry that has all but collapsed during the pandemic. Homes and public buildings The UK has some of the leakiest, draughtiest housing stock in the world – but until the Green Homes Grant was introduced at the end of September, there was no government assistance for homeowners wishing to insulate and upgrade their dwellings. Teething problems with the new scheme have meant a lack of installers signing up, however. If the government wants to encourage installers to sign up to the Green Homes Grant, the message from the construction industry is clear: the £3bn scheme must be extended beyond its current end date of next March. Heat pumps offer a green alternative to gas boilers, but they are expensive and there are few installers with the skills needed. If the government wants people to choose heat pumps – which can cost £10,000 – over gas boilers, some form of compulsion, on the same lines as the phase-out of electric vehicles by 2030, is likely to be needed alongside financial incentives to reduce the costs to householders. Carbon capture Capturing and storing carbon dioxide – in disused oil and gas fields under the North Sea, for instance – is likely to be needed for the UK to meet its target of net zero emissions by 2050. Over the last two decades, successive governments have made several attempts to kickstart the industry, but government funding was finally pulled by the then chancellor George Osborne under austerity. The technology has now been proven in pilot projects around the world, but if it is to be deployed at scale the key question is who will pay for it? Some form of carbon tax on high-carbon industries would provide the funds needed, but companies already facing turmoil from Brexit are likely to push back strongly against any such plans. Nature Tree-planting provides a long-term way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but the government has so far failed to meet its own targets on growing new woodlands. Farmers are still waiting for details of the environment land management contracts that will replace their current EU subsidies, which are supposed to reward them for restoring natural features such as bogs and wetlands. Natural England has been demoralised and starved of funds. If ministers want to encourage tree-planting and nature restoration, farmers will need incentives and the government’s own agencies will need a boost. Innovation and finance Public companies are facing new rules on how to report on their exposure to the risks from climate breakdown, and many already do so. Green finance, prioritising low-carbon technologies, is also a growing sector, and investors such as pension funds are increasingly looking to green their portfolios. Tax incentives could help encourage more investors down the same route. The main question is whether the government will put forward public funding – there have been proposals for a publicly funded green infrastructure bank, to invest in the changes needed to decarbonise the UK’s ageing buildings, and transport, communications, water and energy networks. That would require long-term commitment: the original Green Investment Bank, set up with public money under the coalition government, was quickly abandoned a few years later, and produced little tangible return. The original 10-point plan contained a guarantee that the UK would halt government funding for fossil fuels overseas. That commitment appears to have been dropped, though it may resurface if internal government rows are resolved.",Green politics; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nuclear power; Wind power; Energy; Renewable energy; Gas; Construction industry; Trees and forests; Environment; Fossil fuels,Environment
2018-08-02T10:47:17Z,Tessa Tennant obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/tessa-tennant-obituary,"Tessa Tennant, who has died of cancer aged 59, was led by her ruling passions into a position of huge influence in the world of green finance. Realising the need to reconcile planetary limits with the power of directing investment, for 30 years she was at the forefront of a movement that has encouraged fund managers to invest money in a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion. Tessa co-founded the UK’s first green investment fund, the Merlin (now Jupiter) Ecology Fund, in 1988. She was later head of responsible investment at NPI (now part of Janus Henderson Investors), where she managed massive amounts of institutional money on socially and environmentally responsible lines – for instance by refusing to take shares in high-polluting companies or those involved in child labour. In 1991 she co-founded the UK Social Investment Forum, which lobbied for the wider adoption of responsible investment in Britain. She was also involved in setting up what is now the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, an alliance of more than 200 financial institutions that seeks to improve understanding of how banks, insurance companies and other major investors can take account of environmental, social and governance factors when deciding where to put their money. In addition Tessa co-founded, in 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project, a successful programme that has encouraged major companies to make annual disclosures of the greenhouse gas emissions they generate, and which works with them to cut those emissions. Now known as CDP, the project has grown dramatically since its inception, and works with more than 6,000 companies across the globe, including most of the biggest corporations. Tessa was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, to John Cormack, a pilot, and Jean Davies, the daughter of a Liberal peer. After leaving Prior’s Field school, in Godalming, she gained an environmental studies degree at King’s College London. Working after her degree at the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, she spotted the power that was latent in fund management, and noted that few investors at the time were routinely weighing up the environmental impacts of their decisions. Fewer still considered that excellent long-term returns could be had by investing in business that respects the natural world. After an internship in the US with the green asset management firm Trillium and its inspiring leader Joan Bavaria, she co-founded Merlin (now Jupiter) Fund Management in London and was its head of social investments. There she helped to build up an investment team that featured many people who fanned out into new responsible investment operations across the world over the next quarter of a century. At NPI she built and led a team that grew sustainable assets under management faster than any other group in the UK, winning large institutional mandates.Seeing the implications of billions of far eastern consumers joining the global economy, in 2000 she relocated to Hong Kong. There she set up the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia, which is now part of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an international network of investors pledged to incorporate social and environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes. After helping to create the Carbon Disclosure Project, she became its first executive chair and then a board member until 2014 – encouraging, sometimes embarrassing, corporations into measuring and reporting their emissions. Through defining and disclosing their climate impacts, companies saw the need to bring them down – reducing demand for fossil fuels and driving finance into low-carbon technologies. Over the last 20 years of her life Tessa developed an impressive portfolio of directorships. These included non-executive directorships at the Green Investment Bank and Solarcentury, a solar electricity company. She was possessed of an exceptional combination of energy, social confidence and free-spirited charm that brought her many admirers – her advice was sought by politicians including Tony Blair. In 1983 she had married Henry Tennant, whose father became Lord Glenconner. Tessa and Henry had a son, Euan, shortly before Henry recognised that he was gay. They separated but remained close; in 1990 Henry died from complications of Aids. Tessa took over his forebears’ mansion in the Scottish borders, the grade A-listed Glen House, with accompanying farmland, cottages, steadings and offices. In 2006 she met Bill Staempfli, a New York architect who was in Oxford on sabbatical studying environmental policy, and they married in 2007. Responsibility for managing the Glen estate without the financial means to run it was a legacy that Tessa occasionally thought she could do without, but in partnership with Bill she brought the farm back in hand by managing it organically, planting new native woods, tackling a backlog of repairs and hiring it out for film and fashion shoots. In 2012 Tessa discovered she had ovarian cancer – recording her treatment with wry commentary on a blog. In 2017 she found it had returned – though she spared her friends the knowledge. She declined further treatment, spending her last months at Glen with Bill, Euan, and her two grandchildren, who all survive her. One of her last acts was to be driven by Bill in their all-electric car to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, to collect the insignia of her OBE from the Queen. • Teresa Mary Tennant, green investment campaigner, born 29 May 1959; died 7 July 2018",Ethical business; Green economy; Green Investment Bank; Environment; Business; Society; Carbon offsetting; Climate crisis; Scotland,Business
2020-06-01T06:00:34Z,Does Labour really need to 'repair' its relationship with the City? | James Meadway,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/labour-the-city-share-finance,"Reports in the Financial Times that Labour’s new shadow City minister wants to “repair bridges” with Britain’s financial services industry read oddly to me. I remember accompanying the then shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on his “tea offensive” meetings with City figures – with the emphasis on the cups of tea and digestive biscuits, rather than the offence. McDonnell had the great advantage of dramatically low expectations among the bigwigs of high finance, who (as he joked to them) would turn up half-expecting to be sent to a re-education camp by the end of the meeting. They actually left, as far as could be told, pleasantly surprised. But behind the joke, and McDonnell’s personal charm, was a serious attempt to address the issue that any Labour shadow chancellor or chancellor will run up against: what is the party’s relationship to finance? It’s unavoidable, because Britain contains arguably the world’s most important global financial hub. If you aspire to form a government here, there is no path to doing so that does not, at some point, run through the City of London. The truth is that Labour party shadow Treasury teams – whether from the left, centre or right of the party – tend to have a lot in common in this respect. John Smith, shadow chancellor before becoming Labour leader, had his early 1990s “prawn cocktail offensive” with the financial sector. Gordon Brown praised the financiers right up until the 2007-8 crash. McDonnell promised the financial sector that it would have “a seat at the policymaking and policy delivery table”. This might sound surprising. Particularly in the wake of the global financial crisis only a decade ago, public opprobrium against the bankers was sky-high, and the ability of international finance to bring leftwing governments to heel occupies a major space in the left’s folk memory: François Mitterrand’s government in France, and, more recently, Syriza in Greece are the standout examples. There is also a longstanding critique from the left in Britain, which views the whole economy as distorted by the excesses of “bad”, unproductive finance, leaving “good”, productive capital starved of investment. There’s a substantial truth in the last point. Evidence from the OECD suggests that, not just for Britain, but across the world over the last 50 years, larger domestic financial systems tend to slow growth and worsen inequality. But pointing to an issue does not solve it. Nor, as the 2008 crisis unhappily revealed, does the left’s preferred policy of nationalisation necessarily make finance behave any better – as the accusations of “widespread inappropriate treatment of customers” at the majority state-owned RBS’s global restructuring group suggest. New figures from the Institute for Public Policy Research show that 22% of the government’s job retention scheme money is making its way straight back into the financial system. Simply making the state bigger, or more generous, is not enough to shift the underlying balance of power. Instead, a future social democratic government intent on serious reform needs to base its thinking about financial services on three fundamental points. First, financial services are not a monolith. What insurance companies want is not the same as what hedge funds want, and this is not the same as what the major banks are after. The critical point for a reforming government is to understand where those differences lie, and to make distinctions between different types of activity. While clearly some financial activities and institutions – hedge funds, for example – are very much driven by short-term gains, others – like pension funds – have interests that are far more closely aligned to those of a would-be reforming government. Pension funds look for long-term, stable investments that produce steady returns; potentially the sorts of investment in renewable power generation, or new public transport, for instance, that are so urgently needed. Policy should be designed around an understanding of these varied interests. Some of that should include support for a greater variety of financial institutions, catering for local, regional and sector-specific needs. Second, the global financial system itself is not primed to trash a reforming government in Britain. With a floating exchange rate and interest rates on government borrowing at world-historic lows, neither currency speculation nor the attacks of “bond vigilantes”, pushing up interest rates, are the dangers they might once have been. Instead, in a world where international co-operation is in short supply, the bigger risks are from political decisions taken elsewhere that can threaten financial stability here. For instance, Britain’s financial institutions require access to the EU’s vast capital markets. Outside of the EU, however, this access is no longer a right, but conditional on Brussels’ approval. The commission has already used the threat of withdrawing access rights to put pressure on Switzerland in negotiations. It could do so against other non-members. Similarly, the operation of the Federal Reserve’s “swap lines” – cheap, fast access to dollars, essential in a crisis and reopened for the Bank of England in March – depends on decisions made in Washington. These are more diplomatic challenges than they are financial constraints and there is no reason to act as if global finance is the biggest danger a future Labour government might face. Third, the challenges facing society – even before Covid-19 – are now so large that every part of the economy is affected, reducing distinctions between the interests of finance and the interests of other businesses. Climate breakdown, and environmental destruction generally, directly threatens billions of pounds of investments across the globe. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney was ahead of the curve in raising the risk of climate breakdown to financial stability, and major asset managers are themselves reportedly looking to divest from high-climate risk investments. Last year’s report to the shadow chancellor on green finance is a model of the kind of detailed policy needed here, where a political lead could help reshape the sector. Complete accommodation to the presumed wishes of the City will not work, but nor will sloganeering hostility. In truth, no Labour shadow chancellor has ever done either. The key strategic task for the party over the next few years, as it seeks to win the next election, is to understand how the different interests at play within the finance sector can align with a plan to address those three challenges, and build back better from the pandemic. • James Meadway is an associate fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research",Labour; Financial crisis; Financial sector; Economics; Banking; Politics; UK news,Opinion
2019-12-02T10:10:00Z,"Punish directors who don't make climate disclosures, says hedge fund",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/directors-climate-disclosures-tci-hedge-fund,"The activist hedge fund TCI plans to target directors of companies that fail to disclose their carbon emissions, in the latest sign that investors are putting more pressure on boardrooms to step up their disclosure on climate risks. TCI, which manages assets worth $28bn (£22bn), has written to companies including Airbus, Moody’s and Google parent Alphabet warning them to improve their pollution disclosures or it would vote against their directors. Letters to those companies published on the TCI website say: “TCI believes that climate change-related risks, in particular a company’s greenhouse gas emissions, will have a material effect on a company’s long-term profitability, sustainability and investor returns. These risks include regulation, taxation, competitive disadvantage, brand impairment, financing, physical asset impairment and litigation.” TCI said disclosure should include targets for emissions reduction. The hedge fund also warned it would vote against auditors where the annual report and accounts failed to report material climate risks. It threatened to dump investments where a “portfolio company refuses to disclose emissions and does not have a credible plan for their reduction”. Sir Christopher Hohn, the billionaire hedge fund manager who set up and runs TCI, told the Financial Times: “Investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its pollution is like investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its balance sheet. If governments won’t force disclosure, then investors can force it themselves.” The UK government is working with regulators in London to decide whether mandatory reporting on climate risks is necessary for publicly listed companies and big investment funds and pension schemes. This summer the UK became the first G7 country to sign into law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and its green finance strategy published in July said the financial sector must lead the way. It called for more investment in sustainable projects and infrastructure, and said changes include “setting expectations for publicly listed companies and large asset owners to disclose by 2022 how climate change risk impacts their activities”. Hohn accused BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, of “greenwash” because it does not require emissions disclosures. “Asset owners should fire asset managers that do not require such disclosure,” he said. “Investors don’t need to wait on regulators who are asleep at the switch and unwilling or unable to regulate emissions properly,” he said. “They can use their voting power to force change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously. Investors have the power, and they have to use it.” TCI’s move comes as the world’s governments meet in Madrid this week for the UN climate summit, and as the UN appointed the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who steps down in January, as its special envoy for climate action and finance from February. A new report shows almost half of UK boards (46%) spent zero hours discussing the climate emergency this year, and they were the least likely of all the countries studied to do so. Almost a third of UK boards (32%) feel little or no responsibility for the climate crisis, according to a global survey of 640 chairs and non-executive directors by recruitment firm Harvey Nash and London Business School’s Leadership Institute.",Financial sector; Business; Investment funds; Investments; Money; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; Environment; UK news,Business
2020-04-17T09:00:10Z,Polluter bailouts and lobbying during Covid-19 pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/polluter-bailouts-and-lobbying-during-covid-19-pandemic,"Polluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections. The moves have been described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. They say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, but such action has not been taken to date. Fossil fuels The fossil fuel industry, which already benefits from a $5tn-a-year subsidy, according to the IMF, has had the biggest wins during the coronavirus pandemic in the US and Canada. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar sands oil from Canada to the US got the go-ahead, with $5bn in financial support from the Alberta government. US president Donald Trump called the move “GREAT news”. Other pipelines continued construction despite the lockdown. To “alleviate financial hardship” to the US fossil fuel industry, Trump directed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be filled to its maximum capacity. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a sweeping suspension of its enforcement of environmental laws, three days after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, and extended the period that the more polluting winter gasoline can be sold. Three US states passed laws criminalising fossil fuel protests – South Dakota, Kentucky and West Virginia. Republican senators asked the US federal government to “reduce, delay or suspend” taxes due on oil, gas and coal, while the National Mining Association lobbied to cut $220m in taxes intended to support coal miners affected by black lung disease. In China, as the worst impacts of the virus outbreak passed, there was a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants. From 1 to 18 March, more coal-fired capacity was approved than in the whole of 2019. In South Korea, the major coal plant builder Doosan Heavy Industries got a $825m government bailout; green groups say the company was in deep financial trouble before the pandemic. In Australia, lobbyists welcomed the South Australia government’s move to defer taxes and other commitments to oil and gas explorers. Renewable energy In the US, assistance for the green energy sector was not included in the $2tn support package on 26 March, three days after 24 rightwing thinktanks, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said they were “deeply disturbed” by possibility of funding for “unreliable ‘green’ energy programs”. However, New York state did pass new laws to speed up clean energy projects. In Brazil, the energy regulator has indefinitely postponed green power auctions scheduled for 2020 and in South Africa, the state-owned power giant Eskom, which relies heavily on coal, said it will cut the wind power it had committed to buy. Motor industry In the US, the EPA finalised its rollback of Obama-era rules that made cars less polluting. In the EU, lobby groups argued for a delay in emissions reduction laws, although VW, BMW and Daimler say they are aiming to comply regardless of the virus crisis. Aviation A leaked letter from the International Air Transport Association describes its “aggressive” lobbying approach and includes a call for relief from corporate taxes, sales taxes, employer-paid payroll taxes and passenger ticket taxes. In the US, aviation got a $60bn bailout package and the suspension of many taxes. In the UK, major carrier easyJet got a £600m soft loan, weeks after its biggest shareholder received almost £60m in dividends. Farming In the EU, the farmers’ association Copa-Cogeca called for a further postponement of the “farm to fork” strategy, which is aimed at making agriculture less polluting. The call is backed by the rightwing EPP bloc, the largest group in the European parliament. In Germany, its farming lobby pushed for an easing of environmental standards, particularly those restricting fertiliser use, which are intended to reduce pollution. In the US, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association lobbied heavily and won a $23.5bn bailout package. Agricultural pollution is the cause of a huge “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico. Plastics and chemicals In the US, the plastic industry lobbied to remove bans on single-use plastic bags, citing hygiene concerns, and saw bans lifted in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon and Massachusetts. The EPA also weakened the Toxic Substances Control Act for many chemical and petrochemical manufacturers. In the EU, plastic industry lobbyists asked the European commission to postpone implementation of the single-use plastic directive, intended to cut plastic pollution. However, the commission rejected this call. In England, a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds that was due in April has been postponed. Timber In Indonesia, the trade ministry revoked rules requiring basic certification that wood exports were legally produced in response to lobbying from the furniture and logging industries, according to campaign group Mighty Earth. Green shoots The Covid-19 crisis has seen some backing for a sustainable recovery and rejections of polluter lobbying. G20 finance ministers committed to an “environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery” and EU leaders backed “measures necessary to get back to a normal functioning of our societies and economies and to sustainable growth”. The European commission has not delayed its consultation on a new green finance strategy and is now considering imposing new requirements on firms to reduce the risk of biodiversity loss and pandemics. This is despite coal-heavy states including Poland and the Czech Republic urging the bloc to abandon its Green Deal plan and emissions trading scheme. In France, the government has approved 288 wind and solar energy projects and has relaxed deadlines and cancelled a planned withdrawal of rooftop solar subsidies. Germany rejected calls to ease the planned shutdown of its coal industry, while in Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau rejected the call from Albertan companies to postpone an increase in the federal carbon tax. The fallout from the pandemic is also delaying a number of big fossil fuel projects, from LNG terminals in Australia to coal plants in Indonesia.",Environment; Pollution; Tar sands; Canada; Energy; Fossil fuels; US Environmental Protection Agency; China; South Korea; Australia news; Renewable energy; Brazil; World news,Environment
2021-10-30T10:00:07Z,Is this our last chance to act on the climate crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/30/is-this-our-last-chance-to-act-on-the-climate-crisis,"In the Marshall Islands people are used to the vagaries of the ocean. But recently the monthly “king tide” has brought new perils to this small group of islands in the Pacific about halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Waves crash over the roads and airport runways, especially when the unusually high tide coincides with a storm surge, cutting off communication and making daily business dangerous or impossible. The islanders’ lives are now full of inescapable reminders of climate breakdown, says Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the tiny nation of 60,000 people on 29 atolls. “We see stronger storms and storm surges. Droughts are more frequent and more intense and longer. Growing up I remember just one very intense drought; now they’re happening maybe every three years. We recently had a dengue fever emergency, a problem we’re seeing now in the winter months as they get warmer.” Stege is chair of the High Ambition Coalition, a grouping at the UN climate talks that brings together some of the world’s richest nations, including the EU, and some of the poorest and most vulnerable, to push for stronger climate action. Small island developing states are feeling the impact of climate change, but so, too, are far more populous countries, from low-lying Bangladesh to landlocked Rwanda, also members of the HAC, which represents more than 1 billion people around the world. “We are a small nation, but we have moral authority – our position on the frontline gives us that,” says Stege. “We need to raise our voice, as these changes will affect the whole world in time.” These vulnerable countries are preparing for what many see as the last chance to save their people from devastating climate catastrophe. The Cop26 climate summit will gather more than 120 heads of state and government and representatives of nearly 200 countries to forge a plan aimed at holding global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Small developing countries, and their moral authority, are a large part of the reason delegates are meeting with that goal of “keeping 1.5C alive”, as it is framed by the UK hosts. It means all countries must come forward with national plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, preserve forests and other carbon sinks, and move to a green economy. Cop26 is the biggest diplomatic event on UK soil since the second world war, and is a crunch moment for attempts to tackle the climate crisis, because scientists say there is just a decade left in which to take crucial action to prevent more than 1.5C of warming. Alok Sharma, the UK cabinet minister who is president of the talks, told the Guardian failure at Cop26 would be “catastrophic”, adding: “I don’t know another word for it. You’re seeing on a daily basis what is happening across the world. Last year was the hottest on record, the last decade the hottest decade on record.” The 1.5C limit is the core aim of the talks; the Paris agreement of 2015 required nations to hold global temperature rises “well below” 2C, and to “pursue efforts” to limit rises to 1.5C. That lower temperature limit was included in the agreement at the vocal insistence of the HAC, just a few days before the Paris summit concluded. If they had failed, the world would almost certainly already be on an irreversible path to 2C of heating – a level that we now know, thanks to science completed after the Paris agreement was signed, would lead to far worse impacts, including widespread drought, water shortages for billions of people, heatwaves and sea level rises. At 2C, small islands and low-lying coastal areas around the world would face inundation. The question now is: can a pathway to 1.5C be kept at the Glasgow talks? A conference of equals Cop26 is the 26th conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty signed in 1992 that requires all of the countries of the world to take action on the climate crisis. There have been 25 Cops before now, and yet we still face a rapidly deepening catastrophe. Extreme weather has intensified, with heatwaves in Canada and Siberia, wildfires across the US and Australia, and devastating floods in Europe and China in the past year alone. Last year was the hottest on record, alongside 2019 and 2016. At Cops, the majesty and the unwieldiness of the UNFCCC process are immediately apparent. This is one of the last remaining forums in which the governments of the world meet to debate global issues as equals. Most international conferences today are a stitch-up among major economic powers – the G7 group of the world’s biggest industrialised economies, the G20 group of the biggest economies including the still-developing ones – or have dwindled into ever-narrower special interests, like the Aukus defence pact. But the UNFCCC involves every nation, bar a few failed states, and gives each an equal say. Decisions can be taken only by consensus, which means the poorest countries – which are also those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate catastrophe – have, in theory at least, as much influence as the biggest. Sharma recognises this: “I will ensure that every voice is heard, that the smallest nations are sitting face to face with the world’s great powers, as equal parties to the process.” Putting the 1.5C target into the Paris agreement “was based on hard work by the High Ambition Coalition and the small island developing states,” John Kerry, climate envoy to the US president, Joe Biden, told the Guardian. “They felt it that it was imperative – and thank heavens they did. Science has now caught up to that fact, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] and IEA [International Energy Agency] and others have been pretty clear, that this is what we need to try to achieve.” Aiming for a 1.5C limit makes this Cop more ambitious – and perhaps in even greater danger of failure – than the Paris summit of 2015. At Paris, 197 countries were wrangled by masterful diplomacy into an accord that legally binds the world to limit heating to “well below” 2C, while “pursuing efforts” to remain within 1.5C. It was the first time developed and developing countries had agreed a specific and binding temperature goal. The distinction between 1.5C and 2C may seem small – unnoticeable, to most people, in everyday life. But for the planet, the difference is vast. During the last ice age, temperatures were only about 4-5C colder than they were today. Millions of years ago, at temperatures 4C higher than today, the poles were ice free and covered in swampy jungle. The world today is about 1.1-1.2C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and already the impacts of extreme weather are being felt. In a landmark report published in August, which gave the starkest warning yet from scientists on the climate crisis, the IPCC – the global scientific authority on climate science – made it clear that every fraction of a degree counts. Every seemingly small rise in global temperatures presages much greater impacts in the climate system, and every extra bit of heat makes weather more extreme. “You are promoting moderate extreme weather events to the premier league of extreme events,” said Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading, and an IPCC lead author. The IPCC findings show that the 1.5C threshold is not a cliff-edge to disaster, but the start of a steep slope. Its assessment found there was a narrow pathway remaining to hold warming to 1.5C, but even if we overshoot, we should be trying to avoid anything further – warming of 1.6C is still much safer than warming of 1.7C. As Sharma put it, in a speech in Paris in mid-October: “At 1.5C, 700 million people would be at risk of extreme heatwaves. At 2C, it would be 2 billion. At 1.5C, 70% of the world’s coral reefs die. At 2C, they are all gone. If temperatures continue to rise, we will step through a series of one-way doors, the end destination of which is climate catastrophe.” Kerry adds: “The reality is that scientists have now determined that we need to accelerate and need to do more – the levels of damage we are already seeing have been greater than anticipated and faster than anticipated. We have to take our cue from that, and respond.” ‘The starting line for the rest of the decade’ Cop26 is necessary because the 2015 Paris agreement set out the goals for tackling the climate crisis but did not contain sufficient commitments to achieve them. At Paris, countries came forward with national plans – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – to cut greenhouse gas emissions by varying amounts in the near-term, most of them pegged to a 2030 deadline. But these were too weak, and would lead to catastrophic warming of more than 3C if implemented. For that reason, the French insisted on including a ratchet mechanism in the accord, forcing countries back to the negotiating table every five years to crank up their ambition on emissions cuts with fresh NDCs. Postponed for a year by Covid-19, Cop26 is that moment. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who presided over Paris, said earlier this month: “This is the Cop of action, at which we apply the Paris agreement.” Hopes that Cop26 would produce enough action to meet 1.5C have fallen short. The IPCC has made clear that emissions cuts of 45%, based on 2010 levels, are needed by 2030 for the world to stay within the 1.5C threshold. The major players – the US, the UK, the UN – have admitted, publicly and privately, that the cuts on offer in Glasgow will fall short of that emissions-cutting goal. However, they hope for a deal that will show that all the major developed and developing countries are taking strong action on greenhouse gas emissions, are formulating clear plans with concrete measures and policies to do so, and that pathways can be set out on key issues such as methane reduction, protecting forests and other carbon sinks, and phasing out coal. “Will it be that every country has signed on and locked in [with NDCs adequate to 1.5C]? The answer is no, that will not happen,” says Kerry. “Glasgow has to show strong commitment to keeping 1.5C in reach, but that does not mean every country will get there. We acknowledge that there will be a gap [between the emissions cuts countries offer and those needed for a 1.5C limit]. The question is, will we have created a critical mass?” Nor is Cop26 the end of efforts to stay within 1.5C. Rather, we should see the 2020s as a “decade of action”, in which the world finally brings emissions under control: “There is not a wall that comes down after Glasgow. It is the starting line for the rest of the decade,” says Kerry. Unlike the Paris summit, which produced a binding global treaty, the outcome of the fortnight of negotiations in Glasgow is unlikely to be clear cut, adds Nicholas Stern, a climate economist and chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “We should hope for good progress, and for mechanisms and ways forward on how we close that gap [between emission cuts offered and those needed] further between now and 2025. We should look at the total emissions targeted for 2030. But a language of success or failure doesn’t seem to be me to be very helpful – to have a tick box doesn’t really make a lot of sense.” Lord Stern lists five areas in which Cop26 needs to show progress: NDCs; climate finance; phasing out coal; nature-based solutions to climate change, such as preserving forests, peatlands and wetlands, and other carbon sinks; and the goal of net zero emissions by mid-century. Nevertheless, if Cop26 does not produce a convincing roadmap for how the world can stay within 1.5C, it is hard to imagine how that limit will remain feasible. In 1992, when the UNFCCC was signed, it would have been possible to bring emissions down gradually over the course of a century, and still stay within the 1.5C threshold (though at that time it was not clear that 1.5C was a threshold). Now, because the climate responds to cumulative emissions, and carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for about a century after emitted, every tonne emitted adds to the heating effect. We have almost run out of road. In nearly every year since 1992 – bar a handful of hiccups from recessions and the pandemic – global greenhouse gas emissions have risen. Repeated scientific warnings have failed to stop us, and even the lockdowns – which cut carbon output by between a quarter and a third, when they bit hardest – made only a temporary dent, as emissions have rebounded faster than ever. We have not learned, it appears: the IEA forecasts that next year, emissions will jump by the second-highest amount on record. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, warned after the IPCC report that we were approaching the brink. “This is a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.” Hopes and setbacks over the years The resolution at Paris to “pursue efforts” to limit heating to 1.5C very nearly didn’t happen. When world leaders met in Paris in 2015, the crowded halls were haunted by the ghosts of previous Cops, a long-running series of largely failed attempts to forge an effective climate treaty. Under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed in 1992 on a rise in environmental optimism – the world had just, in the nick of time, rescued the ozone layer, and even rightwing leaders like the UK’s recently deposed Margaret Thatcher and then US president George Bush had been pressing for climate action – nations are bound to “prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with Earth’s climate system”. The treaty did not set out precisely what that meant, calling for greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere to be stabilised but without specifying at what level, and it acknowledged that developed countries should bear the main responsibility while developing countries continued to prioritise economic expansion. So the “conferences of the parties” began, seeking a way to implement these aims. For years, they failed. There were moments of hope, but each was followed by setback. The Kyoto protocol was signed in 1997, placing on developed countries specific national obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adding up to a collective target of reducing carbon by about 5% by 2012. But the US never ratified the protocol. The deal-breaker for the US Congress was that China and other emerging developing economies were exempt from cutting emissions. Rapidly growing China was coming to be seen as a rival, and US lawmakers – goaded by the powerful vested interests of the fossil fuel lobby – were persuaded that cutting emissions would be economically burdensome and result in jobs migrating overseas. (In the event, they migrated anyway, and emissions rose too.) In Copenhagen in December 2009, the world tried again. There was an added sense of urgency: in 2007, in its fourth comprehensive assessment of climate science since 1990, the IPCC had found it was “unequivocal” that the climate was changing, with more than 90% certainty that this was the result of human actions. Scientists agreed that warming greater than 2C was likely to lead to uncontrollable impacts, that if restrictions were not imposed a rise of 6C was likely, and that time was fast running out to keep warming within any limits. The signs were good for Cop15 in Copenhagen. Under a new Democratic president, Barack Obama, the US had re-engaged in international diplomacy and was poised to take action on its own emissions. “The US is back!” declared Todd Stern, climate envoy to Obama. The Cop15 plan was to meet for two weeks to hammer out a “political declaration” on cutting emissions that would be signed by the world’s political leaders, scheduled to fly in for the closing days. But it quickly became apparent that there was a gulf too far to be bridged: small developing countries wanted to include a commitment to stay within 1.5C, but bigger developing countries such as China and India were reluctant. Disagreements over the details were amplified by organisational disarray, and the conference ended in discord, chaotic scenes and recriminations. Copenhagen was derided as a failure, but this obscured an underlying achievement – for the first time, countries including the US and China had agreed a workable plan on emissions cuts, and developing countries agreed to curbs on the future growth of their emissions. Underneath the shouting and the blame-game, there was, as later recalled by Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who took over after the conference, “a very successful failure”. Shifting alliances For small developing countries, the lessons of Copenhagen were manifold but one stood out. The two-decade-old division of the world into developed and developing countries – set out in the UNFCCC treaty, codified further in the Kyoto protocol – disguised a newly evolving world order, in which the national interests of the economic powerhouses of the developing world were rapidly diverging from those of its poorer members. For two decades, the interests of developing countries at the talks had been treated as identical. China negotiated alongside the G77 group of poor nations, and was looked to as their leader. Where many countries had relied on debt and loans from the US and the west, now they could look to burgeoning Chinese overseas investment, in roads, transport networks, mines, farms and natural resources. Yet by the 2010s these countries were vastly different. China, India and a few other large developing economies had pulled away from the pack, industrialising at a faster pace than the world had ever seen. China overtook Japan to become the world’s second-biggest economy, after the US, in 2010. India’s fast-growing tech and service sectors fuelled a burgeoning middle class. These advances came at a carbon cost – industrial expansion ran on cheap domestically produced and imported coal. Copenhagen showed the first fraying of developing country consensus, in the fights over whether 1.5C should be kept within sight. Two years later, the split was confirmed, at a climactic conference in 2011 in Durban, South Africa, that paved the way for the Paris agreement. Negotiators in Durban were exhausted after Copenhagen, and few expected to make much progress. But the EU, sensing a closing window of opportunity, came with a plan. Connie Hedegaard, the EU commissioner, who as Danish environment minister had presided over Copenhagen and was unfairly blamed for much of the chaos, was determined to make progress. She demanded that countries sign up to a roadmap that would lead to a new treaty, requiring developed and developing countries to share obligations on cutting emissions – the format that became the Paris agreement. At the talks, she took soundings from smaller developing countries. They were the ones with most at stake, but being lumped in with fast-growing economies like China and India, whose priority was growth at any cost, was not serving them well. Longstanding alliances began to shift, with the most vulnerable countries inclined to side with the EU in a 130-plus member “coalition of high ambition”. The talks dragged on for a fortnight without resolution, and wearied countries proposed putting any resolution off for six months or another year. But Hedegaard was adamant: postponement could be fatal to her fragile coalition, a decision must be made. After a 50-plus-hour negotiating session, there were three parties left standing – the EU pushing for a roadmap, and China and India dramatically opposed. Close to dawn on the final Sunday morning, China and India could see they were isolated and agreed to the timetable that four years later produced the Paris agreement. The seeds had also been sown for a new force at the UN talks: the “coalition of high ambition”, as one UK minister put it. After Durban, it became clear that the balance of the UNFCCC talks had shifted. As nations gathered in Paris in 2015, the French were careful to keep a mention of 1.5C on the table, despite opposition from some countries. But there was a real danger of the commitment being watered down or left out altogether. With just three days to go, the Marshall Islands negotiator Tony de Brum, uncle of current Marshall islands envoy Tina Stege, made his move. He had been quietly working with the EU, with scores of developing countries, with the US and others, persuading them of the moral necessity of keeping a 1.5C target. The High Ambition Coalition broke cover, declared as a formal grouping of more than 100 countries – even including the US, Canada and Australia (under a very different government from today’s climate-ambivalent Scott Morrison). They succeeded in keeping 1.5C in the Paris agreement. Some countries were not pleased. China “hated the High Ambition Coalition”, said a developed-country diplomat. But the commitment now has legal force, and the twin goals of “well below” 2C and “pursuing efforts” to 1.5C point in a similar direction, according to Kerry. “It was not 2C, it was well below 2C, so what was settled on was not 1.9C or 1.8C or 1.7C but well below 2C, and 1.5C is not so far off that,” he says. For the UK, the key to success at Glasgow and presenting a convincing case that 1.5C will be met will be holding together the coalition of developed and developing countries that carried the day in Durban and Paris. To get the consensus the UN process demands, the hosts will also need some countries that oppose climate action to stay quiet. The key countries that are antagonistic are the fossil fuel producers – Russia, Saudi Arabia, Australia – and Brazil, which under Jair Bolsonaro is intensifying the destruction of the Amazon. At previous talks some of these countries have flung obstructions into the negotiations behind the scenes, held up progress on technical issues or held out on aspects of the agreement. Questions over UK presidency The tortuous history of the climate negotiations and the efforts it took to get to this point clearly illustrate how pivotal the UK’s role is, as host and president of Cop26. That role began in September 2019, but was disrupted by the pandemic. Despite the wearying nature of zoom diplomacy – “breakfast in Seoul, Berlin for lunch and New York for dinner,” as one UK diplomat tells the Guardian – the talks have progressed virtually. Even getting countries to agree that 1.5C should be the aim of Cop26 represents significant progress, given that many of the main players – China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia – had balked at or questioned the 1.5C goal in the past. Kerry points to statements China made at a pre-Cop26 climate summit held by Joe Biden in April. “China came onboard with entirely new language – that the [crisis] is urgent and we have to take action in the 2020s and 2030s, that we need to cooperate with each other, we need to work to 1.5C and well below 2C. China embraced [1.5C] in that context,” he says. The UK has arguably already succeeded in several of the aims of the conference. Staying within 1.5C will require annual greenhouse gas emissions to be stabilised at net zero by mid-century, according to scientific advice. The term “net zero” was scarcely used in Paris, and is found nowhere in the agreement, but means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible then offsetting any remaining irreducible emissions by fostering carbon sinks, such as forests. Countries responsible for about two-thirds of global emissions have now declared national targets to reach net zero emissions around mid-century, including China, which has set the goal for 2060. That is a major step forward, given that two years ago only the UK and a handful of others had a net zero target in law. Net zero, though, is not enough. The atmosphere responds to cumulative carbon, so unless emissions are brought down swiftly, we could reach net zero by 2050 but have emitted so much in the meantime that we burst through the 1.5C limit anyway. Another win for the UK is on climate finance. At Copenhagen in 2009, developing countries were promised $100bn (about £73bn) a year would flow to them, from public and private sources, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. That promise has so far gone unmet: a recent OECD report found only about $80bn was provided in 2019. A report from the German and Canadian governments, commissioned by the UK, published just ahead of Cop found that the $100bn target would be met in 2023, on current pledges. Sharma recognises that the NDCs are at the core of Cop26 and has spoken frequently of climate finance as “matter of trust – which is fragile”. But in the quest to keep 1.5C alive, the UK is also pursuing several side deals. These include an agreement to halt deforestation by 2030; deals to phase out the use of coal; moves to cut methane, a powerful greenhouse gas; potential measures on phasing out fossil fuel vehicles and cutting transport emissions; and commitments from banks to provide green finance and from leading businesses, sub-national governments, cities and other “non-state actors” to cut their carbon. Of these, coal will be the hardest to achieve. Countries including China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to halt the financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, which is a big step forward, but not enough. In response to rising energy prices, China recently announced plans to accelerate its programme of building new coal-fired power plants. India is also moving to increase its coal use. Bernice Lee, the research director for futures at Chatham House, says: “It is not easy for China to move away from coal. A lot of the economy is dependent on it, and people outside China underestimate how deeply embedded it is in the Chinese system.” The biggest question mark over the UK presidency is whether there is real engagement from the prime minister and the rest of the cabinet. Sharma has won plaudits from green campaigners and negotiators, world leaders and Cop veterans. But he has often seemed alone in the UK cabinet. At the Conservative party conference, just a few weeks before the start of Cop26, the prime minister gave only a glancing reference to the summit, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the new foreign secretary, Liz Truss, managed not a word. Contrast this with the French “360-degree diplomacy” ahead of Paris, when President François Hollande and his key cabinet ministers – including the foreign minister, Fabius; the environment minister, Ségolène Royal, ambassadors and a legion of officials – spent 18 months in a round of visits, conferences, speeches, public and private meetings. The cabinet’s neglect of the issue even tipped over into farce: when Kerry chose London to make his biggest foreign policy intervention on the issue, a speech in Kew Gardens in June, not one member of the government came to greet him. Ed Miliband, the Labour shadow business secretary, and Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, received Kerry’s warm words from the podium instead. It got worse. Boris Johnson, having said little on Cop26 all year, finally devoted his speech at the UN general assembly to the climate, but anyone expecting a reprise of Thatcher’s stirring call to climate action in 1989 was disappointed, as he veered off into quips about Kermit the frog. With three weeks to go before the UK’s chance to portray “Global Britain” as a climate saviour, he chose a holiday in Spain over the round of frantic last-minute diplomacy that the French employed before Paris. Other moves by the UK government have also seemed designed to undermine Sharma’s mission rather than to help him. Proposals, green-lit by ministers, for a new coalmine in Cumbria attracted the anger of the former Nasa climate scientist James Hansen, provoking a storm before the issue was put out to public inquiry, and new oilfield licensing is going ahead, despite legal action and protests. The government’s lawyers argued climate commitments were “not relevant” to the decision, despite a report by the IEA, commissioned by the UK government, that showed all new fossil fuel development must cease this year, to stay within 1.5C. Then there was the abandonment of the only “green recovery” measure, the green homes grant, after a few months of botched operation; the expansion of airports, and domestic flights, while raising train fares; supporting climate sceptic Mathias Cormann to be new head of the OECD; dropping a reference to the Paris temperature goals from a trade deal with Australia. Most difficult of all, the government decided to slash overseas aid to developing countries from 0.7% to 0.5%, a bitter disappointment to poor nations as they struggled with the pandemic. The government did manage to produce its net zero strategy just over a week before Cop26, setting out measures on heat pumps, nuclear, technology investment and tree-planting that it said would attract more than £60bn in private funding and generate 440,000 green jobs by 2030. Green experts worried that the £26bn from the government was insufficient, but it was clearly a relief to have a plan. Overall, the impression given by the host nation in the last two years has been patchy at best, with Sharma the only consistent cabinet voice. If the UK succeeds in pulling off a deal at Cop26, much of the credit is likely to be due to Kerry, the EU and other key figures assisting the presidency behind the scenes. The long road ahead For Stege, going to Cop is a moral obligation, to warn the world and speak for those who are rarely heard. “The High Ambition Coalition is critical to this process. Sometimes, in the past year, when I have seen leaders of some of the biggest countries on national podiums talking about 1.5C – it still boggles my mind. We are so far now from where we were in 2009 and 2015. When 1.5C was inserted in the Paris agreement, at the push from the vulnerable countries, with the help of the High Ambition Coalition – it was politically significant at that time, it seemed radical at the time. But now it has become reality, based on the science.” The countries on the frontlines of the climate crisis must be listened to, she said, because their reality today is what the rest of the world will experience tomorrow without swift action. “It has been a big arc to get to the 1.5C target. We have come a long way to get here, but we still have a much longer way now to go,” she says.

2020-02-23T10:47:43Z,Believe the hype – budget 2020 is very important,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/23/believe-the-hype-budget-2020-is-very-important,"Every budget is billed in advance as the most crucial in recent times, but then most are instantly forgotten. The one Rishi Sunak will deliver in just over two weeks’ time may be one of the few that justifies the hype. The reason so much is resting on the shoulders of the tyro chancellor is that the budget needs to satisfy a number of different audiences: the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who gave Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority; traditional Conservative voters; the financial markets; and foreign governments looking to see whether the UK will take a lead before the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November. A package that pushes all the necessary buttons is not going to be easy. To take one example, making tax relief on pension contributions less generous for those on higher incomes would help the chancellor’s sums add up and win credibility with the financial markets but antagonise the Tory party’s natural supporters. Sunak’s immediate task is to announce targets for the public finances that are easier to hit than the ones currently in place, but not so weak that the markets take fright. Moving the goalposts will give the government more scope to borrow for infrastructure projects that need to be underway soon if they are to be completed in time to deliver a political dividend for Johnson at the next general election. But unless he can also find a way of making the budget consistent with the government’s 2050 net zero carbon target for the economy a diplomatic failure of catastrophic proportions looms at the end of the year. The Cop26 is the most important summit the UK has hosted since the G8 met at Gleneagles in 2005 – and the task facing the government is much more daunting than it was then. The Gleneagles summit was all about the rich countries of the west agreeing to provide debt relief and higher levels of aid for poor nations. Most of the debts would never have been paid anyway and the doubling of aid was easily affordable at a time when the global economy was booming. Even so, it took a lot of time and effort to chisel out a deal. The then prime minister, Tony Blair, and the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, both lobbied hard to overcome resistance to their plan, expending plenty of political capital in the process. Public opinion – channeled through the Make Poverty History campaign – was effectively mobilised. Crucially, the Labour government showed leadership by committing to the UN target to spend 0.7% of national income on aid. A deal in Glasgow is going to be immensely more difficult than it was up the road in Perthshire 15 years ago. For a start, there are many more countries involved. For another, some of the biggest players are actively hostile to the idea of setting tougher emissions targets. The contrast between George W Bush – who was interested in Africa – and the climate emergency denier who currently occupies the White House is stark. But the US is not going to be alone in Glasgow: Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia will all prove hard to break down. After failing to persuade David Cameron to do the job, Johnson has put the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in charge of summit preparations. But Sharma does not have the heavy-hitting international reputation that is going to impress other governments. That will require Johnson to demonstrate his personal commitment to making Glasgow a success. All of which brings us back to the budget, which provides an opportunity for the government to announce measures that will accelerate the UK’s progress towards a decarbonised economy. These need to be more than the mooted increase in fuel duty. The Green New Deal Group (of which I am a member) has estimated it will cost about £100bn a year for 20 years to make the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Investment on that sort of scale would be necessary to make the UK’s 30m buildings energy efficient, turn buildings into power stations through the use of solar panels, and invest in renewable energy. So where’s the money going to come from? One answer would be a form of green quantitative easing – money creation by the Bank of England that would pay for the decarbonisation of the economy rather than, as was the case during and after the financial crisis, being pumped into the banking system. The government doesn’t seem keen on this approach, even though there are plenty of economists who think it is wholly feasible. Another possibility would be for the government to borrow the money in the usual way, but this doesn’t appeal to ministers either. There is, though, a third option. At present about £100bn year is paid into pension schemes, all of it eligible for tax relief currently worth £54bn a year. There is also tax relief on the £70bn a year invested in Isas. The GND proposal is that 25% of pension contributions should go into green new deal investment in exchange for that tax relief and that all new Isa contributions – which currently go into cash or shares – should be invested in green new deal bonds issued by the government at a guaranteed rate of interest. The idea is to provide a stream of income to transform the economy as well as offering a new secure investment vehicle for savers.

2020-02-19T06:30:48Z,The European Green Deal will bypass the poor and go straight to the rich | Daniela Gabor,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/european-green-deal-polish-miners,"When Josep Borrell, the EU’s newly appointed foreign policy chief, recently caused outrage by dismissing young climate activists as flaky sufferers of “Greta syndrome”, he made not just a serious error of judgment but a serious mistake in macroeconomics. It was a mistake that is symptomatic of the dire state of European economic debate after a decade of austerity and schwarze Null (balanced budget) ideas. “The idea that young people are seriously committed to fighting climate change – we could call it the ‘Greta syndrome’ – allows me to doubt that,” Borrell said, before going on to question their naivety about the cost of tackling the climate crisis. “I would like to know if young people demonstrating in Berlin … are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, because if we fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.” For Borell, greening the European economy is a zero-sum game, in which paying for the move to a low-carbon economy must come out of the pockets of German taxpayers. Borrell’s views, however unpalatably delivered, are perfectly aligned with the flawed macroeconomics of the much-vaunted European Green Deal. The clue is in the name. The European Green Deal is the European commission’s proposed €1tn plan to finance the transition away from fossil fuels to decarbonising Europe’s economy. But the commission quietly dropped the word “new” from original US plans for a green new deal, which of course echo Franklin D Roosevelt’s Depression-era economic New Deal. Losing that “new” is a signal that the commission does not seek system change through ambitious green macroeconomics and tough regulation of carbon financiers. Rather, it takes a politics as usual, third-way approach that seeks to nudge the market towards decarbonisation. The macroeconomics of the European Green Deal remains trapped in the black zero logic of austerity. Instead of ambitious green fiscal activism, it mostly reshuffles existing European funds through a logic of seed funding to mobilise private sector money. Public money will be used to take risk out of private business activities and finance a “just transition” mechanism that promises to protect groups like Polish miners after their coal mines close through retraining and reskilling programmes. But there is little guarantee that European taxpayer money will reach Polish miners. It will probably go into the pockets of decarbonisation “barons”: clever local elites who will funnel transition money to their businesses, just as land barons siphoned most of the subsidies originally intended for small farmers under the common agricultural policy. Take Romania. Mining unions there complain that measures intended to “reskill’ miners, tested in the Valea Jiului region in Transylvania for the past 15 years, solely benefitted decarbonisation firms. Their connections to Romania’s political elites allowed them to capture the “market” for reskilling services, but private investment and jobs in new economic sectors never actually materialised. In dismissing green macroeconomics, the European commission puts its hopes on private finance. The logic is that the state won’t have to pay if the private sector will, provided there is nudging from public funds to “derisk” green investments. Here, the commission seems to have powerful allies, such as institutional investors with trillions ready to be greened. Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, recently noted that “we are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance” by taking decarbonisation seriously. The turn to green finance is a welcome step given that BlackRock and other global investors have so far behaved more like greenwashing carbon financiers than responsible climate investors: talking green while consistently blocking climate shareholder resolutions. But the danger is that the public money the commission plans to put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing. Think of it as a two-step strategy through which carbon financiers can turn climate into a profitable business. The first step involves shaping the rules of the game, such as the “green list” of assets (or “green taxonomy”) currently being negotiated by the EU institutions. The EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has important advantages over the private environmental ratings (known as ESG ratings) currently used by private finance to identify green assets. Drawing on a broader range of views, including climate experts, the EU taxonomy sets a public standard of green that makes it more difficult for carbon financiers to purchase green ratings privately. Done properly, it could become a global standard for measuring and regulating the environmental performance of global finance. But the EU list risks being watered down in the ongoing political negotiations over the exact details of what constitutes “green” activities. Already, furious lobbying has led to the inclusion of a category of “enabling” activities under the auspices of “pathways to green”. These could easily become loopholes for activities that are more brown than green. The incentive for carbon financiers is to stick the label green everywhere they can in preparation for the second step: persuading European regulators to promote (de-risk) green assets. Meanwhile the commission refuses to talk about – let alone regulate – “brown finance”. Yet the strict regulation of brown finance could be a powerful tool for financing the European Green Deal. The commission could impose penalties on brown assets, either through taxation (a green FTT) or regulation, thus accelerating the switch to green assets. Those outraged by Borrell’s dismissive remarks about Greta Thunberg’s generation should note that the real political battle is to ensure that the European Green Deal does not morph into the first greenwashed social pact between regulators and carbon financiers, between Brussels and local elites, exporting greenwashed finance standards to the rest of the world. Climate activists should be pushing for a complete green economic agenda that recognises the critical role of green fiscal activism in organising the transition to low-carbon. It also means protecting public finances from carbon financiers, ensuring instead that private finance becomes the first lever in the climate fight. • Daniela Gabor is professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol",Climate crisis; Green deal and energy companies obligation (ECO); Energy; Energy efficiency; Environment,Opinion
2019-08-12T16:56:32Z,"British explorer is first person to complete 4,000-mile Yangtze trek",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek,"A 28-year-old British explorer has become the first person to complete a 4,000-mile (6,437km) trek along the Yangtze River in China. Ash Dykes, from Old Colwyn in north Wales, finished the year-long expedition on Monday, overcoming blizzards, a landslide and temperatures as low as -20C (-4F). Dykes was cheered on by British family and friends as well as Chinese supporters as he crossed the finish line to become the first person to walk the third longest river in the world. “It feels amazing. It hasn’t kicked in yet,” Dykes said, adding that the trip took two years to plan and one year to execute. He said the greatest challenge was reaching the source of the river, which at 5,100 metres is almost the same height as Mount Everest base camp. “There were worries I wouldn’t get to the source,” he said, adding that it was a lot harder than he had anticipated. Four members of his team left the expedition before it began due to altitude sickness. Dykes said that early in the journey he was followed for two days by a pack of wolves who had recently killed a woman. “We could hear them howling and we felt super vulnerable of course. We had to stay vigilant. There were moments when I thought what on earth have I put myself through for the past year,” he said. The expedition is Dykes’ third world first. In 2014, he became the first person to walk across Mongolia from west to east in an unsupported solo expedition that took 78 days. He also became the first person to travel the length of inland Madagascar, trekking 1,600 miles over eight mountains in 155 days in 2016. The explorer said he had long been interested in becoming the first person to complete the trek along the Yangtze. “It’s one of the biggest things I can find that hasn’t been done yet,” he said. He said he was drawn to these expeditions because he had “always been fascinated by the world”. Describing the walking as “a bit boring”, Dykes said: “I love travel, meeting new people and taking on new challenges. This is what I do, it’s in my blood.” He took note of the amount of plastics and pollution he saw from the source of the river to the sea. “The good news is that I’ve also seen a huge increase in knowledge and understanding within the communities, towns and cities along the way. People are aware of the damage being caused to their water sources and are now actively changing their ways for the better – it’s inspiring to see,” he said. Dykes worked with the Green Development Foundation, WWF and other environmental organisations to highlight marine plastic, renewable energy and green finance. He was accompanied on the final kilometre by Chris Wood, the British consul-general in Shanghai. Dykes said he was overwhelmed by the response from Chinese supporters, with millions following him through TV and social media. “What a wonderful journey it’s been with incredible locals … People across the country have been so supportive.” He said there was still much to discover in China. “I think I’ll be doing something again in China and try to make it more interactive, not only virtually, but in person too.”",China; Exploration; Asia Pacific; Environment; World news; Science; Plastics,World news
2019-07-02T05:16:53Z,Neil Woodford's refusal to budge over fund fees is breathtaking | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jul/01/neil-woodford-refusal-to-budge-over-fund-fees-is-breathtaking,"The song remains the same from Neil Woodford. The gates will remain closed on his Equity Income Fund, meaning unit holders still can’t access their investments. But management fees will continue to be charged because Woodford’s operation still has overheads to cover. The tin ear on fees is extraordinary. The chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, the chair of the Treasury select committee and Hargreaves Lansdown, his chief cheerleader, have urged him to waive charges in the period in which dealings are suspended. But he won’t budge. One assumes, from his talk in his latest video about the “attractive” investment opportunities ahead, that Woodford still harbours hopes of reviving the fund and his career. But how does he expect to appeal for loyalty when it matters? Investors now know that Woodford Capital, the company 65% owned by Woodford and 35% by his business partner, has received £97m since the fund management venture set out in 2014. And the fees are still rolling in at £60,000 a day during suspension. Even diehard fans are being given a strong daily incentive to say good riddance when they are eventually given the chance. As a candidate for PM, Hunt should know his numbers The Tory leadership race, bizarrely, has become a contest in which both candidates make unfunded spending pledges in an attempt to make Labour’s plans look austere. Even the intervention of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, making the bleedin’ obvious point that the Treasury’s £26bn of “fiscal firepower” would evaporate in the event of a no-deal Brexit, hasn’t halted the procession of loose promises. In his latest outing, Jeremy Hunt would throw £6bn at the farming and fishing industries to help then prepare for a no-deal Brexit. He justified this on the grounds that “we spent just over £1tn bailing out the banks after the financial crisis”, so why not do the same for others in their hour of need? Let’s skip over the important detail that, unless Hunt is proposing to nationalise farming and fishing in the UK, the comparison doesn’t work. More revealing, from the point of view of assessing the candidates’ ability to present numbers honestly, is Hunt’s sloppy claim that “just over £1 trillion” was spent on the bank bailout. Yes, we know the exercise was vastly expensive. But, come on, the outlay – which is what is implied by the word “spent” – was not £1tn. The country would have been bankrupt several times over if that had been the case. The entire national debt was less than £1tn in 2009. Hunt’s number isn’t entirely plucked from thin air, it should be said. Taxpayer support for the banks was estimated by the National Audit Office to be £1.16tn at the peak. But “support” is not the same as money spent. Crucially, the vast bulk of NAO’s figure – some £1.03tn – was non-cash support in form of loan guarantees, indemnities and liquidity schemes. The actual cash outlay, principally from buying shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, plus loans to insolvent banks, was £133bn, according to the NAO. That is still a staggering figure, even though the sum had fallen to £32bn by March 2018, thanks to share sales and loan repayments. But the sum spent was never £1tn-plus. A would-be prime minister should know this stuff. Green guidance needed sooner rather than later It is alarming to see that the second item in the government’s “landmark” green finance initiative is tiny: a mere £5m will be spent on establishing a “Green Home Finance Fund” to pilot mortgages that incentivise sustainable energy. A few million quid is not going to move many dials. Still, one measure could become important – provided it is given teeth. That is the requirement for publicly listed companies, plus big asset owners, to disclose by 2022 how climate risks will impact their activities. A few oil and gas companies have been cajoled already into making such assessments and one can understand why campaigners fight for disclosure. Transparency is necessary to set targets; consistent auditing allows comparisons to be made between companies; and recalcitrant boards are obliged to take notice. More of that, please. It is impossible, though, to tell if the new reporting requirement will bite. Will supermarkets, for example, have to calculate the cost to themselves of a ban on single-use plastic? The Financial Reporting Council says it will “provide practical guidance later this year on how companies can best consider and report on climate-related risk and opportunities”. The wording rather suggests the thinking has only just started.

2019-04-02T02:33:53Z,Melissa Price lobbied by energy company before coal-fired power review requested,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/02/melissa-price-lobbied-by-energy-company-before-coal-fired-power-review-requested,"Environment minister Melissa Price requested a review of how climate change policy could be used to upgrade coal-fired power stations after being lobbied by an energy company, freedom-of-information documents show. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the Vales Point power station in New South Wales had been registered under the emissions reduction fund, the “direct action” climate policy introduced by Tony Abbott that Scott Morrison has promised to spend another $2bn on if re-elected. Its owners, Sunset Power International trading as Delta Electricity, wanted to bid for taxpayers’ support from the fund at an auction in December. If successful, it would have used the money as part of a $14m project to replace turbine blades at the plant. But the bid for taxpayers’ support was blocked by the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, on the grounds the company had not provided enough information to show it would qualify for carbon credits. Documents released under freedom-of-information laws show a consultant working on behalf of Delta Electricity contacted the regulator, the environment department and the offices of Price and energy minister Angus Taylor about the decision. He asked for an “urgent meeting” between Price and Trevor St Baker, the company’s part-owner and a coal advocate and political donor. The consultant, John Short, said St Baker and Delta’s chief executive wanted to discuss concerns the Clean Energy Regulator had adopted a position that discriminated against coal-fired electricity. He suggested the company would consider appealing the regulator’s decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if not overturned. The emails suggest the meeting did not take place, but Price had asked the independent emissions reduction assurance committee to review how coal-fired power stations could earn carbon credits under the climate scheme. Kelly O’Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which received the freedom of information documents, said Price was within her rights to call for a review but the timing and focus on coal raised questions about St Baker’s influence and the government’s support for fossil fuels. “The Morrison government needs to explain its relationship with Trevor St Baker, a major party donor who is seemingly pushing hard to get public money and institutional backing for his coal business,” she said. An upgrade of the Vales Point plant has also been included on a shortlist of power generation projects the government is considering underwriting. It was the sole coal project on the shortlist released last week. Price’s spokesman told the ABC the government frequently reviewed methods used under the emissions reduction fund to ensure they continued to meet integrity standards. She said the scheme was designed to provide funding to projects from across the economy, including industry. The minister’s office had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Green finance analysts say Australia is the only developed country with rules that allow climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants and that China announced in December it would no longer use green bonds to help replace old coal plants with newer technology. Delta Electricity says the proposed Vales Point upgrade would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant’s emissions over that time. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year found limiting global warming to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. The emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as a “climate solutions” fund, distributes cash through a reverse auction, with the cheapest proposed cuts winning contracts. The scheme has been dogged by problems with methodology and criticisms that it is not an adequate policy to deal with national emissions, which continue to rise. There have been concerns within the bureaucracy about how emissions cuts from vegetation projects are calculated, prompting the government to propose amendments to the fund’s rules. The changes suggest some projects have been receiving more carbon credits and taxpayer money than they needed. Most contracts have been awarded to vegetation projects, but industrial developments are also eligible. Rio Tinto received $2m to build a diesel power plant and miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant it says it would have built anyway. The government dedicated $2.55bn to the fund after winning power in 2013, $476m of which has been paid out with another $1.8m under contract. The Coalition has promised to inject an extra $200m a year from 2021 to 2030 if in government. Labor would scrap it and restore a carbon farming initiative, focused on land-based projects.",Australian politics; Energy; Australia news; Coal; Energy; Environment; Fossil fuels; Coalition; Liberal party,Australia news

Bank governors warn financial industry to face climate threat The governors of the Bank of England and France’s central bank have issued a warning to the world’s financial industry that it must reform in the face of the existential threat from climate change. In a letter published in the Guardian on Wednesday, Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau said the cuts to carbon emissions needed to avoid environmental catastrophe “requires a massive reallocation of capital”, and those industries that failed to adjust “will fail to exist.” Green finance.

New interior chief met lawyer linked to Zinke scandal Trump’s new secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, met a lawyer for the Native American tribe linked to one of the scandals swirling around his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, newly released agency records have revealed. In April 2018, Bernhardt met Marc Kasowitz, a former Trump lawyer whose firm represented the Schaghticoke tribal nation. The Schaghticoke opposed a request by two other tribes to operate a casino in Connecticut. Zinke’s decision to block that request is under investigation by a grand jury. Conflict of interest. Bernhardt, who was confirmed as interior secretary last week, is a former energy lobbyist described by environmentalists as “a walking conflict of interest.” Macron vows to rebuild Notre Dame within five years The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has promised Notre Dame Cathedral will be rebuilt “more beautiful than before” and within five years, in time for the 2024 Paris Olympics. But experts have said repairs to the fire-damaged landmark could take decades. More than €800m ($905m) has already been raised for the restoration, mainly thanks to pledges from French billionaires. Investigators working on a timeline of the fire said the structure came “15 to 30 minutes” from complete destruction. Historic blaze. The restoration of Notre Dame will inevitably draw on lessons from other historic landmarks that suffered a similar fate, including York Minster and Windsor Castle in England.

2019-03-17T17:00:14Z,Questions raised over how $1bn of emissions funding have been allocated,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/18/questions-raised-over-how-1bn-of-emissions-funding-have-been-allocated,"Scott Morrison recently announced the Coalition would inject another $2bn into the emissions reduction fund – the Tony Abbott-era “direct action” policy that pays farmers and businesses from the budget to reduce greenhouse gas – but serious questions have emerged about $1bn already allocated. Amendments to the fund rules, released for public consultation, indicate there have been problems with how emissions cuts from projects that involve managed regrowth of native forests and vegetation have been calculated. The two methods used under the fund in this area are complex, but it suggests some projects have received more carbon credits than they deserved for vegetation that has not yet grown as expected, others for plant life that already existed. This is supported by documents released under freedom of information laws, which show officials at the Clean Energy Regulator were concerned about the issue early last year. The revegetation projects under the two methods are supposed to be delivering half of the emissions cuts – nearly 100m tonnes – contracted under the fund. They will receive more than $1bn from taxpayers and are creating carbon credits that count against Australia’s greenhouse targets. Suzanne Harter, a climate change campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, says it shows the fund needs significant reform before more public money is spent on it. “This rule change appears to reflect the growing concerns within the bureaucracy that some regeneration projects may have gained credits and cash from the emission reduction fund for pollution cuts that may not have occurred. “Vegetation regeneration projects make up a significant proportion of the projects under the fund. We must make sure they are genuinely helping cut pollution.” There are two ways to look at the amendments. On the one hand, it is good the problem may be fixed. On the other, it is another problem with the fund, which has been the subject of several damning critiques. The then Coalition environment spokesman Greg Hunt spent the 2009/10 summer working on a solution so Abbott could say he would meet climate targets while launching a ferocious attack on Labor’s carbon pricing plans. The result was to remove a requirement for industry to pay for its pollution and introduce a pot of money from which landowners and businesses would bid for public money to cut emissions, with the cheapest projects winning support. The government dedicated $2.55bn to the fund after winning power in 2013, $476m of which has been paid out. Another $1.8m is under contract and $226m is yet to be allocated. Most of the funds are going to land-based projects. A Guardian Australia investigation highlighted problems with the scheme: there are limits on the extent to which guarantees that land will be permanently protected can be enforced; it is impossible to know if landowners embarking on so-called “avoided deforestation” projects would have cut down trees on their property if not paid by the government; claims it may be cheaper to buy land from farmers than paying them to protect it; the scheme largely ignores the role climate change is projected to play in degrading landscapes. Apart from the methodological issues, the type of land-based projects supported by the fund have broad cross-party support – there is no doubt there should be a scheme to improve the health of cleared forests, agricultural pastures and arid grazing lands. But other projects getting taxpayers’ money raise thornier questions. It was found giving climate funding to landfill sites that capture and combust leaking methane was a waste of money as they were already receiving cash from other government sources and would have existed anyway. Multinational mining companies are receiving climate funding for fossil fuel projects: Rio Tinto received $2m to build a diesel power plant and Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant it says it would have built regardless. Critics object to these projects getting climate funding as they add to climate change and the giant companies receiving the cash do not need the public support. As currently designed, the emissions reduction fund could also be used to pay for an upgrade at a coal-fired power plant. The owners of the Vales Point coal station have been registered under the scheme. Green finance experts say Australia is the only developed country with a system that allows climate funding to go to coal plants. The government is yet to respond to these issues. It put little focus on the emissions reduction fund when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister but that has changed under Morrison. He promised the scheme, rebranded as a “climate solutions” fund, would be boosted by an extra $200m a year from 2021 under the Coalition. To date, the data shows the fund has failed to do its job. National emissions have risen each year since it was introduced. Analysts say the central problem with the fund is that it does virtually nothing to address industrial and transport emissions, which are driving most of the pollution growth. A related policy known as the safeguard mechanism was supposed to stop increases in industrial emissions, but in practice has been lax. In many cases, companies have been able to nominate their own emissions limits, known as baselines. The government last week introduced further changes that allow baselines to be reset annually in line with production levels. Labor has been highly critical of the fund. Along with the Greens and independents in 2011, the ALP introduced the Carbon Farming Initiative – a forerunner to the fund that awarded carbon credits to projects that restored habitat. The crucial difference to the Coalition’s model was that the cuts were paid for solely by big polluters, which bought the credits to use as offsets. Labor has been discussing a return to this type of model with industry, including the safeguard mechanism being adapted into some form of an emissions trading scheme to limit industrial pollution. Details have yet to be released. The ALP says a policy will be announced in coming weeks.",Environment; Australia news; Emissions trading; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis,Environment
2018-03-14T00:01:11Z,"Green Investment Bank sell-off process 'deeply regrettable', say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/14/green-investment-bank-sell-off-mps-macquarie,"MPs have accused the government of a “deeply regrettable” failure to put in place strong guarantees that the UK’s green investment bank will continue to support renewable energy after its privatisation. The public accounts committee said it was unclear whether the bank would continue to support the government’s energy policy or climate change goals, because the bank’s new owner is not legally bound to stick to its green aims. The bank was launched in 2012 to spur investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency and other parts of the “green economy”, but sold by government last year to Australian bank Macquarie for £1.6bn. The MPs said that ministers and officials had, in their rush to get the bank off the government’s books as quickly as possible, failed to explore whether they could have won stronger green commitments from Macquarie. In addition, the spending watchdog said the government had sold the bank before assessing its impact, and was unable to say if it had achieved its objectives. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee’s deputy chair, said: “The manner in which it was sold off is therefore deeply regrettable. Government did not carry out a full assessment of the bank’s impact before deciding to sell, nor did it secure adequate assurance over the bank’s future role.” The government established a “special share” to protect the bank’s green goals, but the MPs attacked the government for not pushing Macquarie hard enough for stronger guarantees. “Macquarie told us that the special share or other commitments it made were not a burden and did not affect the price it was prepared to pay,” said a report by the committee, published on Wednesday. Furthermore, the MPs said the trustees of the special share had no powers to approve investment decisions or influence the privatised bank’s investment strategy. The special share arrangement is also contingent on Maquarie continuing to fund the company set up to hold the share, the watchdog added. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: “Selling the Green Investment Bank reveals this government is more interested in making a quick buck from the family silver than in driving innovation in environmental objectives.” The government defended the sale, saying it had made £186m profit for the taxpayer. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the bank, now known as the Green Investment Group “has made substantial green investments since its sale and plays a key role in the government’s green finance taskforce, as part of our clean growth strategy”.",Green Investment Bank; Environment; Banking; Business; UK news,Environment

Funds going into renewable energy, the mainstay of the low-carbon economy, fell more than 50% in 2017, having dropped by 10% in 2016, bringing annual investment in the sector to its lowest since the financial crisis in 2008. The environmental audit committee (EAC) said on Wednesday that the government would be unable to meet its pledges on carbon emission reductions, if the collapse continued. The MPs also said the government was failing to implement policies to cut emissions from transport, heating and industry, and called on ministers to consider raising a “sovereign green bond”, as other countries have done, in order to stimulate investment. The criticisms come even as the government has boasted of a clean growth strategy, and a 25-year environmental plan that will address climate change along with other green priorities such as pollution and biodiversity. Mary Creagh, chair of the EAC, said: “The clean growth strategy was long on aspiration, short on detail. The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the [billions of pounds of] investment required to meet the UK’s climate change targets, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its strategy.” Cuts to taxpayer-funded support for renewable projects, along with planning obstacles that have effectively ruled out new onshore wind turbines across much of the country, have deterred energy companies and their financial backers. The market for energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, has also seen a sharp decline since the government scrapped its flagship policy, and the Green Investment Bank was sold off. Alex White, senior policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, said: “There are willing investors in the green economy, but not enough projects to invest in. Boosting the pipeline of green infrastructure projects will be critical to meet the UK’s environmental goals and should be the first priority in green finance. Policy detail is key [for investors].” Alongside the EAC report, researchers and NGOs have called for a “greening” of the Bank of England, to meet carbon targets and encourage clean growth. Positive Money, a thinktank, called for the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to have to take the risks of climate change into account in making its decisions, a controversial recommendation that would require wide reviews of how climate change could make an impact on inflation. The report, A Green Bank of England, also suggested that the Bank of England should be given a specific remit on environmental sustainability, which would affect its decisions and advice to government, and should no longer buy bonds issued by fossil fuel companies. Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisors, said linking the Bank of England’s work to climate change was essential, as was linking the performance of other government departments on the issue. “We have compartmentalised our reactions to climate change – we say, we have a minister for this, so the secretary of state for health or the chancellor do not think they have responsibility for it.” He said: “The Bank of England can make a huge difference by using its own direct powers, and by influencing [others].” He was backed up by Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow secretary for international trade, who said: “We have to make it clear to the Bank of England that it is given a specific remit to deal with these issues, not to limit its activity to more conventional banking activity.” The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has repeatedly warned of the risks of climate change to the financial sector, and the need for action by companies, investors, government and regulators to ensure the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy happens beneficially, rather than by shocks to the finance system. Sovereign green bonds, recommended by the EAC, are financial borrowing instruments issued by governments to raise cash for environmental improvement projects, with part of the return on the projects going to market investors. They enable governments to take advantage of the low interest rates on borrowing available to them, while investors are attracted by the relatively low levels of risk. Poland made a bond issue in 2016, with Belgium following suit this year, and countries around the world from Nigeria to Indonesia have also entered the market. The Bank of England would have to take the lead in issuing such bonds in the UK. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it would respond to the EAC proposals in due course. A spokeswoman said: “We’re committed to meeting our climate change targets and will have invested £2.5bn in low-carbon innovations by 2021.”",Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Climate crisis; UK news; Energy; Environment; Energy industry; Business; Green Investment Bank,Environment
2018-06-28T15:17:13Z,Biodiversity is the 'infrastructure that supports all life',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/jun/28/biodiversity-is-the-infrastructure-that-supports-all-life,"Dr. Cristiana Pașca Palmer has a big job ahead of her: planning the 2020 UN Biodiversity Convention in Beijing. As the Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), Pașca Palmer is in charge of forming new goals with governments for the natural world post-2020. At the same time, a growing group of scientists are calling for a serious consideration of the Half Earth idea – where half the planet would be placed under various types of protection in a bid to prevent mass extinction. Do you support the Half Earth model? What tweaks would you make to it? “Half Earth”, a concept coined by the distinguished professor E.O Wilson advocates that we need to conserve half of the Earth’s lands and seas, in order to avoid species extinction. This idea sparked a vivid debate. Questions that I see surfacing frequently in these discussions ask – “What about humans? And what do we do with the ‘other Half? Could we continue to use the planet unsustainably, as long as half of it is conserved?” In my view, we need to ensure that the entire planet is used sustainably. That is, 100% of the Earth, the “Whole Earth”, has to be managed in a way that will allow continuous healthy functioning of the ecological systems that support life on Earth, including human life. We can think of biological diversity as the “infrastructure” that supports all life on the planet. When we lose species through extinction the web of life is destroyed and this in turn affects the resilience of the ecosystems and nature’s capacity to provide the services that humans benefit from – ensuring our food, the air we breath, the water we drink, or the moments of peace and serenity we enjoy in nature. Conservation and protection of nature, ecosystems, and species is one essential pillar of any strategy to ensure fully functional natural systems in the long term. Ecological restoration of degraded lands through natural means should be another key component. Ultimately, the paradigm shift that perhaps is necessary is the wide-understanding that the Earth is one system of interconnected elements, and that humans’ social and economic systems are embedded in the larger nature’s system, and not the other way around. A transformation of the way we produce, consume, and generally, interact with nature should therefore be another pillar of a long-term sustainable approach to ensure nature’s health, which is an essential condition for our survival and well-being on the planet. Ambitious, science-based targets are needed to guide the way in conserving and restoring the Earth. A couple of recent papers have suggested that the CBD push for a new agreement in 2020 that would be similar to the Paris Climate Agreement to ratchet up conservation targets and funding. Is this something that the CBD is actively considering? All 196 parties that are signatories of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the 2050 vision of “Living in harmony with nature.” We have made progress towards this goal but a lot more remains to be done. This ‘road to 2050’ has several important milestones – the design of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework is one of them, along with the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have 2030 as deadline. The current 20 global biodiversity targets (Aichi targets) are embedded and reflected in most of the 17 SDGs; thus, it is expected that achieving the SDGs will also benefit biodiversity. There is also an increasing global recognition of the urgency of action needed to protect biodiversity – to shift to new ways of production and consumption and reorient economic development pathways towards an “economy within ecological boundaries.” Governments are already starting their work to develop an ambitious post-2020 architecture for biodiversity that is transformative but also achievable. We hope this framework, that will be adopted by the global community at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the UN Biodiversity Convention hosted by China in Beijing in 2020, will provide new impetus to the way we conserve and manage Earth’s natural capital. We expect both the governments and other relevant stakeholders from the business sector and civil society to make their specific and strong commitments towards implementing the post-2020 agenda and achieving the 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature. What are the political roadblocks to taking much more ambitious action to save life on Earth? How do you propose to overcome these? The first major structural roadblock is the current global economic and development model which does not account for natural capital and does not consider the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity as a fundamental part of the economic system. We need to fundamentally change this paradigm and shift to an economic model that accounts for the fact that we operate within a closed system – planet Earth – and that our economic growth is limited by the ecological limits of the planet, also known as “planetary boundaries.” The second roadblock is the ‘short-termism’ structurally embedded in the current political decision-making processes. Many environmental considerations and conservation actions are of a long-term nature, going beyond the usual political and election cycles of few years. We need thus long-term planning for the way we use nature’s capital, rooted in the fundamental planetary and human needs and informed by the science on ‘planetary boundaries’. Building a bridge between science and policy-making is crucial. Long-term vision grounded in solid science and short-term, practical, implementation action needs to be at the heart of our decision-making. And the third major roadblock, ticking at the intersection of the political reality and culture, is the dominant concept of human separation from and supremacy over nature. This misconception underpinning in large measure the modern views and attitudes towards nature is at the root of people’s disconnect from nature and the fragmentation we see in environmental governance and policy-making. Significant changes are required in our mentalities – as decision makers, producers, and consumers. Awareness and education are essential for building a common, widely internalised understanding that our planet’s resources for supporting life are finite. How do we significantly increase funding worldwide for conservation protection? Current funding resources for conservation are disproportionally low and fragmented compared to the needs. Creative and more innovative means of finance and resource mobilisation have to be explored to unlock the necessary resources to implement the Convention’s objectives post-2020. Blending public and private finance, innovative green finance, and biodiversity insurance facilities are just few examples. On the other hand, the impact of economic activity on nature and environment could be mitigated by making conservation an integral part of every industrial or other type of projects that may have potential adverse impacts on the environment. This process, called ‘internalisation of externalities,’ follows the principle of sustainable use of resources and allows for a ecosystems, holistic, approach to managing Earth’s natural capital. The cheapest way of doing conservation is investing in the prevention of harmful effects and in building safeguards against major adverse impacts. Switching to sustainable consumption and production, applying the principles of circular economy, eco-design and zero waste are modern approaches in this regard. The money could flow from simply redirecting the funding from ‘nature-ignorant’ decisions to ‘nature-savvy’ decisions and mainstreaming biodiversity in key economic sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism, forestry, infrastructure, health and manufacturing, as already proposed under the provisions of the Biodiversity Convention. Additionally, investing in biodiversity conservation is a cost-effective way to maintain ecosystems resilience and mitigate the impacts to climate change. Ultimately, investing in biodiversity is beneficial for social and economic development. Or, as some say, “green is the new gold.” For the protection of very specific, sensitive, or in crisis ecosystems or species, the funds should be provided through a comprehensive, holistic mix of sources from public and private finance, philanthropy and even crowdsourcing. Finally, the quality and efficiency of the way financial resources are used is just as important as the quantity. Partnerships with civil society, local communities and indigenous people are effective ways to maximise investments and deliver good results for conservation in the long run.",Environment; Biodiversity; Conservation; United Nations; Wildlife; World news; Animals; Science,Environment
2018-02-02T14:17:34Z,How China really perceives ‘Auntie May’ | Yuan Ren,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/china-perceive-auntie-theresa-may-visit,"On the same day that the BBC underlined China’s apparent excitement over Theresa May’s visit, with a video featuring Chinese students praising the UK, Chinese social media was arguably more enthusiastic about the “super blue blood moon” . On Wednesday night China’s popular social media platform WeChat was awash with user postings of moon pictures. Most Chinese people are unlikely to know that the British prime minister is in their country. “I don’t think anyone is paying attention to that,” a Chinese news assistant for a European news agency replied, laughing, when I asked her about May’s visit. As much as the visit has made headlines in the Chinese media, which is mostly state-sponsored, it was her visit to Wuhan that created more buzz, and for a much less well-known female figure. Jiang Shuying, or Maggie Jiang, a Chinese TV actress who holds a masters from the University of East Anglia, was propelled to social media stardom as she showed the prime minister around Wuhan University. Both news and social media posts about the visit were quick to note the actress’s polished beauty and how good her English was. There is some media intrigue with May herself, in particular her family life – as you would expect from a deeply patriarchal society where only one woman sits in the 25-strong top-level politburo. Media noted that May’s visit was the first time she had been accompanied by her husband on an official visit abroad, the narrative being “the quiet man behind a strong woman”. The fact that they have no children was mentioned – the expected explanation for many Chinese people as to how a woman could arrive at such professional distinction. Foreign female political figures are often portrayed as hard bitten – and like Angela Merkel, May has been referred to as an “iron lady”. But this image was tweaked in a state media interview, who suggested the title of “Auntie May” in an interview with her before her visit. As with “Uncle Xi” (President Xi Jinping) and “Mama Peng” (the first lady, Peng Liyuan), the term politely labels May as an amenable and reliable member of the leader’s extended, international family. It’s a clever tactic, but politeness and even flattery is the Chinese way, rooted in its three classical Confucian texts that set out how to behave in public and private. There is no reason China shouldn’t view the UK positively, given that British backing into critical government-led projects such as the new Xiong’an economic zone to the south-west of Beijing. David Cameron first talked of a “golden era” in Sino-UK relations two years ago, evoking China’s own “golden age”: a reference to the prosperous Tang dynasty and thriving trade along the Silk Road. The term has been rejigged: it is now the harvesting of “golden fruits” under May. But the enthusiasm may be less glowing than the British side wants to believe. It’s telling perhaps that Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, wrote in an article in the Telegraph this week that: “Both China and the UK now stand at the entrance to a new era.” Surely this unique relationship is not still hovering at the doorway? China has more in common culturally with the UK than any other European country, and far more than with the US. Ancient history is an important rhetorical device in contemporary China and Xi’s overall political narrative, and the UK’s “stable history” gives it symbolic credibility as a global ally that is experienced in “investment, security, green finance”, as China News wrote. However, the way China sees Britain is not quite the same as at the end of 2013, when George Osborne and Boris Johnson first touted a “special relationship”, going to Beijing to discuss trade. Back then, China also saw the UK as a powerful extension of Europe. With Brexit, it realises the need to court the rest of the continent, for which read France and Germany, more directly. For the time being, the importance of Britain must be weighed against the bigger investment China is trying to make in the EU, which it views as a single entity. May’s visit comes hot on the heels of Emmanual Macron’s a few weeks ago. On the positive side, you could argue that Brexit may grant China more flexibility in trading with the UK, and the depreciation of the pound attracts more investment. For China’s booming middle class, in particular, the devaluing of the pound has been delightful, allowing more families to consider sending their children to study in the UK, not to mention the shopping on Oxford Street, and at Bicester village. But given that Europe is particularly important in the Belt and Road initiative, Xi’s flagship project, China’s focus will increasingly be there. There are also niggling reservations over May after delays in the approval of the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, in which China has a one-third stake. Overall, the UK remains an ally that provides valuable investment opportunities, as well as a country admired by China for its strong political institutions, and centuries-long record of global influence. While there’s no sign of the lavish state reception that greeted Donald Trump in the Forbidden City, the UK can continue to curry favour by supporting the Belt and Road project, and may eventually taste the nectar of those “golden fruits”. If nothing else, loyal family member “Auntie May” – unlike the “stealthy” Trump who flips on China all the time – is unlikely to end up doing anything unexpected. • Yuan Ren is a bilingual writer and broadcaster on China",China; Asia Pacific; Theresa May; Politics; World news; UK news; Foreign policy; Belt and road initiative,Opinion
