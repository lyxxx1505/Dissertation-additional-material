2024-05-28T00:51:58Z,Pro-Palestine protesters at ANU move campus camp by 50 metres ahead of noon deadline,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/28/anu-gives-noon-ultimatum-as-pro-palestine-protesters-refuse-to-disband-campus-camp,"Student protesters in Canberra have moved their pro-Palestine encampment to a new location after police demanded they pack up by noon on Tuesday. Protesters at the Australian National University voted on Monday night to relocate their camp 50 metres down the road, saying they had engaged in good faith. But they condemned what they called “reckless and unjustifiable intimidation tactics” from the university. The ANU dramatically escalated its response to the on-campus occupation on Monday, demanding protesters vacate their site at Kambri, in the centre of campus. Police attended campus at the ANU’s request on Monday and warned students that failure to comply with university directions to leave the site by midday on Tuesday “may result in further action by ACT Policing”. An ANU spokesperson said the university had ensured that protests were safe, appropriate and lawful. “ANU has provided options for the protestors to continue their protests in ways that are respectful and safe for the entire university community,” the spokesperson said. “The university will continue to discuss these options with protestors.” ACT police said officers remained in regular contact with ANU security and were monitoring developments with protesters. No arrests had been made in relation to the encampment. ANU initially directed the encampment to move on Monday morning when the director of facilities and services, Jeremy Matthew, said the camp was in a fire evacuation zone, creating an “unacceptable risk” to staff and students. “We’re committed to the safety of this campus,” the encampment spokesperson and ANU student Al, who preferred not to share their surname, said. “We want to engage in good faith, on the fire evacuation or on our demands as a whole.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Protesters called on supporters to rally on campus on Tuesday morning in support of the camp and said they planned to continue their campaign. In response, ANU shut down businesses in the Kambri precinct, and blocked off public access to a number of buildings adjacent to the Kambri Lawns, including the Marie Reay teaching centre and Chifley library. The ANU students’ association president, Phoenix O’Neill, told the rally the protest had been “disruptive, but peaceful”. “The encampment has moved but the goal of making the university divest has absolutely not,” they said. Students and a number of staff then marched down University Avenue past their new camp site before arriving at management offices. Earlier on Monday ANU security ordered the remaining students entering their fourth week occupying the site to immediately disband. Students rejected the demands, instead issuing a call-out for supporters and legal observers to reinforce numbers. In a video posted to social media, an organiser said a vote had been taken and the remaining protesters had decided to stay on at the Kambri site. “The police have come and told us that we need to leave but we as a collective have decided we’re going to say,” they said. “We will not be moved, we will be staying in Kambri.” From 8am to 3pm on Monday, police officers joined about two dozen members of campus security as protesters drummed on upturned buckets, chanting: “We are the students. We won’t be silenced. Cut the ties now, now, now, now.” The ANU spokesperson said: “No one has been told not to protest.” The direction follows meetings with a small group of students who were advised to disband or risk breaching the university’s code of conduct. Students refused, vowing they would not move until ANU disclosed and divested its ties to weapons manufacturers. Both the University of Melbourne and Curtin University have agreed, in part, to protesters’ demands while negotiating an end to encampments. Camps at La Trobe and Deakin University have also been disbandedas university managements warn of disciplinary action. On Monday afternoon, student protesters at Adelaide University and RMIT announced they would voluntarily pack up after four weeks, while adding they would continue to fight for the Palestinian cause. Asked whether ANU would change its position, the spokesperson said all university investments were governed by its socially responsible investment policy. “The university thanks our student body for drawing our attention to areas that we may need to now consider in 2024,” they said. “This includes expanding companies for review, along with emerging areas of research including artificial intelligence. “The university has listened to this important feedback from its students and thanks them for it.”",Australian universities; Australia news; Israel-Gaza war; Canberra,Australia news
2023-11-25T10:00:46Z,King’s estate to transfer £100m into ethical funds after bona vacantia revelations,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/25/kings-estate-transfer-cash-ethical-funds-bona-vacantia-revelations,"King Charles’s estate has announced it is transferring more than £100m, including funds collected from dead people under the archaic system of bona vacantia, into ethical investment funds after an investigation by the Guardian. The surprise announcement came amid growing pressure on the king over the Duchy of Lancaster’s use of funds collected from people who die in the north-west of England with no will or next of kin. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed some of the funds were secretly being used to renovate properties that are owned by the king and rented out for profit by his estate. The duchy conceded that some bona vacantia revenues are financing the restoration of what it calls “public and historic properties”. However, the king’s estate has also been battling separate questions over its management of another portion of bona vacantia funds that are given to its charities. Two of those charities have used bona vacantia to build major endowment funds worth more than £40m. Their accounts state that there are “no specific constraints on the investment portfolio in terms of ethical, social or environmental (ESG) matters”, although investment managers are advised to take such matters “into consideration”. Contacted by the Guardian this week, the Duchy of Lancaster initially declined to say whether its charities had invested in any oil or gas, tobacco, weapons or mining companies. However late on Friday, a spokesperson for the estate announced a change in policy. “In line with the king’s longstanding support of ethical investing, the Duchy of Lancaster has begun the process of transferring its investment portfolio into ESG funds. This process is expected to be completed by the end of the financial year,” the spokesperson said. There been no suggestion from the king’s estate that it plans to cease collecting bona vacantia or change how it is spent. However, the shift in investment policy will bring the Duchy of Lancaster’s approach into line with that of the Duchy of Cornwall, another royal estate that receives bona vacantia funds, which has an ethical investment policy. The king previously owned and closely managed the Duchy of Cornwall, which raises profits for the heir to the throne. When Charles became king, it was inherited by his son Prince William. At the same time Charles inherited from his mother the Duchy of Lancaster, which exists to raise “private” income for the monarch. Both the duchy itself, and its charities, have investment portfolios. The duchy’s own portfolio, according to its accounts, include equities, bonds and other financial investments worth £74m. That too is now being transferred to ethical funds. The charities the duchy gives bona vacantia revenues to, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund and Duchy of Lancaster Jubilee Trust, have also built large endowment funds, worth £18m and £26m respectively. Both charities’ accounts state they aim for an annual return of £500,000 from their investments, and benchmark the success of the bulk of their stock investments against the FTSE All-Share Index, an index that includes companies such as Shell, BP and British American Tobacco. Ben Faulkner, of the ethical investment company EQ Investors, said benchmarking against an index could mean replicating investments in the companies involved: “Using an index as a base for a replication strategy is very common, known widely as index tracking. When doing so you will typically have more invested in the biggest companies within the index you are tracking … Shell is the largest listed company within the FTSE All-Share Index.” In the last five years, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund has made nearly £2m in income from its investment portfolio, while the Jubilee Trust has made £2.5m. The Duchy of Cornwall, which collects bona vacantia from Cornish residents, has a clear ethical policy in relation to investments by the Duke of Cornwall Benevolent Fund, which has built a £5m endowment. Its accounts state: “The fund is entirely invested in the Newton SRI Fund for Charities, a global and diversified portfolio of equities and fixed interest securities with particular emphasis on environmental, social and governance considerations, screened against negative socially responsible investment criteria.” The Duchy of Lancaster’s announcement of a similar policy comes amid growing questions for the royal estate which has long claimed that bona vacantia proceeds go to charity after costs are deducted. In a shift in language, it now concedes funds are additionally spent on “restoration and repair” of qualifying buildings on the estate. Leaked documents reveal properties deemed eligible for the funds include a suite of properties rented out to raise profit for the king, including holiday lets, farmhouses, a barn on a shooting range and a petrol station. The duchy collects bona vacantia assets from residents of the ancient county palatinate of Lancashire – a territory that includes Lancashire and parts of Merseyside, Cheshire and Cumbria. Cat Smith, MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: “Like so many other local people I was surprised to learn the anomaly that means those dying without a will or heir in the county palatine see their assets passed to the king rather than the state. It’s an unjust and archaic hangover from the medieval times and I’ll be seeking advice on how to bring my constituents’ rights out of the feudal era.” Her comments come after criticisms from two mayors from the north-west of England. “This appears to be a bizarre remnant of feudal Britain,” said the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. “At the very least, people in the north-west are owed transparency and accountability. They should also have a say on how these proceeds are used. I would call on the government and the Duchy of Lancaster to initiate a public consultation on this issue to work towards a set of arrangements that could command greater public consent.” Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, also expressed concern. “Worthy causes have been bypassed and instead it appears that funding has been spent renovating royal properties. I hope the situation will be clarified urgently and, if money has been misused, it is put back where it should be: with those charities it was promised to.”",King Charles III; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment; Monarchy; UK news; North of England; Lancashire,UK news
2023-05-24T18:03:57Z,US Congress members demand that PayPal end ban on Palestinian business,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/24/paypal-palestine-ban-us-congress-,"Eleven members of the US Congress have demanded PayPal end a ban on doing business with Palestinians in the occupied territories while permitting Israeli settlers to use the digital payment platform. The letter, authored by Representative Mark Pocan, says PayPal is discriminating against Palestinians by denying “equal access to the digital economy”. “We have significant concerns that, because PayPal does provide services to Israeli citizens in illegal settlements across the West Bank, but does not provide services to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, PayPal’s current operating status may be infringing upon the rights of Palestinians,” the letter said. “As one of the world’s most recognized payment platforms, PayPal has a responsibility to ensure its services and operations are provided in a non-discriminatory manner.” The letter was sent to PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, ahead of the company’s annual stockholder meeting on Wednesday. It was also signed by Representatives Earl Blumenauer, Betty McCollum, Rashida Tlaib and Greg Casar, among others. PayPal has not explained publicly why it has singled out residents of the Palestinian territories, only saying it regards the area as “high risk”, when other financial service providers, including Visa, Mastercard and Apple Pay, operate in the West Bank and Gaza without problems. The payment platform operates in other areas of conflict, including Yemen and Somalia. Palestinian business owners have likened the PayPal ban to Israeli checkpoints that control movement, saying it stifles economic development because so many other platforms use the payment service, such as eBay. The socially responsible investment firm Harrington Investments, founded by John Harrington, who was at the forefront of pushing US corporate divestment from apartheid South Africa, has put forward a proposal at PayPal’s shareholder meeting that would see the payment platform’s board “establish a policy that ensures that people in conflict zones, such as in Palestine, do not suffer discriminatory exclusion from the company’s financial services”. The proposal says that if PayPal does not wish to implement the policy then it should “provide an evaluation of the economic impact the policy of exclusion has on the affected populations as well as the company’s finances, operations and reputation”. PayPal has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. A Palestinian American businessman, Sam Bahour, plans to tell the shareholder meeting that his companies have worked with the US and UK governments and the EU but cannot use PayPal. Bahour, who is a founder of the Palestine Telecommunications Company, noted that firms such as Cisco, HP and Oracle operate in the Palestinian territories. “Likewise, it’s a fact that Palestine has a thriving banking sector and all Palestinian banks have corresponding US banks that make money transfers daily. The US Treasury Department is also active in Palestine and has praised the level of Palestinian banking compliance,” he said, according to a transcript of the planned remarks. In 2021, PayPal partnered with the strongly pro-Israel group the Anti-Defamation League to investigate “hate group funding”. Palestinian groups accuse the Anti-Defamation League of conflating the campaign for Palestinian rights with extremism and antisemitism. When the partnership was announced, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee asked PayPal: “Will you be going after organizations that fund settler terror against Palestinians?”, a reference to registered charities in the US that send tens of millions of dollars a year that fund settlers who expel Palestinians from their land and other activities widely regarded as war crimes under the Geneva conventions. “Will you block orgs supporting the theft of Palestinian land? … Or are extremists just people your new business partner doesn’t like?” PayPal has been asked for comment.",PayPal; Palestinian territories; Israel; Race; Business; Middle East and north Africa; World news; Technology,Technology
2022-10-23T06:30:29Z,The future offers only variants on austerity? Bunk. There are ways to invest and grow | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/the-future-offers-only-variants-on-austerity-bunk-there-are-ways-to-invest-and-grow,"Common sense now has it that “the markets” are Britain’s new rulers. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is co-governing with them, so the story runs, in contemplating “eye-wateringly” difficult decisions to cut public spending, as would a putative Labour successor, Rachel Reeves. Thus, just as libertarian dreams of stupendous unfunded tax cuts to drive growth are now over, so are social democratic hopes of building a just society. Allegedly, the implosion of Trussonomics has made the lights go out across the political spectrum; the future offers only variants of austerity. I disagree. Britain is not yet an emergent economy. It still has vast resources if it chooses to access them. It possesses a fabric of institutions ranging from the UK Debt Management Office to the Bank of England that, given the right constitutional framework and proper economic and political leadership, are more than capable of being the markets’ master rather than their servant. Economic and political choices remain. Nor are “the markets” hegemonic forces that always and everywhere blindly impose austerity and economic suffering. They are simply our creditors, holding our debt and to whom we have to sell more – therefore, they have to be carefully managed. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, their heads full of Brexity libertarian arrogance and delusion, chose to ignore that reality. The lesson is not that there are no choices but austerity – it is that successful economic management requires seeing straight. It is true that some market participants, generally the hyper-short-termist hedge funds and day traders, are fiercely pro-free market, anti-regulation and pro-Brexit. But there are many more market actors who, for example, take green and socially responsible investment seriously, are pro-EU, understand the case for regulation as long as it’s not too onerous and get that governments tax, spend and borrow to achieve varying political ends. They don’t automatically veto a social democratic government any more than they would a libertarian one. They veto a stupid government. If there is any shared ideology, it is that they want the government of the day to accept the rules of engagement with any creditor. Their fiduciary obligation is to conserve the assets for which they are responsible, which affects anyone, for example, with a private or occupational pension. Quite right. They look for credible fiscal plans that will be delivered within a well-understood, predictable and above all solid framework that can’t be overturned by political whim. Yes, the Truss-Kwarteng growth plan was intellectually risible, but what really spooked, and continues to spook, market actors is that the British constitutional and political system could allow such cultish nonsense to get so far. Even now, the constitutional arrangements of this, a G7 country, are so primitive that they allow a group of Tory backbenchers in the 1922 Committee to set the rules for who will become prime minister. Small wonder that, as Boris Johnson’s ghoulish re-emergence as a leadership contender surfaced on Friday afternoon, sterling and bonds weakened. Britain’s uncodified constitution, in which so much depends on unwritten protocols being respected, has always been vulnerable to one political party going rogue, in which case not only the economy but the rule of law and even democracy itself are threatened. The proroguing of parliament in September 2019 at Johnson’s discretion was a forerunner of what has been happening over the past six weeks. The summary sacking of the permanent secretary of the Treasury with zero process and the overruling of the legal requirement to publish independent economic forecasts with the mini-budget came from the same roots. A minister, exercising regal prerogative power, can do whatever he or she damn well pleases. Now the same principle is written into the financial services and markets bill: a minister is to be given the powers to “recall”, rewrite or veto any dimension of financial regulation that may displease him or her with no parliamentary process. It was one of many reasons for the credit rating agency Moody’s citing “unpredictability in policymaking”, lowering the UK’s credit standing on Friday from stable to negative. Any successful social democratic government thus has to do two foundational things. It needs to reform the constitution so that the presumption becomes that significant changes to our institutional arrangements have to be validated by both houses of parliament rather than left to ministerial fiat. Democratically elected governments set out their proposals in their manifesto and legislate for them; they can respond to changing circumstances by proposing reforms and new regulation but ministers should not be able to govern by whim with no recourse to parliament. Happily, Labour is halfway there with Gordon Brown’s constitutional review, proposing replacing the Lords with a newly powerful upper house democratically recruited from the UK’s cities, regions and nations. To his list of proposed reforms, Brown should add ending “Henry VIII” prerogative powers. Second, there must be a recasting of the UK tax system, far too biased to tax income and not capital, property and wealth. For example, Britain’s housing stock is worth more than £8tn. Council tax – in England, extraordinarily, based on 1991 property values – yields £40bn, a derisory 0.5%of the value of the stock, well below what domestic rates proportionally used to yield before their abolition by Margaret Thatcher. Taking action on this, along with revisiting the taxation of the super-rich and their capital, and the government could comfortably raise the £40bn needed to plug the fiscal black hole. Marry that with a commitment within a new constitutional settlement to respect the independence of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the yet-to-be-established Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. Also offer a credible medium-term plan for spending, taxing and borrowing – borrowing only for capital and science investment – and the “markets” will happily hold and buy more UK government debt at reasonable or even falling interest rates. On top, it will offer a credible framework for growth driven by public and private investment. Don’t believe the financial Eeyores. The death of Trussonomics is just that. Britain can have high-quality public services and social justice if it chooses. It just has to choose. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Economic policy; Politics; UK news; Moody's; Business; Liz Truss; Kwasi Kwarteng; Jeremy Hunt,Opinion

Investors in Australia’s biggest poker machine operator, Endeavour Group, which runs 12,539 pokies across 300 hotels, include the “Socially Aware” option run by the nation’s biggest fund, AustralianSuper, and the “Sustainable Growth” option offered by the retail employee fund Rest. AustralianSuper’s Socially Aware option is also invested in casino operators and Australia’s biggest pokies manufacturer, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia’s third biggest super fund, Aware, which promises to “invest your super in ways that will do good for your community”, is also a big holder of gambling stocks, including Aristocrat and Endeavour. Guardian Australia analysed portfolio holdings disclosures for the most popular investment options offered by the 10 biggest superannuation funds in Australia, as well as socially aware options offered by AustralianSuper and Rest. Under laws brought in last year by the Morrison government, superannuation funds are required to provide details biannually of what they invest in. The data analysed was the most recent available and was correct as of 30 June this year. It reveals that the 10 biggest super funds all invest in Aristocrat Leisure, owning a total of at least $1.67bn worth of shares. It is one of the world’s largest poker machine manufacturers as well as a gambling app developer. In 2021, the company generated $4.7bn in revenue and held 80% of the market share in pokies in Australia, according to Ibisworld. Australians lost $11bn to pokies in 2021 Australians lose about $25bn to legal forms of gambling every year, according to recent estimates from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Last year they lost more than $11.4bn to poker machines alone. AustralianSuper holds 6.6% of Aristocrat’s shares after increasing its stake from 5.05% in June this year. In June, the fund had nearly $921m invested in Aristocrat through its most popular option, Balanced. The Balanced option also invested $624m in Endeavour, $148m in Tabcorp and $661m in Lottery Corporation, which runs lotteries including Tattslotto and Oz Lotto and was spun out of Tabcorp in May. It also had $103m invested in SkyCity Entertainment, which runs casinos in New Zealand and Adelaide, and $4m in the troubled Sydney casino operator Star Entertainment. AustralianSuper’s Socially Aware option also includes $16m in Aristocrat shares, along with holdings in four more of the six biggest Australian-listed gambling companies, amounting to nearly $45m this year. The Socially Aware option screens out companies that directly own fossil fuel or uranium reserves, or produce tobacco, cluster munitions or land mines, have single-gender boards, or “have received a red flag rating on labour rights, human rights, environmental or governance controversies”. AustralianSuper’s marketing does not mention gambling. A spokesperson for AustralianSuper said the fund did not exclude particular industries, other than tobacco. The fund had been “actively engaging” with gambling companies “to understand the initiatives they have to ensure high standards of responsible gaming and appropriate governance practices are in place”, the spokesperson said. “We will remain vigilant to ensure these companies are consistently acting in line with community and investor expectations and can deliver long-term value for members.” Aware Super champions itself as a morally oriented fund that is “at the forefront in responsible investing, leading and collaborating with a common purpose” and that it is “investing in good”. As at June 2022 its most popular, high-growth option had invested some $460m in Australian gambling companies, including $219m in Aristocrat. A spokesperson for Aware said: “We invest across an exceptionally wide and diverse range of industries and the gambling sector is just one of these. Importantly, members with ethical concerns around the gambling sector can choose one of our socially responsible investment options, which have no gambling exposure.” Rest claims its Sustainable Growth option excludes companies that earn more than 5% of their revenue from gambling – but of the $106m invested in the relatively small option, more than $400,000 is held in Endeavour shares. Endeavour does not disclose how much of its revenue comes from its 12,539 poker machines. The shareholder activist Stephen Mayne, a long-time opponent of the pokies industry, estimated that Endeavour reaps between $1.5bn and $1.6bn in revenue from its poker machines every year. An Endeavour spokesperson declined to comment on Mayne’s estimate but said the total revenue from its hotels business was $1.5bn last year, out of total sales of $11.6bn. “For competitive reasons, we do not disclose the breakdown of the revenue streams in our hotels,” the spokesperson said. “We report to the market in accordance with all accounting standards and laws.” A spokesperson for Rest said: “We are confident that the gambling exclusion is currently correctly applied.” All of the fund’s investment decisions were “made in the best financial interests of our members”, the spokesperson said. Rest was an “active owner” that prioritised “engaging with companies as a shareholder” on environmental and social governance matters, and monitored its screens and exclusions “on an ongoing basis, including those that apply to the Sustainable Growth option”. “Rest has attended a number of company engagements and discussed responsible gambling with board representatives, and currently has more planned … We consider divestment if it’s [in the] best financial interests of our members to do so.” ‘Profiting from misery’ Mayne criticised AustralianSuper for buying more shares in Endeavour after its separation from supermarket group Woolworths in June last year – a demerger that followed criticism of the retailer for being involved in pokies. “I think it’s a disgrace that Aussie Super, after Woolworths demerged Endeavour Group, they’ve consciously gone out and aggressively bought more shares in Endeavour Group, knowing it’s Australia’s biggest pokies operator,” he said. He contrasted AustralianSuper’s attitude with that of other investment funds, which sold their Endeavour shares after receiving them in the demerger “because they didn’t want to be investing in specialist gambling companies”. Anyone who knowingly invested in Aristocrat was “profiting from misery”, Mayne said. “I think [Aristocrat is] responsible for enormous misery.” A spokesperson for Aristocrat said all poker machines sold to venues in Australia were “highly regulated and are compliant with a wide range of technical standards and regulations which take into account harm minimisation”. The chief executive of the Alliance for Gambling Reform, Carol Bennett, said gambling companies were “as bad as it gets when it comes to corporate responsibility”. Public awareness about gambling harm was growing, Bennett said, particularly in the wake of inquiries into Crown and Star casinos, which found a series of licence breaches, including evidence of money laundering and criminal involvement in junket operators that bring high-rollers to Australia. A royal commission in Victoria also found that Crown consistently breached its licence by allowing people at its Melbourne casino to gamble on poker machines for at least 12 hours at a time before checking that they were OK. “I think a lot of people are shocked by what they’ve seen and they’re increasingly concerned,” Bennett said. • In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858. The National Debt Helpline is at 1800 007 007. • This article was amended on 15 November 2022 to clarify the status of Aware super’s offering and remove the words “wholly ethical”",Gambling; Superannuation; Australia news; Ethical business; Business,Australia news
2021-06-12T14:04:20Z,G7 backs Biden infrastructure plan to rival China’s belt and road initiative,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/12/g7-global-infrastructure-plan-to-rival-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative,"The G7 group of rich nations has agreed plans to set up an alternative to China’s belt and road initiative as part of a broad push back against Beijing covering human rights, supply chains, support for Taiwan and demands to reveal more about the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some G7 leaders, however, including the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, the current chair of the G20, have urged Joe Biden not to push competition with China to the extent that it prevents cooperation on other vital issues such as the climate crisis. The EU is also pressing the US to back a legally binding code of conduct for the South China Sea that Beijing has been negotiating with regional powers. Draghi, an Atlantacist, has shifted Italy away from the near pro-China policies of the previous Italian government led by the Five Star Movement, but argues that the G7 has a balancing act to pull off in challenging and cooperating with Beijing. Germany, often cautious about confronting China, has been reluctant to specify the monetary value of any infrastructure fund, and France has emphasised a reallocation of rich countries’ special drawing rights, foreign exchange reserve assets maintained by the IMF, towards poorest countries as a means of easing liquidity. US officials said Biden was pushing the other G7 leaders for “concrete action on forced labour” in China and to include criticism of Beijing in their final communique. Japan also said it was backing a mention of Taiwan in the final statement. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke to his Chinese opposite number, Yang Jiechi, from Cornwall on Friday to urge him to release more details about whether Covid-19 leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, a once-dismissed theory now gaining currency. Yang told Blinken the laboratory theory was absurd, according to the state-run China Global Television Network, and that “genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles”. Small-circle diplomacy is a caustic reference to the fact that the proportion of GDP generated by G7 states has declined. Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the UK, the summit’s host nation, is however widening that circle by inviting the leaders of the chief democracies in Asia and the Pacific region – India, Australia and South Korea – to come to the talks in Cornwall this weekend. Biden, in an effort to keep G7 allies on board with his tough China strategy and to create new diplomatic alliances in Africa, is also trying to inject credibility into plans for a western alternative to China’s belt and road initiative, an infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping involving development, port, road, rail and digital schemes from Asia through Africa to Europe. More than 100 countries have signed up to schemes with China. “This is not just about confronting or taking on China,” a US official said. “But until now we haven’t offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.” The officials said the Build Back Better World(B3W) would be “an ambitious new global infrastructure initiative with our G7 partners” that would not only be an alternative to [China’s belt and road initiative. The plan would involve raising hundreds of billions in public and private money to help close a $40tn infrastructure gap in needy countries by 2035, the official said. The Chinese schemes have been criticised, often on contested evidence, for tying up developing countries in crippling debt that leaves them politically beholden to China. Some academics say there are isolated examples of debt enchainment, but the secrecy surrounding many of the contracts makes it hard to judge. According to a Refinitiv database, more than 2,600 projects with a value of $3.7tn were linked to the initiative as of the middle of last year, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden raised the idea of reviving a Trump-era plan for democratic countries to develop their own rival scheme with Johnson in March. In discussions at the G7, Biden also pressed other leaders to make clear that they believe forced labour was an affront to human dignity and “an egregious example of China’s unfair economic competition” to show that they were serious about defending human rights. “We’re pushing on being specific on areas like Xinjiang where forced labour is taking place and where we have to express our values as a G7,” the US official said of the final communique to be issued at the end of the summit on Sunday. It is not clear if the wording will be tougher than the G7 foreign ministers’ statement in May that said: “We agree the importance of tackling instances of forced labour through our own available domestic means, including through raising awareness and providing advice and support for our business communities. We strongly support independent and unfettered access to Xinjiang to investigate the situation on the ground.” The communique also implicitly recognised Taiwan’s independence by calling for it to attend the World Health Organization and World Trade Organization. James Crabtree from the Singapore-based IISS thinktank praised the timing and principle of the G7 infrastructure scheme, but was sceptical about implementation because of the lack of specifics, including money and the fact that the Trump administration had launched similar schemes to no effect. Launching half-baked schemes can do more harm than good, he suggested. The US recently relaunched the Blue Dot Network initiative, a way of branding existing private sector infrastructure schemes as environmentally friendly and socially responsible investment.

2018-09-28T06:00:49Z,Is Goldman Sachs’ new fund really just greenwashing stocks?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/28/is-goldman-sachs-new-fund-really-just-greenwashing-stocks,"When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support “just business behavior”, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. “Capitalism should be a positive force for change,” said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. “Its future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.” The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just’s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund’s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company – and one of Goldman’s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. “You shouldn’t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you’re doing responsible investing,” Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. “The compartmentalization is very hypocritical.” Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund – which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. ‘Ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach’ Goldman’s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) – a financial strategy that represents Wall Street’s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary “screening” tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company’s long-term financial prospects. PwC’s 2017 survey of corporate officials found “that directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas” and the report added that “one of these areas is environmental issues”. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O’Neill put it in a press release, to “[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors”. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing – the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. “Putting the word ‘ethical’ or ‘sustainable’ in the name of a fund does not make it so,” said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. “It is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.” Goldman’s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman’s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for “serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail”. Whether Goldman’s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College’s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm’s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. “There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,” Peifer said. “Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.” In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company’s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples’ rights. “The company’s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,” wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on “policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change”. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against “proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company’s policies with respect to political contributions”. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company’s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman’s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund’s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant’s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company’s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron’s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman’s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair – a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just’s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would “generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society”. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company’s compensation practices “may insulate senior executives from legal risks” relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital’s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. “Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,” said Just Capital’s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies “while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry”. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. “The reason they’re going into this is that there’s money there. It’s all driven by greed,” she said. “It’s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.” As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal records show that the American Bankers Association – which lists Goldman Sachs as a member – has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement. “Shareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,” wrote Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. “Making it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.” Co-published by Capital &amp; Main, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.",Goldman Sachs; Environment; Business; Banking; Chevron; ExxonMobil; Amazon; Facebook,Business
2019-11-26T15:48:12Z,University of Manchester to review fossil fuel shares after student protest,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/26/university-of-manchester-to-review-fossil-fuel-shares-after-student-protest,"The University of Manchester has said it will review its £12m investment in fossil fuel firms after a seven-day protest by students who threatened to go on hunger strike. Students from the protest group People and Planet had occupied one of the university’s buildings for the past week in a demonstration against its multimillion-pound investment in fossil fuel companies. The university said it recognised “the urgency of the issue” and committed to bringing forward a review of its investment portfolio. A freedom of information request by People and Planet found that the University of Manchester, one of Britain’s biggest academic institutions, owned nearly £12m worth of shares in fossil fuel companies despite claiming it was committed to being a “world leader in sustainable development”. The announcement follows divestment pledges by several big universities in recent years, including the University of York last month, Durham University, Cardiff University and Bristol University in 2018. Student pressure has played a key role in these decisions, with many of them coming after significant student-led campaigns. Lizzy Haughton, of Manchester University’s students’ union, said significant progress had been made despite the university’s reluctance to commit to full divestment: “They don’t want to say it out loud, but divesting has to be a part of decarbonising the investment portfolio, so it goes beyond divestment. “We haven’t won yet. There’s very little trust between the students and the university to do all of this, but it’s the biggest shift that we’ve seen since the campaign started.” In a joint statement, the University of Manchester and the students’ union said: “The university has committed to bring forward by a year the review of its SRIP [socially responsible investment policy] because of the shared recognition of the urgency of the issue. “This review will be completed before 31 July 2020 for implementation from 1 August 2020. There will be meaningful engagement with the wider student, staff and alumni bodies as part of this review.” People and Planet called off the week-long demonstration following the university’s commitment. The group said the decision to end the occupation had “not been taken lightly” but it accepted the university’s statement “because of the enormous potential it offers, which could go far further than simply divestment from fossil fuel companies”. Speaking to the university’s student newspaper, the Mancunian, immediately after the occupation ended, the students said they felt they were treated badly by the university, who they said had blocked their access to food and other supplies during the course of the week. “I think they forgot we are students of theirs,” said one of the activists, Neriya. • This article was amended on 27 November 2019 to remove some personal information.",University of Manchester; UK news; Fossil fuel divestment; Environmental activism; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment,Education
2020-01-23T00:19:09Z,From loo roll to dumplings: Hong Kong protesters weaponise purchasing power,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/from-loo-roll-to-dumplings-hong-kong-protesters-weaponise-purchasing-power,"Emily Mak works in finance but every lunchtime in the run-up to lunar new year on Saturday she heads to a bustling Hong Kong market street to distribute lai see packets to customers who have ordered them online. Her packets – red envelopes used to hold a traditional new year gift of money for children – are emblazoned with pro-democracy messages. The profits of the more than 20,000 packets she has sold will be donated to young protesters experiencing hardship. Mak’s packages are an example of the ways that Hong Kongers find new directions to take their struggle for democracy into the economic arena. Across Hong Kong even staunch supporters of the pro-democracy movement are counting the cost of the months-long conflict in which police have arrested about 7,000 and fired live rounds as well as tens of thousands of rubber bullets and more than 16,000 canisters of tear gas. Mak’s lai see packets are part of the emerging “yellow economic circle” which encourages individuals to use their consumer power to sustain the movement and weaken China’s economic dominance. “We have to help our own people,” Mak said. “So many people got beaten, wounded and arrested in the protests. We cannot stop our fight.” China is the main supplier of a range of necessities in the city, from water, meat and vegetables to electronics and consumer products. But now consumers can check lists of shops and restaurants perceived as “yellow” (pro-democracy) or “blue” (pro-government or pro-China) on mobile apps, compiled by pro-democracy supporters. “I’m driven by my conscience. We don’t know if it would work, but we must try,” said Kevin Chan, 56, who bought lai see packets from Mak. Adrian Kan, who participated in protests during most of the past seven months, said the injuries and arrests rendered the radical protests unsustainable and he now patronised “yellow” shops and joined a peaceful “Lunch with you” rally in the financial district of Central several times a week. “The movement has definitely changed direction,” said Kan, an IT professional. “We need to maintain the momentum of our struggle in our everyday life and remind people that we’re not alone.” Keith Poon, restaurant manager of the Trinity dumpling bistro, part of a consortium of “yellow” eateries called HKEconRim, said his restaurant’s business had soared after it joined the consortium in September. The dumplings made in his restaurant used meat from pigs bred in Hong Kong and pastry made by local shops. “It’s more expensive, but we want to support local industries,” Poon said. “Red capital has long monopolised the market. Only by patronising our local businesses will the yellow economy have bargaining power in our struggle.” Roy Tam, a pro-democracy politician, said Hong Kong’s economic reliance on China had enabled Beijing to wield considerable power in its affairs, and consumer power could change that. He helped his constituents buy toilet rolls to support a local paper recycler. “Around 80% of toilet rolls sold in Hong Kong are Chinese products,” he said. “By forming an alliance with people who share our political views, we hope to reduce our reliance on China.” The “yellow economic circle” initiative was dismissed by Hong Kong’s commerce and economic development secretary, Edward Yau, as an unsustainable fad and attracted the authorities’ wrath. A commentary in the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, said: “It is an insult to the word ‘economy’ and a breach of basic human rights. It’s barbaric, coarse and full of antisocial, anti-civilisation tendencies.” But the authorities’ criticism shows their fear it might just work, said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University in the US: “Hong Kong and China are in an economic slowdown. The ‘yellow economy’ would give a lifeline to those which show support to the movement.” He said value-driven consumerism, such as movements to encourage buying fair trade or organic products, was common around the world, as were socially responsible investment funds: “If Hong Kong people can successfully transfer their protest energy into this, it could work.” Economists have said that while the “yellow economy” might have an impact on dining and retail sectors, it would be hard to have a presence in the city’s four key industries – finance, tourism, trading and logistics – which are dominated by China-linked businesses. Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at Baptist University of Hong Kong, said that even if the cumulative impact on the overall economic structure might not be felt, the conscience-driven initiative was effectively “a form of protest in daily life which breeds a sense of self-determination and solidarity against the government”.",Hong Kong; Asia Pacific; World news; China,World news
2019-08-10T06:00:24Z,Why is it so difficult to stop your pension money making the climate crisis worse?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/10/pension-money-ethical-invest-climate-crisis,"In the highly unlikely event that Greta Thunberg grows up and gets a job at the average British company (yes, highly unlikely) then there would be almost nothing she could do to stop part of her pay going every month into a company pension that would, in turn, stuff the money into oil companies such as Shell and BP. It’s 2019, and computer processing has transformed every part of our financial lives – from contactless payments to instant online shopping. So why, when the climate crisis demands urgent action, is it still virtually impossible to control where the biggest sum of money any of us are likely to accumulate – our pension – is invested? Do you want to make sure your pension money is not being used to support the extraction and burning of coal? Fracking? Or drilling for oil in the Amazon or Antarctic? Good luck with that. There are almost no company pension schemes in Britain that allow the employee to stop their money going into fossil fuel extraction. Yet it should be as simple as pressing a few buttons on a workplace computer. Instead, we have a pensions infrastructure in the UK which is fundamentally unfit for purpose when it comes to climate change. This is not to argue that you should be forced to “divest” your pension from fossil fuel companies. Environmentalists make a good case that investing in oil companies will be a bad financial decision – because the huge reserves of oil that make up much of their value will become “stranded assets” as we stop burning fossil fuels. But the shares of oil companies may still be great investments. After all, tobacco companies have flourished (BAT is now the seventh biggest company in Britain) despite all the evidence of how smoking kills. But the important point is that no one is forced to invest their company pension in tobacco stocks, with almost every scheme offering an ethical fund that “screens out” shares in cigarette companies. That’s not the case with fossil fuels. In no other area of consumer expenditure does the buyer – you and me – have so little control and choice. Your employer, not you, chooses where your pension money is invested. It picks whether the likes of Aviva, Aegon or Legal &amp; General will manage your pension savings while at work. But it’s you, the employee, who pays and bears the risk. “There is a huge mismatch between customer and provider,” says Beau O’Sullivan of campaigners ShareAction.org. “The person bearing the investment and climate change risk is not the person choosing the scheme.” Maybe you’re thinking, hold on, doesn’t my employer offer a range of funds for me to invest in? And if I’m a real keeno, can’t I go into the scheme and pick and choose where the money goes? You’re right, but only to a point. Most company pension schemes will automatically “default” you into a prescribed “lifestyle” or “target” fund. In turn, it’s then invested across a range of international shares and bonds. Almost without exception these will include large investments in the likes of Shell and BP (oil and gas) and Glencore and BHP (coal). If you want to take more control, most schemes allow you to, say, put more into emerging markets and less into UK shares. Most will also allow you to divert your money into the “ethical” fund, which avoid tobacco, arms and gambling stocks. But only a tiny number of ethical funds screen out oil, gas and coal companies, and the chances they’ll be available in your company pension set-up are very low. Many of the big Scandinavian and Dutch schemes have already pulled their investments from companies that, say, violate the Paris climate agreement, such as AP of Sweden’s decision to divest from Exxon Mobil. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which manages $1tn (£786bn) of Norway’s assets – ironically mostly derived from oil – has also been given the go ahead for the largest fossil fuel divestment to date by dropping more than $13bn of investments, including Glencore and Anglo-American. Britain is behind the curve. Pension funds will argue that they are devoting time and resources to socially responsible investment, and that they are “engaging” with companies on climate change, which they are. But they need to be bolder and offer simple, accessible ways for savers to opt out of fossil fuels entirely. It’s a choice that for too many people is currently denied. p.collinson@theguardian.com",Climate crisis; Money; Pensions; Environmental activism,Money
2020-02-29T07:00:39Z,50 simple ways to make your life greener,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/29/50-ways-to-green-up-your-life-save-the-planet,"Clean up your kitchen Love your leftovers Look at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says Feast food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of The Art Of The Larder (Quadrille, £25), and substitute for some of the flour and water in bread dough. Treat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of 30 Easy Ways To Join The Food Revolution (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else; aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise; fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack; cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up; wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.” Use tech for good Apps are taking the fight to food waste. Olio connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared; Too Good To Go enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates; while Farmdrop connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at sharewaste.com. Shop little and often A lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.” Buy half your food locally The shorter the food chain, the less waste created before it reaches your kitchen. Hunter subscribes to buying 50% of food grown within 30 miles of where you live. “It’s an achievable figure,” he says, especially when producers, such as Hodmedod’s in Suffolk, are reviving homegrown pulses including British lentils, quinoa, carlin peas and fava beans (which Hunter ferments to turn into miso and soy sauce). The nutritional value of fruit and veg lasts for only a short time, adds Gyngell, so how far your food has travelled matters. Pick your own “Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups; wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check woodlandtrust.org or wildfooduk.com. Switch your flours Crops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation; I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.” Befriend a butcher “There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. Compost on the go Compost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.” Plan ahead Make the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round; make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves; use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter. Minimise packaging Look for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners; so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can. All green on the home front Reduce your washing Erin Rhoads’ Waste Not Everyday (Hardie Grant Books, £10) points out that “the majority of the environmental burden caused by fashion happens after we take the clothing home: 82% of the energy a garment will use is in the washing and drying we do each week”. Rhoads suggests spot-cleaning, and neutralising smells with a spritz of diluted vodka or lemon juice. Clean with castile By making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in Clean Green (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth. Go for plastic-free personal care There is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a reusable tampon applicator. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.” Recycle as much as you can “Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body Wrap. TerraCycle rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has free national recycling programmes and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. Look after your electrical appliances The Restart Project is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting a directory of commercial repair options in London. (See also repaircafe.org for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” If your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity Emmaus accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too. Create clean air “You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms; weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas. Change your shower head “Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the Energy Saving Trust (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. “A water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 a year on gas for water heating, and a further £115 on water bills if they have a meter,” says Horne. Opt for green energy suppliers There are “shades of green” when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. “But just because you’re on a green tariff, it doesn’t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,” says Horne. Practise eco-driving Research by the RAC Foundation has found that eco-driving leads to safer, cleaner and more affordable journeys. Regular vehicle maintenance improves fuel efficiency by as much as 10%. Before a long journey, check tyre pressures (tyres underinflated by a quarter can cause a 2% increase in fuel consumption), remove unused roof racks and boxes, and don’t overload the car (every additional 45kg reduces fuel economy by 2%). At less than 40mph, it’s more fuel-efficient to open a window than use air conditioning. Turn off engines for waits of more than one minute (5-8% of fuel is consumed while idling), and avoid sharp acceleration and heavy braking: aggressive driving can significantly raise fuel consumption. Draught-proof your home One of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about £200, or do it yourself with products such as Gap Seal. Buy vintage furniture “Reusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,” says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio Harding and Read. “Secondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.” To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a free collection service), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. Optimise your white goods According to independent energy comparison service U Switch, the cost of running your fridge and freezer equates to about 7% of your total energy bill (they are one of the few household energy devices that are on all the time). U Switch recommends replacing your fridge and/or freezer if it is over 10 years old. Even if it’s working, the cost of a new model will be made up for in energy savings over the years. Keep your fridge at 5C or less (most are kept at about 7C, which means food will go off sooner) and ensure there is a 10cm gap behind your fridge to let heat flow away easily. Make sure the seal is strong – if it can’t hold a piece of paper when shut, it could be letting in warm air, making it work harder. Let the garden grow Buy local flowers – or grow your own About 90% of the flowers sold through UK florists, supermarkets and wholesalers are imported, mainly from the Netherlands, but they are also flown in from countries as far away as Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia. Reduce your floral air miles and find a local supplier through flowersfromthefarm.co.uk, a co-operative of small independent flower growers. Alternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener Sarah Raven suggests going for “annuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers – and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking”. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts. Encourage bees Honeybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of Planting For Honeybees: The Grower’s Guide To Creating A Buzz. “This is called ‘flower fidelity’ and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or ‘drifts’ of single species and optimise each of the bees’ trips.” Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. “March to September are the key months for honeybees – they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,” she says. Spend less, propagate more Your own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and divide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home‑propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant’s natural habitat to reduce failures. Lock up carbon In The Garden Jungle, Or Gardening To Save The Planet (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, £9.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don’t have room for large trees, “The basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.” So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don’t be too tidy, either. “Log piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.” Let the grass grow Letting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer. Encourage hedgehogs Hedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of How Can I Help Hedgehogs? (Octopus, £14.99). They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. “This is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence – it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.” Reboot your wardrobe Set a bar If a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the “30 wears rule”: ask, “Will I wear it at least 30 times?” before buying. Find a secondhand that works for you Opting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as Paper Dress Vintage or Cow, also have websites. Shop in person – and alone That said, shopping in person – especially if you walk there – is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on. It can help to ditch your friends. “When you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,” writes Lauren Bravo in How To Break Up With Fast Fashion (Headline, £12.99). “It’s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.” Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you’re hungry. Choose materials wisely Some fabrics age better than others; the Guardian’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim – another durable fabric – means jeans are also best bought secondhand. Unsubscribe and unfollow “If someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,” says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. “A brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability – that’s fast fashion.” The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too. Get swishing Clothes swaps – known as swishing – are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you’ll wear for years. Find one near you at swishing.com. Learn to mend Make your clothes fit Layla Sargent, founder of The Seam, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: “If it doesn’t fit well, you’re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.” The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner. Learn how to sew on a button How many shirts and jackets do you keep unworn at the back of your wardrobe because they are missing a button? Sewing on a button is a simple skill that everyone should have. There are lots of online tutorials; try one by the environmental activist Wilson Oryema for Fashion Revolution. Make your own apron from a pair of old jeans Turn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee’s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, £27, published on 26 March). Darn your socks “Once a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),” says Emma Mathews of Socko (socko.shop), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. “But we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.” Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic. Primp your trainers This is a growing service industry. Gråel in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning “coveted footwear”, offering laces cleaning (£3), a deep clean (£15) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (£35). Meanwhile, Jason Markk offers premium shoe care from branches in LA and Carnaby Street in London, where your trainers will be brought back to life by the brand’s sneaker-care technicians. Give the bathroom a makeover Recycle in there While 90% of us recycle our kitchen waste, we recycle only 50% of our beauty packaging – probably because our recycling bins are in the kitchen. Joseph Joseph makes an attractive split-waste bathroom bin for £20. You can reduce what ends up inside further by switching to bar soaps and shampoos (I love social enterprise Beco, from £2.50 at Co-op, Boots and supermarkets) and plastic-free handwash such as Soap Co (£19, 300ml, or £110 for a whopping 5l biodegradable container that should last a year). Lose the disposables A staggering 20,000 litres of water are needed to create only 1kg of cotton – that’s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as Face Halo (£7), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel; both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. A pack of 18, plus washbag, costs about £10. Pick the right package There’s no justifiable excuse for packaging short-use, everyday beauty products in virgin plastic. There are now a large number of brands packaging in post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), from the luxury (Aveda, REN, Biolage) to the mid-range (Soaper Duper, Lush), to the mass (all Simple and Dove bottles are now 100% PCR in Europe; L’Oréal Elvive, the world’s bestselling haircare brand, is rolling out 100% PCR bottles this summer – the caps are recyclable but not made from PCR – saving 7,000 tonnes of plastic globally a year). Alternatively, you could opt for products packaged in glass that haven’t travelled too far. Neal’s Yard mostly uses glass where safe, and distributes from Dorset. Don’t be tempted by minis Those pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in refillable travel bottles and pots from Muji (from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, take them to your nearest homeless shelter, where their clients need them. Embrace baths Baths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but some research shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too. Save to save the planet Save water and lower your bills Consider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Get free water-saving products from savewatersavemoney.co.uk. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website good-with-money.com. Get a loan to improve your home’s energy efficiency Some lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. Ecology Building Society offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties with energy-efficiency measures. Choose an environmentally friendly current account Nearly £150bn has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which has the backing of Friends of the Earth, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation BankTrack, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide. Invest wisely “Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” Evaluate your pension “For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus. Get a green financial adviser Last year, a new financial advice firm called The Path was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has 27 times more impact than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road,” MacDonald says. • If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",Environment; Food waste; Food; Gardens; Life and style; Fashion; Money; Personal loans; Personal pensions; Homes; Ethical and green living; Ethical business; Ethical money,Environment
2018-03-15T07:00:16Z,What to do with those divested billions? The only way is ethics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics,"Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years – boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers – ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as “socially responsible investment”, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about £300m a year was considered “socially responsible” investment; today it is, by one estimate £23bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (£60tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors – and the wider public conscience – are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business – cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. “I would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else’s misery,” explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year’s Schroders’ Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. “While profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,” said Jessica Ground, Schroders’ global head of stewardship. “But investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.” UBS’s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don’t want or can’t afford to pay for them. “It’s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you’d like to be treated,” says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing ‘bad’, or actively doing ‘good’. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices – also covering weapons and women’s progress – were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons “impact investing” – where investors actively seek out companies doing good – is a “force to be reckoned with”. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes’s £170,000 increased in value by 26% last year – notably more than conventional investments. “It started driven by values, it’s now definitely [driven] by value,” says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a “no brainer”. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years – reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were bêtes noires of ethical investors – tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced – by regulators, investors and public opinion – to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. “This is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,” says Andy Howard, Schroders’ head of sustainable research. “This is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.” In the meantime, says Hughes: “If I’m investing into a company that’s helping the environment, or helping women, I’m happy with that. That’s all you can ask of anyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

2018-02-28T06:00:10Z,Gun company investors push for change after Florida school shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/gun-company-investors-florida-school-shooting,"What if the answer to America’s guns crisis lies not with its government but with its gun companies? It’s a question that some investors are now asking and after the recent mass shooting in Florida, some see a path to change. While the deadly massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this month sparked a national debate and made its survivors a powerful voice for a new generation of gun-control activists, there are no guarantees of meaningful change. America’s mass shootings can seem like a grim repetitive cycle of “thoughts and prayers” followed by political inaction, a brief pause, and then another mass shooting. But this time, Judy Byron, coordinator of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is hopeful something has changed. “These high school kids are really changing the debate. I really see some hope this time,” she said. She aims to back their powerful rhetoric with money. The ICCR is a coalition of 300 global institutional investors which control $400bn in managed assets for faith-based groups, academics, unions and others interested in socially responsible investment. Normally, guns would not be on their list of good investments, but two years ago, outraged by the seemingly unending gun death toll in the US, the ICCR started encouraging its members to buy gun shares so that they would have a voice as shareholders. The campaign appears to be taking off. ICCR members have filed motions with the two largest listed US gun companies, Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith &amp; Wesson) requesting reports detailing the companies’ efforts to make their products safer. It’s a move that could bring pressure to bear on gun companies to do more to make their products safer and harder to buy, even if Florida’s tragedy fails to move Washington to action. “We are not going to do away with guns but what are they [the gun companies] going to do to make them safer?” asked Byron. Technology allows us to lock up our phones when they are not in our possession, she said. “But if I left my gun out on the desk, you could use it. Why is that?” she said. Until recently shareholder activists have tended to focus on “divestment” as their tactic to put pressure on gun companies. Many ethical funds refuse to hold shares in gun companies at all and following Florida’s shooting there have again been campaigns to press pension funds to drop their holdings. But those campaigns have been complicated in recent years by the rise of index funds – lower-cost funds that track the performance of various stock market indexes and hold shares in all their components. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with assets of $6tn, is a major player in index funds. As a result it owns significant chunks of gun companies Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm Ruger – not because it sees guns as a great investment but because they are constituents of major indexes like the Russell 2000 index for smaller companies. Last week, BlackRock said it too intends to speak to weapons manufacturers and distributors “to understand their response” to the Florida high school shooting. It hasn’t yet said what it will do if it doesn’t like their replies but the company has form for effecting real change. BlackRock’s founder, Larry Fink, warned company executives in January he expected them to behave as good citizens. “Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose,” Fink wrote to CEOs. “To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” The letter followed BlackRock’s decision last May to back a shareholder resolution to force energy giant Exxon to be more open about the impact of climate change on its business. That resolution had long been championed by ICCR members including the pension funds of the Church of England but with BlackRock’s support it was passed by 62% of shareholders. “When we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,” BlackRock said a statement. The Exxon victory could provide a model for change, said Byron. With BlackRock’s support, change is also possible at the gun companies, she said. She also pointed to the success of campaigners against apartheid in South Africa who targeted companies investing in the country until it scrapped racial segregation. “It took 20 years but it happened,” she said. “But this time we cannot take 20 years. I was a teacher and I just cannot imagine teaching in this environment.” Adam Kanzer, managing director of corporate engagement at Domini Impact Investments, which manages socially responsible mutual funds, said BlackRock’s involvement was a significant early victory for the campaign. “They are going to take that meeting,” said Kanzer. “I am very, very pleased to see that big investors are starting to wake up.” He also said that pressure for change was likely to come from below. “If you manage a teachers’ pension fund, you have got to be hearing from your investors about this,” he said. “That feels like a real problem to me.” But he worries that, as has so often been the case, attention spans are short and pressure for change could fizzle out. And that, in the end, America’s gun problem is an issue that needs “a public sector response. It is not going to be solved by the private sector alone”. The first test will come in May when Sturm Ruger holds its annual shareholder meeting and shareholders will be asked to force the company to account for its “activities related to gun safety measures and the mitigation of harm associated with gun products”. Even if they are not successful this time, the campaign will continue. “Something has to change,” said Byron.","US gun control; US news; Business; Parkland, Florida school shooting",US news
