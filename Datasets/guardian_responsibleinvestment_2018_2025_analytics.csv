2025-05-31T00:00:29Z,A guide to greener banking: I divested my personal finances and you can too – here’s how,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/31/a-guide-to-greener-banking-i-divested-my-personal-finances-and-you-can-too-heres-how,"What if your money was quietly fuelling the climate crisis – and you had no idea? If you bank with one of the big four or have retirement savings in superannuation, there’s a good chance it is. In Australia, many major banks and most default super funds continue to invest in fossil fuel companies and their coal, oil and gas projects, driving global warming. That’s where the global divestment movement comes in. Divestment means shifting your money out of harmful industries and into more ethical, climate-positive alternatives. It’s the opposite of investment – you simply pull your capital out of companies or funds that contribute to environmental or social harm. Over the past few years, I’ve delved into divesting my personal finances and learned some key ways this shift can make a real difference. The biggest win: change your super fund If you only tackle one area of divestment, make it your super – it’s often your largest pool of money beyond property, and too often it’s channelled into fossil fuels. The climate lobby group Market Forces estimates $150bn of Australians’ retirement savings – roughly $6,200 per member account on average – could be tied up in 190 global companies driving the most climate damage. And such investment is growing, meaning our retirement savings are increasingly being used to create a more polluted world to retire into. One way to find a better option is to use the Market Forces comparison tool. It profiles more than 70 fund options, pinpointing just seven that fully exclude fossil fuels and the so-called “Climate Wreckers Index” of the world’s worst polluters. Using this type of information, I divested from a large Australian super fund which has known investments in fossil fuels and moved to a fund that excludes major polluters such as Woodside, Whitehaven Coal, Santos, Origin and AGL. Justin Medcalf, co-founder of Ethical Advisers’ Co-op and Unless Financial, says to beware the “devil in the detail”. For example, some funds use a tiered threshold screening, which may allow investment in companies earning limited amounts of their revenue from coal mining. “A lot of investors assume that having a screening process in place means zero exposure to fossil fuels. It can be a rude surprise to discover there is still exposure,” Medcalf says. “Ultimately, there is no perfect portfolio. For now, it’s ‘how do we create the best version of something that isn’t perfect?’” Demand better of your bank – or move your money All four of Australia’s big banks – ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac – pour billions into fossil fuel projects each year, as do many other major players. In 2021, when searching for my first mortgage, I saw the chance to divest from a big four bank and switch to a more ethical option. I told my broker I wanted a home loan that was both competitive and backed by a bank that doesn’t fund fossil fuels. We landed on one of the few with a cleaner track record. To find out where your bank stands, use Market Forces’ Compare Banks tool. It includes a “tell them to stop” button, so you can quickly send a message and easily demand change. That’s crucial, says Medcalf. “A lot of people move their money but don’t say anything, so the bank never knows why. A key part of the divestment movement is communicating,” he says. And it works. Just last year, Commonwealth Bank broke ranks and announced it would stop financing fossil fuel companies that don’t comply with Paris climate goals. “That was quite a considerable win and a lot of that is attributed to the divestment movement,” Medcalf says. Invest in climate-positive projects If you’re investing in shares, ETFs or managed funds, beware of greenwashing. Many mainstream investment products – even those labelled “sustainable” or “balanced” – still include major polluters. Tools like the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia’s certification and the Ethical Advisers’ Co-op’s Leaf rating can help you find investment products and services that meet high standards of environmental, social and ethical performance. “We need a mindset shift,” Medcalf says. “Rather than thinking ‘what can I avoid?’, think ‘what can I actively invest in?’ Yes, we want to avoid industries that aren’t creating a positive future, but we can also get behind the industries of the future.” And divesting doesn’t have to mean missing out financially – it may even boost your returns. RIAA’s 2024 Benchmarking Report shows responsible investment funds have outperformed mainstream ones by 3% over 10 years, and 1.5% over five years. For long-term investors, especially those in their 30s and 40s, Medcalf says it makes sense to start factoring in environmental risk. Fossil fuel assets are increasingly seen as vulnerable, with tightening regulations and the growing risk of becoming “stranded” and unprofitable. Consider shareholder activism If you want to go a step further, consider strategically buying into a polluting company along with fellow shareholder activists who then band together to demand change from the inside. You can get started with as little as $500 using the Sustainable Investment Exchange (SIX) platform. Whether you divest, reinvest or become an activist shareholder, the point is the same: your money is powerful and you can actively choose whether it props up harmful industries or helps build a better future.",Personal finance; Ethical and green living; Ethical money; Environment; Australia news,Australia news
2025-05-29T05:48:16Z,Ask the experts: how do you make your money matter?,https://www.theguardian.com/australian-ethical-make-your-money-matter/2025/may/29/ask-the-experts-how-do-you-make-your-money-matter,"The rising cost of living undoubtedly affects the choices we can make, but research suggests Australian shoppers are still driven by their personal values. Sustainability is one of the biggest considerations. When Monash University surveyed Australian shoppers in 2024, 46% said sustainability was an important factor when they were making a retail purchase, while 30% frequently looked for sustainable products. Ethical supply chains, animal welfare, and commitments to diversity and inclusion are also common considerations for consumers, other research has found. This thinking affects decisions about products and services, but experts say to see real impact, we need to apply ethics to our financial and superannuation choices, too. Investing in change Many Australians already do this. Research conducted by the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) found that in 2024, 88% of Australians expected their investments to be responsible and ethical, up from 83% in 2022, while 65% said they would invest more if their investments made a positive impact in the the world (up from 61% in 2022). The RIAA’s co-CEO, Estelle Parker, suggests we carefully consider our individual values when choosing where our money goes. Almost all of us are investing in shares and other assets via the choices our super funds make on our behalf – which don’t necessarily fit with our own values. Fortunately, it’s easy to switch to a fund that’s more aligned. “The first thing is to decide what they want to achieve with their investment portfolio,” Parker says. “People can look at the websites of the funds they’re considering and make sure that those funds actually do support their values.” Every super fund is legally required to disclose its investments, but the disclosure isn’t always that easy to find or understand. Fortunately, there are tools that can help. Parker recommends checking out Responsible Returns, an independent source of information about super funds’ portfolio holdings, and Market Forces’ regular reports on how the finance industry contributes to climate change. Responsible Investment Association Australasia CEO, Estelle Parker Every Australian has the power to make a difference “We are all in a position to make a small difference through our super or other investment portfolios,” Parker says. “People are cottoning onto that, and the growing demand is being met by really good quality financial investment options that people can take advantage of. One of the funds featured on the Responsible Returns website is Australian Ethical. Alison George, Australian Ethical’s chief impact and ethics officer, spends a good part of her working week making sure that where Australian Ethical invests its customers’ money – which adds up to more than $13bn in managed funds and super – reflects the organisation’s values and those of its customers. “Australians have a choice of which super fund they have and can move that money at any time,” George says. “You are making a choice, whether you’re making an active one or not.” Doing nothing, George says, is an action in itself. “At Australian Ethical we have a theory of change for the future that guides the way we approach business and approach investment. We believe that if consumers vote with their choices and move to the funds that care about people, planet and animals, this kind of investing can grow. “One day it could just be normal for investments to consider the impact on the environment and society as well as the impact on the bottom line, and money can become a force for good.” Australian Ethical chief impact and ethics officer, Alison George Values-driven choices make our money matter For many people, super is one of the largest investments we will make in our lifetimes – and together we can use it to make significant impact. “The choices that we make as individuals do matter,” George says. “Like climate change: we know it’s an urgent threat. We know that as individuals, it’s hard for us to tackle and engage with. But your money aggregated with others, invested for positive climate solutions for the future, is a great way that you can be doing your part to shift the dial on that issue.” Will van de Pol is the CEO at Market Forces, which holds Australian financial institutions to account on climate. He says values-driven decisions are one of the most powerful ways we can make our money matter. “When it comes to taking on some of the world’s biggest challenges – like climate change – ensuring that your power as the customer is used in a way that drives solutions to problems is incredibly important and powerful,” he says. “The point is to make decisions about what you value most highly and see as ethical, and follow that through with your decision-making.” Market Forces CEO, Will van de Pol Super can be a catalyst for change Australians who care about sustainability might choose to buy locally grown produce or an electric vehicle. If fair working conditions are important, they might research a product’s supply chain or find alternatives to fast fashion. George says: “We’re all busy people – but the idea here is to start acting on what you know and think about making better choices, rather than doing nothing while you wait for perfect information. “When you have time, put that effort into things that are more impactful and bigger choices for you. The car you drive, your bank, your super fund – they’re all good examples of decisions that can have really broad-ranging and long-term impacts. Australian Ethical is seeing more people making values-based choices about their super, George says. “People are recognising the importance of their superannuation money as something that they want to make sure is invested well, for themselves, for the planet and for society as well.” With $4.2tn held in super – more money than Australia’s GDP – the potential for supporting change is profound. Imagine if all of that money was invested in companies trying to change the world for the better. A super fund that aligns with our values is one way we can become part of a force for good.

2025-01-13T14:02:06Z,Apple asks investors to block proposal to scrap diversity programmes,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/13/apple-investors-diversity-dei,"Apple has asked shareholders to vote against a proposal to scrap its diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, as tech rivals scale back similar schemes before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative thinktank, wants the iPhone maker to end its DEI efforts because they expose companies to “litigation, reputational and financial risks”. The proposal will be voted on at Apple’s annual general meeting on 25 February. In a notice to shareholders, Apple’s board has recommended investors vote against the proposal because, it says, it already has the right compliance procedures to deal with any risks and because the proposal “inappropriately attempts to restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies”. DEI schemes are sets of measures designed to make people of all backgrounds – regardless of ethnicity, class, sexuality and gender – feel supported and included in the workplace. Discussions on ways to increase diversity, particularly on race, rose to global prominence in 2020 when the murder of George Floyd by a US police officer prompted businesses to examine their own policies amid global protests. However, the concept has since become a focus for rightwing politicians and Trump has pledged to ban DEI programmes in both the government and the private sector. Last week, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it was terminating its DEI programmes immediately. Janelle Gale, the vice-president of human resources at Meta, said in an internal memo: “The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the US is changing.” Meta also referenced recent supreme court decisions and the “charged” views of DEI that are held by some people. The US supreme court, which has a conservative majority, ruled in 2023 to overturn “affirmative action” policies under which universities sought to adjust admissions to take into account disadvantages for racial minorities. The change followed Meta’s announcement that it was changing moderation practices at the company to “get back to our roots around free expression”. Meta is not the only company to row back on diversity programmes. Amazon also announced last week that it was winding down its diversity programmes. In a memo to employees on Friday, the tech company said it was “winding down outdated programmes and materials” related to representation and inclusion. McDonald’s last week said it would end some diversity goals for its leadership and suppliers, also citing the supreme court decision. The company had introduced the targets – including having women account for 45% of leaders, and 35% of US company leaders to come from “underrepresented” groups – in 2021 after lawsuits alleging discrimination and sexual harassment. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, in November said it would stop using the term DEI, drop DEI training and stop considering race or gender when deciding on supplier contracts, after it was threatened with a boycott by conservatives. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a century-old campaign group, has said it will take legal action to prevent what it describes as the “second Trump administration’s retreat from civil rights enforcement and attacks on efforts to promote racial justice”. Kohinoor Choudhury, the DEI campaigns manager at ShareAction, said: “Whether we are talking about tackling climate change or improving equality and inclusion, these are material financial risks for companies and investors, and are critical to responsible investment. “Whilst it’s concerning to see some companies in the US scaling back their DEI efforts, it’s important that we don’t mistake this change for a global shift. In the UK, companies have a legal duty to address discrimination through requirements … “We urge investors to continue using their influence on the companies they own and invest in to uphold responsible investment standards.” Other companies have signalled a shift in focus away from other issues supposedly aligned with progressive politics. Six of the world’s largest banks – JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – have left the UN-sponsored net zero banking alliance since the start of December. Activists have criticised the move as a way to avoid attacks from the Trump administration, which is strongly committed to the fossil fuel sector.",Apple; Technology; Technology sector; Business; US news; UK news; World news; DEI policies,Technology
2024-10-13T06:00:46Z,‘Very concerning’: BP dilutes net zero targets as global retreat from green standards gathers pace,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/13/very-concerning-bp-dilutes-net-zero-targets-as-global-retreat-from-green-standards-gathers-pace,"In early 2020, Bernard Looney had one clear goal as the incoming chief executive of BP: to convince the world to see the oil company differently. For a time, he did exactly that. In a glossy, high-concept London campaign launch, the BP boss set out 10 new aims for the company, the most significant being BP’s transformation to a net zero energy company by 2050. Within months, he reinforced the rebranding with a pledge to cut the company’s oil and gas production by 40% from 2019 levels by the end of the decade. At the time, his strategy even won the approval of Greenpeace – a feat few oil executives can boast. But by early 2023, BP had watered down the 40% cut to a 25% reduction after the war in Ukraine caused oil prices to surge, doubling the company’s profits. Within months, its greenest ever chief executive was ousted from the company amid revelations about undisclosed relationships with colleagues. His green plans have followed suit. It emerged last week that BP plans to abandon its curbs on fossil fuel production in favour of targeting several new investments in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico. The news angered climate campaigners, but surprised very few. BP’s green retreat has arguably been the most brazen in the industry – from a grandstanding green agenda to a fresh focus on fossil fuels – but the backtrack from environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is gaining pace among the world’s biggest companies and investors. The term ESG was first coined by the UN in a 2004 report entitled Who Cares Wins. It provided companies and investors with a model for implementing the ideals of responsible investing in their spending plans. By 2015, the idea of ESG had evolved from being a talking point to a set of standards which could, and should, be measured. But in recent years, companies and investors in the US and Europe have begun to chafe at the requirements to disclose their ESG credentials, and retreated from the commitments themselves – often to protect their profits. BP’s oil industry rival Shell signalled earlier this year that it may slow the pace of its emissions reductions for this decade by setting a new plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade, compared with its previous target of 20%. Shell has also backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling”, which involves breaking down plastic polymers into tiny molecules that can be made into synthetic fuels or new plastics. It promised to use 1m tonnes of this recycled plastic in its global petrochemicals plants, but later admitted the plan was “unfeasible”. Oil companies are not alone in scaling down their green promises. Volkswagen has quietly dropped a voluntary target to cut CO2₂ emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 30% between 2015 and 2025 in favour of making the same cuts between 2018 and 2030. And Unilever – the conglomerate that owns brands including Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Vaseline, and which is widely credited with pioneering the ESG movement – signalled earlier this year that it would abandon or water down a string of ESG pledges amid a growing backlash from investors and politicians. “It’s a very concerning trend,” said Lewis Johnston, director of policy at the responsible investment organisation ShareAction. “In general, we have seen quite a concerted and organised pushback against some of the principles of responsible investment. It’s a very different philosophy of what generates long-term value.” As recently as 2021, the world’s biggest investors counted ESG principles as important hallmarks of a sound investment. The US investment giants BlackRock and Vanguard voted in favour of almost half of all shareholder ESG resolutions proposed in 2021. But since then they have dramatically withdrawn their support following a fierce political backlash. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, legislators in Texas and other critics of ESG escalated the stakes in late 2022 by collectively pulling billions of dollars in state funds from BlackRock. The investment group’s support for ESG measures has since plummeted. BlackRock has confirmed that in the 12 months to the end of June 2024, it supported only 20 of the 493 environmental and social proposals put forward by shareholders at the annual meetings of the firms in which it invests. This represents just 4% of ESG proposals, compared with 47% three years ago. Vanguard supported none of the 400 environmental or social shareholder proposals that it considered in the 2024 US proxy shareholder season, saying they were “overly prescriptive”, unnecessary or did not relate to material financial risks. Gemma Woodward, the head of responsible investment at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, highlighted the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a tipping point in the trend against ESG. “We saw a real turn in the market where value came back into fashion, and so we saw an ‘easing of the pedal’ of the interest in [ESG],” she said. “I’m very worried, obviously … I guess the problem we’ve got is that we don’t have a global standard.” However, BP and Shell still looked “pretty good” compared with oil companies in the US, where there was an even bigger backlash against ESG, Woodward said. US banks JP Morgan and State Street pulled out of the Climate Action 100+ investor group, which pushes for change from big greenhouse gas emitters, this year. “It’s certainly at its most extreme in the US,” Johnston said. “But we’re not immune to it in the UK or in Europe.” Last summer, the EU confirmed plans to water down the final rules for corporate ESG disclosures through the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The move comes after European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to cut red tape across the EU executive’s work to counter complaints from big companies over the mounting cost of environmental rules. Under the new rules, companies will have more flexibility to decide what information is “material” and therefore should be reported, in effect making some disclosures voluntary instead of mandatory. The easing was described by HSBC analysts at the time as a “step back” in ambition and robustness, but a step that may facilitate convergence in sustainability reporting globally. Johnston insisted that climate transition reporting should not be considered yet as another raft of burdensome reporting rules. Instead, he said, it was about making sure companies were aware of both the risks and the opportunities involved in adapting to the climate crisis. “Mandatory [climate] transition plans are a means of empowering companies and positioning the financial system as a whole, and aligning that and the real economy with the transition that we know is coming,” Johnston said. “So I think it’s absolutely wrong to look at this as merely another regulatory burden, because it really isn’t … It’s about imposing discipline and making sure that companies are preparing for what they should be doing, and that’s, again, responsible stewardship.”",Corporate governance; BP; Ethical business; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Energy industry; Commodities; Business,Business
2025-04-17T06:06:21Z,Can your super be good for you and the planet?,https://www.theguardian.com/australian-ethical-invest-in-a-better-tomorrow/2025/apr/17/can-your-super-be-good-for-you-and-the-planet,"Why do I need to worry about what my super fund is investing in? Australian superannuation funds invest trillions of dollars held in 22.2m member accounts. Our money makes things happen. It’s invested in everything from infrastructure, equities, property, retail and banks to gambling, tobacco and fossil fuels. Anyone concerned about social harm, human rights, environmental degradation or climate change might want to look closely at how and where their money is invested. If you’re making choices in your everyday life to do better, such as by choosing certain brands, recycling or using renewable energy, consider how this could be amplified by directing your retirement savings into projects and businesses that do good on a bigger scale. What is ethical super – and how do funds’ approaches differ? Funds differ in their approaches to ethical investment. One fund, or investment option, might only screen out certain sectors, while another might also look for companies and projects that do good, and allocate capital towards them. Lots of different labels are used to describe investment approaches, which can make it difficult to assess at a glance how ethical a fund is. The lines are blurred between the terms ethical, sustainable and responsible. Some approaches sound good but may not be what you are looking for. Applying an ESG (environmental, social and governance) filter, for example, is about assessing financial risk rather than making judgments based on ethics, and could lead to portfolios containing companies you don’t approve of. It’s also worth noting that ethics vary from one individual to the next. What you consider ethical and what a fund considers ethical may not be the same thing. Is the focus on returns, or ethics, or both? Look at the investment options in most super funds and you’ll find a range of categories to choose from. These categories are often focused on your stage of investing and appetite for risk, rather than the ethical nature of the investments. Even when super funds offer choices, most are primarily focused on returns. You’ll find high-growth (and high-risk) investment options, or more conservative options with lower risk, often favoured by people close to retirement. Some funds also offer ethical investment options. Australian Ethical specialises in them; investments in sectors such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy and tobacco are restricted, while investments in sectors such as renewables, healthcare and IT are supported. How ethical investments are chosen varies between funds, and between investment options within funds, but the goal is always to get good returns as well as invest ethically. My fund says it is one of the good ones. How can I check? Since March 2022, super funds have been obliged to provide publicly accessible twice-yearly portfolio holdings disclosure statements, which outline the composition of the investment options they offer. However, if you’re not a finance nerd, these statements can be overwhelming. Luckily, they are not the only tools at your disposal. You may find reports on ethical funds in the media. The funds themselves can also be a source of information; many are keen to explain their different approaches to investing, and offer detailed information about their ethos and investment choices. The Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) ranks ethical super funds on an investment scorecard in its annual responsible leaders report. Organisations such as Market Forces, which exposes institutions financing environmentally destructive projects, or Choice, can also help you determine if your super fund or investment option is the right one for you. I need my money to work hard – can ethical investing deliver strong returns? Research has found that many ethical funds or investment options perform just as well as, if not better than, standard superannuation offerings. The fund researcher SuperRatings benchmarks the performance of super funds with ethical options, and in 2024 ranked Australian Ethical’s Australian shares option number one for returns over 10 years out of 39 funds. The ATO, Canstar and Finder all offer comparison tools through which you can see how your fund is performing. If you’re unhappy with the ethics of your fund’s investments, the Responsible Returns comparison website can help you find an ethical super fund that meets your criteria.

2025-02-18T00:01:51Z,"Support for ESG proposals at record low driven by US investors, report shows",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/18/support-for-esg-proposals-at-record-low-driven-by-us-investors-report-shows,"Support for shareholder proposals aimed at tackling environmental and social risks hit a record low last year, figures show, amid a “worrying retreat” by investors, particularly in the US. A report compiled by the responsible investment campaign group ShareAction found that, out of 279 environmental, social and governance (ESG) shareholder resolutions put forward at annual general meetings last year in the UK, Europe and the US, only four – or 1.4% – secured majority support. It marks a sharp decline from recent years, having dropped from 21% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, and 3% in 2023. However, it also reflects a severe drop in support for ESG issues in the US, where rightwing activists and politicians have targeted financial firms for supporting climate and diversity policies. Policymakers in Donald Trump’s administration are encouraging a retreat from environmental policies, in favour of support for oil and gas production. The shift has prompted six of the largest banks in the US – Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs – to withdraw from the UN-sponsored net-zero banking alliance in recent weeks. Trump has also used executive orders to reverse diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies in the federal government and is trying to apply them to the private sector. Companies including the Google owner, Alphabet and the Facebook owner, Meta, as well as the financial firms Deloitte and Goldman Sachs, have started to roll back their own DEI policies in response. Shareholder resolutions are usually put forward by campaigners and activists trying to force company directors to address issues including their climate impact, potential human rights abuses, diversity and inclusion policies, and executive pay. While those resolutions are not legally binding, they can put pressure on the board to take action. ShareAction’s Voting Matters report illustrates the growing divide between asset managers on either side of the Atlantic, with those in the UK and Europe supporting 81% of shareholder ESG proposals on average last year, compared with US peers, who supported just 25% of proposals last year. It also highlighted the lack of support by the world’s four largest asset managers: BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard. The firms, which are US-headquartered and together manage $23tn (£18tn) in assets, collectively supported just 7% of shareholder resolutions in 2024. “This is the worst result we’ve seen from asset managers in the six years we’ve been monitoring their voting performance and shows a worrying retreat from ambition when it’s most needed,” said Claudia Gray, head of financial sector research at ShareAction. “We live in a world where asset managers have a huge impact through the companies they invest in. Many claim to be playing their part in tackling important issues like climate change, yet our report calls into question whether the majority of the world’s wealth is being managed effectively by investment firms,” Gray added. The campaign group claimed that, had asset managers thrown their weight behind shareholder resolutions, they could have helped improve conditions for low-paid workers struggling with the global cost-of-living crisis and driven climate action at a time when the impact of the climate crisis is devastating communities worldwide. Just two of the 73 shareholder resolutions focused on climate change received enough shareholder support to pass last year. “At a time when the climate breakdown is already devastating lives around the world – from prolonged droughts to deadly wildfires – the finance sector should be driving urgent environmental action, not slowing it down,” Gray said. “What’s clear is we need better regulation from policymakers and bold leadership and ambition from decision-makers across the financial sector.” Commenting on the ShareAction report, a spokesperson for Vanguard said: “The Vanguard-advised funds vote with an unwavering focus on the long-term interests of fund investors, in accordance with their published proxy voting policies.” A spokesperson for BlackRock said its voting decisions “are based on the long-term financial interests of our clients. For the 2024 proxy year, we found that most environmental and social shareholder proposals were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or were unlikely to promote long-term shareholder value.” It noted that clients had the power to cast votes themselves, including in favour of shareholder resolutions.

2025-07-27T08:59:09Z,Edinburgh University could unadopt antisemitism definition after report into its colonial links,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/27/edinburgh-university-could-unadopt-antisemitism-definition-after-report-into-its-colonial-links,"The University of Edinburgh is considering whether to unadopt an internationally recognised definition of antisemitism that critics say inhibits freedom of speech on the subject of Israel and Palestine. Edinburgh, one of Britain’s oldest and most prestigious universities, is also considering whether to divest from companies accused of enabling alleged human rights violations by Israel. Both issues are being reviewed by university authorities as a report on the legacy of its historical links with the region is published. The report is part of a broader investigation of the university’s involvement in colonialism and slavery. It recommends that the university divest from companies allegedly complicit in Israel’s military actions in Gaza and the West Bank, supports the reversal of its adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, and establish a Palestine Studies Centre to investigate the legacy of the Balfour declaration and offer scholarships to students of Palestinian origin. The report focuses on the repercussions over the past century of the Balfour declaration, a 1917 statement by the British government in favour of “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”. As well as being British foreign secretary at the time, Arthur James Balfour was the University of Edinburgh’s chancellor – a ceremonial and ambassadorial role – between 1891 and 1930. He had been prime minister from 1902 to 1905. Balfour played a “unique role” in “establishing and maintaining a century-long process of imperial and settler-colonial rule in Palestine, resulting today in one of the longest-standing colonial occupations and apartheid regimes in modern history”, the report says. The IHRA definition and the university’s investments were already under review, Sir Peter Mathieson, the university’s principal, told the Guardian. The definition was a “hot topic” and “contentious”, he said. “There is not a unanimity of view. There are some Jewish people who think IHRA is a helpful definition, there are some people who think it’s unhelpful, and so those discussions are ongoing and we haven’t come to a conclusion.” This year’s graduation ceremonies have been hit by a series of protests and walkouts by graduates, with about 200 students staging protests at 24 ceremonies; some directly accused Mathieson of complicity in the Gaza crisis. Last year, students occupied the quad in Old College, where Mathieson has his office. The university was setting up a “responsible investment group” to examine its financial holdings, he added. Its remit included reviewing “investments in relation to companies which are allegedly supporting Israel”. Research on the legacy of the Balfour declaration was added to the broader study of the university’s links to colonialism a year after the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza. The report’s authors, Nicola Perugini and Shaira Vadasaria, both academics at Edinburgh, told the Guardian the decision to include Balfour’s legacy in the research was a “direct response” to pressure on the university leadership by campus protests over the Gaza war. The pair, both of whom taught for several years at al-Quds University, a Palestinian institution on the outskirts of occupied East Jerusalem, had already been researching Balfour’s legacy for several years. They have been involved in divestment campaigns on campus, and last year Perugini demanded Mathieson apologise publicly after the principal met the Israeli deputy ambassador to the UK. Balfour’s 67-word declaration said: “His Majesty’s government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.” During and after the first world war, Britain and other imperial powers were intent on dividing up the Middle East. Britain controlled Palestine under a League of Nations mandate between 1922 and 1948, during which its forces brutally suppressed Palestinian resistance to increased Jewish immigration in the wake of the Balfour declaration. The state of Israel was declared within hours of the end of the mandate in May 1948. The subsequent war drove hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes during what became known as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Many Palestinians still blame Balfour for what they see as an act of perfidy and betrayal. The report’s authors argue Balfour espoused openly racist views that explained his attitudes towards the Middle East, and had a record of supporting settler colonialism in Ireland, South Africa and Canada. In 1913, he became honorary vice-president of the British Eugenics Education Society. Some historians also say he was an antisemite who had backed the 1905 Aliens Act, which severely restricted Jewish immigration to Britain. The main university report said this legislation constituted the first modern UK anti-immigration law that was designed to prevent Jews fleeing to the UK after an explosion of anti-Jewish hatred and religious persecution in Russia. The academics who oversaw the university review believe Balfour’s views can be traced back to racist sciences that they say Edinburgh helped to formulate in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Although there is no evidence the university was involved in drafting the 1917 declaration, the report’s authors maintain it was closely aligned with Balfour’s career. It loaned him £12,000 – equivalent to more than £1.8m today – before he became its chancellor, and in 1925 Balfour wore his official university robes when he laid the foundation stone for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Vadasaria told the Guardian: “Balfour signed a declaration that put in place an imperial and settler-colonial structure of racial domination inside Palestine, which has been sustained by military occupation, ethnic cleansing, apartheid and genocide.” The report points out that the declaration defined Palestinians as “non-Jewish communities” rather than an Indigenous people with national rights to self-determination, and referred only to civil and religious rights rather than political and national rights. In the Nakba, Palestinians were forced into “permanent exile that continues into the present”. Balfour’s legacy was “not merely a matter of historical harm,” it says. “Indeed, harm to Palestinians today can be seen as an extension of Balfour’s legacy in the present. While this violence may have begun with Balfour’s declaration, it remains through ongoing policies that continue with the trajectory of imperialism, settler colonialism and the dispossession of Palestinian land and life.” The Balfour declaration was given an effusive welcome by the Guardian in 1917. Its then editor, CP Scott, had facilitated key introductions between prominent Zionists and members of the government. The report’s forthright language and recommendations, plus the absence of any reference to centuries of Jewish persecution and dispossession that led to the development of Zionism, or the horrific nature of the Hamas atrocities committed on 7 October 2023, are likely to be controversial in a climate of bitter divisions over the war in Gaza. The IHRA definition of antisemitism was adopted by the university in 2020, “without broad consultation with students and staff”, according to the report. The definition “violates academic freedom and freedom of speech by framing any criticism of Israel’s policies of settler-colonial dispossession driven by state racism as a form of antisemitism”, it adds. Alongside the definition, the IHRA offers what it describes as contemporary examples of antisemitism that critics say are used to protect Israel from legitimate criticism. Supporters of the definition say it is essential in helping to protect Jews from hate crimes and abuse. In 2020, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary in the Conservative government, threatened to cut funding to universities in England that failed to adopt the IHRA definition. The majority have done so. On the issue of divestment, the authors say the university authorities have “adopted a ‘conflict agnostic’ approach, a term that denies the Nakba and its settler-colonial afterlife”. This month, a UN report highlighted the involvement of companies from around the world in supporting Israel during its war in Gaza. It noted that the University of Edinburgh was one of the “UK’s most financially entangled institutions”, with nearly £25.5m invested in four tech corporations – Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM – that were “central to Israel’s surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction”. According to Perugini and Vadasaria’s report, the investments have left the university exposed to “complicity with genocide, crimes against humanity and illegal occupation”. A failure to divest would risk reputational damage and lead to further campus protests, the authors told the Guardian. • This article was amended on 29 July 2025 to correct a misquote in the opening line of the Balfour declaration.

2024-12-24T16:00:46Z,"UK must be less dependent on China for critical minerals, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/24/uk-less-dependent-china-critical-minerals-thinktank,"The UK must become less dependent on China for critical minerals, an influential thinktank has concluded before a government strategy decision in the spring. In a report on rare earth minerals, which are essential components for hi-tech products from mobile phones to missiles, Labour Together said ministers should “de-risk” supply chains and reduce reliance on China by building partnerships with other countries. The report said China’s dominance in critical mineral supply chains created “vulnerability” and the UK was at greater risk of being singled out after Brexit. Amid escalating trade tensions with the US before Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, China banned shipments of antimony, gallium and germanium to the country earlier this month. The UK government has said it will produce a new strategy on critical minerals in the spring. Labour Together said this should be closely informed by the government’s industrial strategy, also due in the spring, to determine which critical minerals and stages of the supply chain the UK will be most reliant on in the future. Critical minerals are essential for the green transition. Data suggests China extracts about 70% of the world’s rare earth metal ore, dominates the processing and refining of it and uses it to manufacture 90% of the global supply of neodymium magnets, the magnet most commonly used in wind turbines. The report also said it was important for China to be “engaged where possible, eg on mining standards, rather than treated as an adversary”. A paper by the Royal United Services Institute thinktank in October said the UK should work with China on improving environmental and labour practices in mining and engage with Chinese companies operating in countries eligible for international aid. Labour Together said the government should improve the coordination of cross-Whitehall work on critical minerals, work more closely with the EU, promote responsible mining standards internationally and lead a campaign to drive investment. The Conservative party published a critical minerals strategy in 2022, which the foreign affairs committee said was “too broad and does not convey the sense of urgency”. Alicia Kearns, the Tory committee chair at the time, said that for three decades governments had been “asleep at the wheel”. Labour Together described the Tory approach as “too slow, too general and given too little support”. Felix Cazalet, a policy fellow at the thinktank and author of the report, said: “The new government should be more alert than the last to risks, including from the concentration of production in countries like China, while taking a pragmatic and targeted approach in the new strategy. “This should focus on the key things that matter for the UK, and include working more closely with international partners such as the EU to increase responsible investment in resilient supply. The new strategy is an opportunity to secure the materials we need for the UK’s growth, security and green ambitions.” Ruby Osman, a China policy adviser at the Tony Blair Institute, said ministers needed to prepare for disruption if the critical mineral export restrictions targeted at the US were extended to the UK. “When it comes to China, our biggest problem has been timing. China has been building its remarkable market dominance for decades – the UK only released its first critical mineral strategy in 2022,” Osman said. “Diversification is, rightly, likely to be at the heart of Labour’s new strategy. But the UK’s strategy also needs to be realistic – we can’t ignore quite how dominant China is at every step of these supply chains. Even if it wanted to, the UK is never going to be able to cut China out entirely, and that means we’re going to need some considered engagement.” In 2010, China introduced an export ban on rare earth elements to Japan after a dispute. The clampdown lasted only two months but led Japan to diversify its supply chains and become less dependent on China.",Trade policy; Economic policy; Foreign policy; Politics; China; Manufacturing sector; Commodities; Mining; UK news; Environment; Business; Asia Pacific,Politics
2024-12-26T14:00:42Z,University of Sydney has invested in world’s biggest poker machine maker and global betting giant,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/27/university-of-sydney-has-invested-in-worlds-biggest-poker-machine-maker-and-global-betting-giant-ntwnfb,"The University of Sydney has financial stakes in the world’s biggest poker machine manufacturer and a global sports betting giant, both of which have funded its academics and bankrolled specialist gambling research centres. Documents obtained under freedom of information laws show the university held shares in Aristocrat, and in Entain, which runs the Ladbrokes and Neds brands, between 2021 and early 2024. Shares may have been held before and after this period, beyond the scope of the FoI. Entain, which was taken to the federal court this month by Australia’s financial intelligence agency for alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws, was a foundational sponsor of the university’s centre of excellence in gambling research. Aristocrat, which has exported poker machines to the world, has also funded gambling research at the university. Its 2023 sustainability report disclosed its support for the university’s gambling treatment and research clinic. The financial value of these investments is unknown but Aristocrat featured in a “table of largest active Australian equity positions averaged over 12 months” included in the FoI documents. Australian gambling giant Tabcorp topped the list. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The documents show the university also invested in International Game Technology, a London-based company producing poker machines and other gambling products. It also invested in Crown Resorts and the Star Entertainment Group until mid-2022. A list of the university’s investments, including foreign currencies and international shares, was obtained by the university’s student representative council. The council’s president, Angus Fisher, described the investments as concerning given “the broader societal impacts of gambling and industry’s funding of academic research”. “This issue is particularly pressing as gambling-related harm disproportionally affects vulnerable communities, and the industry’s role in funding research can lead to perceived or actual conflicts of interest,” Fisher said. “It is concerning that a university committed to advancing knowledge and social equity may be profiting from an industry that thrives on exploitation and addiction.” The online gambling inquiry report, released in June 2023, called on the federal government to help “protect public policy and research from gambling industry interference”. A university spokesperson said it was a “not-for-profit entity and re-invests all available revenue into enhancing research and teaching capabilities”. “We have strict rules around our investments and in recent years have reviewed our strategies to improve environmentally, socially and financially responsible investment practices,” the spokesperson said. “It is in all universities’ interests to ensure our research is robust and ethical – our research integrity is essential to our success. We have policies in place to ensure the avoidance and appropriate management of actual, apparent or perceived conflicts of interest by university staff and affiliates.” There is no suggestion the funding or the university’s investments influenced research conducted by its academics. Simon Chapman, a retired academic who successfully campaigned for the University for Sydney to no longer accept research funding from tobacco companies, said the investments should be scrutinised. “Universities cannot continue their research programs without support, but there is obviously controversy when the product is deadly or causes an immense amount of harm,” Chapman said. “Gambling is a case in point … It ought to be something that is debated across the university.” Tim Costello, the chief advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform, said “the reason Australia cannot escape the world’s greatest per capita losses and greatest gambling harm is that even our independent universities, like Sydney, invest in Aristocrat and Entain”. Prof Samantha Thomas, a public health expert at Deakin University, said the gambling sector should be treated like the tobacco industry, in light of the societal harm it causes. “The University of Sydney was a leader in tackling the tactics of the tobacco industry, including policies refusing to accept tobacco support,” Thomas said. “Given the clear recognised harm associated with commercial gambling, it is disappointing to see these relationships with the gambling industry”. Aristocrat was contacted for comment. It has previously said its funding of the gambling treatment and research clinic was to contribute to a better understanding of gambling harm and how to minimise risk. Entain has defended its funding of academic research. Last year, an Entain spokesperson criticised research conducted without its involvement. “There has been a tendency for discussions around the impacts of gambling harm to be led by speculation and emotional rhetoric, which can fuel a misguided or incorrect perception,” a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. “We would prefer more robust research that leads to fact-based decision making and regulation.”",Australian universities; Australia news; Gambling; New South Wales; Sydney,Australia news
2024-10-15T14:00:34Z,‘I love the smell of success more than petrol’: investors break with tradition in world-leading climate campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/16/i-love-the-smell-of-success-more-than-petrol-investors-break-with-tradition-in-world-leading-climate-campaign,"Institutional investors dealing with portfolios in the trillions of dollars aren’t typically the most vocal climate campaigners. You won’t find many superannuation fund staff, fund managers, asset consultants or brokers with a placard on the streets or on top of a Newcastle coal train. But you may increasingly find them on a screen you’re watching. Or at least their message. On Wednesday, the Investor Group on Climate Change, an organisation representing 103 members that manage the retirement savings of nearly 15 million Australians, will launch a national advertising campaign of green energy success stories under the banner “climate action pays off”. The campaign’s stated goal is to compel the federal parliament to back more policies that could accelerate the multibillion-dollar shift to a clean economy so the country can “continue building the industries of the future and help Australia become a clean energy powerhouse”. Its unstated goal is to address what some see as a vacuum in the national conversation about the climate crisis and communicate to Australians that acting fast would be an economic win across the community, not just a cost. Erwin Jackson, the investor group’s director of policy, said it was “the first positive investor campaign on climate change globally”. “Investors and investor groups globally are looking at this campaign because they essentially have the same issues that we have in Australia,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It kicks off as polling suggests voter enthusiasm for more aggressive climate action has waned amid rising household financial stress. Some surveys have identified confusion about the government’s position on the climate crisis, given it has backed both a rapid growth of renewable energy and continued expansion of fossil fuel export industries. The investor group campaign is focused on what comes next: a 2035 emissions reduction target due early next year, and six sectoral plans promised to explain what different parts of the economy can do to reach net zero. Its videos tell the stories of people working in clean businesses, including some who come from backgrounds in polluting industries. The framework echoes previous industry campaigns deployed to prevent ambitious climate action. One video focuses on Chris, an Adelaidean who says he has “gone from building fast cars” for Holden to “building solar farms at speed” and concludes: “I still love the smell of petrol, I just the smell of success more.” Jackson said investors had another motivation – they saw climate change as the biggest systemic risk to their assets. “They’ve done their own numbers and see the costs that will come if we don’t get on an orderly, planned and affordable path to net zero,” he said. “The idea of the campaign is to explain how this is benefiting people today and how there are transferable skills across the economy that will have a place in a net zero world. Whether you are in manufacturing, mining, engineering or a chippy, it will be better for you.” Investor group member Ausbil Investment Management Limited, a boutique global fund manager, said it backed the campaign because climate change was a significant threat to the economy. “An effective policy framework is crucial,” its chief executive, Mark Knight, said. “We need the federal government to stay on the path to net zero and set a strong 2035 carbon emissions target.” First Sentier, a A$227bn global asset management business, said its investee companies were already directly affected by the transition to a low carbon economy and the physical impacts of climate change. “It threatens the stability of economies and societies that underpin the financial markets we operate in,” its global head of responsible investment, Kate Turner, said. On Tuesday, the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced the government would spend $5.4m on a community pilot program to help 500 households in NSW’s 2515 postcode north of Wollongong run on clean electricity and appliances. The Coalition’s climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, said gas, a fossil fuel responsible for about 20% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, was “here to stay”. He said it would be included in the capacity investment scheme – a government underwriting scheme currently reserved for solar, wind and energy storage – if Peter Dutton became prime minister.",Renewable energy; Climate crisis; Environment; Business; Australian politics; Australia news,Environment
2024-05-30T06:50:01Z,BHP walks away from £39bn attempt to take over mining rival Anglo American,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/bhp-seeks-extension-to-talks-on-move-to-take-over-mining-rival-anglo-american,"Anglo American has survived an almost £39bn takeover plot by the Australian mining rival BHP after last-ditch talks over restructuring the 107-year-old company collapsed. The five-week pursuit came to an end after Anglo rejected BHP’s 11th-hour appeal to extend the takeover talks for a second time, after three failed takeover proposals from the Melbourne-based miner. The board’s opposition left BHP to choose between presenting a formal offer directly to Anglo’s shareholders by 5pm on Wednesday – or backing down from its pursuit of Anglo for at least six months. In a statement published shortly before the deadline, Mike Henry, BHP’s chief executive, said: “BHP will not be making a firm offer for Anglo American.” The planned deal, which was expected to radically reshape the global mining industry, hit an impasse over BHP’s plans to sell off some of Anglo’s South African business interests as part of the takeover. The proposals were described as “highly complex and unattractive” by Anglo, which is a household name in South Africa and counts the South African government as its largest shareholders. Henry said: “While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost and, despite seeking to engage constructively and numerous requests, we were not able to access from Anglo American key information required to formulate measures to address the excess risk they perceive.” The takeover talks have coincided with the run up to South Africa’s most uncertain general election since the end of apartheid, and ended as South Africans headed to the polls on Wednesday. BHP’s three takeover approaches all had a requirement for Anglo to spin off its operations in South Africa, including Kumba Iron Ore and Anglo American Platinum, a major employer in South Africa. This was opposed by Anglo and came under criticism from the South African government, which is Anglo’s largest shareholder through its Public Investment Corporation (Pic). The latest proposal from BHP included a string of promises to curry favour among South Africa’s investors, politicians and regulators. It pledged to maintain staffing levels at Anglo’s Johannesburg office and continue Anglo’s charitable commitments in the country for at least three years. It also promised to build “a centre of excellence” to support South African mining. However, Anglo said in a statement that BHP had “not addressed the board’s fundamental concerns” relating to the forced demerger of its South African businesses. It added that the “limited number” of socioeconomic measures suggested by BHP were“confined in scope, impact and duration”. Anglo added that, after discussion with shareholders, it had concluded there was no basis to extend the takeover talks deadline for the “highly complex and unattractive structure” of the proposed deal. The company plans to stave off further advances from its larger rivals by putting forward its own corporate shake-up, including a pledge to break up the 107-year-old business and sell its platinum division and its De Beers diamond arm. The plan has the backing of the South African government. Stuart Chambers, the chair of Anglo American, said the company had set out “a clear pathway to accelerate delivery of its strategy”. “We look forward to delivering our plans for the benefit of our shareholders and for stakeholders, both in our host countries and more broadly,” he said. Anglo’s vast reserves of copper are a key driver of the interest in the business because the mineral is an important building block for low-carbon technologies such as solar farms and electric cars. In addition to interest from BHP, which had hoped that the merger would reshape the industry by creating the biggest copper miner in the world, the company has reportedly caught the eye of Australia’s Rio Tinto and the Swiss mining company Glencore. Anglo’s decision to reject BHP’s call for further talks was welcomed by the Church of England Pensions Board (CoEPB), which holds a 1% stake in the company. Adam Matthews, the chief responsible investment officer at CoEPB, said: “We continue to view this proposed takeover as unfavourable to the long-term interests of our pension fund members. We believe a strongly backed Anglo is better for the mining sector in general, the global transition and remaining a strong presence in South Africa as well as listed in London.”",Mining; BHP; Anglo American; Mergers and acquisitions; Business; UK news; Australia news; World news; South Africa,Business
2024-05-28T00:51:58Z,Pro-Palestine protesters at ANU move campus camp by 50 metres ahead of noon deadline,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/28/anu-gives-noon-ultimatum-as-pro-palestine-protesters-refuse-to-disband-campus-camp,"Student protesters in Canberra have moved their pro-Palestine encampment to a new location after police demanded they pack up by noon on Tuesday. Protesters at the Australian National University voted on Monday night to relocate their camp 50 metres down the road, saying they had engaged in good faith. But they condemned what they called “reckless and unjustifiable intimidation tactics” from the university. The ANU dramatically escalated its response to the on-campus occupation on Monday, demanding protesters vacate their site at Kambri, in the centre of campus. Police attended campus at the ANU’s request on Monday and warned students that failure to comply with university directions to leave the site by midday on Tuesday “may result in further action by ACT Policing”. An ANU spokesperson said the university had ensured that protests were safe, appropriate and lawful. “ANU has provided options for the protestors to continue their protests in ways that are respectful and safe for the entire university community,” the spokesperson said. “The university will continue to discuss these options with protestors.” ACT police said officers remained in regular contact with ANU security and were monitoring developments with protesters. No arrests had been made in relation to the encampment. ANU initially directed the encampment to move on Monday morning when the director of facilities and services, Jeremy Matthew, said the camp was in a fire evacuation zone, creating an “unacceptable risk” to staff and students. “We’re committed to the safety of this campus,” the encampment spokesperson and ANU student Al, who preferred not to share their surname, said. “We want to engage in good faith, on the fire evacuation or on our demands as a whole.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Protesters called on supporters to rally on campus on Tuesday morning in support of the camp and said they planned to continue their campaign. In response, ANU shut down businesses in the Kambri precinct, and blocked off public access to a number of buildings adjacent to the Kambri Lawns, including the Marie Reay teaching centre and Chifley library. The ANU students’ association president, Phoenix O’Neill, told the rally the protest had been “disruptive, but peaceful”. “The encampment has moved but the goal of making the university divest has absolutely not,” they said. Students and a number of staff then marched down University Avenue past their new camp site before arriving at management offices. Earlier on Monday ANU security ordered the remaining students entering their fourth week occupying the site to immediately disband. Students rejected the demands, instead issuing a call-out for supporters and legal observers to reinforce numbers. In a video posted to social media, an organiser said a vote had been taken and the remaining protesters had decided to stay on at the Kambri site. “The police have come and told us that we need to leave but we as a collective have decided we’re going to say,” they said. “We will not be moved, we will be staying in Kambri.” From 8am to 3pm on Monday, police officers joined about two dozen members of campus security as protesters drummed on upturned buckets, chanting: “We are the students. We won’t be silenced. Cut the ties now, now, now, now.” The ANU spokesperson said: “No one has been told not to protest.” The direction follows meetings with a small group of students who were advised to disband or risk breaching the university’s code of conduct. Students refused, vowing they would not move until ANU disclosed and divested its ties to weapons manufacturers. Both the University of Melbourne and Curtin University have agreed, in part, to protesters’ demands while negotiating an end to encampments. Camps at La Trobe and Deakin University have also been disbandedas university managements warn of disciplinary action. On Monday afternoon, student protesters at Adelaide University and RMIT announced they would voluntarily pack up after four weeks, while adding they would continue to fight for the Palestinian cause. Asked whether ANU would change its position, the spokesperson said all university investments were governed by its socially responsible investment policy. “The university thanks our student body for drawing our attention to areas that we may need to now consider in 2024,” they said. “This includes expanding companies for review, along with emerging areas of research including artificial intelligence. “The university has listened to this important feedback from its students and thanks them for it.”",Australian universities; Australia news; Israel-Gaza war; Canberra,Australia news
2022-05-22T22:10:44Z,HSBC suspends head of responsible investing who called climate warnings ‘shrill’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/hsbc-suspends-head-of-responsible-investing-who-called-climate-warnings-shrill,"HSBC has suspended a senior banker after he referred to climate crisis warnings as “unsubstantiated” and “shrill” during a conference speech that has since been denounced by the lender’s chief executive. Stuart Kirk, who has been HSBC’s head of responsible investing since last July, will remain suspended until the bank completes an internal investigation into the matter. HSBC came under pressure to fire Kirk after he gave a presentation in London entitled “why investors need not worry about climate risk”, in which he made light of major flooding risks, and complained about having to spend time “looking at something that’s going to happen in 20 or 30 years”. HSBC declined to comment on Kirk’s suspension, which was first reported by the Financial Times. Kirk did not respond to requests to comment sent via LinkedIn or Twitter. Kirk’s presentation controversially included slides that said “Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong”, while referring to comments made by officials at the UN and Bank of England, who have tried to raise the alarm over global heating. “Human beings have been fantastic at adapting to change, adapting to climate emergencies, and we will continue to do so,” Kirk told attenders at the Financial Times’ Moral Money conference on Thursday. “Who cares if Miami is six metres underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that’s a really nice place.” His comments have sparked a public relations controversy for the bank, which has struggled to burnish its green credentials, despite pledges to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It prompted bosses, including HSBC’s chief executive Noel Quinn, to denounce Kirk’s comments, insisting that they did not reflect the bank’s views on the climate crisis. “I do not agree – at all – with the remarks made at last week’s FT Moral Money Summit,” Quinn said in a LinkedIn post on Saturday. “They are inconsistent with HSBC’s strategy and do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC or HSBC Asset Management. Our ambition is to be the leading bank supporting the global economy in the transition to net zero.” “We have a lot of work to do, and I am determined that our team won’t be distracted by last week’s comments,” Quinn added. Climate activists welcomed Kirk’s suspension but said HSBC had questions to answer about the extent to which Kirk’s views were known or supported within the bank. “Kirk might be on his way out, but this opens up a new can of worms for HSBC,” Beau O’Sullivan, a senior campaigner for the Bank on our Future campaign, said. “The bank must now explain how such offensive and inaccurate comments were signed off, to what extent other senior execs share Kirk’s views, and what sort of culture HSBC is breeding that allowed the comments to pass unchallenged. “More broadly, this is another massive smirch on HSBC’s reputation on climate which it’s been at pains to burnish recently,” O’Sullivan said. “Investors, customers, and regulators should rightly question and scrutinise the bank’s promises on climate, including its upcoming oil and gas policy, not forgetting that HSBC is facing potential action by the advertising regulator over greenwashing.” Kirk, a former editor of the Financial Times’s Lex column, was appointed head of responsible investing in July 2021, putting him in charge of a team responsible for analysing environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks that could affect the asset management arm’s investments. His team was also charge of helping develop new green products for customers.",Banking; Climate crisis; HSBC; Environment; Business; Miami; Miami; Flooding; World news,Business
2024-01-16T06:00:15Z,Shell faces shareholder rebellion over climate activist resolution,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/16/shell-faces-shareholder-rebellion-over-climate-activist-resolution,"Shell’s board faces a shareholder rebellion as large investors including the UK’s biggest pension scheme prepare to back a climate activist resolution. Twenty-seven investors have agreed to back a resolution filed by the Dutch shareholder activists at Follow This that calls for the oil company to align its medium-term emissions reduction targets with the 2015 Paris agreement. The investor coalition together owns about 5% of Shell’s shares and includes the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), which manages the pensions of almost a quarter of the UK’s workers. The resolution has also won the backing of the French asset management firm Amundi, which holds almost €2tn (£1.7tn) in assets, as well as Candriam, Scottish Widows, and Rathbones Group. Diandra Soobiah, the head of responsible investment at Nest, said: “We urge Shell to set a credible scope 3 absolute emissions target. This would demonstrate leadership, show Shell is serious about transitioning its business, and play a role in generating real world change.” “Scope 3” emissions include all greenhouse gas emissions that companies do not either generate directly or purchase for their own energy needs. This extends to everything from raw materials used to create a product to the transportation that delivers that product to a consumer. Shareholders will be asked to vote on the resolution at the £160bn company’s annual general meeting in May. The resolution has already received the backing of investors who together hold about €4tn in assets under management, and support is expected to grow over the months before Shell’s annual general meeting, according to Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This. Van Baal said: “This escalation of 27 leading investors puts the call for emissions reductions by energy companies front and centre for all institutional investors.” Follow This has gained support for its climate campaign in recent years, although the group has yet to win a majority vote in favour of its resolutions. Its latest shareholder resolution has dropped a reference to 2030 in response to criticism from Shell that its demands are too proscriptive. Shell is expected to face growing opposition from ethical investors and climate activists after abandoning its plans to reduce its oil and gas production before the end of the decade. The company’s AGM in London last year descended into chaos as climate protests delayed the start of the meeting by an hour, after the board rejected shareholder calls for new targets for carbon emissions cuts. A Shell spokesperson said: “The 2024 resolution from Follow This is broadly unchanged from their 2023 submission, which was rejected by shareholders (as its variations have been every year since first being submitted in 2016). “Shell’s board has previously advised shareholders that the Follow This resolution was unrealistic and simplistic, that it would have no impact on mitigating climate change, have negative consequences for our customers, and was against the interests of the company and our shareholders.”",Shell; Climate crisis; Oil; Energy industry; Oil and gas companies; Business; Commodities,Business
2023-11-01T14:00:15Z,Company directors could be held liable and fined over unforeseen nature-related impacts and risks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/02/company-directors-could-be-held-liable-and-fined-over-unforeseen-nature-related-impacts-and-risks,"Company directors who fail to foresee the impacts their companies have on nature, and the commercial risks those effects pose, can be held personally liable and fined, according to lawyers. A new legal opinion advises that company directors need to identify anywhere their business is dependent on or has an impact on nature and consider the potential risks this poses to the company. Failure to do this could make directors liable for breaching their duty of care and diligence under the Corporations Act, according to the advice. Breach of directors’ duties under corporations law is punishable and penalties can include stripping of directorships, fines or legal action by third parties that have suffered financial losses. An example of nature-related risk is the European Union’s decision to require companies not to import beef produced on land that has been deforested. That then poses a risk that companies selling beef linked to deforestation could lose access to a whole market. Or, if Australian consumers were to decide they did not want to buy beef products linked to land-clearing, that could become a risk closer to home. The opinion has been issued by barrister Sebastian Hartford-Davis and lawyer Zoe Bush and was commissioned by Pollination in collaboration with the Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative. Pollination is a climate change and nature investment and advisory firm, whose chief executive, Martijn Wilder, is also the chair of the federal government’s National Reconstruction Fund. In 2016, Hartford-Davis and Noel Hutley wrote a seminal opinion – known as the Hutley opinion – that company directors had a duty under the Corporations Act to consider climate-related risk or face legal consequences. The new opinion finds a similar duty for nature-related risks. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The key message for directors of Australian companies is it’s important they take steps to satisfy themselves now that they’ve thought about the relevance of nature-related risk and opportunities to their companies,” Pollination director Laura Waterford said. “It’s not something that can be deferred.” It comes after the taskforce on nature-related financial disclosures recently released a global framework aimed at ensuring that nature is considered alongside other types of risks. It also follows last year’s Cop15 biodiversity pact, in which 196 countries reached agreement on 23 targets aimed at protecting and restoring biodiversity. On the sidelines of the global summit last year Australia and the United States announced they would work together to better measure the economic value of nature and reflect it in national accounts. The legal opinion by Hartford-Davis and Bush advises that nature-related risks to a company should be foreseeable now given the amount of information already available about the extent to which economies depend on nature and the rate at which biodiversity was being degraded in Australia and internationally. The opinion advises that directors who perceive that nature-related dependencies and impacts pose material risks of harm to a company must decide what action, if any, is to be taken. If the risks are considered to be material they should also be disclosed in accordance with continuous disclosure and periodic reporting requirements. The opinion applies to both direct impacts a company’s activities might have on nature as well as indirect impacts through supply chains. It advises directors could be liable for failure to consider physical risks where their companies are directly or indirectly dependent on nature for their prosperity. It also finds they could be held liable for failure to consider transition risks such as changes to regulation, consumer preferences, technology or laws associated with shifts towards more “nature positive” economies. Wilder said the original Hutley opinion had been “hugely influential” in convincing corporate leaders to take climate change seriously. “We fully anticipate this new opinion will have a similar impact when it comes to risks associated with nature,” he said. “We are seeing the rapid emergence of nature positive alongside net zero as a critical part of the future corporate environment.” Estelle Parker, the executive manager of the Responsible Investment Association Australasia, said investor interest in nature had “skyrocketed” in recent years. She said company directors needed to know and properly assess the type and magnitude of nature risks facing their companies. “The risk that nature and biodiversity loss poses to companies is becoming abundantly clear,” she said. “It is an absolute no-brainer that companies should consider and disclose these risks, and that failure to do so actually contravenes the duties of directors.”",Environment; Business; Australia news; Law (Australia); Corporate social responsibility; Business,Environment
2023-11-25T10:00:46Z,King’s estate to transfer £100m into ethical funds after bona vacantia revelations,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/25/kings-estate-transfer-cash-ethical-funds-bona-vacantia-revelations,"King Charles’s estate has announced it is transferring more than £100m, including funds collected from dead people under the archaic system of bona vacantia, into ethical investment funds after an investigation by the Guardian. The surprise announcement came amid growing pressure on the king over the Duchy of Lancaster’s use of funds collected from people who die in the north-west of England with no will or next of kin. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed some of the funds were secretly being used to renovate properties that are owned by the king and rented out for profit by his estate. The duchy conceded that some bona vacantia revenues are financing the restoration of what it calls “public and historic properties”. However, the king’s estate has also been battling separate questions over its management of another portion of bona vacantia funds that are given to its charities. Two of those charities have used bona vacantia to build major endowment funds worth more than £40m. Their accounts state that there are “no specific constraints on the investment portfolio in terms of ethical, social or environmental (ESG) matters”, although investment managers are advised to take such matters “into consideration”. Contacted by the Guardian this week, the Duchy of Lancaster initially declined to say whether its charities had invested in any oil or gas, tobacco, weapons or mining companies. However late on Friday, a spokesperson for the estate announced a change in policy. “In line with the king’s longstanding support of ethical investing, the Duchy of Lancaster has begun the process of transferring its investment portfolio into ESG funds. This process is expected to be completed by the end of the financial year,” the spokesperson said. There been no suggestion from the king’s estate that it plans to cease collecting bona vacantia or change how it is spent. However, the shift in investment policy will bring the Duchy of Lancaster’s approach into line with that of the Duchy of Cornwall, another royal estate that receives bona vacantia funds, which has an ethical investment policy. The king previously owned and closely managed the Duchy of Cornwall, which raises profits for the heir to the throne. When Charles became king, it was inherited by his son Prince William. At the same time Charles inherited from his mother the Duchy of Lancaster, which exists to raise “private” income for the monarch. Both the duchy itself, and its charities, have investment portfolios. The duchy’s own portfolio, according to its accounts, include equities, bonds and other financial investments worth £74m. That too is now being transferred to ethical funds. The charities the duchy gives bona vacantia revenues to, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund and Duchy of Lancaster Jubilee Trust, have also built large endowment funds, worth £18m and £26m respectively. Both charities’ accounts state they aim for an annual return of £500,000 from their investments, and benchmark the success of the bulk of their stock investments against the FTSE All-Share Index, an index that includes companies such as Shell, BP and British American Tobacco. Ben Faulkner, of the ethical investment company EQ Investors, said benchmarking against an index could mean replicating investments in the companies involved: “Using an index as a base for a replication strategy is very common, known widely as index tracking. When doing so you will typically have more invested in the biggest companies within the index you are tracking … Shell is the largest listed company within the FTSE All-Share Index.” In the last five years, the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund has made nearly £2m in income from its investment portfolio, while the Jubilee Trust has made £2.5m. The Duchy of Cornwall, which collects bona vacantia from Cornish residents, has a clear ethical policy in relation to investments by the Duke of Cornwall Benevolent Fund, which has built a £5m endowment. Its accounts state: “The fund is entirely invested in the Newton SRI Fund for Charities, a global and diversified portfolio of equities and fixed interest securities with particular emphasis on environmental, social and governance considerations, screened against negative socially responsible investment criteria.” The Duchy of Lancaster’s announcement of a similar policy comes amid growing questions for the royal estate which has long claimed that bona vacantia proceeds go to charity after costs are deducted. In a shift in language, it now concedes funds are additionally spent on “restoration and repair” of qualifying buildings on the estate. Leaked documents reveal properties deemed eligible for the funds include a suite of properties rented out to raise profit for the king, including holiday lets, farmhouses, a barn on a shooting range and a petrol station. The duchy collects bona vacantia assets from residents of the ancient county palatinate of Lancashire – a territory that includes Lancashire and parts of Merseyside, Cheshire and Cumbria. Cat Smith, MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: “Like so many other local people I was surprised to learn the anomaly that means those dying without a will or heir in the county palatine see their assets passed to the king rather than the state. It’s an unjust and archaic hangover from the medieval times and I’ll be seeking advice on how to bring my constituents’ rights out of the feudal era.” Her comments come after criticisms from two mayors from the north-west of England. “This appears to be a bizarre remnant of feudal Britain,” said the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. “At the very least, people in the north-west are owed transparency and accountability. They should also have a say on how these proceeds are used. I would call on the government and the Duchy of Lancaster to initiate a public consultation on this issue to work towards a set of arrangements that could command greater public consent.” Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, also expressed concern. “Worthy causes have been bypassed and instead it appears that funding has been spent renovating royal properties. I hope the situation will be clarified urgently and, if money has been misused, it is put back where it should be: with those charities it was promised to.”",King Charles III; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Energy; Environment; Monarchy; UK news; North of England; Lancashire,UK news
2023-05-24T18:03:57Z,US Congress members demand that PayPal end ban on Palestinian business,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/24/paypal-palestine-ban-us-congress-,"Eleven members of the US Congress have demanded PayPal end a ban on doing business with Palestinians in the occupied territories while permitting Israeli settlers to use the digital payment platform. The letter, authored by Representative Mark Pocan, says PayPal is discriminating against Palestinians by denying “equal access to the digital economy”. “We have significant concerns that, because PayPal does provide services to Israeli citizens in illegal settlements across the West Bank, but does not provide services to Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza, PayPal’s current operating status may be infringing upon the rights of Palestinians,” the letter said. “As one of the world’s most recognized payment platforms, PayPal has a responsibility to ensure its services and operations are provided in a non-discriminatory manner.” The letter was sent to PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, ahead of the company’s annual stockholder meeting on Wednesday. It was also signed by Representatives Earl Blumenauer, Betty McCollum, Rashida Tlaib and Greg Casar, among others. PayPal has not explained publicly why it has singled out residents of the Palestinian territories, only saying it regards the area as “high risk”, when other financial service providers, including Visa, Mastercard and Apple Pay, operate in the West Bank and Gaza without problems. The payment platform operates in other areas of conflict, including Yemen and Somalia. Palestinian business owners have likened the PayPal ban to Israeli checkpoints that control movement, saying it stifles economic development because so many other platforms use the payment service, such as eBay. The socially responsible investment firm Harrington Investments, founded by John Harrington, who was at the forefront of pushing US corporate divestment from apartheid South Africa, has put forward a proposal at PayPal’s shareholder meeting that would see the payment platform’s board “establish a policy that ensures that people in conflict zones, such as in Palestine, do not suffer discriminatory exclusion from the company’s financial services”. The proposal says that if PayPal does not wish to implement the policy then it should “provide an evaluation of the economic impact the policy of exclusion has on the affected populations as well as the company’s finances, operations and reputation”. PayPal has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. A Palestinian American businessman, Sam Bahour, plans to tell the shareholder meeting that his companies have worked with the US and UK governments and the EU but cannot use PayPal. Bahour, who is a founder of the Palestine Telecommunications Company, noted that firms such as Cisco, HP and Oracle operate in the Palestinian territories. “Likewise, it’s a fact that Palestine has a thriving banking sector and all Palestinian banks have corresponding US banks that make money transfers daily. The US Treasury Department is also active in Palestine and has praised the level of Palestinian banking compliance,” he said, according to a transcript of the planned remarks. In 2021, PayPal partnered with the strongly pro-Israel group the Anti-Defamation League to investigate “hate group funding”. Palestinian groups accuse the Anti-Defamation League of conflating the campaign for Palestinian rights with extremism and antisemitism. When the partnership was announced, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee asked PayPal: “Will you be going after organizations that fund settler terror against Palestinians?”, a reference to registered charities in the US that send tens of millions of dollars a year that fund settlers who expel Palestinians from their land and other activities widely regarded as war crimes under the Geneva conventions. “Will you block orgs supporting the theft of Palestinian land? … Or are extremists just people your new business partner doesn’t like?” PayPal has been asked for comment.",PayPal; Palestinian territories; Israel; Race; Business; Middle East and north Africa; World news; Technology,Technology
2023-05-09T10:55:46Z,"Shell shareholders should oust chair, says influential adviser",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/09/shell-shareholders-chair-pirc-andrew-mackenzie-agm,"An influential investment adviser has added its weight to a move to oust the Shell chair, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, at next week’s annual shareholder meeting as a row over the energy company’s climate goals intensifies. Pirc, which advises shareholders on how to vote at annual meetings, has recommended that investors vote against Mackenzie’s re-election and oppose its annual report to “hold board members to account”. The Church of England has also said it plans to vote to oust Mackenzie, as well as recently appointed chief executive Wael Sawan, at the event at the ExCeL centre in London on 23 May. Shell has faced repeated criticism from green campaigners who claim its climate goals are not ambitious enough and are not aligned with the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C over industrial levels. In a report to investors, Pirc said that “while Shell has short and medium-term targets, there is specific concern that these targets are not aligned to a 1.5 degree pathway which is not heavily reliant on carbon offsetting”. Pirc also advised shareholders to vote against Shell’s “energy transition” resolution, citing concerns that it has not set “absolute emission reduction targets” for “scope 3” emissions, which occur indirectly in companies’ supply chains. Instead, Pirc wants investors to back a resolution filed by the green shareholder group Follow This, which has been pressing companies to align their scope 3 reduction targets with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The meeting will follow a series of fiery shareholder meetings, with climate protests interrupting proceedings at BP, Barclays and Drax in recent weeks. Last year a large number of protesters sang and chanted outside and inside Shell’s AGM, forcing Mackenzie to delay proceedings while police were called. Oil and gas companies have also been in the crosshairs of MPs, the public and campaigners after racking up record profits aided by the increase in commodity prices linked to the war in Ukraine. Governments have introduced windfall taxes in an attempt to use their excess profits to fund measures to cushion the cost of living crisis, but some have argued the levies do not go far enough. Shell was last week accused of a “profiteering bonanza” after it reported record first-quarter profits of more than $9.6bn. Paul Hunter, the head of policy at Pirc, said: “Time is running out if we are to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees and reduce the climate risks facing investors. While targets are now being set, too often they are not aligned to a 1.5 degree pathway not heavily reliant on unproven offsetting technologies … “Pirc is recommending investors hold board members to account where targets fall short of the climate expectations of responsible investors.” Separately on Tuesday, Adam Matthews, the chief responsible investment officer for the Church of England Pension Board, wrote in the Telegraph that the fund would be voting against Mackenzie and Sawan “with genuine regret”. He said: “We have lost confidence in the direction of the company.” The Church’s £3bn retirement fund, a small shareholder in Shell, has accused the company of prioritising short-term profits over investing in renewables and downplaying the importance of green energy. Shell said in response that its strategy is to “become a net zero energy company by 2050 or sooner”. “Shell and the CofE pensions board have worked together as partners on the energy transition for almost a decade, with an emphasis on changing the use of energy as much as its supply. We continue to believe that is the right approach and strongly disagree with the pension board’s changed position,” the company said.",Shell; Energy industry; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Business; UK news; Annual results; Commodities; Corporate governance; Investing; Financial sector,Business
2023-04-24T05:00:04Z,BP facing green rebellion at annual shareholder meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/24/bp-facing-green-rebellion-annual-shareholder-meeting,"BP faces a green rebellion at its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday as some of Britain’s biggest pension funds prepare to demand the company toughen its plans to reduce its emissions by 2030. The National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), which represents about 11m individual workplace pensions, plans to back a resolution put forward by climate campaigners at Follow This, which calls for BP to align its emissions reduction plans with the Paris agreement. The campaign group has also won support from the Universities Superannuation Scheme and the council pensions fund Border to Coast, which have both also agreed to vote for the Follow This resolution. Oil companies have faced rising dissent from activist shareholders including Follow This in recent years. In 2021, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, one of the oldest fund managers in the City of London, backed a similar resolution put forward by Follow This at Shell’s AGM. The resolution was backed by 30% of Shell’s shareholders. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said BP’s existing plans to reduce emissions do not go far enough because they rely on reducing the carbon intensity of the energy BP sells while absolute emissions are expected to keep rising until the end of the decade. The Paris agreement calls for all countries to limit their emissions in order to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels by 2050. The 2020s are considered crucial years to cut carbon in order to remain on track. Van Baal has written to BP’s shareholders urging them to vote in favour of their resolution, saying it was “the only way to compel BP to reduce emissions this decade”. BP’s board has urged shareholders to vote against the resolution, saying it is “unclear”, “simplistic” and “disruptive”. The company added that it would threaten BP’s “long-term value creation”. In a separate climate revolt the three pension funds are expected to vote against the re-election of BP’s chairman, Helge Lund, in protest at BP’s decision to water down its green pledges earlier this year without shareholder consent. The local government pensions schemes LGPS Central and Brunel Pension Partnership are planning to join the funds in voting against Lund’s re-election. BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, originally set out a “net zero carbon” plan that included a goal to cut the company’s oil and gas production by 40% compared with 2019 by the end of the decade. However, he reset the target to 25% by 2030 in February after reporting the highest profits of BP’s 114-year history thanks to soaring oil and gas prices. Diandra Soobiah, Nest’s head of responsible investment, said the fund wants BP to invest more in low-carbon energy and renewables instead of new oil and gas sites. “If BP continues on this path, we have serious concerns about them reaching their net zero goal and the long-term success of the company,” Soobiah said. “While it’s disappointing to see BP rowing back on their climate pledges, what’s particularly worrying is they haven’t gone back to shareholders and given us a chance to vote on such a significant decision. Actions like this undermine the confidence shareholders have in the board and their corporate governance.” Campaigners at Reclaim Finance, which lobbies for the financial sector to align with global climate goals, has also called on investors to vote against the pay awards given to Looney and the chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss, because the remuneration policy does not go far enough to take BP’s climate responsibilities into account. Separately, one of the largest proxy shareholder advisers, Glass Lewis, has recommended that shareholders vote against Looney’s £10m pay packet after the death of four workers last year. It was trimmed by only £78,329 to reflect the safety breaches.",BP; Environment; Oil; Energy industry; Business; Oil and gas companies; Commodities,Business
2023-02-01T09:15:30Z,"Business sector has driven shift to ‘values-based capitalism’, Jim Chalmers says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/01/business-sector-has-driven-shift-to-values-based-capitalism-jim-chalmers-says,"Jim Chalmers says Australia’s business and investment community has driven a shift to values-based capitalism, hitting back at a volley of criticism in some news outlets after the publication of the treasurer’s 6,000-word essay championing co-investment and economic inclusion. Chalmers made the observation on Wednesday while leading a round of consultation with the investment community about a new framework for disclosing climate-related risk. The treasurer participated in a round table convened by the Australian arm of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment initiative. In his new essay published by the Monthly on Monday, the treasurer signalled he wanted to expand the opportunity for “impact investing” while pressing ahead with regulatory reforms, including a “new taxonomy” to help investors “align their choices” with the government’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The treasurer said a renovation of institutions and regulatory frameworks was essential to allow capital to be deployed for private profit and “public value in the for-purpose economy”. He advocated a form of “values-based capitalism” predicated on partnership between the public and private sectors rather than antagonism. Chalmers said in the essay the private sector was “key and central to sustainable growth, and there’s a genuine appetite among so many forward-looking businesspeople and investors for something more aligned with their values and our national goals”. While Chalmers’ views are not hostile to the fundamentals of capitalism and align with mainstream analysis by regulators and sections of the business community, the essay has triggered a barrage of hostile commentary in Australia’s two national newspapers, the Australian and the Australian Financial Review. Chalmers addressed the controversy during Wednesday’s meeting with investors. He noted: “The investors represented here, and the broader investment and business community, don’t just support values-based capitalism – you’ve driven it. “This is not some leftwing fringe idea. It’s about better designed and better informed markets and more cooperation between investors and governments to modernise our economy and deepen and broaden our industrial base, powered by cleaner and cheaper energy. “Your enthusiasm and determination to drive Australia towards an appropriately ambitious sustainable finance agenda is one important example of this but not the only one.” Chalmers said the reforms the government was pursuing in climate-related risk disclosure and financial market transparency aligned with what investors and lenders had been championing for “years”. He said the reforms were intended to provide guardrails and policy stability to ensure markets were well informed and capital could be unlocked for productive investments. Chalmers noted while a “minority” of market participants were intent on clinging to “some sort of outdated ideology”, the government would pursue “a forward-looking, internationally aligned, sustainable finance agenda born out of economic opportunity and contemporary necessity”. Appearing separately at the National Press Club, Labor frontbencher Tony Burke was asked by a reporter whether he could define values-based capitalism “in your own words”. Burke said the arguments Chalmers had made in the new essay were consistent with the values “in the mission statements of major companies”, including members of the Business Council of Australia. Burke said there had been a “rush” in commentary to castigate the treasurer’s analysis, but he advised some of the critics to “look at what a whole lot of major companies put in black and white as the principles that they espouse as mattering”. “It’s a lot more than bottom line and for government to be backing those concepts is right and proper and I’m really glad that Jim’s written the essay.”",Australian economy; Australian politics; Australia news; Jim Chalmers; Business,Business
2022-10-04T06:00:27Z,Green your pension: how you can help the environment,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/04/green-pension-help-environment-climate-crisis,"UK pension funds are worth approximately £3tn with this huge wealth invested in assets all over the world. If you are eager to reduce your carbon footprint, making your pension “green” is 21 times more effective than giving up flying, becoming a vegetarian and changing an energy provider combined, according to the campaign group Make My Money Matter. So how can you make your pension better for the planet? What is ‘more green’ to you? Romi Savova, the chief executive of the pensions consolidator firm PensionBee, says the question you need to ask yourself is: “What does being more green mean to you?” She says: “Because the way it is expressed in the pensions industry can be very, very different, depending on the pension plan and provider.” When looking at whether your pension aligns with your values, one thing to consider is what your approach will be. “Are you looking for investments that exclude companies which contribute to environmental challenges, or do you want to be invested in a way that engages with these companies to push them to do better?” says Helen Morrissey, the senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Engagement,” Savova says, “means you continue to invest in companies that may be major fossil fuel producers, for example. “But your asset manager, or pension provider, takes an active role in engaging with those companies, to encourage them to reform, over time, and put themselves on a more sustainable trajectory for the future.” Stakeholder engagement, with the threat of divestment, is powerful, says David Macdonald, the founder of the independent financial advisers Path Financial. “If you’re an active shareholder, you’re challenging them constantly to improve standards, to make faster changes, to have more credible pledges – with the threat of divestment if they don’t,” he says. “So moving the money into a fund which takes its stakeholder responsibility seriously, and drives for the change that it’s talking about, is far more impactful than just investing in those companies passively in, say, a tracker, where nobody gives a damn about what the companies are actually doing. “If people want their invested money to have a voice, then it’s got to be somewhere where the voice can be heard. And that comes through a more active approach to being a stakeholder,” Macdonald adds. Beyond these choices, you move into actually trying to direct your money to do something genuinely positive, Savova says. “You would be making sure that money goes into renewable energy, healthcare, social bonds, as opposed to, say, government bonds.” Check a workplace pension “Your provider should be able to help you find out where it invests, and, if you already have an online account, you should be able to get details of what your pension is invested in,” Morrissey says. However, she adds: “It can be difficult to drill down and get all the data you need – you may only get the top 10 holdings, for instance, or you may find your funds are invested in other funds so you can’t immediately get the detail needed.” If you are not happy with what you find, Morrissey suggests asking your provider if they have any other funds you can switch to, that are more suitable. “Don’t just accept the default that you’re given; poke around a little bit and see what the options are,” Macdonald says. “The provider might have an ethical fund, or an environmental, social and governance (ESG) choice, which is better than the default.” It is worth noting, too, that ESG is a broad term, open to interpretation and, by unfortunate extension, greenwashing. “As responsible investing has become more high profile, it has led some managers to overstate the progress they are making in incorporating ESG factors into their strategies,” Morrissey says. “Before deciding to invest, it’s worth checking to see if they have signed up to any industry initiatives such as the UN-backed ‘principles for responsible investment’. “Managers have to commit to invest responsibly, as well as incorporate ESG issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes,” she says. “Many will also issue responsible investment reports, which you can find on their websites.” Put pressure on providers Crucially, if you are in a workplace pension, the provider will have been chosen by your employer. Simply stopping paying into that pension, and opening a new one, would mean you would lose your employer contribution. You could, instead, put pressure on pension providers from “within” to encourage them to change their investing ways. If your workplace provider doesn’t offer a fund that matches your environmental values – or even anything approaching them – Make My Money Matter has a tool on its website that allows you to select your provider and send a pre-written letter asking it to offer green pension funds. “Within the sector, we have had feedback from pension funds saying that people emailing them has actually made a difference,” says Kenneth Green, the campaigns manager at Make My Money Matter. “We have managed to help get £1.3tn in UK pension funds committed to net zero.” Transfer old pensions “A lot of people will have old pensions they’ve left behind when they’ve moved on from various jobs,” Savova says. “In the vast majority, those pensions will be invested in so-called default funds, which are chosen by the employer. And the vast majority of those will have exposure to fossil fuels, including producers like Shell and BP. “It can be a bit of a surprise to savers, who have often gone the extra mile in making their daily habits greener, to find their pension is invested directly in fossil fuels.” If you are no longer happy with the way those funds are invested, you can make changes. “Once you’ve figured out where your current pensions are invested, you can decide what to do with them,” Savova says. “Often that will mean consolidating them into a new online plan.” It is possible to do this yourself but there are a number of consolidation firms that transfer pensions into one place; some, such as PensionBee, have fossil fuel-free plans. Compare any changes carefully, and be sure there will not be negative consequences, Morrissey says: “Before deciding to transfer, it is worth checking that you won’t miss out on any potential benefits, such as guaranteed annuity rates, or incur any exit penalties.” Before making any decisions about pensions, it is wise to take professional advice. You can find a list of independent financial advisers specialising in ethical investment on the Ethical Investment Association website. Compare and contrast “Your pension is built for your retirement. It’s built for your future. You don’t want to put it in something that could be inherently risky,” Savova says. There is, of course, always a risk in investing. But how do green funds compare with those that don’t use sustainability criteria? According to Morningstar, across six different categories of fund and over a five-year period, sustainable funds consistently outperformed their standard counterparts by between 0.54 and 1.91%.",Money; Consumer affairs; Pensions; Ethical money; Environment; Green economy; Green politics; Investments; Investment funds; Ethical and green living; UK news,Money
2022-11-07T14:40:05Z,Pay of FTSE 100 chief executives rose an average of 23% in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/07/ftse-100-executive-pay-rose-23-per-cent-4m-2022,"Bosses of the UK’s 100 biggest publicly listed companies have seen their pay jump by an average of 23% to almost £4m because of record bonus payments. The average pay of chief executives of FTSE 100 companies increased from £3.2m last year to £3.9m this year, according to research by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The soaring pay at the top comes as companies push back against workers’ demands for pay rises to help them cope with high inflation and the cost of living crisis. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said pay increases “for people who are already multimillionaires are far from ideal at a time when their lower-paid colleagues are denied a pay rise that keeps up with inflation”. On average, CEOs received 86% of the maximum possible bonus available to them, up from 58% last year, and above “historical pre-Covid levels”. Just 5% of CEOs received no bonus in the 2021-22 financial year, down from 22% a year earlier. PwC said the record bonuses payouts were “part driven by a post-Covid boom in some sectors, and in some cases, due to performance targets which were conservatively set in 2021 to reflect greater market uncertainty”. Andrew Page, PwC’s executive compensation leader, said the huge payouts are likely to be met with “greater investor scrutiny” from shareholders in the forthcoming AGM season, “particularly in the context of rising inflation and pay increases across the workforce”. “We also expect shareholders to focus on windfall gains. As most long-term incentives were granted at the onset of the pandemic, many companies will be committed to reviewing windfall gains rather than making an adjustment,” he said. Average CEO pay is now back above pre-pandemic levels, after some companies cut executive compensation during the height of the crisis. In 2018-19, average pay was £3.6m. The proportion of CEOs with salary freezes dropped from 43% last year to 15% this year. Neville White, the head of responsible investment policy at the sustainable investment manager EdenTree, said the return of big bonuses was “unjustifiable” in the face of the economic downturn and cost of living crisis. “For the first year since we began consistent voting on executive pay, EdenTree has been unable to support any FTSE 100 remuneration policies or reports, opposing all those that have come before us,” he said. “At a time of increasing economic hardship, this somewhat tin-eared response by executives to their own rewards sets a particularly poor example.” In August, research carried out for the Guardian found that the average UK CEO collects 109 times the amount paid to the average British worker, up from 79 times in 2020. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, has said the growing disparity between pay at the top and that paid to workers is fuelling the cost of living crisis. “Workers deserve a fair share of the wealth they create. But right now, CEO pay is soaring while working people experience the biggest real wage falls in 20 years,” she said. “These unbalanced pay policies have seen the gap widen between workers and bosses this year, adding to the cost of living crisis. O’Grady called on the government to introduce tough rules to “rein in executive pay”. “This should include worker representatives on the committees that set top pay, and elected seats for workers on company boards,” she said. “This approach is already commonplace in many countries and works very well. The government should give UK workers this opportunity, too.”",Executive pay and bonuses; UK cost of living crisis; FTSE; Inequality; Business; UK news; Corporate governance,Business
2023-02-09T06:01:15Z,Shell directors personally sued over ‘flawed’ climate strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/09/shell-directors-personally-sued-over-flawed-climate-strategy,"The directors of oil major Shell are being personally sued over their climate strategy, which the claimants say is inadequate to meet climate targets and puts the company at risk as the world switches to clean energy. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have filed the lawsuit against the 11 directors at the high court in England. It is the first case in the world seeking to hold corporate directors liable for failing to properly prepare their company for the net zero transition, ClientEarth said. ClientEarth, which has a token shareholding in Shell, is suing under the UK Companies Act, and is supported by a group of large pension funds and other institutional investors. It argues a global transition to low-carbon energy is inevitable as world governments act to end the climate crisis and that Shell’s failure to move fast enough threatens the company’s success and would waste its investors’ money on unneeded fossil fuel projects. Shell recently announced a record annual profit of $40bn (£33bn), driven by the high energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. But, as climate litigation increases across the world, the company has suffered a flurry of recent legal and regulatory challenges. These include a Dutch court order to cut emissions from its oil and gas by 45% by 2030 and a claim that Shell is investing less in green energy than it says. “Shell may be making record profits now, but the writing is on the wall for fossil fuels long term,” said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson. “The shift to a low-carbon economy is not just inevitable, it’s already happening. Yet the board is persisting with a transition strategy that is fundamentally flawed, despite the board’s legal duty to manage those risks. “Long term, it is in the best interests of the company, its employees and its shareholders – as well as the planet – for Shell to reduce its emissions harder and faster than the board is currently planning,. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that no new oil and gas projects were compatible with net zero emissions by 2050. “Doubling down [by Shell] on new oil and gas projects isn’t a credible plan – it’s a recipe for stranded assets,” Benson said. Nest, the UK’s largest workplace pension scheme with 10 million members, has backed the lawsuit. “Investors want to see action in line with the risk climate change presents and will challenge those who aren’t doing enough to transition their business,” said Mark Fawcett, Nest’s chief investment officer. “We hope the whole energy industry sits up and takes notice.” London CIV manages the assets of the London local government pension scheme and its head of responsible investment, Jacqueline Amy Jackson, said: “Over the next few decades 1 billion lives and trillions of pounds will be at risk due to a single issue: climate change. We do not believe the board has adopted a reasonable or effective strategy to manage the climate risks affecting Shell. In our view, the board of a high-emitting company has a fiduciary duty to manage climate risk.” The group of investors also includes Swedish national pension fund AP3, French asset manager Sanso IS and Danske Bank Asset Management. ClientEarth is asking the high court to order Shell’s board to adopt a strategy to manage climate risk in line with its duties under the Companies Act, and in compliance with the Dutch court’s order for big cuts in emissions. The high court will now decide whether ClientEarth’s claim will proceed. A Shell spokesperson said: “We do not accept ClientEarth’s allegations. Our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the company. We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious [1.5C] goal of the Paris agreement. Our shareholders strongly support the progress we are making on our energy transition strategy, with 80% voting in favour of this strategy at our last AGM.” In May 2021, the Dutch court ordered Shell to cut carbon emissions from its oil and gas products by 45% by 2030. The case was brought by Friends of the Earth and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs, who successfully argued the company had been aware of the dangerous consequences of CO2 emissions for decades, and that its climate targets did not go far enough. Shell is appealing the verdict. Earlier in February, a non-profit group lodged a complaint against Shell with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that the company had overstated how much it is spending on renewable energy. Shell, which is headquartered in London, but is listed on the New York stock exchange, denied misleading investors. The company was also sued this month in London’s high court by 14,000 people from two Nigerian communities, who claim Shell is responsible for devastating pollution of their water sources. Shell said it bears no responsibility for the siphoning off of oil from its pipelines by organised gangs, which it says causes many of the spills, and that is not liable for the actions of its Nigerian subsidiary company. Shell has taken legal action itself this month in an attempt to end the occupation of its oil and gas platform by Greenpeace International protesters. The platform is now in the English Channel, being transported to the North Sea. The protesters are demanding the company stops expanding oil and gas production around the world and pays for the climate destruction they say the company is causing.",Oil; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Climate crisis; Shell; Business; Energy industry,Environment
2022-07-28T04:52:52Z,"Australian super funds must pressure companies to cut emissions, former Bank of England chief says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/australian-super-funds-must-pressure-companies-to-cut-emissions-former-bank-of-england-chief-says,"Australian superannuation funds need to do more to push the companies in which they invest to slash their carbon emissions, the former governor of the Bank of England says. But Mark Carney, who is also a former governor of the Bank of Canada and now an executive at one of the world’s biggest investment groups, Brookfield Asset Management, says funds and companies can only make progress with a clear government commitment to net zero and a clear pathway to get there. The Albanese government last month strengthened Australia’s international commitment under the Paris agreement, which aims to limit global heating at 1.5C, pledging to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 – a target criticised by the Greens as inadequate. Carney says government targets are a “prerequisite to get the focus” of companies and provide a “framework or an anchor to investor expectations, expectations of businesses investing”. He says the community also needs to understand that “ultimately coal is going to be phased out”. “The sooner that’s recognised by governments, by companies, by generators, by investors, the earlier the plans can be made to retrain, redeploy, remunerate workers, helping communities that are most affected move forward with the jobs and opportunities of the future,” he said. He added that divesting from carbon polluting assets was not enough and investors had to ensure they were managed consistent with moving to net zero. Carney was speaking on a panel at the annual conference of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents profit-to-member funds, alongside former UN climate tsar Fiona Reynolds, and former Australian Prudential Regulation Authority member Geoff Summerhayes. Reynolds, who previously ran UN-supported investor group the Principles for Responsible Investment and is now chief executive of financial publisher Conexus, said the Paris agreement contained a built-in ratchet mechanism, meaning that the 43% reduction committed to by the Albanese government would increase over time. But she warned time was running short. “Net zero by 2050 is still alive, but it has a very, very, very weak pulse,” she said. “Policy is going to have to accelerate really quickly in Australia.” Summerhayes, who is now at climate consultancy Pollination, agreed. “We are rapidly running out of time,” he said. He said investors will be expected to be held to account for their scope 3 emissions, which take in those of a company’s customers, and to pour money into transforming the economy. “We’ve taken 100 years to build a fossil fuel economy. We need to dismantle that and replace it in 10 years,” he said. He said natural perils such as floods and fires were no longer one-off events and would become even more common as the globe heats “so I would make a case for adaptation”. And he urged investors to “be brave”. “What looks like a leadership position today looks pedestrian in eight years time,” he said.",Business; Superannuation; Australia news; Australian economy; Climate crisis; Environment,Australia news
2022-07-31T17:30:01Z,Greens push for legal ‘climate trigger’ on new projects as industry calls for policy certainty,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/greens-push-for-legal-climate-trigger-on-new-projects-as-industry-calls-for-policy-certainty,"All future coal and gas projects would be assessed on whether they would make climate change worse under legislation the Greens will introduce into the Senate, as support for the so-called “climate trigger” grows among those crucial to passing Labor’s climate bill. The push comes as industry and conservation groups on Monday called on the parliament to pass the Albanese government’s bill, which legislates its 43% emissions reduction target, hailing it as an important step towards “greater climate policy certainty”. The government cannot pass the bill without the support from the Greens and independent senator David Pocock, who also called for a climate trigger last week. The “sticking point” in the discussions between Labor and the Greens centre around future coal and gas projects: the Greens want an agreement that no new projects will be approved, but Labor has said that is not feasible. The Greens’ environment and water spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said a climate trigger would force the government to look at the actual impacts new projects would have on the climate. “Putting a ‘climate trigger’ in law will force corporations to be honest about how much pollution their new projects and mines will create and force the minister to consider the climate impacts before giving any environmental approval,” she said. “Current environment laws are not fit for purpose. It makes no sense that an application for a new mine or development is not assessed for the impact the project’s emissions will have on the climate. “Any suggestion a project can ‘stack up environmentally’, justifying the environment minister giving it the green light, is a complete furphy.” The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has previously not ruled out a climate trigger in new laws on fossil fuel project assessments, but she has also pointed to a major review of laws last year that said climate impacts could be addressed in other ways. Labor’s bill will not pass the Senate without the Greens’ support. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has said the government does not need to legislate its 43% emissions reduction target to take action, but that putting it into law will give security and certainty to business and investor groups, as well as signal that Australia is serious about taking action on climate. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Signatories to a joint statement released on Monday, which include the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Institute of Company Directors, said the lack of settled national policy had hurt Australia. “There is bipartisan and broad community and business support for achieving net zero emissions by 2050,” the group of eight signatories said. “The government legislating a 2030 target of at least a 43% emissions reduction under the Paris agreement establishes some much-needed policy certainty. “Importantly the legislation includes a process for advice and adoption of deeper targets over time. It also provides clarity to investors and the business community more broadly, given all nations have committed under the Paris agreement to only strengthen their stated contributions.” The previous Morrison government refused to entertain legislating its own lower emission reduction targets, insisting regulation changes were all that were needed. But the group of signatories, which also includes the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Governance Institute of Australia, the Responsible Investment Association Australasia and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, said legislating the target “was a timely signal” that would “further encourage” organisations to “progress their own decarbonisation plans”. The government plans on passing its climate bill through the House this week. The Senate has already started an inquiry into the legislation.",Australian politics; Australia news; Climate crisis; Labor party; Environment; Australian Greens,Australia news
2022-10-23T06:30:29Z,The future offers only variants on austerity? Bunk. There are ways to invest and grow | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/the-future-offers-only-variants-on-austerity-bunk-there-are-ways-to-invest-and-grow,"Common sense now has it that “the markets” are Britain’s new rulers. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is co-governing with them, so the story runs, in contemplating “eye-wateringly” difficult decisions to cut public spending, as would a putative Labour successor, Rachel Reeves. Thus, just as libertarian dreams of stupendous unfunded tax cuts to drive growth are now over, so are social democratic hopes of building a just society. Allegedly, the implosion of Trussonomics has made the lights go out across the political spectrum; the future offers only variants of austerity. I disagree. Britain is not yet an emergent economy. It still has vast resources if it chooses to access them. It possesses a fabric of institutions ranging from the UK Debt Management Office to the Bank of England that, given the right constitutional framework and proper economic and political leadership, are more than capable of being the markets’ master rather than their servant. Economic and political choices remain. Nor are “the markets” hegemonic forces that always and everywhere blindly impose austerity and economic suffering. They are simply our creditors, holding our debt and to whom we have to sell more – therefore, they have to be carefully managed. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, their heads full of Brexity libertarian arrogance and delusion, chose to ignore that reality. The lesson is not that there are no choices but austerity – it is that successful economic management requires seeing straight. It is true that some market participants, generally the hyper-short-termist hedge funds and day traders, are fiercely pro-free market, anti-regulation and pro-Brexit. But there are many more market actors who, for example, take green and socially responsible investment seriously, are pro-EU, understand the case for regulation as long as it’s not too onerous and get that governments tax, spend and borrow to achieve varying political ends. They don’t automatically veto a social democratic government any more than they would a libertarian one. They veto a stupid government. If there is any shared ideology, it is that they want the government of the day to accept the rules of engagement with any creditor. Their fiduciary obligation is to conserve the assets for which they are responsible, which affects anyone, for example, with a private or occupational pension. Quite right. They look for credible fiscal plans that will be delivered within a well-understood, predictable and above all solid framework that can’t be overturned by political whim. Yes, the Truss-Kwarteng growth plan was intellectually risible, but what really spooked, and continues to spook, market actors is that the British constitutional and political system could allow such cultish nonsense to get so far. Even now, the constitutional arrangements of this, a G7 country, are so primitive that they allow a group of Tory backbenchers in the 1922 Committee to set the rules for who will become prime minister. Small wonder that, as Boris Johnson’s ghoulish re-emergence as a leadership contender surfaced on Friday afternoon, sterling and bonds weakened. Britain’s uncodified constitution, in which so much depends on unwritten protocols being respected, has always been vulnerable to one political party going rogue, in which case not only the economy but the rule of law and even democracy itself are threatened. The proroguing of parliament in September 2019 at Johnson’s discretion was a forerunner of what has been happening over the past six weeks. The summary sacking of the permanent secretary of the Treasury with zero process and the overruling of the legal requirement to publish independent economic forecasts with the mini-budget came from the same roots. A minister, exercising regal prerogative power, can do whatever he or she damn well pleases. Now the same principle is written into the financial services and markets bill: a minister is to be given the powers to “recall”, rewrite or veto any dimension of financial regulation that may displease him or her with no parliamentary process. It was one of many reasons for the credit rating agency Moody’s citing “unpredictability in policymaking”, lowering the UK’s credit standing on Friday from stable to negative. Any successful social democratic government thus has to do two foundational things. It needs to reform the constitution so that the presumption becomes that significant changes to our institutional arrangements have to be validated by both houses of parliament rather than left to ministerial fiat. Democratically elected governments set out their proposals in their manifesto and legislate for them; they can respond to changing circumstances by proposing reforms and new regulation but ministers should not be able to govern by whim with no recourse to parliament. Happily, Labour is halfway there with Gordon Brown’s constitutional review, proposing replacing the Lords with a newly powerful upper house democratically recruited from the UK’s cities, regions and nations. To his list of proposed reforms, Brown should add ending “Henry VIII” prerogative powers. Second, there must be a recasting of the UK tax system, far too biased to tax income and not capital, property and wealth. For example, Britain’s housing stock is worth more than £8tn. Council tax – in England, extraordinarily, based on 1991 property values – yields £40bn, a derisory 0.5%of the value of the stock, well below what domestic rates proportionally used to yield before their abolition by Margaret Thatcher. Taking action on this, along with revisiting the taxation of the super-rich and their capital, and the government could comfortably raise the £40bn needed to plug the fiscal black hole. Marry that with a commitment within a new constitutional settlement to respect the independence of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the yet-to-be-established Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority. Also offer a credible medium-term plan for spending, taxing and borrowing – borrowing only for capital and science investment – and the “markets” will happily hold and buy more UK government debt at reasonable or even falling interest rates. On top, it will offer a credible framework for growth driven by public and private investment. Don’t believe the financial Eeyores. The death of Trussonomics is just that. Britain can have high-quality public services and social justice if it chooses. It just has to choose. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Economic policy; Politics; UK news; Moody's; Business; Liz Truss; Kwasi Kwarteng; Jeremy Hunt,Opinion
2022-06-26T09:59:04Z,Sainsbury’s under new pressure to pay living wage for all workers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/26/sainsburys-under-new-pressure-to-pay-living-wage-for-all-workers,"The Queen’s bank, Coutts &amp; Co, and the Coal Pensions Board have joined a group of investors backing a resolution calling for Sainsbury’s to pay the independently set living wage for all staff and contracted workers. The vote at the UK’s second-largest supermarket’s annual shareholder meeting on 7 July will be the first on a resolution committing a UK company board to pay the living wage. ShareAction, the responsible investment campaign group, said the resolution would be a “litmus test for investors’ social commitments amid the cost-of-living crisis”. Leading City investors including HSBC, Legal &amp; General Investment Management and Fidelity International as well as retirement fund Nest and the Brunel Pension Partnership are already part of the coalition behind the resolution that comes as family budgets are squeezed by surging inflation. Sainsbury’s has raised pay for its 171,000 direct employees across more than 1,400 stores in the UK to the living wage, which is independently calculated for the Living Wage Foundation charity, of at least £9.90 an hour outside London or £11.05 in the capital. However, it has not made the same commitment to contractors. Outsourcing companies such as Mitie provide essential services such as cleaning and security to the supermarket. Leslie Gent, the head of responsible investing at Coutts &amp; Co, said: “We recognise the positive progress made by Sainsbury’s to match the living wage for its directly employed staff. As a living wage employer ourselves we believe that this accreditation would set a standard for all UK supermarkets, and would provide the certainty and transparency that helps attract a high-quality workforce, today and in the future.” More than half of the FTSE 100 are among the more than 10,000 accredited living wage employers. However, none of the big supermarkets are among them. The government’s national living wage, which sets legal minimum rates, pays £9.50 to those aged 23 and over, dropping to £6.83 for those aged between 18 and 20, and £4.81 for apprentices. Rachel Hargreaves, a campaigns manager at ShareAction, said: “There is no excuse for a highly profitable company with multimillion-pound executive salaries refusing to guarantee all its staff, including subcontracted workers, a basic standard of living.” With energy and food costs on the rise, the UK’s lowest-paid workers are under particular pressure. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has reported that the poorest households faced inflation in the year to April of 10.9%, three percentage points higher than top earners. However, the Office for National Statistics in the UK recently shared data showing wages for retail workers increased just 3.7% in the year to April. Sainsbury’s chairman, Martin Scicluna, a former boss of the accountants Deloitte, has written to all shareholders, asking them to vote against the resolution. He argued that the firm’s pay rates were already higher than many of its competitors, and said: “Accrediting as a living wage employer would mean that a third party – the Living Wage Foundation – would decide our colleague pay changes each year ... We believe it is right for the company and our stakeholders to make independent decisions regarding pay and benefits, rather than have them determined by a separate external body.” Tesco’s chairman, John Allan, employed a similar argument when asked about the UK’s largest supermarket chain accrediting to the living wage at its annual shareholder meeting on 17 June. He said Tesco tried to set wages via negotiations with trade unions. “We are very concerned about making a commitment to a living wage and putting our wage structure at the mercy of a decision by a third party,” he told shareholders at the meeting.",J Sainsbury; Living wage; Corporate governance; Business; Retail industry; Society; Supermarkets; UK news; Pay,Business
2022-10-25T09:18:09Z,Budget cuts and Morrison’s pledges: where are the biggest savings coming from?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/october-budget-2022-cuts-savings-infrastructure-rorts-waste-environment-explainer-federal-government-australia,"The Albanese government has ripped at least $9bn of regional, environmental and infrastructure spending out of the federal budget, much of it linked to Scott Morrison’s bid to win Nationals’ support for net zero. The cuts reverse some of the Morrison government’s most controversial spending, from pre-2019 election commitments including the urban congestion fund, the Hells Gate Dam and regional funds established by the Coalition’s last budget in March. In this explainer we break down some of the budget’s biggest savings and identify which projects will miss out. Infrastructure The single largest saving in the budget is $4.7bn over four years for “building a better future through considered infrastructure investment”. This includes a cut of $769m from the urban congestion fund, including a $160m saving from the controversial commuter car park fund, which the auditor general found was used to fund Coalition election commitments. If you’re hoping to park and ride at MacArthur or East Hills on the T8 line, or Hurstville in New South Wales; or Bentleigh, Ferntree Gully or Hampton in Victoria then there is bad news: the budget axes the commuter car parks promised for these suburbs. Other cuts from the Coalition’s infrastructure investment program include upgrades to the Wakehurst Parkway in NSW and Dorset Road in Victoria. The government has also “reprofiled” the funding of existing projects, meaning the projects will still be built but over a longer timeframe, with $6.5bn of infrastructure spending pushed out of the forward estimates (the next four years) into the medium term. The budget papers explain this was done “to better align investment with construction market conditions”. Although this measure is a net $4.7bn saving, the government is also spending in the infrastructure portfolio, including: $2.6bn for Victoria, including $2.2bn for the Suburban Rail Loop East $2.1bn for Queensland, including $866m for the Bruce Highway $1.4bn for NSW, including $500m for the early planning for Sydney-to-Newcastle rail Regions The budget shows a $1.4bn saving for “responsible investment to grow our regions”. The energy security and regional development plan will be slashed by $6.4bn. Just $672.7m of spending remains from that program, which will be spent over seven years to help the Pilbara in Western Australia, the Hunter in NSW and central Queensland to support emerging industries and economic transition. The Northern Territory is now off the list. The regional accelerator program, which the Coalition set up in the March budget promising $2.1bn for regional manufacturing and industry development, has also been gutted, with $1.8bn cut. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup The community development grant program has been axed, saving $802m, while the building better regions fund is also gone, saving $256m. In their place, the Albanese government is promising $1bn over three years for the growing regions program and regional precincts and partnerships program – which it says will be “competitive” grants programs. But not all grants programs will be open and competitive: Labor will spend $1bn over five years for the priority community infrastructure program, including $120m to deliver the central Australia plan; and $350m over five years to deliver small-scale community, sport and infrastructure projects. Both of these are “closed grants program to deliver the government’s election commitments”. Labor will also give a $1.9bn equity injection to the Middle Arm sustainable development precinct in the Northern Territory. Water Cuts from the national water grid fund are another huge source of savings: worth $1.7bn over four years or a whopping $4.6bn over 12 years. This consists of: $5.4bn saved by not proceeding with the Hells Gate Dam project in Queensland $900m of funding over four years for the Dungowan and Emu Swamp dams and pipelines, the Hughenden irrigation scheme and the Wyangala Dam wall raising will be deferred “to be reconsidered once business cases are completed and viable pathways to delivery” determined Returning $174m over four years from unallocated and uncontracted funding from the water grid fund Climate crisis, energy and environment A total of $747m will be saved from this portfolio, including $326m from energy measures which included previously undisclosed pre-feasibility studies for gas pipelines and a carbon dioxide pipeline for a carbon capture and storage project. A further $90m was saved from the reversal of uncommitted funding for international technology partnerships and reducing allocated funding for carbon capture and storage – which have been replaced with more spending on climate diplomacy, and limiting CCS funding to research and development or hard to abate industries. Other programs being trimmed include the recycling modernisation fund, freight energy productivity programs and diesel storage projects. Industry The government is aiming to save $506m in the industry portfolio, including: $303m over three years of cuts to the manufacturing modernisation fund and modern manufacturing initiative $198m over four years from redirecting uncommitted funding from the entrepreneurs’ program Miscellaneous Other measures cut due to Labor’s spending audit include: $115.3m in the employment portfolio including the mid-career checkpoint program and reboot participation initiative $50m from axing round seven of the safer communities program $16m from axing the future leaders program, for which the governor general, David Hurley, personally lobbied Scott Morrison $16.8m from agricultural shows, field days and related grants $15.2m in the home affairs portfolio $15m in the social services portfolio $10.4m in the education portfolio There is also a further $1.6bn of “zombie” measures that were announced by the Coalition but not legislated, including the four-year wait period for new arrivals to receive social security payments, voter ID, pensioner residency eligibility changes, and proposed drug testing of welfare recipients. Coalition reaction On Monday the Nationals’ shadow infrastructure minister, Bridget McKenzie, accused the Albanese government of pursuing a “vendetta” against rural and regional Australia through the budget. McKenzie said it was “incredibly disappointing” that Labor planned to axe the building better regions fund and “quite offensive” that it framed regional spending as “waste”. She said the energy security and regional development plan was designed to “overcome the challenges which are finally being recognised by the broader commentary and society that are going to come with any trajectory towards net zero by 2050”. “If you’re going to increase our climate ambition, you cannot then simultaneously cut funding to those regions that are going to unequivocally be impacted by that decision.”",Australia news; Australian politics; Anthony Albanese; Scott Morrison; Labor party; Coalition; National party; Water; Climate crisis; Infrastructure; Environment; Rural Australia; Transport; Energy; October 2022 Australian budget,Australia news
2022-11-14T14:00:02Z,‘Socially aware’ superannuation funds among those investing billions in gambling industry,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/15/socially-aware-superannuation-funds-among-those-investing-billions-in-gambling-industry,"Australia’s biggest super funds have poured more than $4.2bn of workers’ retirement savings into the gambling industry – including pokies manufacturers, casino operators and lottery companies – even through investment options that claim to be “socially aware”. Investors in Australia’s biggest poker machine operator, Endeavour Group, which runs 12,539 pokies across 300 hotels, include the “Socially Aware” option run by the nation’s biggest fund, AustralianSuper, and the “Sustainable Growth” option offered by the retail employee fund Rest. AustralianSuper’s Socially Aware option is also invested in casino operators and Australia’s biggest pokies manufacturer, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia’s third biggest super fund, Aware, which promises to “invest your super in ways that will do good for your community”, is also a big holder of gambling stocks, including Aristocrat and Endeavour. Guardian Australia analysed portfolio holdings disclosures for the most popular investment options offered by the 10 biggest superannuation funds in Australia, as well as socially aware options offered by AustralianSuper and Rest. Under laws brought in last year by the Morrison government, superannuation funds are required to provide details biannually of what they invest in. The data analysed was the most recent available and was correct as of 30 June this year. It reveals that the 10 biggest super funds all invest in Aristocrat Leisure, owning a total of at least $1.67bn worth of shares. It is one of the world’s largest poker machine manufacturers as well as a gambling app developer. In 2021, the company generated $4.7bn in revenue and held 80% of the market share in pokies in Australia, according to Ibisworld. Australians lost $11bn to pokies in 2021 Australians lose about $25bn to legal forms of gambling every year, according to recent estimates from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Last year they lost more than $11.4bn to poker machines alone. AustralianSuper holds 6.6% of Aristocrat’s shares after increasing its stake from 5.05% in June this year. In June, the fund had nearly $921m invested in Aristocrat through its most popular option, Balanced. The Balanced option also invested $624m in Endeavour, $148m in Tabcorp and $661m in Lottery Corporation, which runs lotteries including Tattslotto and Oz Lotto and was spun out of Tabcorp in May. It also had $103m invested in SkyCity Entertainment, which runs casinos in New Zealand and Adelaide, and $4m in the troubled Sydney casino operator Star Entertainment. AustralianSuper’s Socially Aware option also includes $16m in Aristocrat shares, along with holdings in four more of the six biggest Australian-listed gambling companies, amounting to nearly $45m this year. The Socially Aware option screens out companies that directly own fossil fuel or uranium reserves, or produce tobacco, cluster munitions or land mines, have single-gender boards, or “have received a red flag rating on labour rights, human rights, environmental or governance controversies”. AustralianSuper’s marketing does not mention gambling. A spokesperson for AustralianSuper said the fund did not exclude particular industries, other than tobacco. The fund had been “actively engaging” with gambling companies “to understand the initiatives they have to ensure high standards of responsible gaming and appropriate governance practices are in place”, the spokesperson said. “We will remain vigilant to ensure these companies are consistently acting in line with community and investor expectations and can deliver long-term value for members.” Aware Super champions itself as a morally oriented fund that is “at the forefront in responsible investing, leading and collaborating with a common purpose” and that it is “investing in good”. As at June 2022 its most popular, high-growth option had invested some $460m in Australian gambling companies, including $219m in Aristocrat. A spokesperson for Aware said: “We invest across an exceptionally wide and diverse range of industries and the gambling sector is just one of these. Importantly, members with ethical concerns around the gambling sector can choose one of our socially responsible investment options, which have no gambling exposure.” Rest claims its Sustainable Growth option excludes companies that earn more than 5% of their revenue from gambling – but of the $106m invested in the relatively small option, more than $400,000 is held in Endeavour shares. Endeavour does not disclose how much of its revenue comes from its 12,539 poker machines. The shareholder activist Stephen Mayne, a long-time opponent of the pokies industry, estimated that Endeavour reaps between $1.5bn and $1.6bn in revenue from its poker machines every year. An Endeavour spokesperson declined to comment on Mayne’s estimate but said the total revenue from its hotels business was $1.5bn last year, out of total sales of $11.6bn. “For competitive reasons, we do not disclose the breakdown of the revenue streams in our hotels,” the spokesperson said. “We report to the market in accordance with all accounting standards and laws.” A spokesperson for Rest said: “We are confident that the gambling exclusion is currently correctly applied.” All of the fund’s investment decisions were “made in the best financial interests of our members”, the spokesperson said. Rest was an “active owner” that prioritised “engaging with companies as a shareholder” on environmental and social governance matters, and monitored its screens and exclusions “on an ongoing basis, including those that apply to the Sustainable Growth option”. “Rest has attended a number of company engagements and discussed responsible gambling with board representatives, and currently has more planned … We consider divestment if it’s [in the] best financial interests of our members to do so.” ‘Profiting from misery’ Mayne criticised AustralianSuper for buying more shares in Endeavour after its separation from supermarket group Woolworths in June last year – a demerger that followed criticism of the retailer for being involved in pokies. “I think it’s a disgrace that Aussie Super, after Woolworths demerged Endeavour Group, they’ve consciously gone out and aggressively bought more shares in Endeavour Group, knowing it’s Australia’s biggest pokies operator,” he said. He contrasted AustralianSuper’s attitude with that of other investment funds, which sold their Endeavour shares after receiving them in the demerger “because they didn’t want to be investing in specialist gambling companies”. Anyone who knowingly invested in Aristocrat was “profiting from misery”, Mayne said. “I think [Aristocrat is] responsible for enormous misery.” A spokesperson for Aristocrat said all poker machines sold to venues in Australia were “highly regulated and are compliant with a wide range of technical standards and regulations which take into account harm minimisation”. The chief executive of the Alliance for Gambling Reform, Carol Bennett, said gambling companies were “as bad as it gets when it comes to corporate responsibility”. Public awareness about gambling harm was growing, Bennett said, particularly in the wake of inquiries into Crown and Star casinos, which found a series of licence breaches, including evidence of money laundering and criminal involvement in junket operators that bring high-rollers to Australia. A royal commission in Victoria also found that Crown consistently breached its licence by allowing people at its Melbourne casino to gamble on poker machines for at least 12 hours at a time before checking that they were OK. “I think a lot of people are shocked by what they’ve seen and they’re increasingly concerned,” Bennett said. • In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858.

Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy in the US and professor at Texas Tech University, said the world was heading for dangers unseen in the 10,000 years of human civilisation, and efforts to make the world more resilient were needed but by themselves could not soften the impact enough. “People do not understand the magnitude of what is going on,” she said. “This will be greater than anything we have ever seen in the past. This will be unprecedented. Every living thing will be affected.” While countries can start to adapt to some of the impacts, for instance with seawalls and flood barriers, and by making their infrastructure more resilient to extreme weather, if global heating is allowed to continue then the world will rapidly reach a point beyond what can be adapted to. “If we continue with business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, there is no adaptation that is possible. You just can’t,” she said, in an interview with the Guardian. These impacts would be felt across the world, she warned. “Our infrastructure, worth trillions of dollars, built over decades, was built for a planet that no longer exists,” she said. Changing that infrastructure would cost further trillions, so allowing greenhouse gas emissions to continue to grow would mean ever-rising impacts and costs. The whole of modern life was at stake, she added. “Human civilisation is based on the assumption of a stable climate,” she said. “But we are moving far beyond the stable range.” Earlier this month, Stuart Kirk, the head of responsible investment at the global bank HSBC, made headlines by suggesting that financial institutions should discount the risks of the climate crisis as the world could adapt to its impacts. He noted that Amsterdam was built on land below sea level, and suggested that areas climate scientists have predicted would be vulnerable to inundation, such as Miami, could be similarly adapted to cope with the risk. “Who cares if Miami is six metres under water in 100 years?” he asked an investor conference. HSBC moved quickly to disown Kirk’s comments and suspend him. HSBC Asset Management’s chief executive, Nicolas Moreau, said Kirk’s remarks “do not reflect the views of HSBC Asset Management nor HSBC Group in any way”, and reiterated the bank’s commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. “HSBC regards climate change as one of the most serious emergencies facing the planet, and is committed to supporting its customers in their transition to net zero and a sustainable future.” Hayhoe, who has been a lead author on US national climate assessments, said Kirk’s comments seemed to reflect an attitude that was gaining ground among “climate dismissers”, who try to minimise the level of risk from climate change by saying the impacts would be manageable. However, the world’s leading climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warned earlier this year that continued global heating, beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, would wreak devastation across the globe, in the form of floods, droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather, with swathes of the planet becoming unsuitable for agriculture and effectively uninhabitable, causing extreme harm to human society in many places. Hayhoe said the IPCC findings had not been broadly understood by many people. “This is an unprecedented experiment with the climate,” she said. “The reality is that we will not have anything left that we value, if we do not address the climate crisis.”",Climate crisis; Environment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Extreme weather; World news,Environment
2021-10-28T09:00:07Z,Backers of UK airport expansion are part of UN green investment scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/28/backers-of-uk-airport-expansion-are-part-of-un-green-investment-scheme,"Investors funding bids to expand UK airports have been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged they are signatories to a UN green investment scheme. Members of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) scheme, who number more than 4,000, publicly commit to acting in “the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries”, including incorporating environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making. But analysis by the environmental investigation group DeSmog has found that 13 signatories to the scheme are also investors in UK airports with expansion plans, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Bristol. The investigation found that at least one investor in each of the seven airports seeking to expand is involved in the scheme, including four out of five of Bristol airport’s shareholders and four out of Heathrow’s seven. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the main pension provider for the British higher education sector, is a Heathrow investor at the same time as being part of PRI’s “Leaders’ Group”, which celebrates “responsible investment excellence”. Sam Pickard, a climate and sustainability researcher at the Overseas Development Institute thinktank, said: “This analysis shows – yet again – the gulf between the finance sector’s actions and its rhetoric. Investments that unlock decades of future carbon emissions in rich countries are the complete opposite of what is required for creating shared prosperity in the face of the climate emergency.” Charlie Kronick, a senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace, said the findings raised “really serious questions” for initiatives such as PRI. “We know airport expansion, particularly in Europe and the UK is totally incompatible with any kind of serious climate ambition.” He added: “Basically, every week there’s a new investor alliance or coalition that says their climate credentials are amazing and they’re still ploughing money into the same old high-carbon activity from airports to coal.” He said it was “essential” that groups such as PRI “re-evaluate their membership criteria”. Otherwise, he warned, “they risk being nothing more than a smokescreen or a meaningless badge for investors to hide behind”. The UK government recently concluded a consultation on how to achieve a net zero aviation sector by 2050. The Climate Change Committee, an independent body advising the government, has recommended that no net increase in airport expansion should be allowed unless the industry “sufficiently outperforms” its current emissions trajectory, following previous warnings that the sector could consume as much as two-thirds of the country’s 1.5C carbon budget if left unchecked. The PRI, which was started in 2006 under the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, describes itself as the “world’s leading proponent of responsible investment” and its chief executive recently called for a “sustainable and inclusive recovery from Covid-19”. But it has been criticised for not setting strict enough membership criteria. Last year, for the first time, five investors were removed for failing to meet minimum requirements. The scheme does not have a defined policy on aviation investment but last year released a statement with Climate Action 100+, another green investment initiative, in which it defined expectations for the sector, including setting 2050 net zero emissions targets and strategies to support the development of sustainable aviation fuels. Fiona Reynolds, the chief executive of PRI, told the Guardian it was “committed to driving investor action to help achieve the goals of the Paris agreement to reach a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050 or sooner”. Reaching that goal, she said, “requires near-term action and innovation across all sectors”, including aviation. But, she added: “The PRI is not responsible for – nor can it monitor – every individual investment in its more than 4,300 signatories’ portfolios. They must be monitored by the investor, in line with their own investment beliefs, investor duties, commitments and policies.” Reynolds said it was “continuing to strengthen our minimum requirements” and the investment reporting systems. Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said UK airports were “at the forefront” of global aviation decarbonisation efforts. “They were driving forces behind UK aviation’s commitment to net zero by 2050 – a world first for a national aviation sector – alongside a clear roadmap towards achieving that target. Several UK airports are committed to reaching net zero ahead of this date.” Dee added: “To date, UK airports have made great strides in decarbonising their own operations and helped introduce operating procedures to reduce aircraft emissions. Airports also have a clear plan for the future, including by working with their investors to fund initiatives and trials for future net-zero operations.” The USS declined to comment.",Ethical business; Travel and transport; Environment; Air transport; Heathrow third runway; Airline industry; UK news; Business; Heathrow airport; London; Transport; Green politics; United Nations,Business
2022-05-19T17:32:37Z,"Executive pay system is broken, says Church of England’s pension board",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/next-shareholders-agree-to-44m-pay-package-for-chief-despite-opposition,"The system of executive pay is “broken”, the Church of England’s pension board has said, as it challenged more companies to ease the pain of soaring inflation by committing to paying workers the living wage. On the day retailer Next approved a 50% pay rise for its chief executive, Adam Matthews, the Church’s chief responsible investment officer, called out examples of “excessive pay” at large companies in a post on LinkedIn. On Thursday, shareholders in Next backed the company’s decision to reward Simon Wolfson with £4.4m this year, the highest level since 2015, despite opposition from some investors concerned about the disparity between executives and the wider workforce. Matthews, who manages £3bn of investments, voted his shares against the increase. Explaining the decision, he wrote: “We can sound off on radio and vote against but we need to recognise that fundamentally the executive pay system we have isn’t working. “This is particularly egregious at a time that many of the workers in many of these companies will be struggling with the growing costs of living. You have major increases in executive pay in consumer facing companies such as Next where the workforce are not accredited as being on a living wage.” A spokesperson for Next said: “Given the challenges facing the retail sector, Next does not anticipate increasing wages above the national living wage as it prioritises protecting jobs.” Companies which are accredited as living wage employers have committed to paying all of their employees a rate based on living costs, which stands at £9.90 an hour across the UK, and £11.05 in London. Matthews said he would be inviting the board chairs and chairs of remuneration committees, and meeting with other fund managers, to discuss reforms. He added: “There is a societal crisis unfolding before us and in the UK you have over three-quarters of churches involved in supporting foodbanks that are not just providing food to people out of work but those in work that cannot make ends meet. So as a pension fund we will be convening a meeting of asset owners, with key fund managers to look at this broken system that is enabling excess.” His comments followed a warning on Wednesday from Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer advice site Money Saving Expert, that financial desperation could lead to “civil unrest”. Households already struggling with soaring food and energy bills face a further hit when the energy price cap rises for the second time this year in October. “The public mood is desperate, it’s angry and we may well be moving towards, if we don’t sort this when those bills rises come in October to £2,600 in the middle of winter, I worry about civil unrest,” he told ITV’s Peston programme. The Institutional Voting Information Service (IVIS), which is part of the Investment Association and advises investors on corporate governance, had marked Next’s annual remuneration report with a “red top” warning, suggesting that shareholders vote against. Despite the opposition, just 7.5% of shareholders challenged the plan to pay Wolfson an annual bonus worth 100% of his basic salary and two share bonuses based on long-term performance. Activists from Share Action and Labour Behind the Label who attended Next’s AGM in Leicester, the centre of the UK’s garment-making industry, asked the company’s executives why workers in factories which supply garments to Next were not paid the living wage. They reported that Wolfson listened carefully to them, but did not promise change. Other firms including the owner of Wagamama, the Restaurant Group, have also come in for criticism in recent weeks over executive bonuses. The group – which also owns the Frankie &amp; Benny’s and Chiquito chains – paid its chief executive, Andy Hornby, £1.2m last year up, up from £518,000 a year earlier. Meanwhile, Tesco has been criticised for paying its chief executive £4.75m last year, including the highest annual bonus awarded by the supermarket since 2016, at a time when families are being hit by soaring food price inflation. Despite this, Matthews wrote there was rarely widespread backlash from investors: “There are occasional rebellions of shareholders, but then attention diverts and we all waste our time trying to decipher ever complicated justifications for excessive pay.”",Executive pay and bonuses; Living wage; Next; Retail industry; Business; UK news,Business
2022-06-11T18:00:25Z,Why bankers close their ears to the ‘climate nut jobs’ talking about the end of the world | Nick Cohen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/11/technocrats-cant-think-beyond-six-years-whatever-climate-nut-jobs-think,"If the future remembers any corporate villain from 2022, it will be Stuart Kirk. The satirically titled head of “responsible investment” at HSBC looks the part: shaven headed, tightly trimmed beard, hard, sharp eyes. Like all the best villains, the banker’s arguments are insidiously appealing. He says out loud what his audience thinks, cutting through polite society’s pious crap to reveal its selfish desires. “There’s always some nut job telling me about the end of the world,” he told the Financial Times’s Moral Money conference – and I haven’t made that title up either. “Who cares if Miami is six metres underwater in 100 years? Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that’s a really nice place.” Notice the neat two-step he performs. On the one hand, only “nut jobs” talk of a catastrophe, even if the ranks of the nutty include the UN and every serious climate scientist. But when the nut jobs turn out to be anything but nuts, Kirk shifts his position and assures you that we will enjoy climate change, as Amsterdammers enjoy their canalside cafes. And if we can’t? We’ll all be dead in a 100 years anyway so who the hell cares. I welcome Kirk’s rant as he was articulating what most governments must subconsciously think. Not one country has honoured the promises made at last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Alok Sharma, a cabinet office minister and Cop26 president, tried his best to stir them the other day by talking of “a monstrous act of self-harm” and “chronic danger”. To no avail. Like Covid lockdowns and 2021’s fashions, climate change is yesterday’s news. Last week, the government launched a quarter-baked housing initiative, which almost certainly won’t happen, and will only force up the exorbitant price of property if it does. Not once did he mention insulating Britain’s homes. The omission was part of a pattern. In no recent statement has the government committed to improving our energy resilience. Our reliance on oil and gas funds despotic regimes from Russia to Saudi Arabia. Their emissions contribute to catastrophic climate change. Rising fuel costs are pummelling the incomes of millions. And yet nothing happens. So many of the schemes to reach net zero strike my cynical mind as either utopian – the technology isn’t there – or too expensive for electorates to bear. Home insulation, by contrast, is authentically popular. It would halve heating bills and deliver tangible benefits to citizens. The Treasury’s fear of the short-term cost explains the policy paralysis in part. But there is a deeper intellectual confusion, not just here but across the world, which is closer to Kirk’s arrant complacency than fear. Most studies of ignorance concentrate on the voters intellectuals oppose: Brexiters, Trump supporters and the like. But climate change is asking hard questions about the inadequate thinking of highly educated technocrats in rich societies. Green economists are trying to explain why the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England are refusing to treat climate change as a systemic risk to the financial system. They wanted central banks to introduce one-to-one capital requirements for loans to fossil fuel companies. The more risk capital a bank is obliged to hold the less profit it makes on a loan. Faced with a punishing regulatory burden, banks would deprive polluting companies of resources by choosing to lend elsewhere. It’s not that the project was dismissed as too radical. The Bank of England and Federal Reserve took the danger of a climate “Lehman moment” seriously. Isabel Schnabel, a member of the executive board of the ECB, wrote of climate change causing inflation, adding to monetary risk and amplifying volatility as extreme weather and massive suffering brought their inevitable economic consequences. Yet all rejected action. The Bank of England offered the democratic objection that “how to address the causes of climate change is a decision for governments and parliaments, not financial regulators”. But it succeeded only in raising the obvious follow-up question: why then aren’t democratically accountable governments directing banks to address climate change? James Vaccaro of the Climate Safe Lending Network says that even the most intellectually gifted central bankers do not understand the difference between a crisis and a collapse. Or if they do in theory, they are too constrained by established ways of thinking to act on their knowledge. An economic crisis caused by inflation, Russian militarism or Covid may be devastating. The world will suffer loss and damage. But from an economic point of view there is an “other side” to reach once the crisis has passed and we have returned to a type of normality. There is no other side to a collapse. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is talking about the rapid acceleration towards breakdown. You can see it coming in the monstrous heatwave in India and the wildfires in Siberia. Once average global temperatures increase beyond 1.5C, “tree die-offs, drying peatlands, thawing permafrost and other self- reinforcing feedback loops [will] release additional carbon emissions, amplifying the warming further”. Climate change will spiral “beyond the ability of humanity to influence it”. There are no climatic equivalents of interest rate rises or furlough payments to return us to a tolerable equilibrium. Economists, like so many of us, can be slaves to the past. We think we can look backwards to the future. What happened the last time there was a land war in eastern Europe? How did previous Conservative PMs fare after a bloody confidence vote? In the best of times, the past is an unreliable guide, but it offers us no clues to our environmental future. Risk managers point out, that when, for instance, the European Banking Authority says that evidence of climate change causing economic chaos is scarce, it failed to ask what evidence it expected to find in backward-looking data. If ever there was a case for vigorous bank regulation, Stuart Kirk made it. In his address to the FT’s moral money-makers he said that the average length of a loan was six years. “What happens to the planet in year seven is actually irrelevant to our loan book.” HSBC suspended him for telling tales out of school. But the governments, central bankers and business leaders who believe it is “irrelevant” what happens when they have retired in six or more years are still, I am afraid, very much with us. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

2021-11-08T07:00:23Z,More than 130 MPs call for parliament pension fund to divest from fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/climate-130-mps-call-pension-fund-divest-fossil-fuels,"More than 130 MPs, including over half of the parliamentary Labour party, have signed a cross-party letter to their pension fund calling on it to divest from fossil fuel companies to “ensure that our pensions are not funding climate disaster”. The letter, to be delivered on Monday to trustees of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF), applauds recent reductions in investments in fossil fuels, but adds: “We believe you must go a step further, divesting from the fossil fuel industry in its entirety, as quickly as possible. “Without this, our pensions are contributing to temperatures rising above 1.5°C. If this limit is exceeded, then by the time younger members are old enough to draw our pensions, a full-blown climate catastrophe will have struck, with ice caps melted, food systems collapsed and deadly extreme weather becoming the norm.” A total of 132 MPs have signed, including 107 of the 199 members of the parliamentary Labour party, with nine members of the shadow cabinet signing. Thirteen SNP MPs, five Liberal Democrats and two Conservatives also signed, among others. The letter, drafted to coincide with the UK’s hosting of the Cop26 climate summit, reiterates a UN warning that current investment in planned fossil fuel extraction “vastly exceeds” the limit needed to keep global heating below the 1.5C rise mandated by the Paris agreement. “It is recognised that as elected representatives, we have a responsibility to show leadership on the climate emergency and ensure that our pensions are not funding climate disaster,” it says. “Let us get our house in order by aligning our pension investments with a green and prosperous zero-carbon future that helps to contain global heating to below 1.5°C. “The world’s eyes are on us. It is time that we show true leadership and divest parliament from the fossil fuel industry.” The letter has been coordinated by the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana as part of the long-running Divest Parliament campaign, which claims the backing of more than 360 current and former MPs. Another signatory, David Warburton, the Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, said Cop26 had put the UK “at the centre of international diplomacy and coalition-building in a pivotal moment for climate action”. The branch of the GMB union that represents MPs’ staff this week said it supported Divest Parliament and announced that it would be launching a similar campaign centred on staff pensions. “We recognise that MPs and the Westminster community have a unique opportunity to show leadership on climate action and responsible investment through addressing the practices of their own pension fund,” it said in a tweet.",Fossil fuel divestment; Pensions industry; Pensions; Fossil fuels; Oil; Gas; Oil; Gas; Business; House of Commons; Labour; Green party; Green politics; Green economy; Politics; UK news,Environment
2021-10-27T08:30:16Z,City broker launches weather data index to trade climate crisis risk,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/27/city-broker-launches-weather-data-index-to-trade-climate-crisis-risk,"The City broker TP ICAP has launched a weather data-backed index that it says will allow business risks tied to the pace of the climate crisis to be traded on financial markets for the first time. The creation of an index allows financial firms to form a view on the rate of temperature change and build financial products to hedge the risks. Launched in partnership with the environmental data firm Speedwell, the ICAP-Speedwell Climate Index will be underpinned by a representation of average global temperature based on statistics collected from 50 independent weather stations globally. Using a dataset that is 20 years old but that will be updated daily, TP ICAP said it expected this to provide a pricing model that would allow financial firms to create futures and options products that can be traded on markets. Insurers and bankers already track specific weather events such as torrential rainfall near coffee plantations or hurricane risks in the Gulf of Mexico, but the index is believed to be the first to track the climate crisis globally. “Many companies have significant and sometimes unquantified exposure to weather and climate risk,” said Nicholas Ernst, TP ICAP’s managing director of weather markets. “The introduction of the index has the ability to dramatically change how people calculate the financial impact of global climate change, providing comprehensive data to quantify the impact of future temperature changes for the first time.” However, ShareAction, a charity that promotes responsible investment, was critical of the new index. Helen Wiggs, the head of climate, said: “It’s hard to think of a better example of the financial sector putting profit before planet than an index that allows investors to bet on the severity of climate change. “Investors should be focusing all their attention on aligning their investment and engagement practices with 1.5C pathways, instead of creating new products to gamble on the severity of heatwaves and floods that will inflict misery on millions.” The launch of the index comes in the run-up to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, starting on Saturday, where more than 120 world leaders will gather to discuss stepping up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the landmark Paris agreement, signed in 2015, governments committed to limiting global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit heating to 1.5C. Those goals are legally binding and enshrined in the treaty. However, to meet those goals, countries agreed on non-binding national targets and those are inadequate to meet the Paris temperature goals.",Business; Climate crisis; Financial sector; Environment; Cop26; World news; UK news,Business
2022-02-20T16:30:08Z,From human rights to recycling bins: how can you define ‘ethical investing’?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/from-human-rights-to-recycling-bins-how-can-you-define-ethical-investing,"Companies are facing increasing consumer and shareholder pressure to ensure the investments they make are ethical. But how do they define what’s ethical? Broadly, ethical investment is on the rise. According to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA), about $1tn of the $2.24tn in managed funds is classified as responsible. That’s not just because Australians are becoming more aware of the impact their investments can have, but also because responsible or ethical investment is really starting to pay. Sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially conscious businesses are often making essential contributions to our future. Through superannuation, banking and shares, people are actively putting their funds into such ventures. Unfortunately, there’s no uniform indication of what constitutes “ethical”. There’s also no regulation to clarify what ethical investing is as a basic standard. So you need to navigate the marketing. Ethical screening is generally conducted by fund managers and financial advisers. So, for example, in the case of an ethical superannuation fund, the fund’s managers will establish their ethical expectations and screen prospective companies based on this. Similarly, an ethical financial adviser will have a broad view of what they deem ethical, while also taking their clients’ specific needs into account. If you are investing independently, it will be up to you to decide what’s non-negotiable and what’s acceptable. To give you an idea of how the big superannuation funds and ethical investment firms decide what’s ethical and what’s not, here’s a list of the ways their investments might be screened. It’s still not foolproof, but it’s a start. Negative screening The negative screening process involves putting companies through assessments to find out if they’re invested in things that people broadly deem unethical. If they produce an addictive product or service (tobacco, gambling), they’re unlikely to get over the ethical hurdle. Likewise, if they engage in poor labour practices, they can be struck off the list of potential investment. Negative screening is a good place to start when deciding what you will and won’t invest in. If you are staunchly opposed to tobacco, obviously you won’t want your investment portfolio to include a company that makes cigarettes. Positive or ‘best-in-class’ screening This involves seeking out companies that have good social and ethical values, such as a zero-carbon-emissions policy, a gender-diverse board and exemplary treatment of staff in the production of goods and services. In essence, they turn a profit by doing the right thing. Ideally, they do everything right, but depending on who’s screening, they might only need to meet one or a handful of items in the criteria to make the cut. Companies that perform well in a positive screening process often make a tangible difference to environmental or social outcomes. And, in a perfect world, they’re a good investment too. This might include sectors such as healthcare, education and renewable energy. All super funds, managed funds and exchange-traded fund managers will do a form of screening, but the screens vary and therefore you may also need to apply your own ethical lens to see if it’s a good fit. Minimum standards or ‘norms-based’ screening This approach uses the minimum standard of company, government or international standards. The minimum standards depend on which filter they’re put through. So, for example, they may be subject to assessment based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. These principles are based, in part, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles cover topics such as: • Human rights (non-compliance in human rights abuses) • Labour (recognition of the right to collective bargaining and elimination of compulsory labour and child labour; elimination of discrimination) • The environment (precautionary approaches to environmental concerns, environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies) • Anti-corruption Depending on the fund, or financial product, specific screens will be applied. For example, Verve Superannuation applies a specific gender equality screening. This might be important to you. Alternatively, if you seek vegan and animal-friendly investments, you’d be looking for a specific screen layer. Ethics are personal, and therefore no one broad screen is likely to fit your ethical goals. Sustainability investing This is a specific environmental approach, and it means actively seeking out funds or investment opportunities in clean-water programs, renewable energy, infrastructure, recycling, waste management and more. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing ESG covers environmental, social and governance screening principles. If this is the screen you’re using, you might need to dig a bit to see just how good a company’s governance is. That can mean a fair amount of time and effort on your part: reading company reports, understanding the financial situation and continuing to keep track of the company’s activity once you’ve invested. Because ESG covers these sweeping, general areas, it makes it possible for businesses to claim they’re meeting the ESG criteria when, in fact, it’s a regular business where people are paid the nominated award wages and there’s a recycling bin next to the printer. Perhaps they report on sustainability during their annual general meeting, but potentially there’s little real change being driven. That’s not to say there aren’t companies with a great commitment to ESG, but you need to be comfortable with where they sit on what is a massive spectrum. Impact investing If you choose impact investing as a key screen, you’re ultimately looking to see physical results from your investment. That might come in the form of improved transport and infrastructure, schools or hospitals. Equally, the impact might be improved social outcomes locally or internationally. Either way, you’ll seek to get a return on investment while hopefully being able to see an actual result. If you’re unsure where to start, an ethical financial adviser could help you establish a strategy. The cost of personal advice can be prohibitive, which means you may have to do your own research. The first step might be to call your superannuation fund and find out where your money is invested. If they can’t tell you, look for funds that can provide more transparency, so you can consider the contents of the portfolios and how they align with your values.

2021-11-29T16:30:06Z,‘Right to know’: critics blast Coalition attempt to shield Future Fund from FOI laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/30/right-to-know-critics-blast-coalition-attempt-to-shield-future-fund-from-foi-laws,"Legislation scheduled to be debated in federal parliament this week would shield Australia’s Future Fund from freedom of information requests such as the one that revealed the sovereign wealth fund is investing in weapons manufacturers that sell arms to the Myanmar military. The Australian government’s Future Fund has more than $157m invested with 14 publicly traded companies that have done business with the sanctioned Myanmar military, which has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Australia has investments with Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a Chinese state-owned weapons manufacturer that has sold combat aircraft to the Myanmar military, and Bharat Electronics, an Indian government-controlled company which has sold radar and sonar equipment to the regime. The Coalition’s Investment Funds Legislation Amendment Bill 2021 is slated to be debated in the Senate on Wednesday, the penultimate parliamentary sitting day of this year and possibly of this parliament. The proposed law would exempt the Future Fund from releasing any details about its investments under FOI laws, including, as the department of finance confirmed to a Senate inquiry, information about which companies the fund has invested in and how much. Greens senator Nick McKim has tabled amendments that would remove the Future Fund’s FOI exemption and require the fund to publicly report its investments every six months. The Future Fund, which controls nearly $250bn in funds and has 182 employees, has previously said the 10 to 20 freedom of information requests it receives each year are “administratively burdensome”. McKim told the Guardian it was “grossly inappropriate” Australia’s sovereign wealth fund was investing public money in arms manufacturing, “let alone in Chinese state-owned corporations supplying weapons to Myanmar’s military regime”. He said the fund should immediately divest its investments in arms manufacturers, and argued the proposed government legislation was unjustified and unnecessary. “Rather than more secrecy, we need far greater scrutiny of their investments,” McKim said. “Under the government’s proposal, we would never have found out about the Future Fund’s investments in companies linked to the Myanmar military. The Australian people have a right to know how their money is being invested and into which companies.” Introducing the bill into parliament in August, the employment minister, Stuart Robert, said having Future Fund investments subject to the scrutiny of the FOI regime presented an “investment and governance risk”. “The exemption under FOI laws will increase confidence in the operation of the law and allow important engagement with investment managers to successfully invest … on behalf of the government where returns benefit all Australians,” he said. Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, has faced international condemnation over its 2017 “clearance operations” – executed with “genocidal intent” according to UN investigators – against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state, which included mass killings, including of children, as well as gang rapes, arson and torture. More than 25,000 Rohingya were killed, and 700,000 driven over Myanmar’s border into Bangladesh. The Tatmadaw, which has ruled Myanmar for much of its independent history, forcibly took control of the country in a coup in February and has since killed more than 1,200 civilians in a crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The chief executive of Save the Children, Paul Ronalds, said Australia’s Future Fund was established for the benefit of future generations, not to fund companies that provide weapons used by regimes accused of committing mass violence against children in conflict. “The information uncovered highlights the need for greater transparency of Australia’s investment in weapons manufacturers with the Australian public.” Rawan Arraf, the executive director at the Australian Centre for International Justice, said FOI laws had exposed the Future Fund’s “astonishingly inadequate” environmental, social and corporate governance, and responsible investment policy. “If it wasn’t for access to freedom of information, we wouldn’t know just how bad these investment activities are. Now, that mechanism is at serious risk. These investments should be reviewed and scrutinised by the public.” Arraf said Australian taxpayer funds should be invested ethically. Clancy Moore, the Australian director at Publish What You Pay, said “transparency means Australians now know that our sovereign wealth fund is invested in weapons companies and big gas companies, like Total and Chevron”. “The proposed change would keep these investments secret from Australians.” Justice For Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung said: “It is deplorable that Australia’s Future Fund is seeking to profit from companies arming the Myanmar military and effectively financing its campaign of terror.” The Future Fund did not answer questions about its investments in companies linked to the Tatmadaw. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “In line with its mandate from government, the Future Fund has built a broadly diversified portfolio which includes passive investments through external investment managers in thousands of entities globally. “The fund has a well-established policy on environmental, social and governance matters and exclusions which takes account of its objectives, legislation, investment strategy, Australian law and the treaties that the Australian government has entered and ratified.” Neither the Aviation Industry Corporation of China nor Bharat Electronics responded to questions from the Guardian.",Australia news; Australian politics; Canberra; Coalition,Australia news
2021-10-13T03:00:09Z,Aboriginal groups and investors form new alliance to protect heritage sites,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/13/aboriginal-groups-and-investors-form-new-alliance-to-protect-heritage-sites,"A new alliance of powerful investors and Aboriginal heritage organisations has been formed in the wake of Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge, to make sure such a disaster “never happens again”. The Dhawura Ngilan collaboration says it will keep a close eye on mining companies from now on, acknowledging that protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage is the responsibility of all Australians, including the finance and business sectors. “We witnessed national and global investor backlash to the Juukan Gorge disaster, demonstrating that First Nations cultural heritage is both a moral issue as well as a material financial risk,” said Estelle Parker from the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) and Dhawura Ngilan partner, alongside the UN Global Compact Network Australia. Hesta superannuation is another major partner. The fund, which manages $52bn on behalf of more than 870,000 Australians and is an institutional investor in Rio Tinto, has long been vocal in its criticism of the way the mining giant acted at Juukan Gorge. “What we’ve been able to do through the flashpoint that was Juukan Gorge is to say: this is a risk to the way in which you are doing business,” Hesta superannuation’s head of impact, Mary Delahunty, said. “I feel like we should have seen this without the Gorge incident, but I’m so glad that it’s now come to the attention of investors and never shall we turn away from these sort of business practices again,” she said. Delahunty was critical of Western Australia’s draft new Aboriginal cultural heritage bill, which was meant to replace the outdated legislation which allowed Rio Tinto to destroy a 46,000-year-old cultural site at Juukan Gorge, deemed to be of the highest archaeological significance in Australia. Rio obtained ministerial consent to destroy or damage the sites from the Western Australian government under that state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act in 2013, but said it did not reconsider that agreement in light of the new information from 2014 archaeological digs. The explosion led to an international shareholder revolt, cost the jobs of three senior Rio executives and sparked a federal parliamentary inquiry. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Western Australian government has spent the past year consulting on the new bill, but traditional owners say it doesn’t provide them greater protections than before. “We’ve seen, and made ourselves aware of all of the submissions that have been put to that particular piece of legislation and had lengthy conversations with traditional owners on their concerns,” Delahunty said, saying that the bill “doesn’t represent best practice”. “At a minimum, probably the policymakers should stop and consult further and seek to address some of those gaps or we risk really losing the chance to do this properly.” Delahunty said part of the work ahead was to help investors understand how to support free prior and informed consent for traditional owners in their dealings with mining companies. “I think investors are coming to this point, that when you are seeking to do business on land, with people who are the custodians of that land, they’re not just stakeholders. And that elevation of native title holders in decision making, which should be reflected in the Western Australian bill, actually means that they have more consideration than any other stakeholders in the management and protection or destruction and disturbance of culture.” The First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance co-chairs Kado Muir and Anne Dennis said the “immense burden” of pursuing social, cultural and environmental rights had fallen to land councils and native title bodies under different legislative regimes, and they welcomed a new national approach. Rodney Carter, from the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council and the CEO of the Dja Dja Wurrung clans, said: “Every day there are sacred places, cultural places, healing places that are being destroyed because our Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation permits managed destruction. “We must care for our culture and our heritage, not just for the benefit of our own mob, but for all people that visit our countries,” Carter said. The federal inquiry into the Juukan gorge disaster was due to deliver its final report to parliament next week.",Indigenous Australians; Western Australia; Business; Rio Tinto; Mining; Australia news,Australia news
2021-10-11T07:00:25Z,Cop26 must not overshadow Kunming: we need joint climate and biodiversity goals | Ma Jun,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/11/cop26-must-not-overshadow-kunming-we-need-joint-climate-and-biodiversity-goals-aoe,"All eyes are on Cop26 in Glasgow since the climate crisis aroused worldwide attention and compelled more than 120 countries to join the unprecedented global Race to Zero carbon-emissions campaign. But the UN biodiversity conference in Kunming, or Cop15, should not be overshadowed, as biodiversity loss is an equally grave threat to humanity. Cop15, delayed repeatedly by the Covid-19 pandemic, will take place in two parts, online from 11 October, with more detailed discussions left for April’s meeting in Kunming, China. The conference will convene governments from around the world to agree new goals for nature for the next decade, as global biodiversity losses pose a threat to human wellbeing, affecting food, health and security, and increasing the likelihood of pandemics. Humanity has achieved unprecedented development and prosperity over the past 50 years, with the world population more than doubling and global GDP growing from barely $3tn in 1970 to nearly $85tn in 2020. But in this time nature has suffered enormous losses, with the global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish declining by two-thirds on average, according to last year’s Living Planet report. We should not take biodiversity for granted from a human development perspective either. About 75% of crops depend on pollinators; approximately 75% of our fresh water comes from healthy forests; and more than half of the global population depends on nature for their livelihoods. When the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services concluded in 2019 that among the world’s 8 million species, 1 million of them were threatened with extinction in the next few decades, it served as a wake-up call. While conservationists hope an ambitious global biodiversity framework can be crafted in Kunming, it is necessary to recall the lessons of Cop10 in Japan, which agreed the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets to stem the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems. More than a decade later, the world has failed to reach even one of those targets. In a more complex context of global pandemic and climate challenges, the tension between development and conservation is even more pronounced. Without sufficient attention, even if such an ambitious plan were put down on paper in Kunming, it may share the fate of the Aichi targets. So, first and foremost, governments and societies must recognise that humanity and nature are one community with a shared future. Then we must properly value all products and services provided by biodiversity and the planet’s ecosystems. When all eyes are on the climate crisis, we must not forget nature’s vital role in climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. As healthy ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, seas and grasslands, have served as enormous carbon sinks and helped mitigate climate change, a better way is to coordinate the two Cop processes for a synergised solution. Despite the challenges, we see hopeful signs that the importance of biodiversity is being acknowledged and that innovative conservation solutions are being developed in different parts of the world. Costa Rica is well known for its pioneering work in restoring natural ecosystems and reviving rainforests. As the host country of Cop15, China has held up eco-civilisation as one of its fundamental socio-economic development principles. It has designated 25% of its land and territorial waters as “ecological red-line” zones and curbed the trend of eco-degradation through concrete measures such as a logging ban, returning farmland to forest and grassland, establishing national parks, controlling water pollution and a ban on fishing in the Yangtze basin. Information technologies could serve as a gamechanger in building awareness and sharing knowledge. Global Forest Watch provides real-time mapping data for monitoring the world’s forests and unsustainable practices. Our organisation, the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs (IPE), is working with partners to depict China’s red-line ecological zones on our Blue Map website and apps, side by side with local air and water-quality data, and the geolocation and environmental performances of 5m companies. Over the next 10 years, we hope to see biodiversity knowledge and best conservation practices pooled to better coordinate the protection of nature with pollution control and climate actions, and to help mobilise public supervision, strengthen government regulations and enable green supply chain and responsible investment and financing. Only such broad-based actions may bring about a transformation in society’s understanding of and relationship with biodiversity and ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature can be fulfilled. • Ma Jun is founding director of China’s Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs.

2021-05-04T15:10:42Z,‘Ill-judged’ bonus hike for AstraZeneca boss prompts investor anger,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/04/obscene-bonus-hike-for-astrazeneca-boss-prompts-investor-anger,"AstraZeneca is facing mounting opposition over its plans to award its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, a big increase in bonuses, with three investor advisory groups calling on shareholders to vote against the policy. Pirc, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) have all flagged concerns over moves to raise the maximum share bonus Soriot can receive under a long-term plan from 550% of his £1.3m base salary to 650%. AZ also plans to hoist Soriot’s maximum annual bonus to 250% of salary from 200%, depending on performance targets being hit. The advisory groups recommended investors vote against the pay policy at next Tuesday’s annual meeting. Neville White, the head of responsible investment policy and research at EdenTree Investment Management, which holds AstraZeneca shares, described the proposed bonus increases as “wrong and ill-judged”. He added: “As long-term responsible investors in AstraZeneca we applaud unreservedly the company’s leadership during the pandemic. This pride is now tarnished however by proposals to once again escalate executive pay to heights rarely seen in the UK.” “We will vigorously oppose these proposals and call upon the AstraZeneca remuneration committee to think again given this will surely damage the company’s reputation at a time when we should be focused solely on its achievements.” The pay vote comes at a sensitive time, as AstraZeneca has faced a barrage of criticism over its coronavirus vaccine after supply shortages and, in rare cases, a potential link to blood clots. It has, however, pledged to supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic, and lost money making it in the first quarter of the year. Soriot has been paid more than £15m in each of the last two years, after overseeing a turnaround as he rebuilt AstraZeneca’s drug portfolio. The firm has faced down several shareholder pay revolts over the years. AstraZeneca pointed out that the pension contributions of Soriot and other executives would be cut to the same level of the wider workforce, at 11% of base pay, under the new policy. A spokesperson said: “We link the remuneration of our executives to successful delivery of our strategy and shareholder returns. Since their appointment, our executive directors have driven a remarkable turnaround in the company’s performance. This has resulted in AstraZeneca delivering a total shareholder return of close to 300% over the last eight years, significantly ahead of our global pharmaceutical and FTSE 100 peers.” Prof Sarah Gilbert, the scientist who led the team that created the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, could receive more than £20m from her 5.2% stake in a biotech firm she co-founded, which is preparing to float on the stock market in the US. Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of the Covid vaccine maker Moderna, is now worth close to $5bn as a result of his 8% stake in the biotech firm, after the shares soared more than 500% over the past year. • This article was amended on 6 May 2021 to add a quote from Neville White.

2021-05-12T06:00:38Z,HSBC has stakes in firms that plan more than 70 new coal plants,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/12/hsbc-has-stakes-in-firms-that-plan-more-than-70-new-coal-plants,"A loophole in HSBC’s pledge to phase out financing for coal by 2040 will allow the bank to support companies with plans to build more than 70 new coal plants, which could cause an estimated 18,700 deaths from air pollution a year, according to a report. The bank’s asset management arm, which is not included in the coal phase-out pledge, holds ownership stakes in companies that plan to build 73 coal power plants across 11 countries in Africa and Asia, almost enough to supply fossil fuel electricity to all the UK’s homes three times over. Once running, these plants would emit more air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter than all the coal-fired power plants in the EU and the UK combined in 2019, according to a report from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea). The report found that the air pollution impact of these coal plants could also lead to an estimated 29,000 emergency hospital visits due to asthma, 25,000 preterm births and 14 million days of work absence every year at a total annual cost of $6.2bn. Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at Crea, said HSBC’s investments are “perpetuating dependence on the dirtiest form of power generation in countries that are already among the most polluted in the world”. The coal plants are expected to be built in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Madagascar, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea and Vietnam. “The tens of thousands of cases of death and disease that would result from HSBC-linked coal power plants underline the urgency of shifting investments to clean energy to protect public health and the global climate,” Myllyvirta said. HSBC bowed to investor pressure over its support for fossil fuels earlier this year by vowing to phase out its financing of coal-fired power and coal mining by 2030 in developed economies, and by 2040 elsewhere in the world. However, the pledge will not extend to HSBC’s $612bn asset management arm, which is expected to continue investing in companies with plans to build coal power plants in developing countries. An HSBC spokesperson said the asset management arm, which often invests based on index-linked funds that include fossil fuel companies, does not invest directly in coal-fired power plants or coal mining-related infrastructure. “In line with our commitment to the Paris agreement, HSBC Global Asset Management has a policy on responsible investment. We prioritise high carbon sectors for early engagement and action to improve governance, targets, and disclosure of climate risk,” the spokesperson added. The scale of HSBC’s ongoing investment in coal through its asset management division was first revealed by Market Forces in a report earlier this year. Adam McGibbon, a lead campaigner at Market Forces, said although HSBC’s plans to keep investing in companies were understood, the “devastating human cost of these plants” was revealed in Crea’s report. “Coal plants mean death and HSBC, as an investor in these companies, are complicit. HSBC’s investments in such a huge number of new coal plant-building companies makes a mockery of their claim to support the Paris agreement. Ahead of their AGM and Cop26, HSBC must announce plans to phase out their ownership stakes in coal companies,” he said. HSBC will propose a special resolution on climate change at its AGM later this month, which will set out the next phase of the bank’s strategy to support its customers on the transition to net zero carbon emissions, including its pledge to phase out coal financing. The bank set out plans in October to reduce emissions in its operations and supply chain to net zero by 2030, and to align the bank’s financed emissions at a portfolio level to net zero by 2050 or sooner.",World news,World news
2021-11-04T10:00:32Z,The dark secrets behind big oil’s climate pledges ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/dark-secrets-big-oil-climate-pledges-greenwashing,"JPMorgan Chase won glowing headlines last year when the global investment bank unveiled a commitment to counter the climate crisis. The press amplified JPMorgan’s message – sometimes in JPMorgan’s own words. Fortune published a commentary article trumpeting the bank’s plans to “tackle climate change”. Six paragraphs into the piece, the writers noted they worked for the investment firm. (They were actually its top executives.) The bank waited months to detail its plans. In May, it finally outlined its goals: JPMorgan would not pressure oil companies to lower their emissions. Instead, the firm would encourage them to become more efficient. They would focus on their “carbon intensity”. That metric has become a favorite of banks, oil companies and other big businesses. They’ve balked at requirements to cut overall climate pollution. But “carbon intensity” pledges have given companies a framework to keep investing in dirty fuels, while also expanding into pollution-capturing technology and cleaner energy. “They love the metric,” said Jeanne Martin, senior manager of banking standards at ShareAction, a non-profit focused on responsible investment. “They have committed to reducing intensity and financing to the oil and gas sector. But that doesn’t ultimately mean they will reduce oil and gas activities. It may actually increase at a faster rate.” Such “greenwashing”, experts say, allows companies to downplay the scale of the climate crisis – and continue contributing to the problem. “It’s the next five or 10 years that will determine our collective futures,” said Andrew Logan, oil and gas director at Ceres, the non-profit that advocates for corporate sustainability. “It’s probably safe to say that there is no company – certainly in the financial sector, or heavy-emitting sectors – that has a fully defensible plan when it comes to meeting the scale and scope of the urgency of the climate challenge.” World leaders are starting to find the gap between corporate rhetoric and action too glaring to ignore. Historically, oil and gas companies have been top sponsors at international climate meetings, hosting events and prominently displaying advertisements with their climate goals. That is beginning to shift. The UK, host of this week’s landmark climate summit in Glasgow, will limit participation by companies unless they have a “credible short-term action plan” to ratchet down emissions. But in the run-up to this year’s negotiations, oil companies are blitzing social media with advertisements about their climate pledges. In a Facebook ad campaign launched this month, ExxonMobil promises to cut pollution from drilling. It plans to do that by reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon over the short term. That will lower the “methane intensity” of its operations – but it ignores the emissions from customers burning the fuel itself. “The fossil fuel companies feel the heat and feel the pressure to do something about this, if they want to remain the main provider of energy,” said Yamide Dagnet, the director of climate negotiations at World Resources Institute. Royal Dutch Shell announced last week it will cut its absolute carbon emissions in half by 2030. But the commitment pertains only to the company’s internal climate footprint, not the much larger share of emissions that occur when its fuels are burned for energy. The timing of the announcement is also notable, as it comes on the heels of a Dutch court ruling earlier this year that Shell must slash its emissions 45% by 2030. Most other fossil fuel companies – and the banks that finance them – continue to find alternatives to promising outright emissions reductions. A net zero goal signals a company aims to offset its emissions by adding cleaner energy projects to their portfolios, or attempting to capture carbon dioxide and stop it from entering the air. But these goals can be so narrow as to be meaningless. Beau O’Sullivan, senior communications campaigner at the global social activist group Sunrise Project*, said fossil fuel companies were “inoculating themselves from bank and shareholder pressure by making these net zero commitments”. BP has the most aggressive decarbonization plans in the sector, according to an analysis by the global energy research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie. The company aims to be net zero for its operations and upstream production by 2050 and to halve its carbon intensity by then. It has slashed its budget for oil exploration, and it’s the only oil giant that has promised to cut production over the next decade. But the devil is in the details – or the lack thereof. BP declined to comment on why it has excluded a large portion of its emissions in its net zero commitment, choosing not to calculate emissions from its more than 20% stake in the Russian company Rosneft. Rosneft explores for oil and gas in some of the most remote regions, including in ecologically vulnerable Siberia and the Arctic. The company’s lobbying also conflicts with its climate message. In 2020, BP left three associations because of their climate positions. But it is still a member of the American Petroleum Institute, which has lobbied against electric vehicle tax breaks, methane regulations and drilling restrictions in the Arctic. BP in a March 2021 report said it is working with API and other associations to move “on important issues such as support for the Paris Agreement, regulation of methane, carbon pricing and the role of climate science”. These greenwashing campaigns benefit more than just the oil companies. Banks are increasingly under pressure to drop their financing of fossil fuels. To defend their continued investments, they’re pointing at oil companies’ climate pledges. “We’re now at a point where the very largest investors in the world, the investors who are the biggest shareholders in high-emitting companies, see climate change as a real threat to the financial health of whole sectors,” said Miguel Jaller, the vice-chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis. Jaller was the lead author on a white paper that found intensity targets can play a role in emissions reductions, but aren’t a one-size-fits-all tool. “Ultimately, climate change is an absolute problem that requires absolute reductions in emissions,” Jaller said. Banks have begun to commit to shrink the carbon footprint of their own operations, including from powering their office buildings. But their biggest contributions to global heating are in the oil and gas companies they finance. Few have weaved in climate commitments with their financing strategies, although they are beginning to now. The world’s 60 largest banks financed nearly $4tn in fossil fuel projects between 2016 and 2020, according to a March report from a coalition of climate organizations including the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Sierra Club, BankTrack and more. That total includes lending, equity issuance and debt underwriting. JPMorgan is the largest financier of oil and gas projects in the world, according to the report. The US-based bank poured $51bn into the sector just in 2020. JPMorgan announced in May of this year that it would revise its lending portfolio to be more sustainable. “We are the first large US bank to lay out concrete targets that help meet the goals of Paris – climate change is a critical issue and we want to be part of the solution, advancing sustainable and inclusive growth,” a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement. But JP Morgan’s benchmark is built around carbon intensity. The bank could finance more drilling without breaking its pledge. The bank wants oil and gas companies to cut their operations emissions intensity 35%. It’s asking for much less from their oil and gas products – like natural gas for electricity and oil that is turned into gasoline for vehicles. For those, the bank wants a 15% reduction in intensity by 2030. JPMorgan has said it will “work with clients to address end-use emissions, including by shifting to lower-carbon fuels and exploring other business diversification strategies.” The main lower-carbon fuel is natural gas. If a fossil fuel company increases natural gas production enough, it could offset its emissions progress. It could keep its intensity metric lower while still increasing its overall emissions. “They really took a page out of the oil industry book, when it comes to talking about their goals,” said Jackie Fielder, digital and communications coordinator at Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition committed to ending the financing of fossil fuel companies. “They talked in terms of carbon intensity. So that’s completely compatible with increased emissions.” On the ground, JP Morgan’s financing has powered some of the most controversial fossil fuel projects. It funded TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink, a fracked-gas pipeline that in 2020 leaked in Wet’suwet’en Territory. It also financed Cheniere’s Corpus Christi natural gas export facility, as well as Enbridge, which is building the Line 3 pipeline. A JP Morgan spokesperson said the bank focuses on helping clients “transition to the low-carbon world”, and supports climate policies like a carbon tax. But, the spokesperson added, the bank believes the world still needs oil and gas. “The solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels,” the bank’s spokesperson said. *Sunrise Project is a Floodlight supporter.",Oil and gas companies; Climate crisis; Fossil fuels; Business; Energy industry; Environment,Environment
2021-05-18T12:30:07Z,Morrison government to fund $600m gas-fired power plant in NSW Hunter region,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/18/morrison-government-to-fund-600m-gas-fired-power-plant-in-nsw-hunter-region,"The Morrison government has confirmed it will spend up to $600m to build a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley despite experts warning the fossil fuel investment makes little commercial sense. The government announced on Tuesday night it was dedicating unallocated funding in last week’s budget to the publicly owned Snowy Hydro Ltd plan to build a 660 megawatt gas plant at Kurri Kurri. It follows Scott Morrison warning last September that taxpayers would step in if the private sector did not commit to building at least 1,000MW to replace the Liddell coal-fired generator in 2023. EnergyAustralia announced last week it would build the 316MW Tallawarra B gas-hydrogen plant with $83m in state and federal support. An environment impact statement (EIS) lodged with the NSW government shows the Kurri Kurri plant would be rarely used. It is expected to run at just 2% of its full capacity across the year, filling gaps at times of peak demand. It would be expected to be powered initially by diesel – an even more expensive and polluting fuel – before receiving its gas supply. In a statement, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the two new plants were part of the government’s “gas-fired recovery” from the coronavirus and were needed to avoid “unacceptable price increases” when Liddell closed. He said 600 jobs would be created at the peak of Kurri Kurri’s construction. The EIS suggested there would be 250 construction jobs and about 10 positions during operation. “Cheap power is crucial to ensuring families, businesses and job-creating industries in NSW can thrive, which is why we are committed to replacing the energy generated by Liddell to keep prices down,” Taylor said. The announcement has been mooted for months, and confirmed four days before a state byelection in the Upper Hunter. Energy experts and government advisers dispute whether additional generation is needed to replace Liddell, and say there are cheaper and emissions-free alternatives to gas generation that can provide the “dispatchable” power needed to support variable solar and wind energy. The chair of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, told Guardian Australia gas was “expensive power”, and said a taxpayer-funded gas plant made little commercial sense given the abundance of cheaper options flooding the market. A taskforce advising governments about the impact of the Liddell closure did not find an additional 1,000MW would be needed from a grid reliability standpoint, and listed a range of committed and probable projects that it found would be “more than sufficient”. Taylor said it was “a responsible investment”, with strong returns expected. The government points to evidence from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) that found between 6 and 19 gigawatts of new dispatchable generation would be needed over the next 20 years. Aemo found that generation could come from a range of sources including batteries, pumped hydro and demand management. It said new gas “peaking” plants (such as Kurri Kurri and Tallawarra B) were also an option, but were likely to be more expensive. Climate scientists have objected to the government’s support for new gas-fired power at a time when rapid cuts are needed. Gas power is sometimes described as having half the emissions of coal, but studies have suggested this is an underestimate. Supporters of gas power have said it will rarely be used and can help smooth the system as coal is increasingly replaced by solar and wind, but some argue investments in it should be left to the private sector. Tony Wood, energy program director with the Grattan Institute, said the Kurri Kurri plant was “just not necessary”. “It’s not necessary for prices, it’s not necessary for reliability and it’s not necessary to bring down emissions,” he said. The announcement coincided with the International Energy Agency warning in a major report that development of new oil and gas fields and coal-fired power plants needed to stop this year if the world was to stay within safe limits of global heating. Taylor’s statement emphasised the government’s other support for gas in the budget, including $30m for early work on a Port Kembla generator proposed by the billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, and $24.9m to support new gas generators including Tallawarra B to be hydrogen-ready. The Kurri Kurri site was previously an aluminium smelter. It was bought by Hunter Valley property developers Jeff McCloy and John Stevens in 2020, with a plan to transform the area into industrial estates, a business park and a new suburb called Loxford Waters. Officials from the federal Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources were asked by the Labor senator Jenny McAllister whether they were “aware that the prospective owner of [the Kurri Kurri] site” – Jeff McCloy of McCloy Group – “was a major Liberal party donor”. The secretary of the department, David Fredericks, said he was unaware of that, and it was “a matter for Snowy Hydro”.",Energy; Australian politics; Australia news; Scott Morrison; Gas; Energy; Environment,Australia news
2021-06-12T14:04:20Z,G7 backs Biden infrastructure plan to rival China’s belt and road initiative,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/12/g7-global-infrastructure-plan-to-rival-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative,"The G7 group of rich nations has agreed plans to set up an alternative to China’s belt and road initiative as part of a broad push back against Beijing covering human rights, supply chains, support for Taiwan and demands to reveal more about the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some G7 leaders, however, including the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, the current chair of the G20, have urged Joe Biden not to push competition with China to the extent that it prevents cooperation on other vital issues such as the climate crisis. The EU is also pressing the US to back a legally binding code of conduct for the South China Sea that Beijing has been negotiating with regional powers. Draghi, an Atlantacist, has shifted Italy away from the near pro-China policies of the previous Italian government led by the Five Star Movement, but argues that the G7 has a balancing act to pull off in challenging and cooperating with Beijing. Germany, often cautious about confronting China, has been reluctant to specify the monetary value of any infrastructure fund, and France has emphasised a reallocation of rich countries’ special drawing rights, foreign exchange reserve assets maintained by the IMF, towards poorest countries as a means of easing liquidity. US officials said Biden was pushing the other G7 leaders for “concrete action on forced labour” in China and to include criticism of Beijing in their final communique. Japan also said it was backing a mention of Taiwan in the final statement. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke to his Chinese opposite number, Yang Jiechi, from Cornwall on Friday to urge him to release more details about whether Covid-19 leaked from a Wuhan laboratory, a once-dismissed theory now gaining currency. Yang told Blinken the laboratory theory was absurd, according to the state-run China Global Television Network, and that “genuine multilateralism is not pseudo-multilateralism based on the interests of small circles”. Small-circle diplomacy is a caustic reference to the fact that the proportion of GDP generated by G7 states has declined. Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the UK, the summit’s host nation, is however widening that circle by inviting the leaders of the chief democracies in Asia and the Pacific region – India, Australia and South Korea – to come to the talks in Cornwall this weekend. Biden, in an effort to keep G7 allies on board with his tough China strategy and to create new diplomatic alliances in Africa, is also trying to inject credibility into plans for a western alternative to China’s belt and road initiative, an infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping involving development, port, road, rail and digital schemes from Asia through Africa to Europe. More than 100 countries have signed up to schemes with China. “This is not just about confronting or taking on China,” a US official said. “But until now we haven’t offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.” The officials said the Build Back Better World(B3W) would be “an ambitious new global infrastructure initiative with our G7 partners” that would not only be an alternative to [China’s belt and road initiative. The plan would involve raising hundreds of billions in public and private money to help close a $40tn infrastructure gap in needy countries by 2035, the official said. The Chinese schemes have been criticised, often on contested evidence, for tying up developing countries in crippling debt that leaves them politically beholden to China. Some academics say there are isolated examples of debt enchainment, but the secrecy surrounding many of the contracts makes it hard to judge. According to a Refinitiv database, more than 2,600 projects with a value of $3.7tn were linked to the initiative as of the middle of last year, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden raised the idea of reviving a Trump-era plan for democratic countries to develop their own rival scheme with Johnson in March. In discussions at the G7, Biden also pressed other leaders to make clear that they believe forced labour was an affront to human dignity and “an egregious example of China’s unfair economic competition” to show that they were serious about defending human rights. “We’re pushing on being specific on areas like Xinjiang where forced labour is taking place and where we have to express our values as a G7,” the US official said of the final communique to be issued at the end of the summit on Sunday. It is not clear if the wording will be tougher than the G7 foreign ministers’ statement in May that said: “We agree the importance of tackling instances of forced labour through our own available domestic means, including through raising awareness and providing advice and support for our business communities. We strongly support independent and unfettered access to Xinjiang to investigate the situation on the ground.” The communique also implicitly recognised Taiwan’s independence by calling for it to attend the World Health Organization and World Trade Organization. James Crabtree from the Singapore-based IISS thinktank praised the timing and principle of the G7 infrastructure scheme, but was sceptical about implementation because of the lack of specifics, including money and the fact that the Trump administration had launched similar schemes to no effect. Launching half-baked schemes can do more harm than good, he suggested. The US recently relaunched the Blue Dot Network initiative, a way of branding existing private sector infrastructure schemes as environmentally friendly and socially responsible investment. But the Biden team with its Asia tsar, Kurt Campbell, claims greater administrative coherence and a willingness to cooperate with the EU and UK to put a more credible scheme together. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, recently said the bloc’s development assistance between 2013 and 2018 stood at €414bn in grants, adding that this was broadly comparable with what China offered with its belt and road initiative mainly via loans.",G7; Belt and road initiative; China; European Union; World news; Asia Pacific; Joe Biden; Boris Johnson,World news
2021-06-26T15:00:02Z,Investors turn ire on firms whose executives are set to cash in,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/26/investors-turn-ire-on-firms-whose-executives-are-set-to-cash-in,"Some of Britain’s best- paid company bosses are behaving as if the pandemic never happened. Bonuses secured in 2019, and paused last year as firms sought government support, are returning in 2021. But there are signs of a hardening of the shareholder stance on high executive pay. Companies from Cineworld to Morrisons have faced investor ire over their remuneration policies this year. Latest in the firing line is JD Sports, which paid executive chairman Peter Cowgill almost £6m in bonuses in the 12 months to February 2020. Major shareholder groups are preparing to vote against the pay deal at Thursday’s annual general meeting – the company’s refusal to refund £86m of government furlough cash being a particular irritant. Investors and campaigners are battle-hardened after fights with AstraZeneca, online clothing retailer Boohoo and estate agencies Foxtons and Savills. Foxtons paid its chief executive a £1m bonus despite taking £7m from the government to support staff on furlough. In April 44% of its shareholders voted against the pay deal. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot saw a 40% vote against a deal that could hand him pay and perks of nearly £18m for 2021. Under corporate governance rules a shareholder vote on executive pay – such as the one Cowgill faces this week – is advisory. Only a vote on the overall pay policy, which must be held at least every three years, is binding. Catalist Partners, an activist investor that holds a 2% stake in Foxtons, said in April: “Today’s vote must serve as a wake-up call for the board.” Glass Lewis, one of the world’s most influential investor advisory services, has recommended that shareholders vote against what it called an “inappropriate pay policy” at JD Sports. Both Foxtons and AstraZeneca ignored the shareholders; JD Sports is expected to press ahead with Cowgill’s reward should he also face a similar negative vote. Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, says shareholder activism generates headlines, but has achieved little in practice. “There is a risk of overstating the extent of shareholder opposition to indulgent top pay awards. Only three pay awards have actually been voted down so far in 2021, and these are only advisory votes, so the chief executives will still be getting the money.” At supermarket chain Morrisons only 30% of the vote went in favour of its boardroom pay earlier this month. Chief executive David Potts and his two most senior managers will receive £9m in pay and bonuses, after the remuneration committee used its “discretion” and adjusted its calculations to ignore Covid-19 costs of £290m. In April, more than 60% of shareholders in Informa, the world’s biggest events group, voted against the pay packages of chief executive Stephen Carter and chief financial officer Gareth Wright. In May Rio Tinto’s shareholders voted by 61% against the miner’s remuneration policy, which handed £7.2m to disgraced former chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques for last year, a 20% rise on his total pay the year before. Jacques stepped down after the destruction of sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelters in Western Australia. The non-binding vote was ignored by the board. Much of the pay debate centres on the makeup of remuneration committees, which are a mix of non-executive directors and consultants, often from the major accountancy firms. Some argue that pay for senior executives needs to be attractive in a competitive world, and that awards are as much about sending a signal to prospective candidates as they are a reward for current bosses. But chief executives know they have a short shelf life – about six and a half years for male bosses, just over three for women – and push for higher rewards as compensation. Remuneration committees must also choose which businesses to use as a benchmark. If private equity firms are introduced into the equation, the sky is almost the limit. One of the private equity firms that owns a slice of Morrisons, for instance, has a very generous pay regime. Silchester International Investors operates from offices in London’s Mayfair. Its partners shared a £110m payout last year, according to its latest accounts. Silchester owns 15% of Morrisons and is expected to back a buyout of the supermarket at the right price. Labour and the TUC want to inject a degree of realism into pay awards by giving workers a place on remuneration committees. But investor groups insist they are having an impact, despite the high-profile cases where votes are ignored. Legal &amp; General Asset Management is one of the UK’s largest investors and owns a slice of most large companies. It says 447 companies asked it for advice last year on corporate governance, including pay. Senior manager Angeli Benham said: “We believe UK companies have done the right thing in taking account of the wider stakeholder experience when determining executive pay. While the impact of the pandemic continues to affect companies and stakeholders, we would like companies to continue to show restraint.” Benham is campaigning for companies to pay the living wage and offer minimum hours, as it is in shareholders’ long-term interests that staff are not on the breadline. This chimes with the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, which state that income inequality can “negatively impact institutional investors’ portfolios”, as well as damaging output, reducing growth and contributing to “populism and protectionism”. The Investment Association, which represents UK investment managers, sets executive pay guidelines and has made clear its opposition to bonuses when a business has shed staff or used government rescue funds. Andrew Ninian, its director of corporate governance, said: “Companies need to be mindful of the impact of the pandemic on their business and stakeholders, and treat executives as they do their wider workforce, perhaps now more than ever.” Hildyard of the High Pay Centre says the determination of some groups is undermined by the many who do little to curb executive pay: “We found that while 37% of FTSE 100 companies cut executive pay during the shutdown, only 13% cut the bonuses and long-term incentives that are the biggest component of executive pay awards. “Awards are made by serving or former business leaders who themselves have benefited from excessive top pay. Remuneration committees and wealthy investors are insufficiently sceptical of the need to lavish millions on company directors, or of the exaggerated importance of individual chief executives or difficulties finding replacements. “The process would greatly benefit from the presence of elected workers’ representatives on boards and remuneration committees – people who understand the company best, and could bring a bit of real-world perspective to deliberations.” • The sub-heading of this article was amended on 29 June 2021 to make it clear that some, but not all, of the firms mentioned in the article, drew on furlough money.",Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Morrisons; Management; Investing; JD Sports Fashion; Foxtons; AstraZeneca; Business; Savills; Rio Tinto; Informa; UK news,Business
2021-01-17T16:17:18Z,Church of England to step up pressure on firms to improve diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/17/church-of-england-to-step-up-pressure-on-firms-to-improve-diversity,"The Church of England’s investment arm is to warn companies that they must do more to protect biodiversity and increase the ethnic diversity of their senior teams or risk protest votes at upcoming shareholder meetings. The Church Commissioners, which manages the religious group’s £8.7bn fund, will start sending letters outlining their demands to some of the worst-offending companies in the fund’s investment portfolio by mid-February. The team is drawing up its benchmarks and the shortlist of companies – both public and private – that will be targeted in its new campaign. Bess Joffe, the Church Commissioners’ new head of responsible investment, said the fund would ratchet up the pressure by casting protest votes at annual shareholder meetings within months if companies fail to comply. We [want companies to] have respect for the planet and respect for the people – Bess Joffe “I think you’ll see some vote impact as early as 2021. But of course it’s not going to be taking companies off guard – we will be communicating our expectations in the next four to six weeks,” she told the Guardian. Some of the fund’s holdings, according to a list released last June, include Google’s parent firm, Alphabet, Royal Dutch Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Facebook, Tesco and AstraZeneca. That is on top of property investments including London’s Hyde Park Estate and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, near Newcastle. The body has previously voted against companies for poor climate change policies and all-male boards. Last year, it voted against members of the Prudential’s board over an “unacceptably low” number of female directors and put pressure on the energy giant Exxon over emissions disclosures. The new focus on biodiversity and ethnicity is part of a three-year ethical investment plan being crafted by Joffe’s team. “We thought about recasting the way we think about things into two broad themes, so we have respect for the planet and respect for people. And I think that fits really well with the Church’s overall mission,” she said. Joffe, a Canadian who joined from Lloyds Banking Group in August and previously held roles with Goldman Sachs and Hermes, said the shift to biodiversity was meant to encourage a holistic approach to the way companies take responsibility for protecting life on earth and enabling the planet to thrive. “Ethnic diversity has not been a priority in any real way for companies,” she said. “They have to play their part in improving the lives of people who have been disenfranchised and left behind and who are going to suffer [disproportionately] as a result of Covid.” The UK’s biggest fund manager, L&amp;G, has already committed to voting against all-white boards who fail to diversify their leadership teams by 2022. In February 2020, the Parker Review showed that only 178 or 6.8% of 2,625 director positions across the FTSE 350 index weren’t held by white people. Joffe and the Church Commissioners are expecting progress. “You want to be in a world where boards of directors, management teams and pipelines of talent look like the communities in which they exist,” she said.",Ethical business; Corporate governance; Anglicanism; Christianity; Investing; Business; UK news,Business
2021-09-25T13:00:43Z,‘I feel a bit rusty’: Has Covid killed our sex lives? ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/25/has-covid-killed-our-sex-lives,"This year was meant to be a replay of the roaring 20s, your hot girl or boy summer. We’d be hedonistic, bacchanalian and, above all, getting laid. All the pent-up energy of lockdowns, the only time it has ever been illegal for people from different households to have sex, would explode in one helluva bonkbuster summer. But has it panned out that way? Or has Covid ruined our sex lives? Have we really stopped having sex? Every decade since 1990, the UK has carried out a detailed National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal). In 2020-21 it was replaced by the smaller Natsal-Covid study, which painted a complicated picture: of those in cohabiting relationships, 78% saw a change in their sex life, usually for the worse. One in 10 reported sexual difficulties that started or worsened in lockdown. Even though 63% reported some sexual activity, 75% of those who did were in a cohabiting relationship. Times have inevitably been even leaner for couples who weren’t living together. As for people who weren’t in a relationship, the lockdown months were a catastrophe: only one in 30 women and one in 10 men had a new sexual partner. A rise in sexual activity can often be detected by a rise in STI rates, but these are hard to judge at present. Anecdotally, professionals have reported a jump. Will Nutland of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, who is co-founder of the not-for-profit Love Tank, which researches health inequalities, says: “All my clinical colleagues have noted STIs rising. There’s been a big increase in syphilis, particularly among straight women.” But the general feeling is that Covid-driven lack of STI services means these are mostly stored-up cases from 2020. In summary: just as summer failed to materialise, so did the love. Does long Covid kill your mojo? Short answer, probably. Robyn, 37, caught the virus last December, felt better in January, then found her symptoms coming back. “The main thing is dreadful fatigue and brain fog. I forgot my housemate’s name. I technically could go on a date, but I’ve barely enough energy to walk to the corner shop, let alone have sex.” And anyway, she adds: “I’ve got absolutely nothing to say for myself. My interests are napping and having baths. I’ve got no sparkling personality. Oh, and since December, I’ve had no sex drive at all.” But Eleanor Draeger, a sexual health and HIV doctor, counsels against too much extrapolation. “People with all sorts of physical disabilities have sex, and long Covid is a physical disability. They may not be having hanging-from-the-chandelier sex, but they can still have sex.” However, she agrees that if low libido is a symptom, it will be pretty decisive. How does fear of catching Covid affect our sex lives? It’s not unreasonable to try to avoid catching Covid. Rose, 27, lives in Edinburgh and works in responsible investment, so uses the phrase “risk budget” more than most of us. But she says “I don’t want to waste that budget on spending time with anyone other than my friends.” She doesn’t want to try getting off with friends: “You’d ruin a friendship at a time when it’s so hard to make new ones?” Has social distancing atrophied desire for intimacy? There’s a subtle but gigantic mental barrier to cross in going from two metres to zero millimetres apart. “People are not necessarily scared of Covid,” says Nutland. “They’ve just forgotten how to be close.” This doesn’t always have a sexual dimension – many people describe anxieties about everyday proximity and crowded spaces. “We’ve lost those social and sexual skills,” he adds, “though they’ll come back with a bit of time.” Have lockdowns shaken our body confidence? Nearly half of us – 48% – put on weight in lockdown, and 29% said they drank more. But that interacted with more nebulous feelings of pessimism and low self-esteem that come with too much time indoors. Jenny Keane, a sex educator who was running an online orgasm workshop when the pandemic broke out, says feedback she was getting “centred on low libido, lack of desire and low self-esteem, which are in a vicious circle.” So she tailored a course on “body confidence and sexual self-care”. Not everyone sank into despair about their bodies. Anya, 38, is frustrated by the fact that she is in decent shape but there’s no one to appreciate it. “I wouldn’t get on Love Island, but I want someone to bear witness to the fact that I’m reasonably attractive and look good naked.” Have we become obsessed with hygiene? Sanitised sex is a contradiction in terms. It isn’t reasonable or possible to be intimate with someone while maintaining germ barriers. After 18 months of trying to keep ourselves physically separate, it is quite hard to stop seeing closeness as a threat. Draeger has seen this play out vividly in her clinical work, to the point where an STI diagnosis that wouldn’t normally have caused a huge amount of angst has had a hugely damaging effect. “People have told me having an STI felt really stressful in the context of Covid,” she says. “They just felt that everything was unclean.” Phil Samba, 31, a researcher and campaigner who helps black gay men in particular access HIV and STI testing, says: “Suddenly the message was ‘Just wank.’ That really irritated me. That didn’t work during the HIV/Aids pandemic, and it wasn’t going to work now.” But it was still “very triggering” for people who lived through the HIV epidemic. Samba says: “People were dying of a mystery virus spread through interaction, and it put people back into that 1980s fear.” Are we all just happier staying at home now? Alan, 50, says: “I’ve got so used to pottering about my flat that I think, ‘Yeah, that’s my life now.’” Greg, 45, divorced with two children, ended a relationship at the start of lockdown partly because his kids, 10 and 12, were not happy about it. “Now I can’t even go to work without the dog going up the wall. Everybody’s got used to this cocooned, slightly selfish world. I’d struggle to bring anybody else into my life. I was supposed to be having a date tonight, but I don’t really fancy it. I feel a bit rusty.” Also, where is everyone? Dating apps, brutal at the best of times, are a bit quiet. Anya says: “When the pandemic started, I was 36. Now I’m 38. Part of me does worry that men are looking for women whose fertility isn’t going to be an issue.” And where do you meet people, if you’ve had enough of app dating? After-work drinks, bars and festivals have all either disappeared or are operating under new limits that squash flirting opportunities. Are cohabiting couples really having it the best? The problems in a cohabiting relationship are different, Keane says. “A woman might be a mother in the morning, a worker in the day, a mother again when she comes home, and a partner when the children go to bed.” In lockdown, we lost those boundaries and became everything in one room. Then there is stress, which can send you in one of two, really unhelpful, directions: “Either we become activated, so the kind of sex you want then is generally fast and easy,” says Keane. “Or we become disconnected, and have that sense of being further away from the person you’re in the room with.” Even before the pandemic, were we having much sex? In the US, research from 2018 found a distinct downward trend: millennials were having less sex than boomers did at their age, and Zoomers were having less than millennials. This doesn’t appear to be the whole story in the UK, unless we’re just slower to notice. Here, under-35s are drinking less and taking fewer drugs, but according to the most recent Natsal (2010-2012), they were having more of everything sex-wise: partners, experiments, encounters. Certainly, they are not very reliable narrators – one 21-year-old I spoke to had sex with two different people between agreeing to be interviewed and the actual interview, and that was a window of 24 hours. So I had to drop her, but I don’t think she minded. Why haven’t we gone back to normal now? The lifting of lockdown doesn’t mean intimacy returns. A lot of the practical barriers to sex, such as a house full of children – or, worse, adult children – and everyone working from home, are still up. Tom, 37, is in an open relationship with his same-sex partner of 20 years. “We’re intimate but we’re not really sexual,” he says. They both used to travel a lot for work, and had sex with other people when the other was out of the house. Since Covid, that’s harder. “It’s a bit awkward saying: ‘I’m just off out to get laid.’ Where we’re out of practice is the tacit understanding: “Oh, you had a shower and went out for two hours.’ It feels as if I’m doing something dishonest.” Sex is about connection, and the pandemic has been about disconnection – physical and emotional: at some time or another, we’ve all been in fight-or-flight mode, which is about as disconnected as life gets. Keane believes there is a way back, if we understand better how our state of being affects our interest in sex. “Whatever the problem, everybody’s question is always: ‘Am I broken?’ When so many of us carry shame about bodily functions and confusion about sex, good quality, sex-positive education is key. You can change your entire relationship with yourself just by changing the understanding of your body. My answer is always the same. ‘No, you are not broken.’” Some names have been changed.

2021-02-20T08:00:27Z,‘Absolutely ridiculous’: top scientist slams UK government over coalmine,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/20/absolutely-ridiculous-top-scientist-slams-uk-government-over-coalmine,"One of the UK’s most eminent environmental scientists has called the government’s failure to block a new coalmine in Cumbria “absolutely ridiculous”. Prof Sir Robert Watson said the UK’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 to tackle the climate crisis was “wonderful”, but that there had to be a focus on immediate actions. The UK is hosting a UN climate summit, Cop26, in November and Boris Johnson has pledged to lead a green industrial revolution. “The British government says, ‘We’re going to lead Cop26 in Glasgow, we really care about climate change. But, by the way, we won’t override the council in Cumbria, and we’ll have a new coalmine.’ Absolutely ridiculous!” Watson said. “You get these wonderful statements by governments and then they have an action that goes completely against it.” Watson has led the UN’s scientific organisations for climate and biodiversity, is a former chief scientific adviser at the UK’s environment department and worked for Bill Clinton when he was US president. He has also held senior positions at Nasa and the World Bank. The underground mine would be the UK’s first in 30 years. Critics, including the government’s official climate advisers, say it seriously undermines Johnson’s ability to lead a successful UN summit, which is seen as vital in averting the worst impacts of global heating. Ministers have repeatedly said the decision on the mine is a local one. Supporters of the £165m mine say it would provide 500 jobs in an area which is among the most deprived in the country. On Thursday, 40 Conservative MPs wrote to the leader of Cumbria county council warning that stopping the mine would “represent a serious risk to Cumbria’s economic growth”. The council approved the mine in October and communities and the local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, chose not to “call in” the plan for a central government decision, which is allowed if a project conflicts with national policy. Amid growing controversy, the council said earlier in February that it would reconsider the decision to take into account climate advice published in December by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). Watson said decisions to stop carbon emissions were needed immediately: “We need action now. A lot of governments have said, ‘We’ll be zero carbon by 2050’. That’s wonderful [but] it’s 30 years away. The key message on climate is we need to have a 50% reduction of emissions by 2030. We’ve got to focus on short-term actions, not [just] long-term targets and goals.” Other leading scientists have criticised the mine. Prof James Hansen, who has been called the “godfather of climate change”, told Johnson his “actions and decisions now will either establish or undermine your claim to climate leadership”. Prof Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, said the mine “is a big mistake”. The mine would produce 2.7m tonnes a year of coking coal, which is used in steel-making rather than burned in power stations. About 85% of the coal from the mine is planned for export, although there is no shortage of such coal globally. The mine has planning permission to 2049 but the CCC has said “there may be no domestic use [for coking coal] after 2035”. Green experts say steelmakers will have to deploy new technology to reduce their emissions under the UK’s net zero targets and that green industries provide more secure jobs. Cumbria council has yet to set a date for its planning committee to meet and reconsider the mine application, but it is expected before council elections in May. It is thought locally that the council is unlikely to overturn the original backing for the mine, but Jenrick could yet call in the decision. Earlier in February, the website Responsible Investor revealed that EMR Capital, the firm financing the mine, is a signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, which requires “incorporating environmental, social, and governance issues into decision-making processes”. The UK has cut emissions faster than any other rich nation in recent decades by phasing out coal burning for electricity, as well as with the closure of much of the country’s heavy industry and importing more manufactured goods from overseas. But ministers are being criticised over a series of decisions that run counter to cutting emissions, including backing a gas-fired power station that would be the biggest in Europe, a third runway at Heathrow airport and committing £27bn to new roads, a policy now under legal challenge. It was also reported last week that one of Johnson’s flagship green policies, a £1.5bn green homes grant scheme, is likely to be scrapped having reached just 4% of the homes intended.",Coal; Climate crisis; Energy; Steel industry; Cop26; UK news; Environment; Fossil fuels,Environment
2021-01-29T19:00:49Z,Zali Steggall's climate bill gets broad backing from industry groups and investors,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/30/zali-steggalls-climate-bill-gets-broad-backing-from-industry-groups-and-investors,"The Morrison government was urged by major industry groups and investors to give popular draft climate change legislation from the independent MP Zali Steggall a chance at becoming law during a parliamentary inquiry. Major business representatives gave evidence alongside conservationists, scientists and health professionals that broadly backed the proposed laws, which would legislate a 2050 net zero emissions target for Australia. Widespread support continues to grow for Steggall’s bill, but will need backing from a reluctant government to allow it to be debated in parliament. Steggall’s bill would also set out a pathway to reach net zero and establish an independent climate change commission to oversee annual climate risk assessments. The UK government’s independent Climate Change Committee has also backed the bill in a submission to the inquiry, saying the bill set out a framework similar to its own 2008 Climate Change Act, which had helped “provide clear signals to investors, help build political consensus and navigate political challenges, and encourage an evidence-based approach to climate policy”. The Committee on the Environment and Energy is conducting an inquiry into the draft bill and held the first of two public hearings on Friday, with a second scheduled for Monday. Anna Freeman, a policy director at the Clean Energy Council representing Australia’s renewable energy industry, said the proposed laws “provide the prospect of us finally ending the climate policy impasse that’s afflicted Australia for the past decade”. Unlike more than 100 countries and many of Australia’s major trading partners, the Morrison government has refused to adopt a net zero emissions target by 2050 – saying only it wants to get there as quickly as possible. At the same time, the government has touted a “gas-led recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic. The Australian Industry Group’s climate and energy policy adviser, Tennant Reed, told the inquiry: “Were the parliament to pass this bill it would be a strong contribution, but not the last word, of the long task of building a successful Australian response to climate change.” Reed said there were other options open to the government to give businesses and investors more certainty, but Steggall’s bill – with some amendments – was “sensible and workable”. The Business Council of Australia – a group representing mining, retail, manufacturing, banking and energy bosses – has also formally backed Steggall’s legislation. Both the Planning Institute of Australia and the Property Council of Australia voiced strong backing for the bill during the inquiry, which Steggall said had received about 6,200 submissions. Simon O’Connor, the chief executive of the Responsible Investment Association Australasia, said policy uncertainty was risking a loss of billions of dollars in investment across multiple sectors. The association has 350 members, including superannuation funds and investment managers, which collectively manage about $9tn of assets globally. O’Connor said parliament should consider the bill, which was a “strong step” in creating the certainty for investors that would help unlock billions more in investment. Conservation groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and WWF-Australia, also voiced strong support for the bill. They recalled how climate heating was threatening Australia’s wildlife and habitats through fires, droughts, excess heat, coral bleaching and warming oceans. Prof Lesley Hughes, representing the Climate Council and the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, said it was a “no brainer” for Australia to take a lead on climate change action. She said: “The bill is absolutely essential for Australia to be in a leadership position, rather than be an international embarrassment.” Representatives for doctors and veterinarians that advocate for climate change action also supported the bill, saying livestock, wildlife and humans were already suffering from global heating. The committee chairman, Liberal National MP Ted O’Brien, questioned several speakers who had said Australian investment in renewables was being held back, and that Australia’s performance in cutting emissions was poor. He cited information provided by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources for the inquiry, which showed high levels of investment in renewables and emissions cuts on a per capita basis in Australia. During the hearing, Steggall and the Labor MP Josh Burns pushed officials from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources to say if work had been done to project when Australia’s emissions might reach net zero. Kushla Munro, an acting deputy secretary in the department, said work was “ongoing” and would form part of a long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy to be submitted to the United Nations’ climate convention ahead of the next major talks in Glasgow scheduled for November. Rob Sturgiss, a general manager in the department, was asked by the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman if it was practically possible to prepare a greenhouse gas emissions budget out to 2050. “I think it’s maybe sensible [to do],” Sturgiss responded. Steggall told the Guardian the chance of her bill being debated – and therefore a chance at becoming law – depended on the willingness of the Morrison government to listen to evidence coming from across industry, science and health. She said across many sectors, representatives wanted “a cohesive framework” of policies that would chart a path to net zero by 2050. “The prime minister has said he won’t let the international community pressure him” she said. “But I’d hope he would listen to the Australian community. Will he listen to anyone other than the fossil fuel industry? “Clearly there’s a strong appetite for this debate. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t force it to drink.” In a statement, a spokesman for the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said: “When it comes to net zero, we want to get there as soon as possible. It’s a question of ‘how’, not ‘what’. “But Ms Steggall’s bill is simply a plan for more process and more bureaucracy. It has nothing to offer on the ‘how’.”",Climate crisis; Australian politics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Australia news; Environment,Environment
2020-03-15T16:30:02Z,West Saharan group takes New Zealand superannuation fund to court over 'blood phosphate',https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/west-saharan-group-takes-new-zealand-superannuation-fund-to-court-over-blood-phosphate,"The Western Sahara liberation movement has taken New Zealand’s superannuation fund to the country’s highest court over its investments in farms that use phosphate illegally mined in the occupied territory. New Zealand is one of the few remaining countries – and last western nation – that accepts imports from the contested territory in West Africa, forcibly occupied by Morocco since 1975. Morocco’s claims to the territory are largely unrecognised internationally. The Polisario Front – the political arm of the Western Saharan independence movement – has lodged documents in the New Zealand high court saying the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, with $45bn under management, is exposed to unlawful practices through its investments in farms that use Western Saharan phosphate, and interests in companies operating in the occupied territory. Fertiliser companies Ravensdown and Ballance Agri-Nutrients in New Zealand are the only companies in the western world that import phosphate from Western Sahara, spread on New Zealand farms. The phosphate rock mined in Western Sahara has low levels of cadmium suitable for New Zealand soil conditions, although alternatives are available from other sources. In 2017, the Polisario Front won a South African court action, seizing a load of fertiliser in port in Port Elizabeth, ordered by Ballance Agri-Nutrients, and bound for New Zealand. The court ruled Morocco had no legal claim to the phosphate, and could not sell it to a third party. “The Sahrawi people are determined to protect their natural resources with all available means,” the Polisario Front’s representative of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to Australia and New Zealand, Kamal Fadel, said. “This legal action is a message to all who are involved in the exploitation of Sahrawi natural resources that they face legal action, reputational risks and investor withdrawal.” The movement’s claim to the high court said the NZ Super Fund’s involvement in Western Saharan phosphate trade was inconsistent with statutory obligations to manage and administer the fund in a manner “consistent with avoiding prejudice to New Zealand’s reputation as a responsible member of the world community”. Fadel said the court action was determined to stop the extraction of Western Saharan resources and said the NZ Super Fund must “put an end to their illegal involvement in the exploitation of the natural resources of our country”. “New Zealand companies have plundered our phosphate for decades. The blood phosphate illegal trade must end.” A spokesman for the Guardians of the NZ Super Fund said the fund was invested in several farms that used Western Sahara-sourced phosphate, and had a limited equity exposure through passive index funds to international companies that operated in the territory. He said the allegations made by the Polisario Front about the fund’s investments were not accepted by the fund. “We take our obligations as a responsible investor very seriously. These obligations are integrated into the Guardians’ investment activities through its responsible investment framework. “The Guardians believes it has appropriately applied its responsible investment framework in a manner that meets its legislative obligations to manage the fund in a manner consistent with best practice portfolio management and avoiding prejudice to New Zealand’s reputation as a responsible member of the world community. The spokesman said NZ Super Fund’s position was supported by independent third party assessments including the UN. “The framework and the Guardians’ wider work programme are closely aligned to the United Nations-backed principles for responsible investment, which graded the Guardians’ activities as A or A+ in its annual assessment of governance and strategy for responsible investment.” Internal NZ Super Fund documents reveal the issue of Western Sahara has concerned fund investment managers for years. “New Zealand Super Fund says we need to understand alternatives to Western Sahara phosphate rock,” a 2019 internal briefing document, revealed under the official information act, argues. “[The] ministry of foreign affairs and trade says there are alternative sources. New Zealand only started getting phosphate from the Western Sahara in the 1980s.” The document also says New Zealand Super Fund is directly exposed because it owns 25 farms. “New Zealand Super Funds’ farms are continuing to be supplied by Ballance. NZSF has, however, asked its farm manager FarmRight and Ballance to explore whether or not, going forward, there are commercially-feasible alternatives to obtaining phosphate from the Western Sahara.” Ballance Agri-Nutrients and Ravensdown are the only two members of the Fertiliser Association of NZ. They supply 98% of all fertiliser used in NZ. “The Fertiliser Association continues to believe that the local inhabitants of Western Sahara should benefit from the resources of their territory, and that any activities involving these resources should be undertaken in their best interests and for their benefit, however also consider that the United Nations is the most appropriate organisation to make judgements on situations like this,” the internal briefing document argues. Western Sahara is regarded by the United Nations as a “non-self-governing territory”, but international proposals for referenda and autonomy plans have failed to break the four-decade impasse. Since 2012, international funds, including the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, National Employment Savings Trust in the UK, the Netherlands’ APG, AP Funds in Sweden, and FDC (Luxembourg) have divested from companies that extract resources from Western Sahara for ethical reasons.",New Zealand; United Nations; Morocco; Asia Pacific; Africa; World news; Middle East and north Africa; Business,World news
2020-11-17T08:44:16Z,Fortescue regrets causing offence with threat of legal action during bid to destroy Aboriginal sites in Pilbara,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/17/fortescue-regrets-causing-offence-with-threat-of-legal-action-during-bid-to-destroy-aboriginal-sites-in-pilbara,"Mining giant Fortescue Metals Group has said it regrets the offence caused by a letter it sent threatening legal action if an application for permission to destroy Aboriginal heritage sites in the Pilbara was not progressed. Fortescue’s chief executive, Elizabeth Gaines, told a federal parliamentary inquiry the letter concerned “points of law” to be considered by a Western Australian government committee and “did not reflect Fortescue’s close consultative approach with Aboriginal people”. Western Australia’s Aboriginal Cultural Material Committee (ACMC) assesses section-18 applications to disturb or destroy Aboriginal sites and advises the state minister Ben Wyatt. In April, the ACMC received a letter from Green Legal on behalf of Fortescue, advising that it did not intend to comply with a request to consult the eastern Guruma traditional owners on the application. Fortescue told the ACMC that if a recommendation was not made to the minister “forthwith”, then it would compel the ACMC to make one – including by taking legal action. Fortescue’s letter described the eastern Guruma peoples’ concerns about minimising the impact on their sites as “irrelevant” to the progress of the application because traditional owners had “no entitlement” to protect the areas under Western Australian law. “That letter from an external legal adviser does not reflect Fortescue or our views or our conduct,” Gaines said on Tuesday. “If that letter did cause offence, I regret that.” Eastern Guruma said it was “bullying, dismissive, disrespectful behaviour inconsistent with their published values and the expected behaviours of an ASX top 10 company”. Gaines and Fortescue’s director of community, environment and government, Tim Langmead, appeared before the federal parliamentary inquiry into Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara in May. He said Fortescue had 121 section-18 permissions, with five pending approval by the minister. Some 29 have been “closed”, he said, meaning the purpose for which they were granted is complete. WA Greens senator Rachel Siewert asked if that meant the areas in question had been destroyed. Langmead replied that not all section-18 permissions ended in the destruction or salvage of cultural heritage. “There is an important distinction there,” he said. “The assumption that the existence of a section 18 is that all cultural heritage would be removed from the land is not accurate.” Gaines on Tuesday confirmed that Fortescue was withholding $1.9m in royalty payments from the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation (WGAC). WGAC previously told the inquiry their royalties were being withheld because they had been asking questions about Fortescue’s plan for nine leases in areas that contain numerous sacred sites. Fortescue had subsequently sought a meeting, via email, to discuss a “roadmap” for resolving the matter, WGAC said. “The so-called roadmap was not included in the email correspondence. The email did not say when or if the outstanding royalty payment would be made,” WGAC’s chairman, Glenn Camille, said. But Gaines told the inquiry on Tuesday that WGAC had failed to comply with a contractual obligation over a prolonged period and withholding the payment was the “first time in FMG history we have done this”. “We are working to facilitate the payment … as quickly as we can,” she said. Earlier on Tuesday, one of Australia’s biggest superannuation funds told the inquiry it wanted Rio Tinto to conduct an independent review of all the agreements it has with Aboriginal traditional owners in the Pilbara. Hesta said Rio Tinto’s conduct was indicative of “larger systemic issues” about how the mining industry negotiates with traditional owners which needed to be managed to provide certainty and consistency for investors. “Whilst we might make an assessment of a company by what we can see in their public commentary, the way they act is actually in those agreements,” Mary Delahunty, Hesta’s head of impact, said. “If those agreements in any way erode the rights of parties ... they probably shouldn’t be relied upon.” Hesta has $54bn worth of assets under management, $2bn of which is invested in the Australian mining sector on behalf of its 870,000 members. It currently has $244m worth of Rio Tinto shares. Hesta has a formal process for divestment which it may look at but “at this point, we’re still working across the mining resource sector to continue to exert the influence we believe can have a positive impact on the way this sector operate”, the fund’s senior responsible investment adviser, Claire Heaps, said. The explosion of Juukan gorge had been a “devastating blow” to Rio Tinto’s social licence, Heaps said. “What we need as investors is a clear plan from Rio on how they are going to rebuild that trust.” In May, the company blew up a 46,000-year-old significant site against the wishes of traditional owners to access higher-grade iron ore. The act triggered international condemnation and prompted a federal parliamentary inquiry. An interim report is expected in mid-December.",Indigenous Australians; Mining; Western Australia; Business,Australia news
2020-10-19T15:58:51Z,Interested in a green job? How do you measure a company’s credentials?,https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/interested-in-a-green-job-how-do-you-measure-a-companys-credentials,"When it comes to getting a job that leaves your conscience clear, a recommendation straight from a trusted source – a friend or contact at the company, for example – can’t be topped. But only the most avid networkers have fingers in so many pies. For the rest of us, ethical certifications, such as B Corporation, can help sort the genuinely responsible companies from the greenwashers. What is B Corporation? Certified B Corporations must meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. “It took six months for us to be fully certified,” says Emilie Vanpoperinghe, co-founder of Oddbox, a certified B Corporation that distributes boxes of surplus and odd-shaped vegetables directly to your door. “It started with a detailed questionnaire – more than 200 questions on governance, workers, community, environment and customers.” Have any companies I’ve heard of signed up? Well, there’s the Guardian, for starters. Also The Big Issue, the bamboo toilet paper evangelists Who Gives a Crap and the clothing company Patagonia. But it’s not just the usual suspects: construction companies, insurance companies and a clutch of the food giant Danone’s subsidiaries are on the roster too, as well as five Unilever companies. Certification isn’t so niche then? It’s becoming ever more mainstream. There are now more than 3,500 B Corporations worldwide, with about 400 in the UK – nearly 300 of which have signed up since the beginning of last year – and the movement has lofty ambitions: “We believe at a fairly fundamental level that business needs to be a force for good in the world,” says Chris Turner, executive director of B Lab UK, a non-profit organisation supporting the B Corporation movement. “Because of the current structure of our system, business has been largely responsible for the climate emergency, social challenges and inequity. We want to fix that.” How can B Corporations help fix the planet? First comes the assessment, then the legal “mission lock” – what Turner calls the movement’s “special sauce”. In the UK, that’s a legal change to a company’s articles of association, so they “reflect the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit”. In other words, making money isn’t a B Corporation’s only goal. How will the shareholders react to this? It’s a little too early to tell. Any listed company would need to ask its shareholders to forgo their right to profit at all costs, so there’s a little education needed there about having a longer-term view. But Lisa Stonestreet, head of communications and charity impact at the Eiris Foundation – a registered charity working to increase the positive impact of responsible investment – believes the momentum is there. “More and more, people are looking around and saying: ‘If our investment decisions are having a negative impact on the environment and on society, what kind of world will I be retiring into?’” Are there any listed B Corporations? There are a few – the Brazilian cosmetics company Natura, which owns The Body Shop and employs more than 2 million people, for one. “They’ve had that difficult conversation with their shareholders,” says Turner. “We’re also talking to a lot of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies about certification. It’s one of those things: who’s going to be the first? We hope after that the floodgates will open.” He also has an ace up his sleeve: “We’re pushing hard for the mandatory legal change B Corporations make to be an amendment to the Companies Act, so that the people, planet and profit triple bottom line applies to every business in the UK by default.” So is it all about getting the badge? Not necessarily. For every company that goes through the full assessment in the UK, there are about 25 using the tool simply to measure their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, says Turner. Companies that might not previously have engaged with the subject are now taking it seriously. “Some people are scathing whenever a large corporation starts talking about sustainability or stewardship,” says Stonestreet. “But these companies need to know they can have constructive conversations about this if they’re to adjust.” Does that mean all companies are thinking about these issues? Maybe not all. Clare Reilly, head of corporate development at PensionBee, says that despite Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg forcing us to ask ourselves questions, the pensions world is slow to change. “Your pension is probably still invested in oil. Maybe tobacco too.” So we’re not quite there yet? Not yet – but we’re making good progress. Let’s just say this radical and necessary transformation of corporate behaviour is a work-in-progress, but with 72% of people wanting businesses to have a legal responsibility to people and the planet, according to a B Labs poll in May, now is the time for change.

2020-08-05T17:30:08Z,Experts call for independent body to oversee new standard to prevent dam collapses at mines,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/06/experts-call-for-independent-body-to-oversee-new-standard-to-prevent-dam-collapses-at-mines,"The chairman of the group behind a new standard designed to reduce the chance of deadly dam collapses on mine sites says an independent body should oversee the benchmark, rather than industry as mining companies would prefer. Bruno Oberle, an environment professor at L’Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, agreed to chair an international review of tailings dams in April 2019 that was set up after a dam at the Córrego do Feijão mine in Brumadinho, Brazil killed 270 people. That disaster followed other tailings dam collapses including at the Samarco mine in Brazil, which was jointly owned by Australian company BHP and Brazil’s Vale, which killed 19 people and poisoned hundreds of kilometres of river, devastating the local economy. The new standards are designed to reduce the risk of further disasters by making mine operators properly plan to build and shut down dams, and have emergency plans in place for the local population if there is a breach. They also require companies to provide information about the dams, which collect waste slurry from mines, to a new central database and beef up their governance of the engineering process. In a paper designed to be circulated to the sponsors of the Global Tailings Review project – the United Nations Environment Programme, industry body the International Council of Mining and Metals, and the investor group the Principles for Responsible Investment – Oberle said he preferred an independent body to other options put forward to give the standards life. Reasons for creating an independent organisation included that it would “provide the standard with a certain autonomy from industry, reduce the risk (real or perceived) of industry capture and build trust and credibility with external stakeholders”, he said in the paper. He said this was a significant advantage over an industry-operated scheme or allowing companies to self-assess. Another key participant in the review, the Unesco professor of marine science at the University of Sydney, Elaine Baker, said she would also prefer an independent body to oversee the new standard. She said a model for independent oversight already existed in the gold industry, where a code on the use of cyanide to leach the precious metal out of ore is overseen by the Washington-based International Cyanide Management Institute. “The industry wants to continue to self-regulate,” she said. “They have been in a position of self-regulation all this time there’s been a history of catastrophic dam failures in countries where you would think mine governance was pretty good, including Australia,” she said. The review was also limited by not being allowed to ban certain types of dam construction or look at mines where slurry is pumped directly into a river, such as at the disaster-plagued Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea, or out to sea. However, she praised the mining industry for the compromises it had made in agreeing to the code. “ICMM is a very powerful group and they had to move a long way, so good on them. “I think the mining companies are genuinely worried about their social licence to operate.” The code also stops short of requiring miners to take out insurance against dam collapses, but Baker said this was because no such insurance product existed. She said it was important that the standard included disclosure of how much it would cost to take a dam down once mining was over. “The business plans of these companies are often really flawed because they often don’t take account of these externalities,” she said. As part of the code, mining companies will be required to contribute detailed information to a worldwide database of tailings dams, which Baker has helped set up. She said companies she asked for information about their dams had been surprised to find they did not have the information readily available.",Business; Mining; Australia news; BHP; Brazil,Australia news
2020-10-19T15:56:27Z,Green jobs for graduates: what should you study and how can you reskill?,https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/green-jobs-for-graduates-what-should-you-study-and-how-can-you-reskill,"Leah Bennett has always wanted to make a difference. The 23-year-old graduate from Preston has volunteered to clean up beaches, investigated the politics behind the Amazon forest fires, researched alternatives to plastic packaging and given up her time to edit a digital magazine for the environmental organisation Louder Than The Storm. Jobs with purpose wanted Bennett isn’t alone in looking for graduate opportunities in the environmental sector. A 2018 survey from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy found that almost two-thirds (60%) of 18-24 year olds were interested in pursuing a career in the green economy. Even in other industries, this generation of young jobseekers wants to work for organisations that takes sustainability seriously. The graduate recruitment app Debut found that 89% of female and 80% of male students and graduates say they want to work for an organisation with a strong environmental policy. Increasingly, those credentials are being highlighted in job ads, even if the role itself would not be considered “green”. “It’s becoming a real differentiator for companies,” Kim Connor Streich, marketing director at Debut, says. “And there are an awful lot of opportunities outside of the traditional ‘green’ companies, or on graduate schemes, where you get an all-round understanding of what companies are doing, with the chance to specialise later.” The green boom The good news is that the green jobs market is growing fast. Renewable energy, electric vehicles (EV) and smart technologies are at the heart of the UK’s plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Worldwide, the Global Commission on the Future of Work expects 24m new jobs to be created by the green economy over the next 10 years. Graduates from Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects will be key in helping the UK achieve net-zero carbon emissions, says Jacqui Murray from Innovate UK, who leads the Faraday battery challenge for EVs. But part of her mission is also to encourage young people to appreciate the range of skills that will be needed in a green future. “Stem is always a labour of the heart,” she says. “It’s problem solving and it’s teamwork. It’s something everybody can contribute to. You may not be a world-leading scientist, but you may be someone who can fit the pieces together in a facility in Southampton. “The real power is in the cross-discipline nature of what we do. Stem skills are absolutely going to be at the heart of the green economy, but the ability to communicate and translate those ideas is really important [as well].” The benefit of a fresh pair of eyes Irfan Lohiya, the founder of Green Recruitment Solutions, says he’s seen an increase in demand for graduates in sectors such as waste recycling, water, renewable energy and green investment since he launched his business in 2013. “Organisations have realised that they need to source talent,” he says. “There is an ageing workforce right now in the sector.” A lot of the roles are technical, he adds, and engineering degrees are highly sought after. “Process engineering comes up a lot. Chemical engineering is good because it can be applied to water, waste management and energy process industries.” In the energy and sustainability consulting sector, Inspired Energy launched its first graduate scheme last September, hiring six candidates from a variety of academic backgrounds to spend two years across its different departments. It’s been so successful that the programme is being extended to 20 graduates this year. “[Graduates] are hungry and ready to get started. And we’ve enjoyed having fresh pairs of eyes,” says Matt Jones, commercial director for optimisation at the firm. “Seeing the enthusiasm light up in them when they latch on to this subject is brilliant.” Getting the right job for you Part of the challenge in finding the right role in the green economy is how broad the sector is, says Shannon Houde, a career and executive coach for the impact sector and author of Good Work: How to Build a Career that Makes a Difference in the World. “I break it down into five key categories: corporate responsibility and sustainability; social impact and international trade and development; sustainable finance and responsible investment; environmental (for example, renewable energy); and smart cities and food.” As well as looking to big brands, such as Unilever, Patagonia and Nike, there are opportunities in the public sector, non-governmental organisations, industry associations and consulting. “There are lots of SMEs worth looking at too, from sustainable fashion to vegan food companies,” she says. Future-proofing your career Graduates should emphasise skills such as building relationships, communication, project management, research, analysis and reporting, Houde says. It also pays to focus your attention on one or two impact issues, which you can talk about in an interview. That approach has worked for Bennett, who has secured three paid, part-time internships by highlighting the skills she does have. At the Centre for Global Eco-Innovation at Lancaster University, she’s now working as an environmental and sustainability researcher. “I told them: ‘I’m good at research, I can communicate information and I can make it accessible.’ These skills come in handy in so many ways.” In a challenging post-pandemic jobs market, aligning yourself with the green economy could be a shrewd move, Houde adds. “There’s going to be more and more growth in this space. It is definitely a way to future-proof [your career] way beyond your own personal values.” To search for all the latest green jobs visit Guardian Jobs",,Guardian green jobs

2018-09-28T06:00:49Z,Is Goldman Sachs’ new fund really just greenwashing stocks?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/28/is-goldman-sachs-new-fund-really-just-greenwashing-stocks,"When Goldman Sachs and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones announced a partnership three months ago to help socially conscious investors support “just business behavior”, they promised that their new index fund would generate solid returns for savers while directing their investment dollars towards truly humane companies. “Capitalism should be a positive force for change,” said Jones in a press release announcing the fund, which is designed to track an index of socially responsible companies identified by his non-profit Just Capital. “Its future will be driven by a new definition of corporate success that is aligned with the values and priorities of the public.” The partnership comes as pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors increasingly seek to put their financial weight behind ethical and sustainable corporate behavior. So far, the rebrand seems to be working: the Just fund debuted in June to rave reviews from the financial press and ended its first day of trading with over $250m in assets, making its launch one of the most successful in recent history. However, a Capital &amp; Main review of corporate documents shows that some of Just’s largest investments are in fossil fuel firms that have been sued for suppressing global climate research, Wall Street behemoths fined for defrauding investors, a social media platform accused of helping rig elections and a tech industry giant criticized for paying its workers starvation wages. Moreover, proxy voting records reveal that even as Goldman Sachs now markets itself as a champion of social responsibility, the firm has been using its existing stakes in many Just fund companies to help CEOs block key environmental and social justice reforms proposed by their shareholders. Those initiatives range from gender pay gap and diversity initiatives to corporate governance reforms; from efforts to increase lobbying transparency to prohibitions on doing business with companies tied to genocide and other human rights violations. Meanwhile, in the months before Just fund’s launch, Goldman was slammed for blocking a human rights resolution at its own company – and one of Goldman’s key lobbying groups in Washington was working to shape Republican legislation that would make it far more difficult for shareholders to file environmental, human rights and other socially minded initiatives in the future. “You shouldn’t be able to, with a straight face, invest in the Dakota Access Pipeline with your left hand, and with your right hand tell people that you’re doing responsible investing,” Lisa Lindsley, capital markets adviser for the shareholder advocacy group SumOfUs, told Capital &amp; Main. “The compartmentalization is very hypocritical.” Through a spokesperson, Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the process by which its equity funds vote on shareholder proposals, and how that process may differ with the Just fund – which, as a newly launched fund, has not yet participated in proxy voting for any of the companies in which it holds stock. ‘Ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach’ Goldman’s new fund spotlights socially responsible investing (SRI) – a financial strategy that represents Wall Street’s more affirmative answer to negative or exclusionary “screening” tactics like divestment from fossil fuel producers and tobacco firms. While a recent directive by the Trump administration has been viewed by some experts as an effort to limit SRI strategies, the market for such investments remains strong. According to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, US-based assets managed using SRI strategies more than doubled to $8.7tn between 2012 and 2016, and now account for more than one in five dollars under professional management in the country. The rise in SRI investment comes amid questions about whether corporate boards are adequately evaluating environmental and social justice concerns when they look at their company’s long-term financial prospects. PwC’s 2017 survey of corporate officials found “that directors are clearly out of step with investor priorities in some critical areas” and the report added that “one of these areas is environmental issues”. High-profile initiatives like the Just fund are a chance for the industry to tout its eagerness, as the Goldman Sachs executive Timothy O’Neill put it in a press release, to “[allow] investment to flow toward a more sustainable and equitable future, while seeking to generate attractive returns for investors”. The trend has given Wall Street an opportunity for an image makeover in a time of growing public distrust in the financial system: According to a Gallup poll conducted last month, fewer than half of Americans under 30 report having a positive view of capitalism, a 12-point drop in just the past two years. For some activists and investors, though, the rapid expansion of the market for SRI-branded financial products has raised concerns about greenwashing – the practice by which companies market themselves as socially or environmentally responsible without actually adopting business practices that meet those goals. “Putting the word ‘ethical’ or ‘sustainable’ in the name of a fund does not make it so,” said a report by British investment advisory firm Castlefield, whose recent reports documented how some environmental funds include investments in fossil fuel firms. “It is increasingly important to differentiate between those funds genuinely responding to customer demand for a sustainable approach and those which use terms like ethical, Socially Responsible Investment or stewardship in their name but include companies such as British American Tobacco or Shell in their key holdings.” Goldman’s record on socially responsible investing Amid surging interest in SRI funds, Goldman’s Just US Large Cap Equity ETF aims to convince investors that the company is serious about injecting a spirit of ethics and morality into its financial strategies. To that end, the fund says it directs money only into companies that are ranked highly by Just Capital. The 426 companies featured in the Just index were selected on the basis of their performance across seven different criteria, including labor practices, customer service and environmental impacts. Goldman itself ranks in the top tenth of the Just rankings, despite the company being attacked for supporting the fossil fuel industry and also being fined $5bn in 2016 by the Department of Justice for “serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail”. Whether Goldman’s new Just fund represents a step in a larger shift towards socially responsible investment remains to be seen. Baruch College’s Jared Peifer says that one way to judge a firm’s commitment to social responsibility is to watch how it deals with resolutions brought by shareholders, whereby investors attempt to force management to adopt socially responsible policies. “There is variance to the degree that SRI funds are ethically motivated versus a more greenwashing approach,” Peifer said. “Is the fund dialoguing with management? Issuing shareholder proxy votes, voting on others? If so, that seems like a more ethically motivated fund to me, because they are exerting additional effort many other funds do not bother with.” In recent years, Goldman executives have been fighting off SRI resolutions at their own company, including initiatives that have asked management to more transparently disclose their political lobbying and create a human rights committee to review the company’s policies regarding doing business with governments engaged in censorship and repression. Only three months before Goldman announced the Just fund, Goldman successfully pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to bless its move to block shareholders from voting on a resolution asking the company to honor indigenous peoples’ rights. “The company’s extraordinary no action request shows the notable lengths that the company is willing to go, and to stretch credulity, in order to prevent its directors from shouldering fiduciary obligations on indigenous and human rights,” wrote shareholder proponents at the time. Last year, Goldman was lauded by Share Action, an SRI activist group, for switching its position and using its holdings to support a series of climate-change-related shareholder initiatives. In its proxy voting guidelines, Goldman says it will generally vote for proposals asking companies to report on “policies, initiatives and oversight mechanisms related to environmental sustainability, or how the company may be impacted by climate change”. However, those guidelines do not make the same commitment when it comes to initiatives requiring companies to actually reduce their carbon emissions. The guidelines also say the company will generally vote against “proposals requesting increased disclosure of a company’s policies with respect to political contributions”. The company further says it will vote to remove representatives of employees or organized labor from a company’s board if they are overseeing company audits or executive compensation, and if there is no legal requirement for them to be in that position. Goldman votes against resolutions at Just fund companies Goldman’s hostility toward many SRI initiatives is illustrated by its votes on resolutions at the companies now in its Just fund. For example, there is Chevron Corporation, which ranks as the Just fund’s 17th-largest holding as it faces accusations that it is trying to intimidate environmentalists and avoid cleaning up pollution in the Amazon rainforest. In May, the oil giant’s shareholders were asked to vote on a slate of seven proposals, including a requirement for the company’s board to nominate a director with environmental experience; the preparation of a report on transitioning to a low-carbon business model; increased transparency relating to lobbying activities; and stronger prohibitions on Chevron’s interests overseas from doing business with governments that are complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. As shareholders in Chevron, 14 different Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) funds voted on these proposals. The majority of funds voted in support of just one, a request for the company to prepare a report on its efforts to minimize methane emissions. In every other case, the funds unanimously or overwhelmingly opposed the proposals. Proxy-voting records from dozens of shareholder meetings reviewed by Capital &amp; Main show a similar pattern. In rare cases, Goldman funds did vote in favor of some shareholder reforms, including the preparation of a report on the gender pay gap at Facebook and Google. At several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen and Eli Lilly, Goldman funds supported increased accountability for executives regarding high drug prices. Such votes, however, were few and far between. Of the 10 companies that make up the largest share of Goldman’s Just fund, eight considered shareholder-proposed reforms that were overwhelmingly opposed by Goldman-managed funds at their most recent annual meetings. The proposals included prohibitions on offshore tax avoidance schemes, increased transparency on lobbying activities and requirements that companies appoint an independent board chair – a governance model that advocates say leads to more responsible corporate behavior. The remaining two companies, Microsoft and Visa, did not consider any shareholder proposals. At JPMorgan, the recipient of Just’s fourth-largest investment, Goldman funds voted unanimously against a requirement for the company to release a report on its investments in PetroChina, a firm that activists accuse of helping to fund crimes against humanity due to its ongoing business relationships with oppressive regimes in Syria and Sudan. Goldman made that move despite its own proxy voting guidelines saying the company would “generally vote for proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier labor and/or human rights standards and policies, or on the impact of its operations on society”. Eighteen of the 19 Goldman funds with shares in JPMorgan also voted against an effort to prohibit the accelerated vesting of awards for executives who enter government service, a practice often criticized for fueling the revolving door between Wall Street and financial regulators. A shareholder proposal to the board of pharmaceutical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson, expressing concern that the company’s compensation practices “may insulate senior executives from legal risks” relating to the opioids crisis, recommended that opioid-related litigation costs be factored into executive pay. All 16 Goldman funds with stock in Johnson &amp; Johnson voted to defeat the proposal. Goldman asserts that its fund is designed to invest in firms that rank well in Just Capital’s ratings. But even that assertion is not what it seems. Because the index features companies ranked in the top half of their respective industries, it includes dozens of firms in sectors like energy and financial services that score poorly overall. For example, the fund invests in both National Oilwell Varco, a drilling equipment firm, and Entergy, a Louisiana utility, despite the fact that the companies rank 626th and 676th, respectively, among the 875 companies evaluated by Just Capital. “Every industry is represented at approximately the same weight as [in] the Russell 1000,” said Just Capital’s Hernando Cortina, referring to the best-known index fund tracking the largest publicly traded companies. Cortina added that the Just fund is designed to feature responsible companies “while providing diversified equity exposure to every industry”. Lisa Lindsley of SumOfUs said the situation spotlights how socially responsible investing is seen on Wall Street not as a values-based cause, but as yet another way to trick investors into believing that the investment industry has reformed itself a decade after the financial crisis. “The reason they’re going into this is that there’s money there. It’s all driven by greed,” she said. “It’s pretty easy to do some greenwashing and call yourself a responsible investment manager.” As Goldman now markets its Just fund, it remains unclear whether the company will change its proxy voting or its posture towards shareholder resolutions in general. Those resolutions, though, could be more rare, if congressional Republicans pass their legislation that would make it more difficult for shareholder resolutions to qualify for a vote. Federal records show that the American Bankers Association – which lists Goldman Sachs as a member – has been lobbying on that bill, which critics say could undermine the SRI movement. “Shareholder proposals play an important role in ensuring that owners get a say in how their companies are run, and in setting the broader agenda across the market,” wrote Dimitri Zagoroff of the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis. “Making it harder for shareholder proposals to be resubmitted from year to year would make it that much harder for proponents to refine their ideas and build a coalition of support. This often takes several years, both to generate interest in the underlying topic, and to convince other shareholders that the specific proposal offers the appropriate means of addressing the topic.” Co-published by Capital &amp; Main, a non-profit investigative news site based in Los Angeles.",Goldman Sachs; Environment; Business; Banking; Chevron; ExxonMobil; Amazon; Facebook,Business
2020-06-30T06:07:46Z,AGL says it will link bosses’ bonuses to lowering emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/30/agl-says-it-will-link-bosses-bonuses-to-lowering-emissions,"Australia’s largest domestic emitter of greenhouse gases, the energy provider AGL, is the first major company in the country to link managers’ bonuses to lowering emissions. AGL announced on Tuesday that metrics including the amount of power the company generated from renewable sources would be linked to the pay incentives of key managers from the next financial year, starting in July 2021. Brett Redman, AGL’s chief executive, said the move was introduced “to hold ourselves accountable” as the company worked towards a target of net-zero emissions by 2050. In 2018-19, the company declared it had emitted greenhouse gases equivalent to 42.7m tonnes of CO2, mostly from burning coal and gas in power plants. That amount was more than double the 20.1 Mt from the next largest emitter, EnergyAustralia. AGL announced a new climate statement on Tuesday and, from Wednesday, Redman said customers would be given the option to pay extra on their bills for “carbon-neutral” electricity. That scheme would be rolled out to all AGL’s products in the future, Redman said. Using a government-accredited scheme, AGL customers could choose to pay $1 a week to have the greenhouse gas emissions from their electricity offset. Small businesses would pay $4 a week. AGL would initially invest in two schemes to offset the emissions from customers’ electricity use – a forestry program in northern New South Wales and a project in Kenya to replace charcoal ovens with lower-emission alternatives. The company did not alter the established timeline for the retirement of its main coal-fired power stations. Redman said the new climate statement did not change the company’s previously announced plans to retire its three-main coal-fired power plants, meaning that Loy Yang power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley would keep burning coal for 28 years. But he said the company was being driven by the demands of its customers and, if there was high demand for carbon-neutral products, it may revisit its timeline to close the coal plants. More rapid developments in cleaner technologies could also see the company close its coal assets earlier. In a briefing to reporters, Redman said AGL would link one-third of the company’s longer-term incentive pay scheme for its 50 or so senior managers to emissions reductions and sales of carbon-neutral energy. Details would be announced at the company’s annual general meeting in September, Redman said. He believed AGL was the first top-50 ASX company to link remuneration to emissions reductions. Last week Australia’s major electricity and gas companies – members of the Australian Energy Council – called on the government to back a target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. According to a report in the Australian, one council member, Intergen, with coal plants in Queensland, said the call could antagonise the federal government, which has only committed to a net-zero goal sometime before 2100. The AGL investor First State Super, which has $120bn of funds under management, has been a lead negotiator with AGL on behalf of Climate Action 100+, a group of global investors worth US$40tn. Liza McDonald, head of responsible investment at First State Super, which owns about 1% of AGL, welcomed the move to link remuneration to climate-related targets. “We are having regular and constructive engagements with AGL and are seeing real progress from the company in strengthening their climate risk analysis,” she said. “We will continue to engage with AGL and other heavy greenhouse gas emitters to understand and influence how they are preparing for a more rapid transition to a low-carbon economy.” But one climate campaign group, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, rubbished AGL’s announcement Dan Gocher, the centre’s director of climate and environment, said closing coal plants “at their use-by dates” was not consistent with the Paris climate change agreement, “with which AGL claims it is aligned”. “AGL has made no new commitments other than offering carbon offsets to its retail customers,” Gocher said. “Offsets are no substitute for simply not producing emissions in the first place. “While AGL’s intention to reward executives to reduce emissions is welcome, and consistent with ACCR’s asks of other heavy polluters, executives must not be rewarded for business as usual.”",AGL; Business; Energy; Australia news; Energy; Renewable energy; Business; Environment; Coal; Greenhouse gas emissions; Executive pay; Gas; Fossil fuels; Corporate social responsibility,Business
2020-05-05T15:39:32Z,Ocado faces shareholder revolt over £88m bonus payout,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/ocado-shareholder-revolt-bonus-payout-royal-london,"Ocado is to face a shareholder rebellion over its “excessive” executive pay after four bosses banked an £88m bonus payout. The chief executive, Tim Steiner, was the biggest winner from the scheme, raking in £54m – one of the largest bonus payouts made by a listed UK company. The chief financial officer, Duncan Tatton-Brown, and chief operating officer, Mark Richardson, each banked £14m. Luke Jensen, who runs its tech business, Ocado Solutions, received £6m. Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), which owns a 0.3% stake in Ocado, said it would vote against the pay report at the annual shareholder meeting. The influential proxy voting agencies, which advise big shareholders how to vote, have raised a red flag over the executive pay scheme before Wednesday’s meeting behind closed doors at its head office in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Shareholders, who cannot physically attend due to lockdown restrictions, are voting by proxy, with at least 25% expected to protest against the payouts. The company attracted a similar-sized rebellion last year. RLAM said this year’s bonus bonanza was “a classic example of how poorly designed incentive plans can lead to excessive awards for management”. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, its head of responsible investment, complained payouts were not capped and the remuneration committee “did not apply any discretion”. The men were promised the shares in 2014 under a five-year “growth incentive plan” that measured Ocado’s share price growth relative to the FTSE 100. The company’s value has soared over the past two years: the shares, which were changing hands for about 250p in November 2017, are now worth £17 after Steiner sold its grocery-picking expertise to seven foreign supermarket chains. The advisory groups Pirc, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have told investors to vote against the company’s pay report. They have also urged investors to block the re-election of Andrew Harrison who is head of the remuneration committee. Lord Stuart Rose, Ocado’s chairman, said Ocado recognised the “sensitivities around executive pay”, but that the pay schemes had been approved and the payouts had been earned. He said: “The award reflects outstanding performance over a five year period during which £7.5bn of value was created for Ocado shareholders. “The remuneration committee is satisfied that Ocado’s pay schemes past and present, all of which have already been approved by shareholders, deliver above-market pay-outs only for outstanding results.” The lockdown has resulted in a period of record grocery sales as the closure of restaurants, cafes and pubs forces Britons to eat and drink at home. But while supermarkets have expanded online services after a surge in demand for home delivery, Ocado’s automated warehouses quickly reached capacity, forcing the retailer to turn away custom. The Shore Black analyst Clive Black said Ocado had suffered a “meltdown” in the early weeks of the crisis, with both the app and website crashing. “I don’t think Ocado has had a good campaign,” he said. “It has taken 23 years to get from zero to 7% of grocery sales online – and it has taken 23 days to get to 10%. Ocado will benefit from that but others will benefit more.”",Ocado; Executive pay and bonuses; Business; Retail industry; Supermarkets,Business
2020-01-09T19:50:37Z,BlackRock joins pressure group taking on biggest polluters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/09/blackrock-joins-pressure-group-taking-on-biggest-polluters,"BlackRock, the world’s largest investor, has joined an influential pressure group calling for the biggest polluters to reduce their emissions, after criticisms that it was undermining action addressing the climate crisis. The US investment firm has signed up to Climate Action 100+, a group of investors managing assets worth more than $35tn (£27tn), that pressures fossil fuel producers and other companies responsible for two-thirds of annual global industrial emissions to show how they will reduce carbon dioxide pollution. In February 2019, one Climate Action 100+ resolution put to shareholders of BP forced the British oil supermajor to describe how its strategy is consistent with the Paris climate accord. BlackRock, which manages assets worth $6.9tn including major oil producers such as BP, Shell and Exxon Mobil, has faced a mounting backlash for actions that activists said were preventing oil companies from being held to account. BlackRock has directly voted against multiple shareholder resolutions brought by Climate Action 100+. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink’s annual letter to investors, expected ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos on 21 January, has previously called on companies to take more action on the climate crisis. BlackRock has faced protests from environmental campaigners, who have accused the company of hypocrisy for routinely voting against shareholder motions directing boards to take action on the climate crisis. A spokesperson for the investment giant said: “BlackRock has become a signatory to Climate Action 100+. This is a natural progression of the work our Investment Stewardship team has done to date. We believe evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly and we are accelerating our engagement with companies on this critical issue.” BlackRock is understood to have been considering joining the climate crisis investor coalition for a while and its membership could signal a transformation in how the firm uses its influence to hold the planet’s biggest polluters to account. Fiona Reynolds, the chief executive of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a UN-backed investment group, said: “In joining CA100+, BlackRock is responding to the demands of its asset-owner clients and other groups globally that they take meaningful action to address climate change.” Last year, an investigation by the Guardian revealed that BlackRock’s retail investment portfolio in fossil fuel companies totals more than $87bn and that it is the largest investor in some of the biggest polluters on the planet. Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners, which runs the pensions for British clergy, said: “The Church Commissioners warmly welcome BlackRock to Climate Action 100+ and look forward to working together as we seek commitments from the world’s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to achieve emissions reductions in line with the goals of the Paris agreement. “We know from our previous engagement with companies on climate change just how important BlackRock’s support can be for moving companies forward. This is a hugely welcome decision by BlackRock and a step-change for the entire investment industry as it collectively grapples ever more seriously with the financial implications of climate change.” It is thought that BlackRock staff have become increasingly uncomfortable with the criticism from activists and other investors, including the British hedge fund manager Sir Chris Hohn, who last month accused BlackRock of “greenwashing”. In December, the American investors Boston Trust Walden and Mercy Investment Services submitted shareholder proposals to BlackRock, a publicly listed company in New York, calling on it to use its votes to pressure companies to align with climate targets. Timothy Smith, the director of shareowner engagement on the environment at Boston Trust Walden, said he hoped BlackRock’s decision to join the group would prompt other major asset managers such as State Street to start voting on environmental issues. BlackRock has previously argued that its influence is better used in engaging with company managers over environmental issues, rather than exercising their often considerable voting power. BlackRock reports the number of engagements it carries out every year, but does not offer any transparency over the content of those conversations or the position it takes on company-specific issues. • This article was amended on 10 January 2020.

2020-06-12T23:01:00Z,Ethical investments are outperforming traditional funds,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/13/ethical-investments-are-outperforming-traditional-funds,"Environmentalists cheered by huge improvements in air quality during the lockdown – and the collapse in coal power generation – have another reason to celebrate. Even the stock market has gone in their favour. A detailed number-crunching of environmentally sustainable funds has revealed that they have outperformed traditional funds across the board – beating them during the pandemic as well as during the 10 years up to and including the coronavirus sell-off. The data, from the global research agency Morningstar, comes amid growing evidence that environmentally focused investing – once pigeonholed by City traditionalists as only for a vegan/hippy minority – is becoming mainstream. This week, Vanguard, one of the world’s biggest fund managers, launched two ethical index funds aimed at UK investors, while Aviva, Britain’s biggest insurer, unveiled a “climate transition” fund. Morningstar examined 745 sustainable funds and compared them against 4,150 traditional funds, and found they matched or beat returns in all categories – whether bonds or shares, UK or abroad. “Average returns and success rates for sustainable funds suggest that there is no performance trade-off associated with sustainable funds. In fact, a majority of sustainable funds have outperformed their traditional peers over multiple time horizons,” it says. Over 10 years, the average annual return for a sustainable fund invested in large global companies has been 6.9% a year, while a traditionally invested fund has made 6.3% a year. The outperformance continued during the coronavirus crisis. “In all but one category considered in the study, sustainable funds outperformed, with average excess returns in Q12020 ranging between 0.09% and 1.83% across categories,” Morningstar says. One reason may be that many US tech stocks, popular among environmental investors, have soared during the crisis, while shares in oil, gas and coal companies have plummeted. The Nasdaq index of US tech stocks has recovered completely from the coronavirus crisis, reaching new highs this week, while the oil giant ExxonMobil is trading at $53 compared with $70 before the lockdown. The Morningstar researchers noted that sustainable funds are longer-lasting than their peers. One of the tricks of the asset management industry is that funds that do badly are quietly removed – usually by merging them with another, better-performing fund. This has the effect of flattering the overall performance figures, suggesting that investors are doing better over the longer term than they really are. Morningstar found that three-quarters of sustainable funds lasted 10 years or more, compared with less than half of traditional funds. Campaigners welcomed the confirmation that sustainable funds are better. Michael Kind of ShareAction – a charity and company that promotes responsible investment – says: “It’s very positive, but also not surprising, to see that funds with robust environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies are overall better performers financially. We hear from savers very often that one of the biggest barriers to action is that there is a perception that you will lose out financially if you switch to investing responsibly. “But is this enough? No … we would expect more ambitious and authentic ESG funds to deliver better outcomes for stakeholders and the environment but not inevitably to deliver investors more money every time.” ShareAction’s checklist for making your money more socially responsible Research what funds your pension/Isa/investment provider offers you. Look into the holdings and stewardship/investment policies of your funds, or those you are considering putting money in. These policies show how your asset manager will invest your money and try to influence companies on your behalf. You can either do this on your own or ask your investment (or pension) provider/employer/financial adviser for this information. It is important to see how your investment provider votes at the world’s largest companies’ AGMs. Are they voting for climate action and supporting human rights? ShareAction recently produced an independent global ranking of the most responsible asset managers across many topics. Use it to make an informed decision when selecting a manager.

2020-06-23T15:01:44Z,Trillion-dollar investors warn Brazil over 'dismantling' of environmental policies,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/23/trillion-dollar-investors-warn-brazil-over-dismantling-of-environmental-policies,"Investors managing trillions of dollars in assets have warned Brazil that escalating deforestation and the “dismantling” of policies to protect the environment and indigenous communities are “creating widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing”. Amazon destruction rose to its highest level in more than a decade last year, Brazil’s first under the leadership of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist who has vowed to develop the region and slash environmental protections. And on Tuesday, in the latest chapter of an intensifying international pressure campaign, institutions from countries including the US, the UK, Norway and Japan told Brazil’s leaders the devastation – which has continued to increase this year – had to stop. “It is with deep concern that we follow the tendency of increasing deforestation in Brazil,” the group, which manages $3.7tn (£3tn) in assets, said in a letter to the Brazilian government. “As financial institutions, who have a fiduciary duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries, we recognize the crucial role that tropical forests play in tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity and ensuring ecosystem services,” the letter added. Jeanett Bergan, the head of responsible investment at KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund and one of the letter’s 29 signatories, told the Guardian it was intended to signal to Brazil’s leaders that “what is happening there is going in the wrong direction”. “We have very strict guidelines for our investments in terms of if there is an unacceptable risk of contributing to serious environmental degradation or human rights violations then we need to consider divestment. And what is currently happening in Brazil is very alarming and poses a high risk for both environmental degradation and human rights violations,” Bergan said. “That is why we have to work very seriously with this issue.” The group – whose signatories also include Legal &amp; General Investment Management and the Church of England – expressed concern over controversial legislative proposals to legalise occupation of public lands and forests and a Bolsonaro-backed push to open indigenous lands to commercial mining. They also highlighted recent remarks from Bolsonaro’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, suggesting Covid-19 provided good cover to push through deregulation since journalists were distracted. “[We] urge the government of Brazil to demonstrate clear commitment to eliminating deforestation and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples,” the investors wrote. The letter comes after seven European investment firms last week announced they would divest from beef producers, grains traders and even government bonds in Brazil. “The trends we’ve seen in Brazil are very concerning,” Daniela da Costa-Bulthuis, Brazil portfolio manager for Netherlands-based asset manager Robeco, told Reuters. Over the past year, the Guardian has published a series of investigations showing the close link between the beef industry in Brazil and the deforestation of the Amazon. In December, a Guardian analysis showed that the fires which had burned in the rainforest were three times more likely to occur in beef farming zones. International condemnation of Bolsonaro’s handling of the environment, which reached a crescendo during last year’s Amazon burning season, has sparked some reaction from Brazil’s government. In January, Brazil announced the creation of an “Amazon Council” supposedly tasked with defending the world’s largest rainforest and placed vice-president Hamilton Mourão in charge of those efforts. But Rubens Ricupero, Brazil’s former environment minister, said he suspected the anti-deforestation plan was little more than “pure public relations” designed to hoodwink the world. “I am very sceptical,” Ricupero said, noting that the “disastrous” increase in deforestation had continued this year. “These are not small increases. These are gigantic increases – and so far there are no facts that would justify thinking that the government is genuinely concerned about this,” Ricupero added. “Even if the government now manages zero deforestation [for the rest of 2020], this year will still be worse than last year. And no Brazilian government has ever managed zero deforestation, no matter how hard they have tried in the past.” Ricupero said pressure from international investors would be a mid-term worry for Bolsonaro’s administration as it looked to rebuild Latin America’s biggest economy with a series of major post-pandemic infrastructure projects. “Right now, there is no investment, from Brazilians or foreigners. But the concern is that as the pandemic begins to weaken, the government will want to revive the economy … and for that the government will need to be able to attract investments from overseas.”",Brazil; Amazon rainforest; Deforestation; Climate crisis; Jair Bolsonaro; Americas; Conservation; Environment; Trees and forests; Anglicanism; World news; Investing,Environment
2020-07-27T14:00:55Z,Resistance to the 'environmental sect' is a cornerstone of Bolsonaro's rule,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/27/resistance-to-the-environmental-sect-is-a-cornerstone-of-bolsonaro-rule-brazil,"It is not just meat companies in Brazil that are under pressure over rising deforestation and widespread fires in the Amazon. The government has been forced to react after international investors and CEOs of Brazilian companies have protested, and now its own environmental officials have joined the chorus. But its response is hobbled by a deep distrust of global heating, fed by a far-right ideology reluctant to admit that the climate emergency has a human cause. Brazil’s foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, has warned that climate change was a plot by “cultural Marxists” and President Jair Bolsonaro made a campaign promise to pull Brazil out of the Paris climate accord before reluctantly backing off. The international community has fought back, with Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Norway’s Storebrand Asset Management, leading a group of 29 investors with $3.7tn under management who warned that rising deforestation and the dismantling of environment agencies was “creating widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing”. Virtual meetings with Brazil’s vice-president, Hamilton Mourão, environment minister Ricardo Salles and leaders of the Brazilian congress have since been described as “positive”. “The vice-president expressed that the government is committed to keeping deforestation to a historically minimum level,” Saugestad said. “This represents a start of the dialogue.” But he added: “Of course we need to see action on the ground.” Mourão runs Brazil’s Amazon Council and heads up an army operation to counter deforestation and fires. He is sometimes presented as a more moderate counterpoint to the fire and brimstone of his boss, Bolsonaro. But in July last year, Mourão told the Guardian during an event that climate change was “being discussed … if this is a seasonal change, as has already happened in the history of Planet Earth, or if it is something that came to stay”. Salles called the climate crisis “secondary” in 2018. In a cabinet meeting this April – a video of which was released by a supreme court judge – Salles recommended the government use media attention on the Covid-19 pandemic to weaken environmental regulations – exactly what environmentalists had argued the government was already doing. Last September, during an interview with foreign journalists, finance minister Paulo Guedes told the Guardian that “there is still a precarious scientific basis” to climate change science. Such radical views do not sit well with everyone in that group of 29 nervous international investors. “All countries will have to react to the way the international investment community sees things,” said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investment at Nordea Asset Management. “If that is really what they think then they are really quite alone in the international community.” Bolsonaro is unlikely to care very much. He has long made controversial statements about the Amazon and what he sees as European interest in exploiting, not preserving it. He shows no signs of moderating his position. Last July, he responded to rising deforestation by sacking the head of Brazil’s Space Research Institute, the government body in charge of monitoring deforestation. After the highest number of fires since 2010 raged through the Amazon last August and caused an international storm, Bolsonaro falsely accused actor Leonardo DiCaprio of giving money to set it on fire. He said Brazil was being unfairly criticised over rising deforestation because of commercial interests, an accusation he provided no evidence for. “Europe is an environmental sect,” he said. Agriculture minister Tereza Cristina repeated the accusation the same month. “There is an orchestration there abroad against Brazil,” she said, citing tensions over the trade deal between Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, and the European Union, which countries like Austria have signalled they will not ratify. The Brazilian government does have a plan to fight deforestation, as Cristina noted. It involves regularising the land titles of as many as 97,000 small properties, some of which have been there, she argued, since Brazil’s military dictatorship encouraged Amazon migration in the 1970s. Mourão told foreign reporters on 15 May that land ownership confusion was a major cause of deforestation. “[If] we don’t know who owns the land, we can’t bring them to justice,” he said. But environmentalists disagree. They say regularising so many land titles, many of which were the result of invasions of public or protected land, means rewarding land grabbing. And current legislation already allows land occupied until 2011 to be regularised, said Brenda Brito, a land specialist and researcher at the Amazon non-profit group Imazon. In fact, Brazil already knows who is behind much of its Amazon deforestation, she said – even though many fines are ignored. A study published in May by MapBiomas – a non-profit group of universities, NGOs and technology companies that studies the Amazon – found over three quarters of deforestation alerts in 2019 overlapped with property with an owner registered on a self-declaratory system. The government argues that developing the Amazon will provide jobs and prevent people struggling to escape poverty from destroying the forest for wood, minerals and land. In May, Mourão said Brazil needed international help to develop into a “new economic model for the 21st century. It has to include biodiversity, innovation and a great deal of technology to reach its full potential,” he said. Last Tuesday, over 600 employees of Ibama wrote an open letter to the organisation’s president, Mourão, as well as the president of Brazil’s supreme court and congress leaders, stating: “Even though other government measures to generate jobs and income in the Amazon region can’t be left aside, without firm action against environmental crimes, the destruction rates of the Amazon forest will not decrease.” Staff at the agency are banned from talking to the media. Key officials have been sacked for essentially doing their jobs and attacked by Bolsonaro for burning equipment belonging to loggers and miners as they are legally mandated to do.",Environment; Brazil; Deforestation; Amazon rainforest; Climate crisis; Meat industry; Jair Bolsonaro; Food; World news; Americas; Trees and forests,Environment
2020-03-22T14:37:30Z,Church fund chief says coronavirus will renew calls for responsible capitalism,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/church-fund-chief-says-coronavirus-will-renew-calls-for-responsible-capitalism,"The ethical investment chief at the Church of England’s investment arm has said the sacrifices made to tackle the coronavirus outbreak will renew calls for “responsible capitalism” and force companies to reconsider issues such as excessive executive pay. Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners, said that while the coronavirus was overwhelming the news agenda it was likely to refocus minds on the collective good and how companies need to play their part. “Some of the post-financial crisis themes we’ve seen around corporate tax, not having excessive executive remuneration, treating people fairly, treating staff fairly – I think all these issues are already part of the public discourse on coronavirus. And I think it’s only going to increase the sort of momentum behind responsible capitalism, because everyone’s making sacrifices at the moment,” he told the Guardian. Mason said the Church Commissioners, which manage an £8.3bn ethical fund on behalf of the Church of England, would also expect firms that receive government support during the Covid-19 outbreak to consider what they could do in return. “If society has been good to a company, it’s incumbent on that company to be a responsible citizen in society and to be generous back. That’s very much part of our philosophy as a church: mutual generosity and intentions towards the common good,” Mason said. Last week the High Pay Centre, a thinktank, called for any bailouts during the coronavirus outbreak to come with social and environment conditions including a cap on chief executive pay at 10 times that of the company’s median worker. In recent years the Church of England has used its shareholdings to criticise companies such as Sports Direct over poor working conditions and BP over its carbon footprint. In the US it has taken aim at Amazon for paying “almost nothing” in taxes and ExxonMobil for failing to disclose emissions reduction targets. It is now pushing Barclays on its climate record. The Church Commissioners have joined a list of influential investors backing a shareholder resolution calling for Barclays to phase out lending to fossil fuel companies. A vote on the measure will take place at the bank’s annual general meeting on 7 May. Barclays has been the top European financier of fossil fuels in the last four years, according to figures compiled by campaigners including the Rainforest Action Network. They also showed that the London-based bank was the largest financier of Arctic oil and gas last year. Mason said he expected companies to make further progress in battling the climate crisis despite the coronavirus outbreak. “We’re exceptionally key that this should remain on the agenda” he said. “Climate change is by far our highest priority, it is the biggest ethical issue that concerns our stakeholders in the wider church, and also poses the greatest systemic risk to our portfolio.” This year the Church Commissioners will start assessing whether companies in their investment portfolio – including oil producers and airlines – are aligned with the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2C. The investment arm, which says it aims to engage with polluters in an effort to change their behaviour, has pledged to divest from laggard companies by 2023. The C of E holds stakes in oil firms including Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil. “There’s a lot resting on companies and we’re hopeful that companies will rise to the challenge … and once the immediate crisis is over, we’ll be ready to challenge companies, as appropriate, as well,” Mason said.",Ethical business; Executive pay and bonuses; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Anglicanism; Investing; Financial sector; Coronavirus; Business; UK news,Business
2020-02-16T17:06:30Z,Church group criticises US plan to rein in smaller shareholders,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/16/us-regulators-deny-church-investors-right-to-hold-firms-to-account,"Managers of the Church of England’s £8.3bn investment portfolio have criticised US regulators for planning to deny smaller shareholders, such as the church, the right to challenge US companies over excessive executive pay and the climate crisis. A group of 70 church investors, including the C of E, have written to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opposing its plans to “modernise” shareholder rules by adding stricter criteria for filing resolutions voted on at a company’s annual meeting. The Church Investors Group (CIG), which manages a combined £21bn in assets, said the changes would make it harder for independent shareholders to push for better governance.Edward Mason, the head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners, which is the C of E’s financial arm, told the Guardian: “We’re very concerned about the direction of regulation in the US that is restricting shareholders’ ability to hold companies to account. The mission of the SEC is to protect investors but these changes seem intended to protect companies from accountability to their investors.” The C of E said if the rules were changed it would be harder to challenge US companies on issues such as high executive pay, climate change and diversity. Some of its largest corporate holdings are in US companies including Google’s parent Alphabet, the tech firm Oracle and the agriculture equipment firm John Deere. The C of E has previously attacked large US firms such as Amazon for paying “almost nothing” in taxes and criticised ExxonMobil for failing to disclose emissions reduction targets. In the UK, the church has used its shareholding to criticise Sports Direct over poor working conditions and attack energy companies such as BP over their carbon footprints. It is pushing Barclays to phase out loans for fossil fuel companies. Its power to formally call for shareholder votes in the US will be at risk under the SEC’s proposed rule changes. US rules stipulate that any shareholder owning $2,000 (£1,544) worth of shares or a 1% stake for at least one year can submit a resolution to be voted on at a company’s AGM. However, the changes would create a tiered system where small shareholders with at least $2,000 worth of shares would have to wait three years to put forward a shareholder vote. This is three times as long as large investors who own $25,000 worth or shares or more. Under the US regime, shareholders file a resolution to the company, a copy of which is then forwarded to the SEC. If the shareholder meets the criteria, companies can either allow the resolution to go ahead, ask the shareholder to withdraw it or challenge it through the SEC. “Investors will lose their right to challenge boards,” the CIG letter said. While a number of shareholder resolutions may fail to gain overwhelming support, the CIG argues that proposals by independent investors have helped flag emerging issues to the company before they become a larger concern. “This would simply diminish investors’ ability to seek company disclosure of meaningful financial and other information,” the letter explained. The C of E has already come up against the SEC while pushing for change at ExxonMobil last year. The regulator allowed the US oil firm to block a resolution that would have forced it to disclose emissions reduction targets. In protest, the C of E called for ExxonMobil to install an independent chairman, and it gained 40% backing. The CIG’s members primarily hail from the UK and Ireland but also include international groups such as the Church of Norway and the Methodist church in New Zealand.

2020-03-09T06:01:01Z,Carbon emissions fall as electricity producers move away from coal,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/09/carbon-emissions-fall-as-electricity-producers-move-away-from-coal,"Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% last year, the biggest drop in almost 30 years, as countries began to turn their backs on coal-fired power plants. A new report on the world’s electricity generation revealed the steepest cut in carbon emissions since 1990 as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources. Overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year, even as China’s reliance on coal plants climbed for another year to make up half the world’s coal generation for the first time. Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007, and last year collapsed by almost a quarter in the EU and by 16% in the US. The report from climate thinktank Ember, formerly Sandbag, warned that the dent in the world’s coal-fired electricity generation relied on many one-off factors, including milder winters across many countries. “Progress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,” the report said. Dave Jones, the lead author of the report, said governments must dramatically accelerate the electricity transition so that global coal generation collapses throughout the 2020s. “To switch from coal into gas is just swapping one fossil fuel for another. The cheapest and quickest way to end coal generation is through a rapid rollout of wind and solar,” he said. “But without concerted policymaker efforts to boost wind and solar, we will fail to meet climate targets. China’s growth in coal, and to some extent gas, is alarming but the answers are all there.” The EU has made the fastest progress towards replacing coal with wind and solar power, while the US has increased its reliance on gas following its shale boom in recent years. The report revealed that renewable wind and solar power rose by 15% in 2019 to make up 8% of the world’s electricity. In the EU, wind and solar power made up almost a fifth of the electricity generated last year, ahead of the US which relied on these renewable sources for 11% of its electricity. In China and India, renewable energy made up 8% and 9% of the electricity system, respectively. To meet the Paris climate goals, the world needs to record a compound growth rate of 15% for wind and solar generation every year – which will require “a colossal effort”, the report warned. The electricity generation report was published as a separate piece of research claimed that 38 out of 75 of the world’s largest asset managers are stalling on taking action on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The latest ranking by Asset Owners Disclosure Project, a scheme managed by the investment campaign group ShareAction, found that the 38 asset managers have weak or nonexistent policy commitments and fail to account for their real-world impacts across their mainstream assets. The survey also claimed that the investment managers often lack appropriate engagement and escalation processes on climate change, human rights and biodiversity. Scores were based on a survey of activities in responsible investment governance, climate change, human rights, and biodiversity and ranged between AAA to E. Not a single asset manager was granted an AAA or AA rating, the top two scores available. Felix Nagrawala, ShareAction analyst, said: “While many in the industry are eager to promote their ESG credentials, our analysis clearly indicates that few of the world’s largest asset managers can lay claim to having a truly sustainable approach across all their investments.” ShareAction said the world’s six largest asset managers – including BlackRock (rated D), State Street (D) and Vanguard (E) – were among the worst performers. Vanguard said it was committed to companies making “appropriate disclosures on governance, strategy and performance on relevant ESG risks”. BlackRock and State Street did not respond to a request for comment.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy; Energy efficiency; Energy industry; Climate crisis; Business; Environment; Ethical and green living; Fossil fuels; World news; Renewable energy; Wind power; Solar power,Environment
2020-06-11T17:30:02Z,Adani mine: three major insurers to have no further involvement in coal project,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/12/adani-mine-three-major-insurers-to-have-no-further-involvement-in-coal-project,"Three major insurance groups that provided cover for parts of the Adani coal project in Queensland have said they will not provide future policies to the project. AXA XL, Liberty Mutual and HDI have told Guardian Australia they will not have any further involvement in the project after previously providing insurance cover that has now expired. The names of the three companies, together with one other insurer, appear on a file seen by Guardian Australia as having provided insurance cover for the project. Construction has started on the Adani coal site – one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in Australia’s history. The mine and its railway will export coal through Adani’s Abbot Point terminal to power plants. Insurance broker Marsh has reportedly been working with Adani since 2015 and like other companies has come under pressure from campaigners to walk away due to coal’s contribution to the climate crisis. A spokesperson for AXA XL told Guardian Australia the company “do not currently have a live insurance policy for the Carmichael mine’s assets, neither directly nor through packages, and we do not intend to do so in the future.” The spokesperson said the policy had provided “a period of residue cover for work defaults” and that this expired in 2021. The decision to break ties with the Adani project was related to a new company policy on coal, announced in January 2020. The spokesperson added that “we are all committed to a long-term ‘exit’ strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030 in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world”. A spokesperson for Liberty Mutual said the firm and its subsidiary Liberty Specialty Markets “do not have any current policies in place for the Adani Carmichael mine project”. Guardian Australia asked if the company had any ongoing involvement in the mine and its railway project. In a statement, the spokesperson added: “In January 2019, we informed the appropriate parties we would not be participating in the insurance program for the operational phase of the project. We will not have any further involvement in the Adani Carmichael mine project.” A previous policy covering early-works site construction had expired in October 2019 and the company remained “contractually obligated to a 24-month maintenance period for any defects that may arise in that specific construction following the conclusion of the period of insurance”. The spokesperson said the company recognised the risk of climate change and had a new “Office of Sustainability” that would “embed responsible investment and risk management policies into our decision-making.” The company’s 2019 environment review said “the world needs to retain some level of balance between fossil fuels and renewable sources while making the transition to a fully decarbonised system”. The company had a policy, the report said, to make no new investments in debt or equity securities of companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining and to “phase out coverage and investments for existing risks that exceed this threshold by 2023”. Two other insurers named on the files seen by Guardian Australia were Aspen RE and HDI. A statement from HDI Global said the company “is not an insurer of the Adani Carmichael coal mine project” and Guardian Australia understands this includes the railway that is part of the Carmichael project. The statement said the company could not rule out that one or more of its Australian customers could be among the mine’s contractors. The statement said the company – part of the German-owned Talanx Group – would no longer underwrite any risks for newly planned coal-fired power stations or coalmines. By 2038, the company aimed to no longer have any coal plants or mines in its portfolio. “It is part of our fundamental business principles not to grant any direct insurance cover to projects like the Adani Carmichael coal mine,” the statement said. A Marsh employee who has been a commercial risk manager for more than two years with the company, but who asked not to be named, said the insurance broker had “lost domestic clients over this already” and that some colleagues were “concerned about where Marsh stands on climate change and what we represent”. There was concern among some employees, the manager claimed, of the impact of the mine on the land and culture of the Wangan and Jagalingou people. In May, the company’s parent group, Marsh &amp; McLennan, released a one-page “client engagement principles” document, saying the firm had a commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on climate change. That goal does not include specific temperature targets, unlike the UN’s Paris climate agreement. The document was branded as “greenwash” by campaigners. A spokesperson for Marsh told Guardian Australia the company had a “long-standing policy not to comment on the identity of clients” and pointed to its client engagement principles. “These principles do not contain a bright-line policy against any industry. Rather, we will evaluate proposed engagements that potentially conflict with these goals and determine whether work can proceed as proposed or with limitations.” The spokesperson said Marsh had adopted recommendations of the international Financial Security Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures – a project chaired by Michael Bloomberg that encourages financial institutions and companies to disclose their exposure to risks from climate change. A spokesperson for Aspen Insurance said the company could not discuss individual policies, adding: “We are currently reviewing our underwriting appetite around fossil fuel but cannot comment further at this time.” Aspen “understands the importance of environmental, social and governance issues,” the spokesperson said, and the company had joined a UN leadership platform “for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices.” In January, the Australian coach company Greyhound cut ties with a contractor building the Adani mine railway after Guardian Australia revealed its association with the coal project. Pablo Brait, a campaigner at Market Forces, a group working to highlight financial links between companies and fossil fuel projects, said: “The fact that there are more than a dozen insurers who have said that they won’t go near the Adani project speaks to the reputational risk that any company that underwrites it faces. “Most insurance policies have expiry dates and we encourage any company underwriting the project either with Adani directly or through a contractor to refuse to renew any policies when they come up for renewal or expire.” An Adani spokesperson said: “Details on insurance providers for the Carmichael Project are commercial in confidence, however we have the requisite insurance requirements in place.”",Carmichael coalmine; Adani Group; Business; Insurance industry; Coal; Fossil fuels; Environment; Queensland; Australia news,Environment
2019-11-26T15:48:12Z,University of Manchester to review fossil fuel shares after student protest,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/26/university-of-manchester-to-review-fossil-fuel-shares-after-student-protest,"The University of Manchester has said it will review its £12m investment in fossil fuel firms after a seven-day protest by students who threatened to go on hunger strike. Students from the protest group People and Planet had occupied one of the university’s buildings for the past week in a demonstration against its multimillion-pound investment in fossil fuel companies. The university said it recognised “the urgency of the issue” and committed to bringing forward a review of its investment portfolio. A freedom of information request by People and Planet found that the University of Manchester, one of Britain’s biggest academic institutions, owned nearly £12m worth of shares in fossil fuel companies despite claiming it was committed to being a “world leader in sustainable development”. The announcement follows divestment pledges by several big universities in recent years, including the University of York last month, Durham University, Cardiff University and Bristol University in 2018. Student pressure has played a key role in these decisions, with many of them coming after significant student-led campaigns. Lizzy Haughton, of Manchester University’s students’ union, said significant progress had been made despite the university’s reluctance to commit to full divestment: “They don’t want to say it out loud, but divesting has to be a part of decarbonising the investment portfolio, so it goes beyond divestment. “We haven’t won yet. There’s very little trust between the students and the university to do all of this, but it’s the biggest shift that we’ve seen since the campaign started.” In a joint statement, the University of Manchester and the students’ union said: “The university has committed to bring forward by a year the review of its SRIP [socially responsible investment policy] because of the shared recognition of the urgency of the issue. “This review will be completed before 31 July 2020 for implementation from 1 August 2020. There will be meaningful engagement with the wider student, staff and alumni bodies as part of this review.” People and Planet called off the week-long demonstration following the university’s commitment. The group said the decision to end the occupation had “not been taken lightly” but it accepted the university’s statement “because of the enormous potential it offers, which could go far further than simply divestment from fossil fuel companies”. Speaking to the university’s student newspaper, the Mancunian, immediately after the occupation ended, the students said they felt they were treated badly by the university, who they said had blocked their access to food and other supplies during the course of the week. “I think they forgot we are students of theirs,” said one of the activists, Neriya. • This article was amended on 27 November 2019 to remove some personal information.",University of Manchester; UK news; Fossil fuel divestment; Environmental activism; Fossil fuels; Energy; Environment,Education
2019-11-28T00:01:23Z,City investors urge UK's top firms to pay workers living wage,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/28/city-investors-urge-royal-mail-british-airways-jd-sports-to-pay-workers-living-wage,"Influential City investors have written to the chief executives of companies including Royal Mail, British Airways and JD Sports urging them to pay their workers a real living wage. The letter calls on businesses to seek accreditation from the Living Wage Foundation, which makes sure companies pay employees and contractors an hourly rate higher than the national minimum. Signatories include the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, Candriam Investors Group, BMO Global Asset Management and responsible investment group Hermes EOS. The investors together control almost £2tn in assets. The foundation’s real living wage – calculated as “what employees and their families need to live” – is £9.30 an hour across the UK, or £10.75 in higher-cost London. That contrasts with the £8.21 legal minimum for over-25s – dubbed the “national living wage” by the former chancellor George Osborne – or the £7.70 minimum wage for the under-25s. Concern over low pay for employees has risen up the political agenda since the financial crisis, with British workers enduring the worst decade for real-terms pay growth since the Napoleonic wars of 1803–1815, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. At the same time, executive pay has risen dramatically. More than 5,500 employers are accredited as living wage employers, but only 38 of the companies listed on the FTSE-100 index have signed up so far. Pauline Lecoursonnois, who negotiates with companies for Hermes EOS, said: “The case is clear: a workforce that is fairly paid, well valued and respected will perform better than one that isn’t and therefore we are asking UK companies to consider paying the living wage as a key indicator of a responsible and sustainable business.” Royal Mail, whose workers are appealing in court to try to strike over the Christmas period, was among the recipients of the letter. A spokesman said the “vast majority” of its employees earned more than the living wage. Hargreaves Lansdown, the FTSE-100 investment platform, said it planned to gain living wage accreditation in response to the letter, which was organised by ShareAction, a campaign group. The government-appointed Low Pay Commission on Wednesday delayed its publication of its recommendation for the national living wage, citing the purdah period ahead of the general election. Other companies who received letters were the takeaway app Just Eat, the software company Aveva, the bookmaker Flutter Entertainment, and the manufacturers Halma and Smurfit Kappa. Four of the companies had still not signed up to the living wage despite having faced investor pressure on the issue over the past year. They were IAG, which owns British Airways, the United Utilities water company, the pest control and cleaning company Rentokil Initial, and the Irish industrial group DCC. BA said all its workers were paid more than the legal minimums. Rentokil said only a small number of workers were paid below the living wage as a starting salary. United Utilities and Just Eat said all direct employees were paid the living wage. The property developer British Land said it pays all direct employees the living wage, but could not guarantee the pay rates of outsourced suppliers such as cleaning contractors.",Living wage; Royal Mail; British Airways; JD Sports Fashion; Business; Society; Poverty; Gig economy; UK news,Society
2019-11-18T19:19:26Z,"G4S has no place on ethical index, London Stock Exchange told",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/18/london-stock-exchange-criticised-for-including-g4s-on-ethical-index,"Human rights campaigners have criticised the London Stock Exchange Group for including G4S on ethical investment indices, after the British security company was accused of contributing to human rights violations. The FTSE4Good index, run by the London Stock Exchange Group’s FTSE Russell subsidiary, has included G4S for the past three years. During that time, G4S, one of the world’s largest public sector employers, with 546,000 employees in 90 countries, has been at the centre of multiple controversies over its treatment of workers. In September, it said it will end its involvement in the immigration and asylum sector following a scandal at a detention centre near Gatwick. Norway’s $1.1tn (£850bn) government pension fund last week announced it had excluded shares in G4S from its investment portfolio, after its ethics watchdog found an “unacceptable risk of the company contributing to systematic human rights violations” among workers in the Middle East. On Sunday the Labour party criticised the company following the revelation that a board member helped to set the UK’s minimum wage. Vaidehee Sachdev, a senior research manager at ShareAction, which campaigns on responsible investment, called on FTSE Russell to remove G4S until it showed progress on improving its human rights record. “Even before Norway’s deeply distressing findings, the company’s human rights record was questionable,” she said. “People who want to do good with their money would rightly be horrified to be invested in a company that fails to meet basic human rights standards.” Index providers such as FTSE Russell are highly influential in the investment industry, and so-called ethical indices, which claim to exclude companies on environmental, social or governance grounds, have grown in popularity in recent years. Peter Frankental, Amnesty International UK’s economic affairs programme director, said ethical indices are often “little more than soft corporate PR – reliant on partial and outdated information, rather than anything genuinely independent”. He said: “Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is likely to offer a better assessment of whether G4S is actually doing enough to root out modern forms of slavery from its Gulf supply chains.” FTSE Russell’s largest competitors, including MSCI, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and Deutsche Börse’s Stoxx, do not include G4S on their ethical indices. G4S in September said its inclusion on FTSE4Good highlighted its contribution on the United Nations’ eighth sustainable development goal, which calls for “immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking”, and to “protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers”. However, Norway’s Council of Ethics found that some of G4S’s employment practices were indicators of forced labour, a type of modern slavery, under the conventions of the UN International Labour Organisation. Migrant workers mainly from India, Pakistan and Nepal – working in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – were routinely subjected to misinformation about working conditions, restrictions on freedom of movement and “debt bondage” from high recruitment fees, the council found. G4S last week said it had investigated the council’s findings and that it was making progress on improving its employment practices. The London Stock Exchange Group declined to comment.",Human rights; G4S; London Stock Exchange; Business; UK news; World news; Ethical business; Shares; Investments,Law
2019-11-17T15:23:53Z,Charity fund manager moves to tackle modern slavery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/charity-fund-manager-launches-initiative-to-tackle-modern-slavery,"One of the UK’s biggest charity fund managers, CCLA, has teamed up with a UN-backed investor group and the UK’s Investment Association to launch an initiative aimed at stamping out slavery from companies’ supply chains. CCLA argues that virtually every company in the UK has connections to slavery somewhere in its operations, with more than $18bn (£14bn) of goods produced from forced labour imported into Britain every year. Even though the UK’s Modern Slavery Act came into force in 2015, few companies have made significant progress on the issue, warns CCLA, which manages £10bn of investments for charities, the Church of England and local authorities. Its three-year initiative, called “Find it, fix it, prevent it”, is backed by Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a UN-supported international network of investors, and Rathbone Investment Management. It will use the clout of investors to encourage UK businesses to find and help victims of slavery within their operations and supply chain. A progress report will be published every year. Globally, around 25 million people are living in a state of forced labour, in servitude or having been trafficked, according to UN estimates. Around 130,000 are estimated to be living in the UK, working in agriculture, construction and other areas. Last week, CCLA convened 27 fund managers, including M&amp;G Investments and members of the Church Investors Group, to discuss the issue. CCLA is calling on the UK’s investment industry to pressure businesses to develop better policies and procedures for identifying and tackling modern slavery. It is also urging the government to force firms to improve their reporting on the issue. Peter Hugh Smith, CCLA’s chief executive, said the fund managers were “shocked” when presented with the figures and findings on how mainstream slavery had become. He believes shareholders should be asking questions about slavery in much the same way they are scrutinising companies’ policies in relation to climate change. The initiative will initially target 25 hospitality companies such as restaurants and hotels. He said consumers must also play their part and be vigilant, for example “when they get their car washed or when they go to a nail bar – these are areas where slavery happens in this country”. The Modern Slavery Act requires UK companies of a certain size to report annually on what action they have taken in their operations and in supply chains. Last year only a cluster of FTSE 100 companies stood out with their reporting, and the average score was 31%, according to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said: “The investment management industry has the power to shine a light on companies and improve their practices. As investors, we want to invest in well-run companies and we welcome this new initiative, which aims to stamp out slavery and support its victims.” The programme will be overseen by an advisory committee chaired by Hugh Smith that includes representatives from the association, PRI, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre and the University of Nottingham’s Rights Lab.",UK news; Business; Human trafficking; Modern slavery,UK news
2019-11-22T15:35:10Z,Legal & General defends holding Shell stock in climate fund,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/22/legal-general-defends-holding-shell-stock-in-climate-fund,"Legal &amp; General has defended its decision to retain Shell as one of the top stocks in its climate-conscious fund despite a pension client raising concerns about the oil corporation’s inclusion. PensionBee, an online pension provider that handles £650m worth of client assets, said it was being inundated with questions from its customers about the composition of one of Legal &amp; General Investment Management’s Future World Funds, which counts Shell among its top 10 holdings. “While Shell has made some progress in the right direction, our customers are asking us on a daily basis whether Shell’s business model is sufficiently transitioning to a low-carbon economy to warrant continued inclusion in this responsible investment plan,” PensionBee’s chief executive, Romi Savova, said in a letter sent to LGIM this week. PensionBee, which has more than 60,000 customers, is believed to be one of the fund’s top five owners, with about £50m invested. LGIM’s Future World Funds are governed by its “climate impact pledge”, which means it can exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. Big oil companies need to cut their carbon emissions by 35% by 2040 to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement, according to a recent report by the financial thinktank Carbon Tracker. But Shell is forecast to increase its combined oil and gas output by 38% by 2030. “This is a puzzling situation and one that is compounded by Shell’s refusal to disclose its future production schedule and whether it is indeed on track to meet its global obligations,” Savova said. LGIM, which is one of the UK’s biggest fund managers with £1tn in assets, has acknowledged that the oil and gas industry cannot continue to expand if the world is to meet climate targets. “However, there is no widespread agreement on what individual companies need to do,” it told PensionBee. The fund manager stressed the need to “balance” environmental and financial concerns when putting together the investment portfolio. “The fund has already significantly reduced exposure to hundreds of carbon-intensive stocks. Further exclusions might have unintended financial impacts. For example, Shell is one of the largest payers of dividends in the UK.” LGIM said it was seeing “positive signs” from the oil company, which this year announced plans to quit the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers lobby group over differing views on climate policy. Shell has also gone further than most of its peers by setting carbon reduction targets that include customer emissions and investing in low-carbon technologies, the asset manager said. LGIM, which has become one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, said the oil company could do more and it was pushing for greater transparency on how Shell’s production plans aligned with the Paris agreement. LGIM also plans to monitor how Shell meets its emissions targets. The investment firm said if it had significant concerns about Shell’s climate strategy it would vote against the chair of the business or dump its shares from its Future World Fund. Shell said the company fully supported the Paris agreement and had already invested billions of dollars in a range of low-carbon technologies including biofuel and wind power. “We’re committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs.”",Legal and General; Shell; Paris climate agreement; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Investing; Investment funds; Investments; Business; Financial sector; Money; Oil; Oil and gas companies; Pensions industry; UK news; Energy industry; Ethical business; Commodities,Business
2020-01-23T00:19:09Z,From loo roll to dumplings: Hong Kong protesters weaponise purchasing power,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/from-loo-roll-to-dumplings-hong-kong-protesters-weaponise-purchasing-power,"Emily Mak works in finance but every lunchtime in the run-up to lunar new year on Saturday she heads to a bustling Hong Kong market street to distribute lai see packets to customers who have ordered them online. Her packets – red envelopes used to hold a traditional new year gift of money for children – are emblazoned with pro-democracy messages. The profits of the more than 20,000 packets she has sold will be donated to young protesters experiencing hardship. Mak’s packages are an example of the ways that Hong Kongers find new directions to take their struggle for democracy into the economic arena. Across Hong Kong even staunch supporters of the pro-democracy movement are counting the cost of the months-long conflict in which police have arrested about 7,000 and fired live rounds as well as tens of thousands of rubber bullets and more than 16,000 canisters of tear gas. Mak’s lai see packets are part of the emerging “yellow economic circle” which encourages individuals to use their consumer power to sustain the movement and weaken China’s economic dominance. “We have to help our own people,” Mak said. “So many people got beaten, wounded and arrested in the protests. We cannot stop our fight.” China is the main supplier of a range of necessities in the city, from water, meat and vegetables to electronics and consumer products. But now consumers can check lists of shops and restaurants perceived as “yellow” (pro-democracy) or “blue” (pro-government or pro-China) on mobile apps, compiled by pro-democracy supporters. “I’m driven by my conscience. We don’t know if it would work, but we must try,” said Kevin Chan, 56, who bought lai see packets from Mak. Adrian Kan, who participated in protests during most of the past seven months, said the injuries and arrests rendered the radical protests unsustainable and he now patronised “yellow” shops and joined a peaceful “Lunch with you” rally in the financial district of Central several times a week. “The movement has definitely changed direction,” said Kan, an IT professional. “We need to maintain the momentum of our struggle in our everyday life and remind people that we’re not alone.” Keith Poon, restaurant manager of the Trinity dumpling bistro, part of a consortium of “yellow” eateries called HKEconRim, said his restaurant’s business had soared after it joined the consortium in September. The dumplings made in his restaurant used meat from pigs bred in Hong Kong and pastry made by local shops. “It’s more expensive, but we want to support local industries,” Poon said. “Red capital has long monopolised the market. Only by patronising our local businesses will the yellow economy have bargaining power in our struggle.” Roy Tam, a pro-democracy politician, said Hong Kong’s economic reliance on China had enabled Beijing to wield considerable power in its affairs, and consumer power could change that. He helped his constituents buy toilet rolls to support a local paper recycler. “Around 80% of toilet rolls sold in Hong Kong are Chinese products,” he said. “By forming an alliance with people who share our political views, we hope to reduce our reliance on China.” The “yellow economic circle” initiative was dismissed by Hong Kong’s commerce and economic development secretary, Edward Yau, as an unsustainable fad and attracted the authorities’ wrath. A commentary in the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, said: “It is an insult to the word ‘economy’ and a breach of basic human rights. It’s barbaric, coarse and full of antisocial, anti-civilisation tendencies.” But the authorities’ criticism shows their fear it might just work, said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University in the US: “Hong Kong and China are in an economic slowdown. The ‘yellow economy’ would give a lifeline to those which show support to the movement.” He said value-driven consumerism, such as movements to encourage buying fair trade or organic products, was common around the world, as were socially responsible investment funds: “If Hong Kong people can successfully transfer their protest energy into this, it could work.” Economists have said that while the “yellow economy” might have an impact on dining and retail sectors, it would be hard to have a presence in the city’s four key industries – finance, tourism, trading and logistics – which are dominated by China-linked businesses. Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at Baptist University of Hong Kong, said that even if the cumulative impact on the overall economic structure might not be felt, the conscience-driven initiative was effectively “a form of protest in daily life which breeds a sense of self-determination and solidarity against the government”.",Hong Kong; Asia Pacific; World news; China,World news
2019-11-20T13:42:15Z,China's appetite for coal power returns despite climate pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/china-appetite-for-coal-power-stations-returns-despite-climate-pledge-capacity,"China’s growing appetite for new coal-fired power stations has outstripped plant closures in the rest of the world since the start of last year, data shows. Elsewhere countries reduced their capacity by 8GW in the 18 months to June because old plants were retired faster than new ones were built. But over the same period China increased its capacity by 42.9GW despite a global move towards cleaner energy sources and a pledge to limit the use of coal. Christine Shearer, an analyst at the NGO Global Energy Monitor, said: “China’s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach, even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.” More than 30 countries plan to phase out coal-fired power to help reduce carbon emissions and keep global temperatures from rising to catastrophic levels. The UK has just five coal-fired power stations, with one in south Wales scheduled to close next year and two more to be converted to gas within the next two years. Global Energy Monitor said the gulf between China and other countries was on track to widen as Beijing pursued plans to build more new plants than the rest of the world combined. China is also helping to finance a quarter of all the new coal projects in the rest of the world, including in South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh. China’s coal investments, including domestic projects, mean it is backing more than half of all global coal power capacity under development. The country has a pipeline of 147GW of coal plants that are either under construction or suspension but are likely to be revived, the report says. This is more than all existing coal plants in the EU combined and almost 50% higher than the 105GW of capacity planned in the rest of the world. “Instead of expanding further, China needs to make significant reductions to its coal fleet over the coming decade,” Shearer said. The report says China’s continued expansion of coal power is not inevitable, and urges Beijing to strengthen its policies to discourage the plant construction and incentivise low-carbon energy. “The path that China’s central government chooses could make or break Paris climate goals,” the report says. Jeanett Bergan, the head of responsible investment at Norway’s largest pension fund, KLP, said China should be able to break its addiction to coal by using clean alternatives. “China has a strong advantage that it is a global leader in solar and wind power, and last year it sold more electric cars than the rest of the world combined. China can become the world’s foremost clean energy superpower,” she said. The country must align itself “with what is almost a worldwide consensus: all coal plants are toxic investments and ‘clean’ coal is a myth”, Bergan added. KLP is one of many money managers to drop investments in coal in recent years. It said its $80bn (£62bn) assets were coal-free and it was considering the fund’s total carbon footprint too. “This has meant shedding around $6.5m in over 20 Chinese coal companies. But we still have $500m invested in China and our message is crystal clear: replace coal with clean energy,” Bergan said.",China; Energy industry; Energy; Fossil fuels; Asia Pacific; World news; Business; Environment,World news
2019-05-13T23:01:18Z,City investors push for BP to be more open on climate change policy,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/14/city-investors-push-for-bp-to-be-more-open-on-climate-change-policy,"A coalition of major City investors have emerged as key players in forcing BP to be more transparent in how it fights climate change. Investors holding just under a tenth of all BP shares, equivalent to more than £10bn in value at Monday’s prices, put their names to the shareholder resolution, to be voted on at the company’s annual meeting next week, the Climate Action 100+ investor group revealed on Tuesday. The resolution is thought to represent the strongest level of support for a climate-related resolution at a major publicly listed company. Under the Climate Action 100+ resolution, BP will have to provide a detailed strategy on how it will comply with the Paris agreement, the global deal reached in 2015 on climate change that aims to limit global warming to only 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. Seven of the top 20 BP shareholders co-filed the resolution, including the UK’s biggest asset manager, Legal &amp; General Investment Management, as well as Aviva Investors and M&amp;G Investments. Other major investors who signed up to the resolution included Royal London Asset Management, Schroders, UBS Asset Management, Jupiter Asset Management and the pension funds of the churches of England, Scotland and Wales. Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors, described the resolution as only the first step in tackling the climate emergency. He said: “The scientific consensus is crystal clear on the need for far-reaching action by corporates, with the next decade critical in limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Investors have a responsibility to hold companies to account and to ensure they consider their alignment with the Paris agreement.” However, the resolution has faced criticism because it stops short of mandating emissions targets, which include all of the greenhouse gases produced when BP’s products are burned, known as “scope 3” emissions, on top of BP’s own operational emissions. BP has opposed another resolution, co-ordinated by the campaign group Follow This, which would force the company to set targets to reduce total emissions from BP fuel. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “BP does not want to take responsibility for the admissions for their products. “As long as an oil major has no targets for scope 3 they can never say they are committed to the Paris agreement.” The Follow This resolution is expected to receive support from multiple major investors but the presence of a separate, less strict resolution may mean fewer back it. Aegon, the Dutch insurer and investor, has committed to vote in favour of the carbon limits. Eric Rutten, chair of Aegon’s responsible investment committee, said: “These large oil and gas companies should follow Shell’s example to play a leading role in the transition to climate-neutral energy supply.” Investors in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, including some who proposed the BP resolution, were part of the coalition in December 2018 that forced Shell to commit to carbon targets that included its products, a much tougher requirement than that demanded of BP. Shell executive pay is also linked to the targets. The resolution backed by BP includes a commitment to measure scope 3 emissions. The company will also have to provide details of how new investments will meet the Paris goals, what metrics it uses to measure its success and its progress on combating climate change during the past year. Oil and other fossil fuel extractors have come under particular pressure in recent years as the scientific and diplomatic consensus has acknowledged the need for immediate and radical action to reduce carbon emissions in order to prevent catastrophic climate change. The pressure on oil companies has been heightened by recent Extinction Rebellion climate protests and the declaration by MPs that the UK faces a climate emergency.",BP; Business; Energy industry; Climate crisis; Environment,Business
2019-08-10T06:00:24Z,Why is it so difficult to stop your pension money making the climate crisis worse?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/10/pension-money-ethical-invest-climate-crisis,"In the highly unlikely event that Greta Thunberg grows up and gets a job at the average British company (yes, highly unlikely) then there would be almost nothing she could do to stop part of her pay going every month into a company pension that would, in turn, stuff the money into oil companies such as Shell and BP. It’s 2019, and computer processing has transformed every part of our financial lives – from contactless payments to instant online shopping. So why, when the climate crisis demands urgent action, is it still virtually impossible to control where the biggest sum of money any of us are likely to accumulate – our pension – is invested? Do you want to make sure your pension money is not being used to support the extraction and burning of coal? Fracking? Or drilling for oil in the Amazon or Antarctic? Good luck with that. There are almost no company pension schemes in Britain that allow the employee to stop their money going into fossil fuel extraction. Yet it should be as simple as pressing a few buttons on a workplace computer. Instead, we have a pensions infrastructure in the UK which is fundamentally unfit for purpose when it comes to climate change. This is not to argue that you should be forced to “divest” your pension from fossil fuel companies. Environmentalists make a good case that investing in oil companies will be a bad financial decision – because the huge reserves of oil that make up much of their value will become “stranded assets” as we stop burning fossil fuels. But the shares of oil companies may still be great investments. After all, tobacco companies have flourished (BAT is now the seventh biggest company in Britain) despite all the evidence of how smoking kills. But the important point is that no one is forced to invest their company pension in tobacco stocks, with almost every scheme offering an ethical fund that “screens out” shares in cigarette companies. That’s not the case with fossil fuels. In no other area of consumer expenditure does the buyer – you and me – have so little control and choice. Your employer, not you, chooses where your pension money is invested. It picks whether the likes of Aviva, Aegon or Legal &amp; General will manage your pension savings while at work. But it’s you, the employee, who pays and bears the risk. “There is a huge mismatch between customer and provider,” says Beau O’Sullivan of campaigners ShareAction.org. “The person bearing the investment and climate change risk is not the person choosing the scheme.” Maybe you’re thinking, hold on, doesn’t my employer offer a range of funds for me to invest in? And if I’m a real keeno, can’t I go into the scheme and pick and choose where the money goes? You’re right, but only to a point. Most company pension schemes will automatically “default” you into a prescribed “lifestyle” or “target” fund. In turn, it’s then invested across a range of international shares and bonds. Almost without exception these will include large investments in the likes of Shell and BP (oil and gas) and Glencore and BHP (coal). If you want to take more control, most schemes allow you to, say, put more into emerging markets and less into UK shares. Most will also allow you to divert your money into the “ethical” fund, which avoid tobacco, arms and gambling stocks. But only a tiny number of ethical funds screen out oil, gas and coal companies, and the chances they’ll be available in your company pension set-up are very low. Many of the big Scandinavian and Dutch schemes have already pulled their investments from companies that, say, violate the Paris climate agreement, such as AP of Sweden’s decision to divest from Exxon Mobil. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which manages $1tn (£786bn) of Norway’s assets – ironically mostly derived from oil – has also been given the go ahead for the largest fossil fuel divestment to date by dropping more than $13bn of investments, including Glencore and Anglo-American. Britain is behind the curve. Pension funds will argue that they are devoting time and resources to socially responsible investment, and that they are “engaging” with companies on climate change, which they are. But they need to be bolder and offer simple, accessible ways for savers to opt out of fossil fuels entirely. It’s a choice that for too many people is currently denied. p.collinson@theguardian.com",Climate crisis; Money; Pensions; Environmental activism,Money
2019-10-27T01:50:21Z,"Ethical superannuation: what is it, and does it actually work?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/27/ethical-superannuation-what-is-it-and-does-it-actually-work,"Ethical superannuation funds are on the rise. Especially for younger Australians, the idea of putting your super into something that makes the world better – or at least not actively worse – is an appealing pitch. These funds promise either positive action to invest in areas such as clean energy, or to not invest in sectors such as the arms industry (or both), all while growing your retirement savings. A 2017 poll conducted by the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA) found 80% of Australians would be willing to switch funds so their money is invested according to their values, and that rises to 88% among those aged 18-34. Four funds in Australia currently claim to be fully “ethical” – Australian Ethical, Future Super, Local Government Super and Christian Super. Dozens of other funds provide “ethical” or “sustainable” options – including UniSuper, Sunsuper and Australian Super, the country’s largest. In the past five years, Australian Ethical has nearly quadrupled the amount of super it manages, from $639m to $2.4bn. Future Super, which was a high-profile backer of the most recent school climate strike, has grown by 15,000 members since its founding in 2014. But putting the word “ethical” in the name of a fund does not in itself tell investors much. There’s no shortage of super tips floating around, but if you want to invest ethically there is a further layer of complexity to the decision about where to put your money. Analysis from the consumer group Choice has found that some funds are not as ethical as they appear, and that in some cases it would be a better use of money to give it directly to the causes you support. What exactly do we mean by ethical? First, the definitions. There is nothing to stop anyone calling their fund “ethical”, “green” or “sustainable”. These are just marketing terms. If they are grossly incorrect, they can constitute misleading and deceptive conduct – but it’s a very high bar. And “ethical” can mean anything from green energy to animal rights to bans on gambling and alcohol. There is no set definition. The closest thing we have to regulation is accreditation from the RIAA. The RIAA is a non-government body that promotes sustainable investment. When a fund volunteers to be accredited, the RIAA combs through its investments and very handily produces a searchable database of what it does and does not do. Some of the largest funds’ “ethical” options – such as Australian Super’s – are actually not accredited, and thus won’t show up on the search, but others – including UniSuper’s – are. RIAA accreditation is in-depth and rigorous but there are two things to keep in mind. First, under RIAA rules, a fund can be accredited with “excluding fossil fuels” but still earn up to 20% of its revenue from fossil fuels. It’s all in the fine print, and it varies from fund to fund. For example, First State Super’s “Socially Responsible” option only blocks companies that earn more than 20% of their revenue from coal, oil and gas. Other funds, such as Future Super, promise full, 100% fossil fuel exclusions. Second, the RIAA does not impose any definition of “ethical”, other than a minimum standard that means every fund on its list must not invest in tobacco companies and armaments. Otherwise it simply does the work to check if a fund’s investments align with its value statement. Not everyone’s ethics are the same Some funds will care about labour rights or gender parity, others have radically different priorities. Christian Super will not invest in anything that provides intra-uterine devices, abortion medication, or stem cell research – in according with its ethics, which are disclosed on the RIAA site. “It’s about ensuring that investment products are delivering on what they are promising,” says the chief executive of the RIAA, Simon O’Connor. “We don’t tell them at what point they draw the line but we get them to verify where they draw the line, disclose it in all their legal documentation, then we verify that.” These nuances are mostly provided on the RIAA database. But for the most detail – and some of it can be crucial – you will have dig around on each individual fund’s website, and if it’s not there, call or email them. For example, Australian Ethical will positively invest in aged care, as well as banning investments in coal, coal-seam gas and oil. VicSuper’s “Socially Conscious” option, by contrast, has no positive inclusions. And finally, downstream investments also have to be considered. A fund may divest from fossil-fuel companies, but still invest in a bank that then invests in fossil fuels; or it may invest in a shipping company that makes most of its profit moving coal. Another example is supermarkets. Your fund may blacklist cigarette makers, but it probably invests in Coles and Woolworths, which sell cigarettes over the counter. The RIAA does not by default investigate downstream investments. Again, if your fund promises to take downstream investments into account, the RIAA will check it – if not, it won’t. The cost of ethics There is a lingering question around whether super is the most effective way to drive change. In September, the head of Hostplus said divesting from coal was “a waste of time” – because those shares would just be bought by other people. Instead, he advocated putting direct pressure on governments. Xavier O’Halloran from Choice says that if your fund eats into your returns (either through high fees or just bad performance), you might be better off donating or investing that money direct to the cause. “We found with some of these ethical funds the fees are pretty high compared to the market average,” he says. “You’ve really got to weigh up the returns you are getting compared to the fees.” It’s easy to underestimate how much fees chip away at super. It’s the magic of compounding. An apparently negligible 0.8 percentage point difference in fees can add up to $123,000 less in super over a lifetime. “On a purely mathematical analysis you might be better off going with a more traditional fund,” O’Halloran says. “Then you can make a contribution more directly.” But O’Connor from the RIAA disagrees, pointing to the effectiveness of divestment from tobacco. “We have seen 35 super funds divest from tobacco in the past five years.

2019-06-20T23:01:29Z,Major global investor drops US firms deemed climate crisis laggards,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/us-climate-crisis-legal-and-general-investment-management,"An ethical investment operation by the UK’s largest asset manager has dumped shares in a string of US companies it has deemed climate crisis laggards, including oil giant ExxonMobil and insurer Metlife. Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM) said it had cut five companies – ExxonMobil, Metlife, Spam maker Hormel Foods, US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation – from its umbrella of ethical investment funds worth a total of £5bn. LGIM added the climate laggards to a list which already includes China Construction Bank, carmaker Subaru, Japan Post Holdings, Canadian retailer Loblaw, US food and service conglomerate Sysco Corporation and Russian oil giant Rosneft, which is part-owned by BP. The asset manager monitors companies across six major sectors: oil and gas; mining; electric utilities; carmakers; food retailers; and finance. Meryam Omi, head of responsible investment at LGIM, said investor engagement with companies can be “a powerful tool” if there are “consequences”. L&amp;G retains shareholdings in the blacklisted companies at other funds in its £1tn investment empire and will now use those shares to vote against board appointments at the named and shamed businesses. “Talks without action are no longer fit for purpose given the urgency to address climate change,” she said. “This is no fad. The world is truly in the midst of a climate emergency, which could have drastic consequences for markets, companies and, therefore, our clients’ assets.” LGIM expects all companies to disclose their exposure to the climate crisis and set targets for reducing the carbon-intensity of their operations as part of its 2016 climate impact pledge. The investment firm warned earlier this year that the world is facing “a climate catastrophe” unless companies act, and last year said it voted against a record number of boards which are not doing enough. Omi said the investor is doing “a huge amount” to urge clients to follow the example of its ethical funds by divesting from carbon-intensive companies to protect against the financial risk of climate breakdown. She said there is also a “powerful opportunity” for investors which remain shareholders of polluting companies to use their voting power to help change the organisation. The money manager said US companies have proved the most challenging to engage with on climate concerns. LGIM said the nation is divided between companies firmly committed to tackling climate issues, and a disproportionate number of companies among the lowest-scoring of its report. Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, in contrast to many US states and cities which are making strides in holding fossil fuel companies to account for the climate crisis. Overall, LGIM believes there is less willingness among US companies to make even incremental changes because they are not under the same pressure to take climate action because it is not expected by US investors. ExxonMobil, the world’s largest listed oil company, emerged as the leading climate laggard in this year’s tally after refusing to report its own carbon emissions or set targets to reduce them. Omi said these measures are the minimum LGIM would like to see from a company “with a huge footprint”. Meanwhile, LGIM praised US oil company Occidental Petroleum which was reinstated as an investment candidate after landing on the laggard list last year. The report said Occidental has shown “a step change” in its climate engagement by measuring and disclosing its total carbon emissions and announcing plans to set emissions targets by the end of the year. Occidental also plans to spend $36bn (£32bn) to buy a shale oil company, Anadarko, in one of the largest US shale deals of recent years. LGIM said it plans to escalate its climate criteria in the years ahead.",Legal and General; Business; ExxonMobil; Climate crisis; World news; Environment; Oil; Oil and gas companies; UK news; US news,Business
2019-05-07T09:46:36Z,Cambridge University agrees to explore fossil fuel divestment plan,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/07/cambridge-university-agrees-explore-fossil-fuel-divestment-plan,"The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has welcomed an “urgent change” by Cambridge University, after it agreed to provide fully costed plans setting out how it could divest multibillion-pound endowments from fossil fuel corporations. The university’s management accepted a motion, known as a grace, which urged Cambridge to “set out fully the advantages and disadvantages, including the social and political ones”, of divestment from global coal, oil and gas companies. The grace, agreed without adjustments by management, follows an escalating campaign by staff and students concerned about Cambridge’s financial backing for the fossil fuel industry. Williams said: “It is an important message to our own society and national institutions, but also to all those vulnerable populations across the world who are most at risk from climate change; and it is good to see that clear and focused advocacy in the university has produced so welcome and urgent a change.” The grace was signed by 324 academics, which campaigners said represented one of the largest totals in the university’s history. The academic and Green party MEP candidate Jeremy Caddick, who helped push the motion, said: “Two years ago, we asked the university to divest from fossil fuels. Since then, the administration has done everything it can to avoid the question, so I am delighted that the council have accepted this latest grace.” This year, Clare Hall, the college of the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, became the latest to commit to fully divest funds from fossil fuels. The college also said it would withdraw money invested in the university’s £3.2bn central fund if it did not divest within five years. Awareness of the scale of the ecological crisis has been growing. Last month, more than 1,000 people were arrested during civil disobedience protests across London. Last week, parliament became the latest body to declare a climate emergency. And on Monday, a UN report detailed the urgent threat to human society from the loss of Earth’s natural life. Campaigners say Cambridge is too closely entwined with the fossil fuel industry. In January, the Guardian revealed the university had been offered two multimillion-pound donations from global fossil fuel corporations at the same time it was considering calls to divest its endowment fund. The author and Cambridge academic Robert Macfarlane said it was time for the university to act with urgency. “It is good news that Cambridge has at last accepted the need to re-evaluate its position on divestment,” he said. “Every week, new research, some of it coming out of Cambridge itself, further clarifies the severity of the climate crisis and the speed with which change is happening.” A spokesperson for the Cambridge zero carbon society, the group campaigning for divestment, said: “The university must produce costed strategies for how it can divest, alongside an evaluation of the social and moral factors in divestment, as hundreds of academics have demanded. “This is a second chance for the university to end their complicity in the climate crisis and align its economic policy with the scientific evidence produced at this very institution.” A spokesperson for the university said it recognised climate change was “a real and present danger” and had made two appointments to underline its commitment in the area. Cambridge said Emily Shuckburgh from the British Antarctic Survey had been appointed as the first director of the university’s carbon futures initiative. Toope described it as a critical role. “Emily is the ideal person to lead this initiative, which will pool research from across the university to address the greatest challenge the world faces today,” he said. The university has also appointed Ellen Quigley to “work with the chief financial officer to establish a programme of research into responsible investment”.",Fossil fuel divestment; University of Cambridge; Education; Higher education; Rowan Williams; UK news; Environment; Fossil fuels; Climate crisis; Climate science; Oil; Gas; Coal; Energy,Environment
2019-04-15T05:00:12Z,Dividend income for holders of UK shares jumps to record £19.7bn,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/15/dividend-income-holders-uk-shares-bhp,"Dividends paid to holders of UK shares jumped to a record high in the first three months of the year, putting investors on track for £100bn in payouts this year. The payments rose 15.7% to £19.7bn, easily a first-quarter record, according to data tracked by Link Asset Services. Regular dividends have risen every year since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2009. Between that year and 2018, total dividends paid to shareholders grew by 85%. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the figures underlined the inequality between rewards for shareholders and workers, and said the economy needed to be redesigned to ensure everyone got a fair share. The big increase in dividend income in the first quarter of 2019 was mainly driven by a £2.6bn special dividend from the FTSE 100 mining company BHP. The largest dividend payment in the quarter, at £2.9bn, was the oil company Royal Dutch Shell, while pharma company Astrazeneca, oil giant BP, Vodafone and British American Tobacco all paid out more than £1bn in the quarter. Underlying dividends (excluding specials) grew slightly more slowly than Link expected, up 5.5% to £17.6bn, boosted by fluctuations in currency values. Michael Kempe, chief operating officer at Link Market Services, said the growth in dividends was “in truth, a touch weaker than we expected on an underlying basis”. He said 2019 was set for further increases in payouts to shareholders in spite of uncertainty about the global economy and Brexit negotiations in the UK. Link forecasts total annual UK dividend payments will break £100bn for the first time in 2019. The pace of dividend growth has far outstripped that of the British economy as a whole, as well as wages paid to British workers. Real average weekly earnings peaked at £525 in February 2008 (in 2015 terms), just as the crisis began, but have not yet surpassed that value, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Analysis of separate government figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in March showed that the median income recorded 0% growth after adjusting for inflation in 2017-18. Dividend income is taxed at a lower rate than regular income, while share ownership in the UK is overwhelmingly concentrated among wealthier people. Dividend income does also accrue to people whose pensions hold shares across the income distribution, but that benefits owners of bigger pensions more than people with smaller retirement pots. O’Grady said the portion of national income going to workers was declining around the world. “At a time when millions of working people are struggling to make ends meet, shareholders are making a mint,” she said. “We need to redesign the economy so that everyone gets a fair share. That means giving people more voice and power at work.” Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a group that campaigns for responsible investment, said: “As pleasing as these bumper dividends are for shareholders, it’s right to ask if company boards have their priorities straight when dividend payouts could have been used to address chronic low pay. “Six of the UK’s 10 top dividend payers are still not living wage employers – Shell, BP, Vodafone, BAT, Imperial and BT. “ShareAction calls on big shareholders, especially pension funds acting on behalf of working people, to signal to UK listed companies that dividends should not be distributed at the expense of decent wages, and certainly not before all staff earn at least the UK living wage.”",Investments; Investment funds; Shell; Business; UK news; Income tax; Money,Money
2020-02-29T07:00:39Z,50 simple ways to make your life greener,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/29/50-ways-to-green-up-your-life-save-the-planet,"Clean up your kitchen Love your leftovers Look at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says Feast food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of The Art Of The Larder (Quadrille, £25), and substitute for some of the flour and water in bread dough. Treat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of 30 Easy Ways To Join The Food Revolution (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else; aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise; fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack; cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up; wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.” Use tech for good Apps are taking the fight to food waste. Olio connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared; Too Good To Go enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates; while Farmdrop connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at sharewaste.com. Shop little and often A lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.” Buy half your food locally The shorter the food chain, the less waste created before it reaches your kitchen. Hunter subscribes to buying 50% of food grown within 30 miles of where you live. “It’s an achievable figure,” he says, especially when producers, such as Hodmedod’s in Suffolk, are reviving homegrown pulses including British lentils, quinoa, carlin peas and fava beans (which Hunter ferments to turn into miso and soy sauce). The nutritional value of fruit and veg lasts for only a short time, adds Gyngell, so how far your food has travelled matters. Pick your own “Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups; wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check woodlandtrust.org or wildfooduk.com. Switch your flours Crops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation; I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.” Befriend a butcher “There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. Compost on the go Compost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.” Plan ahead Make the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round; make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves; use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter. Minimise packaging Look for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners; so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can. All green on the home front Reduce your washing Erin Rhoads’ Waste Not Everyday (Hardie Grant Books, £10) points out that “the majority of the environmental burden caused by fashion happens after we take the clothing home: 82% of the energy a garment will use is in the washing and drying we do each week”. Rhoads suggests spot-cleaning, and neutralising smells with a spritz of diluted vodka or lemon juice. Clean with castile By making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in Clean Green (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth. Go for plastic-free personal care There is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a reusable tampon applicator. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.” Recycle as much as you can “Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body Wrap. TerraCycle rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has free national recycling programmes and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. Look after your electrical appliances The Restart Project is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting a directory of commercial repair options in London. (See also repaircafe.org for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” If your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity Emmaus accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too. Create clean air “You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms; weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas. Change your shower head “Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the Energy Saving Trust (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. “A water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 a year on gas for water heating, and a further £115 on water bills if they have a meter,” says Horne. Opt for green energy suppliers There are “shades of green” when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. “But just because you’re on a green tariff, it doesn’t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,” says Horne. Practise eco-driving Research by the RAC Foundation has found that eco-driving leads to safer, cleaner and more affordable journeys. Regular vehicle maintenance improves fuel efficiency by as much as 10%. Before a long journey, check tyre pressures (tyres underinflated by a quarter can cause a 2% increase in fuel consumption), remove unused roof racks and boxes, and don’t overload the car (every additional 45kg reduces fuel economy by 2%). At less than 40mph, it’s more fuel-efficient to open a window than use air conditioning. Turn off engines for waits of more than one minute (5-8% of fuel is consumed while idling), and avoid sharp acceleration and heavy braking: aggressive driving can significantly raise fuel consumption. Draught-proof your home One of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about £200, or do it yourself with products such as Gap Seal. Buy vintage furniture “Reusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,” says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio Harding and Read. “Secondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.” To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a free collection service), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. Optimise your white goods According to independent energy comparison service U Switch, the cost of running your fridge and freezer equates to about 7% of your total energy bill (they are one of the few household energy devices that are on all the time). U Switch recommends replacing your fridge and/or freezer if it is over 10 years old. Even if it’s working, the cost of a new model will be made up for in energy savings over the years. Keep your fridge at 5C or less (most are kept at about 7C, which means food will go off sooner) and ensure there is a 10cm gap behind your fridge to let heat flow away easily. Make sure the seal is strong – if it can’t hold a piece of paper when shut, it could be letting in warm air, making it work harder. Let the garden grow Buy local flowers – or grow your own About 90% of the flowers sold through UK florists, supermarkets and wholesalers are imported, mainly from the Netherlands, but they are also flown in from countries as far away as Ecuador, Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia. Reduce your floral air miles and find a local supplier through flowersfromthefarm.co.uk, a co-operative of small independent flower growers. Alternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener Sarah Raven suggests going for “annuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers – and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking”. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts. Encourage bees Honeybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of Planting For Honeybees: The Grower’s Guide To Creating A Buzz. “This is called ‘flower fidelity’ and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or ‘drifts’ of single species and optimise each of the bees’ trips.” Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. “March to September are the key months for honeybees – they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,” she says. Spend less, propagate more Your own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and divide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home‑propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant’s natural habitat to reduce failures. Lock up carbon In The Garden Jungle, Or Gardening To Save The Planet (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, £9.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don’t have room for large trees, “The basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.” So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don’t be too tidy, either. “Log piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.” Let the grass grow Letting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer. Encourage hedgehogs Hedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of How Can I Help Hedgehogs? (Octopus, £14.99). They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. “This is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence – it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.” Reboot your wardrobe Set a bar If a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the “30 wears rule”: ask, “Will I wear it at least 30 times?” before buying. Find a secondhand that works for you Opting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as Paper Dress Vintage or Cow, also have websites. Shop in person – and alone That said, shopping in person – especially if you walk there – is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on. It can help to ditch your friends. “When you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,” writes Lauren Bravo in How To Break Up With Fast Fashion (Headline, £12.99). “It’s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.” Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you’re hungry. Choose materials wisely Some fabrics age better than others; the Guardian’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim – another durable fabric – means jeans are also best bought secondhand. Unsubscribe and unfollow “If someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,” says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. “A brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability – that’s fast fashion.” The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too. Get swishing Clothes swaps – known as swishing – are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you’ll wear for years. Find one near you at swishing.com. Learn to mend Make your clothes fit Layla Sargent, founder of The Seam, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: “If it doesn’t fit well, you’re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.” The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner. Learn how to sew on a button How many shirts and jackets do you keep unworn at the back of your wardrobe because they are missing a button? Sewing on a button is a simple skill that everyone should have. There are lots of online tutorials; try one by the environmental activist Wilson Oryema for Fashion Revolution. Make your own apron from a pair of old jeans Turn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee’s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, £27, published on 26 March). Darn your socks “Once a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),” says Emma Mathews of Socko (socko.shop), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. “But we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.” Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic. Primp your trainers This is a growing service industry. Gråel in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning “coveted footwear”, offering laces cleaning (£3), a deep clean (£15) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (£35). Meanwhile, Jason Markk offers premium shoe care from branches in LA and Carnaby Street in London, where your trainers will be brought back to life by the brand’s sneaker-care technicians. Give the bathroom a makeover Recycle in there While 90% of us recycle our kitchen waste, we recycle only 50% of our beauty packaging – probably because our recycling bins are in the kitchen. Joseph Joseph makes an attractive split-waste bathroom bin for £20. You can reduce what ends up inside further by switching to bar soaps and shampoos (I love social enterprise Beco, from £2.50 at Co-op, Boots and supermarkets) and plastic-free handwash such as Soap Co (£19, 300ml, or £110 for a whopping 5l biodegradable container that should last a year). Lose the disposables A staggering 20,000 litres of water are needed to create only 1kg of cotton – that’s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as Face Halo (£7), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel; both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. A pack of 18, plus washbag, costs about £10. Pick the right package There’s no justifiable excuse for packaging short-use, everyday beauty products in virgin plastic. There are now a large number of brands packaging in post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR), from the luxury (Aveda, REN, Biolage) to the mid-range (Soaper Duper, Lush), to the mass (all Simple and Dove bottles are now 100% PCR in Europe; L’Oréal Elvive, the world’s bestselling haircare brand, is rolling out 100% PCR bottles this summer – the caps are recyclable but not made from PCR – saving 7,000 tonnes of plastic globally a year). Alternatively, you could opt for products packaged in glass that haven’t travelled too far. Neal’s Yard mostly uses glass where safe, and distributes from Dorset. Don’t be tempted by minis Those pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in refillable travel bottles and pots from Muji (from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, take them to your nearest homeless shelter, where their clients need them. Embrace baths Baths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but some research shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too. Save to save the planet Save water and lower your bills Consider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Get free water-saving products from savewatersavemoney.co.uk. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website good-with-money.com. Get a loan to improve your home’s energy efficiency Some lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. Ecology Building Society offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties with energy-efficiency measures. Choose an environmentally friendly current account Nearly £150bn has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which has the backing of Friends of the Earth, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation BankTrack, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide. Invest wisely “Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” Evaluate your pension “For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus. Get a green financial adviser Last year, a new financial advice firm called The Path was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has 27 times more impact than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road,” MacDonald says. • If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",Environment; Food waste; Food; Gardens; Life and style; Fashion; Money; Personal loans; Personal pensions; Homes; Ethical and green living; Ethical business; Ethical money,Environment
2018-08-02T10:47:17Z,Tessa Tennant obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/tessa-tennant-obituary,"Tessa Tennant, who has died of cancer aged 59, was led by her ruling passions into a position of huge influence in the world of green finance. Realising the need to reconcile planetary limits with the power of directing investment, for 30 years she was at the forefront of a movement that has encouraged fund managers to invest money in a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion. Tessa co-founded the UK’s first green investment fund, the Merlin (now Jupiter) Ecology Fund, in 1988. She was later head of responsible investment at NPI (now part of Janus Henderson Investors), where she managed massive amounts of institutional money on socially and environmentally responsible lines – for instance by refusing to take shares in high-polluting companies or those involved in child labour. In 1991 she co-founded the UK Social Investment Forum, which lobbied for the wider adoption of responsible investment in Britain. She was also involved in setting up what is now the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, an alliance of more than 200 financial institutions that seeks to improve understanding of how banks, insurance companies and other major investors can take account of environmental, social and governance factors when deciding where to put their money. In addition Tessa co-founded, in 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project, a successful programme that has encouraged major companies to make annual disclosures of the greenhouse gas emissions they generate, and which works with them to cut those emissions. Now known as CDP, the project has grown dramatically since its inception, and works with more than 6,000 companies across the globe, including most of the biggest corporations. Tessa was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, to John Cormack, a pilot, and Jean Davies, the daughter of a Liberal peer. After leaving Prior’s Field school, in Godalming, she gained an environmental studies degree at King’s College London. Working after her degree at the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, she spotted the power that was latent in fund management, and noted that few investors at the time were routinely weighing up the environmental impacts of their decisions. Fewer still considered that excellent long-term returns could be had by investing in business that respects the natural world. After an internship in the US with the green asset management firm Trillium and its inspiring leader Joan Bavaria, she co-founded Merlin (now Jupiter) Fund Management in London and was its head of social investments. There she helped to build up an investment team that featured many people who fanned out into new responsible investment operations across the world over the next quarter of a century. At NPI she built and led a team that grew sustainable assets under management faster than any other group in the UK, winning large institutional mandates.Seeing the implications of billions of far eastern consumers joining the global economy, in 2000 she relocated to Hong Kong. There she set up the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia, which is now part of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an international network of investors pledged to incorporate social and environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes. After helping to create the Carbon Disclosure Project, she became its first executive chair and then a board member until 2014 – encouraging, sometimes embarrassing, corporations into measuring and reporting their emissions. Through defining and disclosing their climate impacts, companies saw the need to bring them down – reducing demand for fossil fuels and driving finance into low-carbon technologies. Over the last 20 years of her life Tessa developed an impressive portfolio of directorships. These included non-executive directorships at the Green Investment Bank and Solarcentury, a solar electricity company. She was possessed of an exceptional combination of energy, social confidence and free-spirited charm that brought her many admirers – her advice was sought by politicians including Tony Blair. In 1983 she had married Henry Tennant, whose father became Lord Glenconner. Tessa and Henry had a son, Euan, shortly before Henry recognised that he was gay. They separated but remained close; in 1990 Henry died from complications of Aids. Tessa took over his forebears’ mansion in the Scottish borders, the grade A-listed Glen House, with accompanying farmland, cottages, steadings and offices. In 2006 she met Bill Staempfli, a New York architect who was in Oxford on sabbatical studying environmental policy, and they married in 2007. Responsibility for managing the Glen estate without the financial means to run it was a legacy that Tessa occasionally thought she could do without, but in partnership with Bill she brought the farm back in hand by managing it organically, planting new native woods, tackling a backlog of repairs and hiring it out for film and fashion shoots. In 2012 Tessa discovered she had ovarian cancer – recording her treatment with wry commentary on a blog. In 2017 she found it had returned – though she spared her friends the knowledge. She declined further treatment, spending her last months at Glen with Bill, Euan, and her two grandchildren, who all survive her. One of her last acts was to be driven by Bill in their all-electric car to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, to collect the insignia of her OBE from the Queen. • Teresa Mary Tennant, green investment campaigner, born 29 May 1959; died 7 July 2018",Ethical business; Green economy; Green Investment Bank; Environment; Business; Society; Carbon offsetting; Climate crisis; Scotland,Business

Good morning, I’m Mattha Busby with today’s essential stories. Trump plays down drone attack but reports say strikes were approved Donald Trump reportedly gave initial approval for the military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for Tehran shooting down a US drone, before pulling back at the last minute. Planes were in the air and ships were in position when word came to stand down on Thursday night, the New York Times quoted an unnamed official as saying. ‘Loose and stupid’. Trump had earlier seemed keen not to raise tensions further, suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone could have been carried out by a “loose and stupid” Iranian officer without authorization from Tehran. He also emphasized that the aircraft had been unmanned. Trump set to veto Senate vote to block Saudi arms sales The Republican-controlled upper house voted narrowly to block the Trump administration from selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, but the president has already promised to veto the measures. The White House said stopping the sales “would send a message that the United States is abandoning its partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing”. The UK court of appeal ruled on Thursday that British arm sales to the country were unlawful, and accused ministers of ignoring whether airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen broke humanitarian law.

Senator Bob Menendez said: “These are bombs that we know have killed thousands of civilians in Yemen, patients in hospitals, children on school buses.” Major global investor dumps shares in US climate crisis laggards An ethical investment operation by the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal and General, has cut five companies – ExxonMobil, the insurer Metlife, the spam-maker Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and the Korean Electric Power Corporation – from an umbrella of funds worth £5bn. Meryam Omi, L&amp;G’s head of responsible investment, said investor engagement with companies could be a powerful tool if there were consequences, and that although it retained shareholdings in the blacklisted companies within other much larger funds, it would vote against board appointments.

Legal and General’s blacklist of climate laggards already includes China Construction Bank, the carmaker Subaru, Japan Post Holdings, the Canadian retailer Loblaw, the US food and service conglomerate Sysco Corporation and Russian oil firm Rosneft, which is part-owned by BP. Hope Hicks: Trump adviser prevaricates in marathon testimony The Democrat-controlled house judiciary committee has released a 273-page transcript detailing their fruitless attempts to interrogate Hope Hicks, a former longtime aide to Trump who resigned as communications director in March 2018, having previously worked at the Trump organization. White House lawyers manoeuvred Hicks away from answering questions 155 times during a closed-door hearing on Wednesday, on issues as diverse as seating arrangements in the Oval office and the firing of the former FBI director James Comey. ‘Odd’. In a rare moment of candour, Hicks said she thought Trump’s order to his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to urge Jeff Sessions to “unrecuse” himself from the Russia investigation was odd.

2019-05-01T23:01:08Z,"‘Do it now’: UK must set zero-carbon target for 2050, say official advisers",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/02/do-it-now-uk-must-set-zero-carbon-target-for-2050-say-official-advisers,"The UK government must immediately set a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, its official advisers have said, signalling an end to the nation’s role in driving climate change. Doing so will be challenging, said the Committee on Climate Change, meaning the end of petrol and diesel cars and gas boilers, less meat on plates, quadrupling clean electricity generation and planting an estimated 1.5bn trees. It will require tens of billions of pounds of investment every year, the CCC said – about 1-2% of Britain’s GDP. But not acting would be far more costly and the changes would deliver a cleaner and healthier society, the advisers said, as well as potentially bolstering the UK economy and jobs. The CCC’s request for urgent action comes after Labour, Scottish National party and the Welsh assembly declared a climate emergency. It also follows a week of high-profile protests by the Extinction Rebellion group and Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the global school strikes, telling the UK government that its support for fossil fuels and airport expansion is “beyond absurd”. The UK is forecast to miss existing carbon targets in 2025 and 2030. Hitting zero emissions in 2050 will require a leap in the ambition of government policy, particularly on heating and transport. The zero emissions goal would fulfil the pledge made by the UK when it signed the Paris agreement in 2015 to limit the rise in global temperature to as close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as possible. In October, the world’s scientists warned of severe global impacts above this rise. The CCC target includes flying and shipping and all greenhouse gases, and allows no offsetting of emissions abroad, making it the toughest of any major economy. The CCC said it could prove a vital catalyst in unlocking matching pledges from other countries. The current plans of the world’s nations would lead to 3C of warming and catastrophic damage. The CCC’s recommendation was welcomed by many politicians, business leaders, energy and water companies, doctors and farmers. Some green groups, including WWF, called for zero emissions by 2045, while Extinction Rebellion activists have said 2025. The CCC said the 2050 date could be brought forward if good progress was made. The former environment secretary John Gummer, now Lord Deben, the chair of the CCC, said the zero emissions target for 2050 must be passed into law immediately. “We [must] do it now. The urgency is not just a matter of a shortness of time, but the quicker you do it, the cheaper it is.” Referring to the climate protests, he added: “Recent events have shown how strongly people feel.” Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said planning to cut emissions rapidly could begin as soon as the zero emissions target was set. “I would like to see it happen as soon as possible, preferably before the big UN summit in September,” he added. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, is demanding nations bring ambitious pledges to that summit to deliver the action needed. Gummer said cutting emissions to zero would incur significant costs but would not lower living standards if the costs were shared in a fair way. “We are not asking people to lead a miserable life, we are looking to have as fulfilled a life as today, but to do it in a way that takes responsibility for the future by respecting the planet which gives us life,” he said. “We would have cleaner air and we would live in a better society.” As a wealthy nation, and one with a long history of carbon emissions, the UK had a responsibility to lead in the fight against global warming, Gummer said. “If we want the world to win then we have got to set that example.” The CCC target is for “net zero” because some activities, such as flying and farming, will unavoidably produce some emissions in 2050. But these will be balanced by taking carbon out of the air by growing trees or burying CO2 under the ground. The government did not immediately accept the recommendations but Greg Clark, the business secretary, whose department has responsibility for climate change, said: “This report sets us on a path to become the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely.” Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist of the business group the CBI, said: “The CCC recommendations mark a new dawn for climate change action in the UK. Recent protests have shown the strength of public passion and sense of urgency. What we need now is a supportive and timely response from the government.” Steve Waygood, the chief responsible investment officer of Aviva Investors, said: “The CCC’s report makes a significant contribution, showing that a net zero economy is necessary, feasible and desirable.” Businesses including Siemens, Legal &amp; General, BT, Thames Water, Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Coca-Cola all backed the target. There is wide political support for the 2050 net zero target, with almost 200 MPs already in favour. Michael Howard, a former Tory party leader and now a peer, said: “The science is clear – we must not shirk from this challenge, nor should we be afraid of it.” Laurence Tubiana, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the Paris deal was sealed, said the CCC report was hugely important, adding: “I look forward to seeing many other countries in Europe, and beyond, follow suit.” Many scientists backed the CCC report. Prof Paul Ekins of University College London said: “Hopefully it will lay to rest once and for all the misperception that deep decarbonisation is either impossibly difficult or impossibly expensive.” But Prof Mark Maslin, also at UCL, said: “The zero-carbon target is essential, but the date of 2050 is too far in the future. The UK must adopt a 2030 zero-carbon target.”",Green politics; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Environment; Energy; UK news; Politics,Environment
2018-12-09T17:00:19Z,Largest ever group of global investors call for more action to meet Paris targets,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/10/largest-ever-group-of-global-investors-call-for-more-action-to-meet-paris-targets,"The largest ever group of institutional investors has called on governments around the world to urgently increase their efforts to meet the Paris climate change agreement goals. The 414 global investors - which represent US$31 trillion of assets-under-management - say they are deeply concerned about the “ambition gap” that exists between governments’ commitments and what is needed to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. They say that gap is increasing the physical risks from climate change and hampering investors’ ability to properly allocate trillions of dollars needed to support the much-needed transition to a low carbon economy. They have signed a “Global Investor Statement” to be handed to world leaders this week at the COP24 - the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Poland. The signatories include some of the world’s largest pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies, including Australian investors BT Financial Group, Australian Super, Cbus, HESTA, IFM Investors, Local Government Super, and VicSuper. It is the single largest intervention from investors on climate change, surpassing even the one issued in Paris. The investor statement includes recommendations for governments on the specific steps the investors believe are needed to support a low carbon transition. Among specific policies, they request governments “phase out thermal coal power”, “put a meaningful price on carbon” and “phase out fossil fuel subsidies.” The three major areas for government action are: Achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals – update nationally-determined contributions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, to complete the process no later than 2020 Accelerate private sector investment into the low carbon transition – put a meaningful price on carbon, phase out fossil fuel subsidies by set deadlines, and phase out thermal coal power worldwide by set deadline. Commit to improve climate-related financial reporting The intervention comes as findings of a recent UN report show that nations must triple their efforts to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Chris Newton, the executive director of responsible investment, IFM Investors, which has $81bn in assets under management, says the long-term nature of the problem of climate change has met with a “zombie-like response” from policymakers. “This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic,” he said. “We need our infrastructure assets to continue to provide essential services to communities and economies around the world. We have a duty to our investors to act for the long term when others are clearly sidestepping the challenge”. The global investment manager Schroders, a signatory to the statement, warned recently that current global policies implied long-run temperature rises of around 4°C, with $23 trillion of associated global economic losses over the next 80 years – representing permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis. The investors are also calling for the phase out of coal power worldwide. They have welcomed growing support for the global “Powering Past Coal Alliance,” which was launched by the UK and Canada, and which now has 28 national government signatories, alongside other sub-national and corporate supporters. Australia is not a signatory to the alliance, but the Australian Capital Territory government is.",Paris climate agreement; Environment; Climate crisis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Australia news,Environment
2019-01-31T19:54:48Z,Metro Bank chief has talked himself into hole over loans blunder | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/31/metro-bank-chief-has-talked-himself-into-hole-over-loans-blunder,"When Metro Bank confessed last week that it had put £900m worth of loans into the wrong risk bracket, outsiders were astonished. Getting these things right is meant to be basic stuff for a bank. The effect of the blunder was to clobber Metro’s capital ratios, with the main one falling from 19.1% to 15.8%. The share price plunged by almost 40% as the City speculated that the fast-growing lender would need more capital. There was an obvious question: how was the mistake uncovered? It was “something we found as we went through our end-of-year reviews”, explained its chief executive, Craig Donaldson. Was he saying that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the Bank of England’s supervisory body, didn’t play a role? Donaldson was clear: the findings of the review were “discussed” with the PRA, but Metro found the problem itself. It was not the full story. After the Daily Mail reported that the problem was initially spotted by the PRA, Metro had to come clean. “Ongoing supervision by the PRA helped to identify potential inconsistencies in certain loans which were raised with the bank,” said Thursday’s statement. One might say Donaldson’s original breezy account doesn’t matter terribly since it doesn’t change the figures. Perhaps Metro should simply stop boasting on its website that it is “a bank that tells you exactly what you’re getting, in language that actually makes sense”. But there’s a serious issue here. The effect of Donaldson’s original statement was to make the PRA look foolish. The regulator has teams of supervisors policing every bank and they are expected to have a good grasp of the riskiness of the assets. The suggestion that officials were asleep at wheel at Metro – which was one reading on Donaldson’s words – was explosive. Metro isn’t in the banking big league, but it still has 1.5 million customers and ambitions to expand. Financial regulators tend to take a dim view of misleading statements. Paul Pester did not last long at TSB after the bank was accused by the Financial Conduct Authority of not being “open and transparent” in its communications during the IT meltdown. There were implications for the trust in the whole sector, explained the regulator. Maybe Donaldson’s airbrushed account will be viewed less seriously, but he’d be unwise to count on it, especially as Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, is taking an interest. Nor should he count on much support from shareholders if Metro does intend to seek more capital. They will now have even more questions about management credibility. The share price, down another 11% on Thursday, says as much. Donaldson has talked himself into a deep hole. If Ofwat is right, customers shouldn’t have to plug the leak at inefficient Thames Three water companies got top marks from regulator Ofwat for their next five-year business plans and – look at this – they are the only three in the sector that still remain on the stock market: Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water, which is owned by Pennon. Of the others, 10 got a “further work to do” rating, and four laggards, including big firms Thames and Southern, were told to resubmit something credible. Correlation does not imply causation, obviously, and Ofwat’s David Black noted that United, which operates in the north-west, was at the bottom of the pile when this exercise was run five years ago. All the same, there’s a useful line of inquiry here. Does the extra public scrutiny that comes with quoted-company status encourage boards to run more efficient businesses? And, while the directors may still pay themselves fortunes, do they have a keener sense of what customers will tolerate on bills? Discuss. Certainly, Thames – the company whose capers have done more than anything to popularise Labour’s idea of nationalising the entire sector – still seems to be paying the price for a decade of unenlightened ownership under the control of Macquarie. The unlovely Australian investment bank has departed from Thames’ shareholder register and a new-broom management now preaches a gospel of responsible investment, backed by cuddlier funds that have agreed not to take a dividend for three years. Good plan, but Thames is starting from the back of the pack if Ofwat’s numbers are to believed. The regulator thinks the company could be 25% more efficient and a lot less leaky. Thames chief executive Steve Robertson protested that Ofwat’s verdict amounted to a demand to reduce much needed investment, and he may have a point. Yet, if Thames really is so inefficient compared with its peers, it’s hard to see why the poor old customers should be asked to cover the difference. That is not how the system works.",Metro Bank; Banking; Regulators; Utilities; Water bills; Business; Consumer affairs; Money,Business
2019-05-21T05:00:41Z,World’s biggest investor accused of dragging feet on climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/21/blackrock-investor-climate-crisis-blackrock-assets,"When a letter from BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, Larry Fink, landed in inboxes in January saying that the world’s biggest investor would no longer invest in companies that are not compliant with the Paris climate agreement, people took notice. The media jumped on the announcement, which appeared to herald a new era of finance facing up to the perils of the climate emergency. The letter was a hoax, carried out by the Yes Men, a group of pranksters with a history of embarrassing big companies. But while the message was fake, the concern behind it was not: environmental campaigners see BlackRock as a key obstacle to progress on meeting climate crisis goals. Now they are stepping up the pressure on the world’s biggest asset manager – which faces its shareholders at its annual meeting on Thursday – to use its influence on some of the world’s biggest polluters, as it has done previously on issues such as executive pay. Fink, who was paid $24m (£18.8m) in 2018, began BlackRock as part of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity group, and spun it out in 1995. Since then, New York-based BlackRock has risen to become an investing behemoth, controlling $6.5tn in assets – a value more than twice the annual output of the UK economy. That staggering size has placed BlackRock at the heart of the global fossil fuel industry: it is the largest investor in coal worldwide, according to InfluenceMap, an environmental campaign group, and has by far the highest density of coal holdings of the world’s 10 largest investors. BlackRock effectively owns 2.1bn tonnes of thermal coal reserves, based on the size of its stakes in major miners. BlackRock is counted among the top three shareholders in every oil “supermajor” bar France’s Total, and is among the top 10 shareholders in seven of the 10 biggest coal producers, according to Guardian analysis of data from financial information firm S&amp;P. Yet Fink, 66, who moves in US Democrat political circles, argues it is not his company’s duty to fight the climate emergency. In the real version of his annual letter to shareholders, published in January, Fink said that his overriding duty is to make customers money. “Our firm is built to protect and grow the value of our clients’ assets,” Fink wrote. “We often get approached by special interest groups who advocate for BlackRock to vote with them on a cause. In many cases, I or other senior managers might agree with that same cause – or we might strongly disagree – but our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter here. Our decisions are driven solely by our fiduciary duty to our clients.” After publication of this article, BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify it that considers climate change a significant investment risk that has the potential to impact the long-term value of many companies. Critics argue this approach is not financially sustainable in the long term, given the likelihood that the climate crisis is expected to make some business models redundant or even illegal through measures such as bans on petrol- and diesel-powered cars or fossil fuel companies being forced to leave oil in the ground. Lauren Compere, a managing director at Boston Common Asset Management, a US investor, said investor action on the climate emergency was “not about being political”, but was rather a case of looking at the risks presented by the crisis to savers’ assets. Compere, whose job involves engaging with companies over issues such as the climate crisis, said other investment funds could put greater pressure on businesses. “There are big players that could be more proactive, more consistent, and frankly should probably be leveraging their assets more,” she said. “Across the globe it is not acceptable to sit on the fence not leveraging your assets.” Casey Harrell, a senior campaigner at the Sunrise Project, part of a broad coalition of groups putting pressure on BlackRock’s environmental record, said: “There is a real big disconnect between words and deeds that needs to be highlighted.” Investment strategies that follow environmentally friendly companies should be part of BlackRock’s core offer to clients, rather than an option they must actively choose, he added. BlackRock has acknowledged the growing demand for greener investment products as it tries to gain millennials as customers and employees. In October 2017 it hired Barack Obama’s former climate change adviser, Brian Deese, to be managing director of its sustainable investing business, which now has $32bn in assets under management. Former UK chancellor George Osborne is another part-time employee, earning £650,000 a year, although climate crisis was not included on the list of topics – such as China and European politics – that he is advising on. Regarding investment attitudes towards companies that are undeniably contributing to the climate emergency, BlackRock and other major investors argue it is better to push for change from within. After publication BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify that the large majority of its equity holdings are held through index funds and ETFs, which are designed to track indices controlled by third parties in which customers have chosen to invest. As a result, BlackRock focuses on engaging with companies to understand how they are managing material risks, including climate related risks, a spokeswoman said. With BlackRock’s scale, meaningful engagement would be a gargantuan task. BlackRock’s stewardship team of 43 people – which decides how BlackRock votes at shareholder meetings – must cover every major listed company in the world across 90 markets. When it does engage, evidence of progress is limited. BlackRock said it had 232 “engagements” with companies on climate-related matters during the year to June 2018. Only a fifth of the companies bothered to respond in “substantive fashion” to requests to disclose climate risks to their businesses – or to say why they did not plan to do so. BlackRock could not provide any quantitative evidence that its engagement approach was working. Research by Majority Action, a pressure group, found that BlackRock lags many of its rivals in supporting climate-related resolutions.In the year ending 31 August 2018, BlackRock supported only 23% of climate crisis reporting proposals – to make companies report their carbon dioxide emissions or their exposure to climate emergency-related risks – compared with 33% at US-based Vanguard and 85% at the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal &amp; General. In some cases BlackRock has stood in the way of environmental action. The company voted against a 2018 proposal for Royal Dutch Shell to carry out detailed scenario planning for a world affected by temperature rises of 2°C, “because we found the proposal overly prescriptive”. In the case of US oil company Chevron, BlackRock was among the investors that could have tipped the balance in favour of imposing targets for reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas. Some 45% of shareholders voted in favour, but BlackRock and Vanguard, both of which held more than 6% of the votes, opposed the motion. In a statement to the Guardian, BlackRock said it was better, given the firm’s commitment to long-term investment in businesses, to discuss climate policy with companies than to challenge them through shareholder resolutions. “Given the multi-year nature of the energy transition and the challenge of addressing climate change, our process emphasises engagement before voting because we find that is the most effective way to achieve productive outcomes in our clients’ long-term interests.” While BlackRock is by no means the only investor dragging its feet on climate issues, its power and totemic place at the top of the investment world mean it could have an outsized impact, according to activists. “There’s a bit of a herding mentality in the institutional investors,” said Jeanne Martin, a senior campaigner on fossil fuels at ShareAction, a responsible investment charity. “If they start using their shareholder rights at these companies that would really shift the dial.” • This article was amended on 23 May 2019 to insert clarifications from BlackRock.",Investing; Climate crisis; Energy; Business; Environment; UK news; US news; Financial sector; George Osborne; World news; Politics; Private equity,Business
2018-09-19T16:42:26Z,Ryanair faces growing backlash at annual shareholder meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/19/ryanair-facing-mounting-backlash-annual-shareholder-meeting,"Royal London Asset Management is the latest Ryanair investor to announce it is planning to vote against the re-election of the airline’s chairman at its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, over concerns about how the company is run. RLAM, which manages £117bn of assets, said it will also vote against the senior independent director and the chairman of the audit committee, listing a string of complaints including the ability of board members to stand up to management, led by outspoken chief executive Michael O’Leary. The investment manager joins The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum and shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS in recommending a vote against chairman David Bonderman at the AGM. “We are also concerned with Ryanair’s corporate governance and poor stakeholder management, which could have an impact on the long term future of the company,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at RLAM. “We have had long-standing issues with the independence of Ryanair’s board and with the extent to which the board can provide effective challenge to management decisions. “While we recognise that Ryanair has taken some steps towards improving the level of independence in its boardroom in the last year, this has not sufficiently mitigated our overall negative view of governance and oversight at the company.” Ryanair said it was confident that shareholders would back the airline at the meeting, which will be held in Gormanstown, Ireland, on Thursday morning. A spokesperson said: “Ryanair shareholders will pass all AGM resolutions by a large majority this year, including the nomination of directors and chairman, as they have done in all previous years. They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding chairman like David Bonderman guide the board and the airline.” RLAM, which has a 0.07% stake in the airline, said it was also concerned by Ryanair’s plan to take away the voting rights of its non-EU shareholders under a hard Brexit scenario, as part of a quest to ensure it has an operating license within the bloc after the UK leaves. “As UK-based shareholders, we are vehemently against the proposal the company has put forward to take away our voting rights under a hard Brexit scenario,” said Claxton. “One share, one vote is a fundamental pillar of good governance that companies should uphold.” Ryanair has faced its worst ever strikes this summer, as action by pilots and cabin crew forced it to cancel flights, including to major holiday destinations such as Italy, Portugal and Spain. It secured a breakthrough in August after reaching a deal with striking Irish pilots, but cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands are planning a one-day strike on 28 September. Unions have said there will be a strike once a month until demands are met. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said the relationship between Ryanair management and pilots has become “utterly dysfunctional”, risking the continued success of the company. Balpa is urging shareholders to replace O’Leary and Bonderman. In the latest setback for the airline, a Spanish judge ruled on Wednesday that a former Ryanair pilot should have been considered an employee and not an independent contractor. Under Spanish law, a contractor does not enjoy the same workers’ rights as an employee and the airline does not have to contribute to the worker’s social security payments.",Ryanair; Airline industry; Brexit; Ireland,Business
2019-03-10T06:59:36Z,US and China must focus on striking a deal for the sake of both economies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/10/china-and-us-must-focus-on-trade-deal,"In 2010 almost one in five Chinese people lived in poverty. By 2017 that figure had fallen to a little under one in 30, according to the World Bank. It’s an astonishing decline in poverty achieved with a mix of authoritarianism, competitive markets and a huge increase in corporate and state borrowing. During his state of the union speech last week to Chinese communist party officials in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, it was clear that Li Keqiang, the prime minister, was worried this situation might go into reverse. He told the audience that GDP growth would be lower this year at between 6% and 6.5%, down from 6.6% in 2018 and the slowest rate in nearly 30 years. The prime minister emphasised that officials needed to be mindful of job losses in the industrial sector and put more money into retraining schemes. He instructed his officials to reduce their spending to avoid accusations of cronyism. And he countered the growing sense among private sector entrepreneurs that the Communist party no longer supported them. Notably, though, he refrained from smoothing ruffled feathers with the promise of easier credit. With the country’s debts standing at 220% of GDP, he obviously felt any extra lending capacity should be kept in reserve to deal with the rocky times that almost certainly lie ahead. The most immediate problem confronting Beijing is a battle it hopes will be resolved soon with US President Donald Trump over import tariffs. Without a deal, the 20% plunge in exports during February that China reported last week is only likely to get worse. Trump has accused Beijing of subsidising its exports and artificially depressing its currency to aid that effort. In addition, the US wants Chinese companies to be banned from demanding technology transfers as the price of entering Chinese markets. It is difficult to make a case for currency depreciation when the People’s Bank of China has sanctioned a huge expansion of credit, just as every central bank has done, not to devalue the currency but to bolster the economy. However, subsidies in the Chinese industrial sector, both to state-owned and private companies, are rife, and technology transfers, which are a pernicious form of protectionism, are commonly demanded from foreign firms. The White House set a deadline for talks of 1 March. However, that date passed without agreement and Trump said on Friday that he wouldn’t sign a “bad deal”, but compromise is in the air. The most recent trade figures for the US showed the world’s largest economy suffered its worst trade deficit in 10 years. As if to emphasise the economic law that both sides lose in a protectionist war, the December data, which was delayed following the US government shutdown, revealed a 19% increase in the trade deficit for 2018 following a dip in exports and rocketing imports. The worsening data on both sides of the Pacific should bring both sides together and that is what the rest of the world should hope for. An agreement would allow Beijing to concentrate on the bigger issue of achieving growth without an endless supply of young people and in a way that limits CO2 emissions. A meagre welfare state also needs to be given a boost, along with a health system that is undermined by corruption. Households have the savings to pay higher tax rates in return for better services, but officials, as they do everywhere in the world, fear putting up taxes. President Xi Jinping has proved to be more concerned with consolidating his own power than confronting these longer-term problems. Hopefully those around him will nudge him to take action. Norway should have been bolder When you have an investment fund worth £1tn, you have true clout in financial markets. You also have the opportunity – and the duty – to demonstrate responsible investment thinking. Sadly, Norway has merely come up with a muddle as it tries to limit its exposure to oil and gas companies. At first glance, the recommendation from the Norwegian government appeared groundbreaking. The country’s Government Pension Fund Global, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, should sell its investments in oil and gas explorers and producers, said the report. Cue excitement among environmental lobbyists calling for radical divestment from fossil-fuel-dependent energy giants. But the proposed Norwegian policy doesn’t fit the radical description. For a start, the fund would still be permitted to own shares in oil and gas explorers as long as those companies also have renewable assets. The argument is that much of the growth in renewable energy will come from companies whose main business is not renewables. But this is a remarkably loose approach. If an energy company is 90% fossil fuels and 10% renewables, it can still get a thumbs-up from Norway, it seems. That does not imply much divesting. Why so timid? Well, there’s a huge tension at the heart of Norway’s fund. Since the wealth flows from producing oil and gas, an outright refusal to invest in the sector on grounds of sustainability would invite the charge of rank hypocrisy. Second, being too underweight on oil and gas risks investment underperformance in some years; so a mildly underweight position is preferred instead. At a push, you might say Norway’s shift is in the right direction. Yes, but the reform is slow and plodding. The oil and gas giants will not be rattled. Debenhams investors should examine Ashley’s motives Mike Ashley has lost £85m, at least, on his punt on Debenhams shares, so it’s not surprising he’s hopping mad and desperate not to see Sports Direct’s near-30% stake diluted to very little in the debt-for-equity swap the current board is preparing. Thus Ashley wants to remove most of Debenhams’ directors and install himself. It’s a revolutionary plan but, from where he’s sitting, not illogical. Debenhams’ banks and landlords would surely prefer to negotiate with a conventional crew of plc directors than the untamed, and untameable, Ashley. Other shareholders might also see appeal in backing Ashley. The bombed-out share price values the department store at just £45m, so their downside is limited. Maybe Ashley can strike a little terror into the landlords by threatening to play rough with leases in other parts of his sprawling retail empire. For that reason, Ashley probably starts as favourite to succeed in his attempted coup. He defenestrated Debenhams’ former chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire, in an encounter in January. It would be unwise to bet against him. Yet non-Ashley shareholders would be grossly naive to imagine the Sports Direct founder is a noble warrior for all investors’ interests. The possible hidden agenda isn’t really hidden: Ashley has made no secret of the fact that he’d like to add Debenhams to House of Fraser, the business Sports Direct bought out of administration last year. If that’s the game, Ashley has a simpler route open to him: just make a takeover bid. If, on the other hand, Debenhams were to be delivered into Sports Direct’s arms via administration, shareholders would be at risk of getting nothing. The Debenhams board went to great lengths to prevent Ashley getting control of the business via the back door and was right to do so. Investors should adopt extreme scepticism: what helps Ashley may not benefit them.",Global economy; Business; China; Asia Pacific; World news; Donald Trump; US news,Business
2018-09-26T00:17:55Z,American nuns win victory holding Smith & Wesson accountable,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/25/smith-and-wesson-gun-safety-nuns-accountability,"A group of American nuns has won a second victory in their battle to force gun manufacturers to do more to prevent gun violence, convincing shareholders of American Outdoor Brands – formerly known as Smith &amp; Wesson – to require the company to report on what it’s doing to advance gun safety. Shareholders of the gun company formerly known as Smith &amp; Wesson voted on Tuesday to approve a shareholder resolution introduced by a coalition of nuns that will require the company to report on what it’s doing to monitor how its guns are used in violence, as well as what it’s doing to make its products safer. Shareholders of Sturm Ruger, another major gun manufacturer, approved a similar resolution by an overwhelming 69% majority in May, just three months after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that left 17 people dead. On Monday, Sister Judy Byron, who introduced the resolution during Tuesday’s virtual shareholder meeting, said she was not sure if the political will to hold gun companies accountable had dissipated in the seven months since the Parkland shooting. The approval of the resolution suggests that concern over gun violence – and shareholders’ worries about what long-term impact America’s escalating mass shooting problem might have on gun companies – is holding strong. Both American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger have bristled at the shareholder activism from religious groups, even though the resolution American Outdoor Brands shareholders approved simply requested that the companies report to shareholders about what the company is doing to advance “gun safety measures and the mitigation of harm associated with gun products”, as well as what reputational and financial risks the company faces as a result of gun violence. Responding to the voting results at Tuesday’s shareholder meeting, American Outdoor Brands CEO James Debney said the resolution was “politically motivated” and that he was “disappointed” that shareholders were focusing on the firearms company, rather than focusing their activism on laws, CNBC reported. The resolution noted that the Parkland shooter, like several perpetrators of mass shootings before him, had used a Smith &amp; Wesson AR-15-style rifle. “The proposal requires Ruger to prepare a report. That’s it. A report,” Sturm Ruger’s CEO Chris Killoy said in May, according to National Public Radio. “What the proposal does not, and cannot, do is to force us to change our business.” In March, BlackRock, a major investor in both Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm Ruger, pressed both companies to answer a similar set of questions to the ones religious organizations had posed, including how they were investing in gun safety, and how America’s gun violence crisis might affect their business. A spokesman for BlackRock, which manages more than $6tn in assets, said he could not immediately comment on how the company had voted on Tuesday’s resolution. The Smith &amp; Wesson resolution was backed by 11 religious organizations, led by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, who are represented by Byron, who is also the director of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment. The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which announced that the measure backed by the religious groups had passed, did not have immediate information on what percentage of shareholders voted to approve it. A spokeswoman for American Outdoor Brands did not respond to a request for comment. In advance of the vote, Byron told the Guardian that the religious activists were not trying to stop the production of guns, but simply trying to use shareholder power to press companies to do more to make guns safer. “We are not asking that they stop manufacturing guns. We realize that we are going to have guns in our society,” Byron said. Gun companies, she said, should be willing “to monitor their distribution chains” to see how guns get into the wrong hands, and “we’d like them to be involved in lobbying more for universal background checks and federal funding for gun safety research, and to also let us know what they’re researching in terms of safer weapons. “We need everyone’s involvement: legislators, citizens, police, but we also also need the gun manufacturers to be involved in ending gun violence,” she added.",US gun control; Gun crime; US news,US news
2018-10-05T07:50:16Z,Unilever scraps plan to move HQ from London to Rotterdam,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/05/unilever-scraps-plan-move-london-rotterdam-uk-netherlands,"Unilever has abandoned a controversial plan to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam in the face of an unprecedented rebellion from its British shareholders. The climbdown, only three weeks before the shareholder votes, is a major blow to the credibility of its top executives, the chairman, Marijn Dekkers, and the chief executive, Paul Polman, both Dutchmen who had lobbied hard for a relocation they insisted was not linked to Brexit. The decision was met with a chorus of approval from shareholders. “We are pleased they have abandoned the plan to ‘go Dutch’,” said Ali Miremadi, portfolio manager at Swiss asset manager GAM, who intended to vote against the move. “Now the company can put its focus into the core job, driving long-term shareholder value.” Iain Richards, the head of responsible investment at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which was also against the move, welcomed the change of heart: “Better approaches are possible and the problems for shareholders were foreseeable.” Mike Fox at Royal London Asset Management said the board had “listened to shareholder concerns. We are pleased we and other UK investors can now share in the future growth of the company.” British investors were worried that once Unilever, which is Britain’s fourth-largest company, shifted its domicile to the Netherlands, it would have been ejected from the FTSE 100. That would have forced funds that track the FTSE 100, and funds that buy only UK stocks, to sell their shares. At least 10 shareholders, who together owned a 12% stake in Unilever, publicly spoke out against the move. Unilever went to great lengths to sell the plan, holding more than 200 meetings with investors and taking out full-page adverts in the press. In a statement the company said that after extensive consultation the proposal had not received support from a significant group of shareholders and therefore it was “appropriate to withdraw”. Dekkers said the board continued to believe overhauling the complicated structure – which is a hangover from Unilever’s formation through the merger of a Dutch margarine producer and a British soap maker 89 years ago – was in the firm’s best interests. “The board continues to believe that simplifying our dual-headed structure would, over time, provide opportunities to further accelerate value creation and serve the best long-term interests of Unilever,” Dekkers said. “The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders.” Unilever spent a year reviewing its dual structure and announced its plan to switch from two legal entities into a single one, incorporated in Rotterdam, in March. It dealt a major blow to the UK government and its efforts to uphold Britain’s status as a centre for business after Brexit. Unilever has consistently insisted the move to Rotterdam was “nothing to do with Brexit”. It also said at the time that its 7,300 workers in the UK and 3,100 in the Netherlands would remain unaffected by the changes. Last year Unilever knocked back a shock £115bn bid from Kraft and although the stated aim of the move was to make it more efficient and agile in a consumer market rocked by e-commerce and upstart rivals, the Netherlands appeared to offer a safer harbour from corporate raiders. The debacle means question marks hang over the future of Polman, who is due to step down next year, and Dekkers, who is two years into his stint as chairman. Unilever needed a 75% majority of the UK votes cast at this month’s poll but also a simple majority among all UK shareholders by number. However, with the chorus of disapproval growing louder by the day, Polman is said to have agreed to scrap the plan during a call early on Friday after it became clear that it could fall short of the approval needed. “There was a real suspicion that … part of the motive for the move was that UK rules too easily allow takeovers,” Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said. “As a committee, we will want to consider looking at the government’s white paper on foreign takeovers to see whether the new regime should include additional safeguards.” Unilever, which also owns Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice-cream, Persil and Lipton teas, employs about 169,000 people worldwide. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the decision to scrap the move. “Unilever has a long and proud history in the UK and I welcome this decision by Unilever’s board, having listened to its shareholders. Clark said: “The UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business and our modern industrial strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy, and a great place to locate global headquarters.”",Unilever; Corporate governance; Netherlands; Business; UK news; Europe; World news; London,Business
2018-04-25T06:00:40Z,UN staff pension fund mired in 'dirty profits' from firms guilty of rights abuses,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/25/un-united-nations-staff-pension-fund-firms-rights-abuses,"The United Nations is facing calls for a full review of its staff pension fund after the Guardian uncovered that it has around a billion dollars invested in companies whose activities are or have been incompatible with core UN principles and programmes. Established in 1948 by the UN general assembly, the fund provides retirement, death and disability benefits to employees. At present it has 203,050 beneficiaries and a market value of $64bn (£45bn), of which nearly $1.5bn is invested in 24 publicly traded companies. Many of those companies have been or are being prosecuted for corrupt practices, implicated in human rights abuses or in environmental catastrophes. “These investments clearly undermine the credibility of a well-respected organisation,” said Thomas Küchenmeister, managing director of Facing Finance. “How can I promote sustainable development and the protection of human rights and simultaneously benefit from violations of these?” The fund’s largest investment is $210m (£150m) in Shell shares. A 2011 report by the UN environmentproject examining environmental damage from oil spills in Nigeria’s Ogoniland found Shell to be partially responsible, noting that Shell had failed to adhere to its own internal procedures, “creating public health and safety issues”, the restoration of which “could prove to be the world’s most wide-ranging and long term oil clean-up exercise ever undertaken”, with an estimated cost of $1bn. Three years on from the study, Amnesty and other groups said little had been done to clean up the pollution, while further claims are ongoing over the continuing contamination caused by the spills. Shell insists it is following international best practice in its operations in Nigeria. Barnaby Pace, from Global Witness’s oil, gas and mining team, told the Guardian that “as a global leader”, the UN must invest responsibly and “leverage its investment positions to demand that all companies it invests in … embed robust anti-corruption measures in practice”. “This will help ensure UN investments are not wasted in companies that compete on bribery instead of quality and allow public money to line the pockets of kleptocratic elites,” said Pace. Declining to comment on specific companies, the UN special rapporteur for human rights and the environment, John Knox, said: “The United Nations has moral and legal responsibilities to take the lead in promoting and protecting human rights, including the rights undermined by environmental degradation … and [should] seriously consider how to ensure that its investments are consistent with those responsibilities.” The fund also holds a combined $244m in HSBC and Barclays. The pair have been pursued by authorities in recent years over allegations of handling covert financial transactions, and have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines or settlements, most recently Barclays in 2015, over failings in anti-money laundering processes. HSBC was fined a record $1.9bn in 2012 for what US prosecutors described as wilfully flouting sanctions, allowing at least $881m in drug money to pass through its Mexican branches. Also in 2012, the US Justice Department extracted $3bn from GlaxoSmithKline, in which the fund holds $78m of shares, after the pharmaceutical giant pleaded guilty to failing to report drug safety data, misbranding drugs, and marketing anti-depressants not approved for use by minors to children. The firm was fined $490m in China, where it was found guilty of bribing doctors and hospitals to push products. Küchenmeister said there was some irony as the UN was a driving force behind the authoring of the “six principles for responsible investment” (PRI). “With the investments in companies violating human rights, pollution, corruption, or international law the UN is violating its own principles of responsible investment,” Küchenmeister wrote in an email. “It is irresponsible and a no-go to generate pensions from dirty profits for UN people [working] their whole life [to counter] the harmful impacts of companies violating social and ecological standards.” The PRI have at their heart environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). Last year the UN staff pension fund was awarded an A+ PRI rating. However, an analysis of the fund’s top 10 biggest shareholdings by leading ESG ratings agency Sustainalytics categorised them as either of “significant controversy”, or “high controversy”. The ratings reflect “impact on the environment and society”, as well as the degree to which they suffer from ESG issues. Ian Richards is one of 11 staff representatives on the UN pension fund’s board. He told the Guardian that when the board met with the secretary general’s representative in charge of the fund’s investments in March, it voiced concerns about lack of oversight. “Everything with the UN is quite complicated but that doesn’t prevent us having a closer look at this,” he said. “We don’t want to find that our pensions are being paid from companies that go against the values that we’ve been working for all our careers.” A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said that while the fund does not comment on specific investments, it “does not believe there is a conflict between its fiduciary obligation to its beneficiaries and core UN objectives”. They added that the fund “addresses ESG concerns by explicitly prohibiting investments in the tobacco and armaments sectors”, and its policy is built around the belief that: “By deploying an active voting and engagement policy which supports NGO initiatives and communities, the fund can more effectively impact positive and sustainable change consistent with our mission.” But Peter Frankental, director of Amnesty’s UK’s business and human rights programme, said there should be a full review. “These revelations are troubling, because the UN cannot distance itself morally from the activities of its staff pension scheme to which it contributes financially, even if this is an independent body run at arm’s length,” he said. “The secretary general should initiate a full review of the joint staff pension fund to examine how its holdings can become compatible with the United Nations’ vital humanitarian and human rights work.”",Global development; United Nations; Nigeria; Human rights; Environment; Law; Africa; World news,Global development
2018-03-15T07:00:16Z,What to do with those divested billions? The only way is ethics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/what-to-do-with-those-divested-billions-the-only-way-is-ethics,"Divestment has become a trillion-dollar topic in recent years – boycotting companies considered harmful has never been more popular: Israeli exporters, arms makers, and fossil fuel producers, among others. Across the world more than 800 institutions, with total investments valued at $6tn, have committed to divest from fossil fuels. But where do investors put their money instead? Are companies that benefit thriving? In short, is ethical investing making a difference? Definitions of this sector vary, as do monikers – ethical, environmental, sustainable. But they can be broadly categorised as “socially responsible investment”, or SRI. Among the many estimates of the power of private investment, the most plausible is that this kind of investment jumped to 10% of private funds under management in recent years, after slumming along at long-term levels of below 4%. Institutional investors are also getting in on the act: two decades ago about £300m a year was considered “socially responsible” investment; today it is, by one estimate £23bn. And yet this is still a drop in the ocean compared to all global funds under management, estimated at about $85tn (£60tn). Green bond issues are expected to double this year, but will still be less than one percent of the global bond market. Despite being comprehensively overshadowed by conventional investment, however, there is sober but considerable optimism about the future of SRI. Proactive investors – and the wider public conscience – are pushing governments, and in turn regulators, to demand better practices from business – cleaner air, less obesity, reducing use of fossil fuels. “I would not feel comfortable gaining from somebody else’s misery,” explains company owner and private investor Rebecca Hughes. Institutions too are heading in the same direction: nearly 80% of investors across 30 countries told last year’s Schroders’ Global Investor Study that sustainability had become more important to them over the last five years. “While profitability remains the central investment consideration, interest in sustainability is increasing,” said Jessica Ground, Schroders’ global head of stewardship. “But investors also see sustainability and profits as intertwined.” UBS’s Doing well by doing good report claims more than half the UK public would pay more for goods or services with a conscience. Many more people will want better ethical standards, even if they don’t want or can’t afford to pay for them. “It’s in my upbringing: you treat others in the way you’d like to be treated,” says Hughes. More active financial investors are also taking the issues seriously. Several have indices to track the value of shares in companies which are not doing ‘bad’, or actively doing ‘good’. One is Morgan Stanley, whose two environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices – also covering weapons and women’s progress – were worth $62bn by last summer. UBS reckons “impact investing” – where investors actively seek out companies doing good – is a “force to be reckoned with”. One of the key reasons is the other big driver of the sector: shareholders no longer have to choose between their conscience and profits. Hughes’s £170,000 increased in value by 26% last year – notably more than conventional investments. “It started driven by values, it’s now definitely [driven] by value,” says Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment Forum. While Richard Mattison, CEO of environmental data firm Trucost, says investors such as pension funds now see such investments as a “no brainer”. Is this sea-change having any effect on the issues that investors want to improve? Shareholders and the wider public have won many causes in recent years – reductions in unsustainable palm oil, reduced packaging, new coal plants ditched, high street shops such as Sports Direct embarrassed over treatment of workers. But some of the biggest winners on the stock markets last year were bêtes noires of ethical investors – tobacco, car makers and aerospace and defence companies. Energy stocks have risen by one third in the last two years. And in November 2017 scientists revealed global carbon dioxide emissions, which drive climate change, reached a record high. However, ever-rising demand to invest in companies pioneering and popularising technologies to create carbon-free energy, reduce waste landfill sites, reduce aircraft noise and other improvements to living standards, should make a considerable difference over time. At the same time, existing companies, across the spectrum, from manufacturers to media, are being forced – by regulators, investors and public opinion – to reconsider how they will do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, especially with regard to carbon emissions. “This is going to reverberate across every part of the economy,” says Andy Howard, Schroders’ head of sustainable research. “This is going to be painful for some [but] there are big opportunities for people who get it right.” In the meantime, says Hughes: “If I’m investing into a company that’s helping the environment, or helping women, I’m happy with that. That’s all you can ask of anyone.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

So did the shooter who killed a dozen people at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012, and the shooters who opened fire on the staff of a county health department in San Bernardino in 2015. Now, a coalition of American nuns is pressuring Smith &amp; Wesson, which rebranded itself as “American Outdoor Brands”, to produce a report for shareholders outlining how the company is monitoring “violent events associated with” its products, and what efforts it is making to “produce safer guns”. Sister Judy Byron, representing the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, is leading the shareholder resolution effort, backed by 10 other religious groups, including Catholic Health Initiatives, the Sisters of Bon Secours, USA and the Sisters of St Francis of Philadelphia. “We need everyone’s involvement: legislators, citizens, police, but we also also need the gun manufacturers to be involved in ending gun violence,” Byron said. The company’s shareholders will hear Byron’s resolution during a virtual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. A similar resolution at Sturm Ruger, another major gun manufacturer, passed with 69% support from shareholders in May, Byron said. The nearly 70% vote in favor of Sturm Ruger producing a report was one of the largest votes in favor of a social resolution, said Byron, who has worked with the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment for two decades, and is currently the group’s director. Gun manufacturers and sellers faced intense pressure and scrutiny from the financial sector after the 14 February school shooting in Parkland. The success or failure of Tuesday’s shareholder resolution effort will signal whether that pressure has lessened in the seven months since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting, or whether major investors are still concerned that a failure to act on gun violence prevention might damage gun companies’ prospects. “I think the shareholders of these companies are concerned about the long-term sustainability of the company. If they don’t take some of these steps, will they continue to exist?” Byron said. “We are not asking that they stop manufacturing guns. We realize that we are going to have guns in our society,” Byron said. What the activists shareholders want gun companies to do is “to monitor their distribution chains” to see how guns get into the wrong hands, and “we’d like them to be involved in lobbying more for universal background checks and federal funding for gun safety research, and to also let us know what they’re researching in terms of safer weapons”. “In this age when technology is touching everything, it doesn’t make sense that it isn’t touching firearms,” Byron said, referencing the development of smart gun technology that has not been widely adopted by major firearms companies. In early March, just two weeks after the Parkland shooting, BlackRock, a major investor in both American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, posted a public statement about what it was doing to respond to the “terrible toll from gun violence in America”. As well as allowing its clients to opt out of investing in civilian firearms manufacturers altogether, BlackRock, which manages more than $6tn in assets, said it wanted to talk to gun companies about responsible business practices. The company wrote to American Outdoor Brands asking a series of questions that paralleled many of the inquiries of the women’s religious groups. BlackRock asked how the gun company was “managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms”, how it assessed the risks of its different products, and what steps it was taking to monitor and support the safe use of its products, including any research and development efforts to make guns safer. American Outdoor Brands responded with a defiant public letter to BlackRock. The firearms company argued that “the first course of action must be to enforce existing laws” and “address the challenges of acute mental illness in our society” and that “the solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company” as well as “the rights of our law abiding customers”. “Any discussion of our business certainly must start with the second amendment, which confers a fundamental right, expressly provided in the Bill of Rights, to keep and bear arms,” the company wrote. The company also publicly shared a document from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for gun manufacturers, raising questions about the reliability of current “smart gun” technology, and how much demand there might be for this technology from consumers. American Outdoor Brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday’s shareholder resolution. Other activists, including a group of law enforcement officials and public health professionals organized by the Industrial Areas Foundation, are also publicly advocating for American Outdoor Brands to “develop and carry out a comprehensive plan to minimize the harmful impacts of its products”. Byron, a former school teacher and principal, said that when she was working in schools in the 1990s, “we had earthquake drills and fire drills, but never lockdowns or active shooters”. “When Sandy Hook happened, at that time, I thought, ‘If this doesn’t cause change, nothing will,’” she said. But she said the activism of the Parkland high school students who spoke out against the National Rifle Association and pro-gun politicians after their classmates were killed had transformed the political landscape in a way that adults advocacy had not, and noted that the Parkland students continue to register other students to vote and travel across the country. This summer, Byron said, she met a local high school student volunteering to support a gun safety ballot measure in Washington, who mentioned that he would have to work fewer hours in the fall, when he had to go back to school. “We can’t let the young people do the heavy lifting on this,” Byron said. “We need legislators, we need grandmas, we need moms … we need everyone working to solve this.”",US gun control; US news; Gun crime,US news
2018-02-28T06:00:10Z,Gun company investors push for change after Florida school shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/28/gun-company-investors-florida-school-shooting,"What if the answer to America’s guns crisis lies not with its government but with its gun companies? It’s a question that some investors are now asking and after the recent mass shooting in Florida, some see a path to change. While the deadly massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this month sparked a national debate and made its survivors a powerful voice for a new generation of gun-control activists, there are no guarantees of meaningful change. America’s mass shootings can seem like a grim repetitive cycle of “thoughts and prayers” followed by political inaction, a brief pause, and then another mass shooting. But this time, Judy Byron, coordinator of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is hopeful something has changed. “These high school kids are really changing the debate. I really see some hope this time,” she said. She aims to back their powerful rhetoric with money. The ICCR is a coalition of 300 global institutional investors which control $400bn in managed assets for faith-based groups, academics, unions and others interested in socially responsible investment. Normally, guns would not be on their list of good investments, but two years ago, outraged by the seemingly unending gun death toll in the US, the ICCR started encouraging its members to buy gun shares so that they would have a voice as shareholders. The campaign appears to be taking off. ICCR members have filed motions with the two largest listed US gun companies, Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands (formerly Smith &amp; Wesson) requesting reports detailing the companies’ efforts to make their products safer. It’s a move that could bring pressure to bear on gun companies to do more to make their products safer and harder to buy, even if Florida’s tragedy fails to move Washington to action. “We are not going to do away with guns but what are they [the gun companies] going to do to make them safer?” asked Byron. Technology allows us to lock up our phones when they are not in our possession, she said. “But if I left my gun out on the desk, you could use it. Why is that?” she said. Until recently shareholder activists have tended to focus on “divestment” as their tactic to put pressure on gun companies. Many ethical funds refuse to hold shares in gun companies at all and following Florida’s shooting there have again been campaigns to press pension funds to drop their holdings. But those campaigns have been complicated in recent years by the rise of index funds – lower-cost funds that track the performance of various stock market indexes and hold shares in all their components. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with assets of $6tn, is a major player in index funds. As a result it owns significant chunks of gun companies Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm Ruger – not because it sees guns as a great investment but because they are constituents of major indexes like the Russell 2000 index for smaller companies. Last week, BlackRock said it too intends to speak to weapons manufacturers and distributors “to understand their response” to the Florida high school shooting. It hasn’t yet said what it will do if it doesn’t like their replies but the company has form for effecting real change. BlackRock’s founder, Larry Fink, warned company executives in January he expected them to behave as good citizens. “Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose,” Fink wrote to CEOs. “To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” The letter followed BlackRock’s decision last May to back a shareholder resolution to force energy giant Exxon to be more open about the impact of climate change on its business. That resolution had long been championed by ICCR members including the pension funds of the Church of England but with BlackRock’s support it was passed by 62% of shareholders. “When we do not see progress despite ongoing engagement, or companies are insufficiently responsive to our efforts to protect the long-term economic interests of our clients, we will not hesitate to exercise our right to vote,” BlackRock said a statement. The Exxon victory could provide a model for change, said Byron. With BlackRock’s support, change is also possible at the gun companies, she said. She also pointed to the success of campaigners against apartheid in South Africa who targeted companies investing in the country until it scrapped racial segregation. “It took 20 years but it happened,” she said. “But this time we cannot take 20 years. I was a teacher and I just cannot imagine teaching in this environment.” Adam Kanzer, managing director of corporate engagement at Domini Impact Investments, which manages socially responsible mutual funds, said BlackRock’s involvement was a significant early victory for the campaign. “They are going to take that meeting,” said Kanzer. “I am very, very pleased to see that big investors are starting to wake up.” He also said that pressure for change was likely to come from below. “If you manage a teachers’ pension fund, you have got to be hearing from your investors about this,” he said. “That feels like a real problem to me.” But he worries that, as has so often been the case, attention spans are short and pressure for change could fizzle out. And that, in the end, America’s gun problem is an issue that needs “a public sector response. It is not going to be solved by the private sector alone”. The first test will come in May when Sturm Ruger holds its annual shareholder meeting and shareholders will be asked to force the company to account for its “activities related to gun safety measures and the mitigation of harm associated with gun products”. Even if they are not successful this time, the campaign will continue. “Something has to change,” said Byron.","US gun control; US news; Business; Parkland, Florida school shooting",US news
2018-03-29T14:19:53Z,"Investors push gun companies for 'immediate, positive' steps to end violence",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/29/investors-gun-companies-action-violence,"A group of 142 institutional investors on Thursday called on gun manufacturers, retailers and other companies with ties to the gun industry to take “meaningful action” to address the US’s epidemic of gun violence in the wake of February’s mass shooting in Florida. The statement, which says “the moral case for action grows more urgent each day”, was drafted by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), a coalition of global institutional investors. It has been signed by US and European investors including the UK’s Hermes that together manage over $634bn in assets. Sister Judy Byron of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment said: “As investors who have been engaging the companies in our portfolios on this issue for many years, we see this moment as an inflection point: companies that want to exhibit corporate citizenship and play a positive role in society need to get off the sidelines and take a public stand in favor of improved gun safety.” The statement identifies a series of commitments that companies should consider to protect their employees, consumers and communities, including ending any commercial relationships or promotional ties with the NRA. Several companies including Best Western, Delta and Hertz ended discount deals for NRA members following the fatal shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, last month. Retailers Dick’s Sporting Goods and Walmart also moved to end sales of guns to anyone under the age of 21. Colleen Scanlon of Catholic Health Initiatives said: “Gun violence in the US is a public health and human rights crisis with extraordinary and escalating human and economic costs, and hospitals are on the forefront of this crisis. While gun manufacturers and retailers are most exposed to the risks and controversies, there is a positive role to be played by all companies to help stem the tide of deaths due to gun violence.” Among other proposals the investors are calling for gun manufacturers to publicly endorse the “Sandy Hook principles” – a set of guidelines drawn up after the murder of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut school in 2012. Those principles include greater restrictions on firearm and ammunition sales, stricter background checks and a re-evaluation of the sale of military-style assault weapons. The investors are also asking for retailers to: Stop the sale, production, design or conversion of military style semi-automatic assault weapons and associated accessories and components, including high capacity magazines, for use by civilians. Limit gun and ammunition sales to purchasers 21 and over. Reinforce background checks as referenced above. End the sale of realistic toy guns and air rifles marketed to children. The statement finishes by saying: “In the coming months we will be engaging with companies we own to urge immediate and positive action that addresses gun violence.” The move comes after the ICCR launched a campaign to push shareholders in the two largest US gun manufacturers, American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, to tighten up their gun safety policies.","US gun control; Business; Parkland, Florida school shooting; US news; Investing",US news
2018-02-23T09:19:16Z,Persimmon slashes boss's bonus … to just £75m,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/23/persimmon-slashes-bosss-bonus-to-just-75m,"Persimmon is slashing bonus payouts to three executives by £51m, including a £25m cut for its chief executive, after the UK’s second largest housebuilder was strongly criticised over its controversial pay deal. The FTSE 100 firm said Jeff Fairburn would receive £75m worth of shares rather than £100m under the company’s long-term incentive bonus plan. Based on Thursday’s closing share price, Mike Killoran, the finance director, will receive £24m less than the £78m originally slated, while the bonus for Dave Jenkinson, the managing director, will be cut by £2m to £38m. All three will have future payouts under the scheme capped at £29 a share, compared with a current share price of around £25. Persimmon said the incentive plan had been a significant driver of the company’s “outstanding performance”, but acknowledged the lack of a cap in the original terms of the scheme was a mistake. “It is clear that the absence of a cap … has given rise to the potential for payouts which, when triggered in full, will be significantly larger and paid earlier than might reasonably have been expected at the time the scheme was originally put to shareholders,” it said in a statement. Persimmon has come under intense pressure both publicly and privately from politicians and shareholders for planning record-breaking bonus payouts to bosses after the company benefitted from the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme. The change of heart came after shareholders started to voice complaints and indicated they were considering voting against the re-election of some directors at the company’s annual general meeting on 25 April. This week the company’s sixth-largest shareholder, Aberdeen Standard Investments, described Fairburn’s bonus as “grossly excessive”, and said it remained a huge concern despite his recent pledge to donate some of it to charity. Responding to Persimmon’s move, Royal London Asset Management said on Friday that while the board had finally listened to shareholders, the sums being paid to the executives were still generous. The investment management firm has a 0.5% stake in Persimmon, worth about £35m. “This incident has been a classic corporate governance failure and highlights the need for remuneration committees to step up and make decisions if circumstances beyond a company’s control change,” said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, the head of responsible investment at Royal London. “However, even after this reduction, in our view the scale of the remuneration on offer under this plan is still extremely generous given the government’s support for the sector through the help-to-buy scheme. Despite this, we hope the company and shareholders can now draw a line under this issue, allowing management to devote their focus solely to the running of the company.” Announcing the bonus reduction, Persimmon said its remuneration committee was “fully supportive” of the decision. Nicholas Wrigley resigned as company chairman in December over his role in orchestrating the pay scheme. The company will be hoping it takes some of the pressure off its senior management as it prepares to publish its 2017 results next week. Earlier this month, Fairburn said he decided some time ago to give some of his bonus away but that he had wanted to take an “old-fashioned approach” and keep the decision private. Last year the Guardian revealed that his pay deal could be used to provide a council house for every homeless family in Yorkshire, where Persimmon is based. Even reduced by a quarter, Fairburn’s bonus could be used to build more than 1,000 council houses. A donation of £4.6m could provide a home for all of the 58 registered homeless families in York. It would cost £60.8m to build a home for all 760 homeless families in the Yorkshire and Humber region.",Persimmon; Executive pay and bonuses; Construction industry; Real estate; Business; UK news; Help-to-buy scheme,Business
2018-05-30T06:00:43Z,Meat and fish multinationals 'jeopardising Paris climate goals',https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/30/meat-and-fish-protein-multinationals-jeopardising-paris-climate-goals,"Meat and fish companies may be “putting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy” by failing to properly report their climate emissions, according to a groundbreaking index launched today. Three out of four (72%) of the world’s biggest meat and fish companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions, despite the fact that, as the report points out, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions. “It is clear that the meat and dairy industries have remained out of public scrutiny in terms of their significant climate impact. For this to change, these companies must be held accountable for the emissions and they must have credible, independently verifiable emissions reductions strategy,” said Shefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy European office. The new Coller FAIRR Protein Producers Index has examined the environmental and social commitments of 60 of the world’s largest meat and fish producers and found that more than half are failing to properly document their impact, despite their central role in our lives and societies. Many of the names in the index will be unfamiliar, but their consolidated revenues of $300bn cover around one-fifth of the global livestock and aquaculture market – roughly one in every five burgers, steaks or fish. The companies looked at by the index include giants like the Australian Agricultural Company, which has the biggest cattle herd in the world; the Chinese WH Group, the largest global pork company; or the US’s Sandersons, which processes more than 10 million chickens a week. Many of them run vertically integrated systems, sourcing meat from contracted farmers around the world, processing it themselves through their own slaughter and packing houses and then selling on to frontline, more familiar companies such as McDonalds, Walmart, Nestle and Danone. But a close examination by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) group has shown that, despite their critical part in our food system, these companies appear to be neglecting some of their social responsibilities. The food system, according to FAIRR, is “very sensitive to changing public sentiment”, and really large sums of investor money in the sector are often at risk due to little-understood risks. The organisation, founded by financier Jeremy Coller in 2015, aims to shed greater light on these risks. Animal welfare, water scarcity, deforestation and working conditions were some of the areas in which the 60 largest protein-producing companies around the world were assessed. The index looked at self-declared information from each company, and set a wide range of key performance indicators such as targets for deforestation reduction, a policy on antibiotic reduction, or water exposer of supply chains. Overall 60% were found to be “either not managing critical risks or are failing to disclose basic information”. “The findings from this first index create cause for concern,” said the report’s introduction. “There is still a worrying lack of ESG [environmental, social and governance] data availability and disclosure … despite the sector’s myriad sustainability impacts.” Climate change emerged as a particular concern. Despite the fact that, according to the report, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, almost 72% of companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions. Some 19 companies received the lowest possible mark in this section, including Australia Agricultural Company, Cal-Maine (a US company which reportedly produced 1bn eggs in 2017), Russian Cherkizovo and Indian Venky’s. This, the report argues, may be “putting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy”. The Guardian approached these companies for comment but received no response. Studies over the last decade have repeatedly shown that the production of red meat is energy and water-intensive compared to the production of most grains and vegetables. But many government officials appear to be reluctant to suggest that consumers should reduce their meat consumption. Antibiotic use also stood out. Antibiotic resistance has soared in recent decades and is now considered one of the biggest public health threats facing the world. The role of farming and food production in spreading resistant bacteria has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as growing evidence points to a direct threat to human health from veterinary overuse of antibiotics on farms. Despite this, there has been a “widespread failure to respond” to the crisis, the report says. The report says that 77% of the sector - 46 companies worth an estimated $239bn - rank “high risk” on antibiotic stewardship, with “little or no measures in place to reduce excessive use of antibiotics”. Abigail Herron, global head of responsible investment, Aviva Investors, said: “Our research shows that three in four of these companies are ignoring the calls from regulators, health professionals and the financial community to manage and reduce their use of antibiotics. That failure puts both global public health and their business models at risk.” Indian poultry giant Venky’s is among the companies ranked as “high risk” on antibiotics. Sanderson Farms, one of the US’s largest poultry producers, is also given bottom-tier ranking. Venky’s was recently found by an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to be advertising colistin, a so-called “last resort” antibiotic, for sale as a growth promoter in India, one of five pharma companies found to be doing the same. Deforestation is another area in which many companies are falling short. A recent analysis by Forest 500 found that despite cattle production being the biggest driver of tropical production globally, only 17% of assessed cattle companies had a policy addressing forest production. And the Coller Index finds that of the 24 companies processing beef and dairy (where deforestation is a particular risk), only one is assessed as “low risk”. “From an investment point of view, it is not only this $300bn group of companies at risk but the wider multi-trillion dollar global food supply chain ... Investors sit at the top of the chain as ultimate owners of these listed businesses. They need to use their influence as responsible stewards of these assets to start a dialogue on best practice and encourage a race to the top to build a more sustainable food system,” said Aarti Ramachandran, head of research and corporate engagement at FAIRR. “A major, systemic change is needed in the way we source protein if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, habitat loss and water stress. This can only be achieved if businesses and policymakers, working with the latest food technologies and scientific advice, collaborate to create a sustainable and nutritious food revolution that meets tomorrow’s demand,” said Emily Farnworth, Head of Climate Change Initiatives, World Economic Forum. “It’s always worth remembering that there is no such thing as cheap meat—these industries have been subsidised for years by the public because we pay for their environmental pollution, public health costs that they do not account for in their business model. This is where governments need to step in,” said Sharma.

2018-01-21T15:35:01Z,Lloyd's of London to divest from coal over climate change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change,"Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market, has become the latest financial firm to announce that it plans to stop investing in coal companies. Lloyd’s will start to exclude coal from its investment strategy from 1 April. The definition of what is a coal company and the criteria for divestment will be set over the coming months. The firm has long been vocal about the need to battle climate change, with insurance one of the worst affected industries by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding in recent years. The insurance market decided last month to implement a coal exclusion policy as part of a responsible investment strategy for the central mutual fund that sits behind every insurance policy written by the Lloyd’s market. Inga Beale, Lloyd’s of London chief executive, said: “That means that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal. “Is there more the insurance sector could be doing to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy by choosing sustainable or low-carbon stocks?” Lloyd’s does not underwrite operations directly, but offers a marketplace to almost 90 syndicates of other insurers. Lloyd’s has been slower to take action than others. Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal &amp; General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns about climate risks. About £15bn has been divested by insurers in the past two years, according to a recent report from Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. It said 15 companies – almost all in Europe – have fully or partially cut financial ties by selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. France’s Axa was one of the first financial firms to reduce investments in coal in May 2015 and is still leading the way. It said last month it was ditching investments and ending insurance for controversial US oil pipelines. After being criticised by campaigners for applying a threshold of 50% of revenues to define coal companies, it lowered the threshold to 30%. The Church of England has gone further, pulling out of investing in companies that make more than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal or oil from tar sands. Analysis by the ClimateWise coalition of the world’s biggest insurers published in December 2016 found that more frequent extreme weather events were driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable. The report concluded that the “protection gap” – the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured – had quadrupled to $100bn (£79bn) a year since the 1980s. Insurance companies are perhaps also mindful of the danger that they could suffer a huge loss if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change, as the Bank of England warned in 2015. However, some banks are still investing in coal plants, according to research from campaign groups. Beale told the Guardian that she would be discussing the group’s new investment strategy at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this week. Climate change and what investors can do will feature prominently at the meeting of political and business leaders. Beale said: “It goes beyond climate change.

2018-06-25T05:00:53Z,Tobacco: activist investors pressure £20bn companies over child labour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/tobacco-companies-child-labour-pressure,"The world’s biggest tobacco companies are coming under mounting pressure over child labour and working conditions in fields globally, from Zimbabwe to North Carolina. The firms are facing intense scrutiny from unions, NGOs and academics. While all have child labour policies in place and have formed organisations such as the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation (recognised by the UN), their actions have brought little change and are largely cosmetic, claims Marty Otañez, associate professor at the University of Colorado Denver. He has been working on the subject for 20 years and has done research in Malawi, Bolivia, Argentina, Tanzania, India and Kenya. “There is a disconnect between what company representatives say they do and what they actually do,” he alleged. “In every segment during the tobacco production process, you find different magnitudes of child labour.” Otañez said governments were often complicit because they did not want to deter overseas investors and relied on tobacco tax revenues. Tobacco companies wouldn’t be able to maintain their current rate of profits without the use of cheap labour, he added. British American Tobacco (BAT), which became the world’s biggest listed tobacco company following its $49bn (£42bn) takeover of Reynolds American last year, the Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PMI), the Virginia-based Altria, Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and Britain’s Imperial Brands made combined profits before tax of nearly £20bn last year. A report entitled Bitter Harvest published in April by Human Rights Watch (HRW) said there was widespread child labour in tobacco farms in Zimbabwe, where multinationals such as BAT, JTI and Imperial buy tobacco. The NGO said this was consistent with its findings in Kazakhstan, the US and Indonesia. A 2016 report by the not-for-profit organisation Swedwatch revealed widespread child labour across BAT operations in Bangladesh. BAT said its follow-up review last year found no evidence of child labour in Bangladesh, and that its main supplier in Zimbabwe, Northern Tobacco, would undergo an external review this year by AB Sustain. The HRW report is based on interviews with 64 small-scale tobacco farmers and 61 hired workers in Zimbabwe, one of the world’s largest producers of tobacco. It reported many farmers and workers, including children as young as 11, complained of symptoms consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, such as sickness, headaches and dizziness, from absorbing nicotine through their skin while handling tobacco plants. They had not been told how to prevent and treat the condition, HRW said. Workers also handled pesticides without adequate protective equipment, the report said. All the tobacco firms say they have training policies. At BAT’s annual general meeting (AGM) in London in April, the company’s board was grilled over its record on child labour. Sunniva Guatvik from the UK responsible-investment charity ShareAction said the two studies “show a gap between BAT’s policy commitments and continued, severe impacts on children in tobacco cultivation communities”. The BAT chairman, Richard Burrows, said the board was “very sympathetic” to the issues raised. But, he added, “you will find BAT has not got any questions to answer in respect of these issues”. He insisted: “Human rights is something we take very seriously as a company and as a board.” Guatvik asked BAT to publish more detailed information on how the situation was being monitored. Burrows said the company was meeting all the objectives set out by ShareAction, but the charity told the Guardian this was not the case. Hazel Cheeseman, director of the anti-smoking charity Ash, also weighed in at the AGM, asking the company to clarify its position on child labour. BAT said its policy explicitly prohibited anyone under the age of 18 from undertaking tasks that involve direct contact with green tobacco, but it allowed those under 18 to carry out “non-hazardous tasks associated with tobacco growing”. Jacqueline Baroncini of the International Union of Food and Allied Workers asked how the company could be sure that no children under 18 were working on farms supplying tobacco to BAT. Burrows reiterated that the programmes in place and the audits carried out assured him the policy was adhered to. Otañez proposes an action plan that calls for tobacco companies and leaf buyers to allow better monitoring of their supply chains; fairer labour arrangements on farms, including collective bargaining rights; and help for farmers to switch away from tobacco to growing food crops. In its report, HRW said most of the tobacco companies it had contacted now had policies banning children from activities involving direct contact with green tobacco. However, none of the companies prohibited children from handling dried tobacco, which has been linked to respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest. BAT told the Guardian that it does not allow under 18s to handle dried tobacco when there is a risk to their health. Baldemar Velasquez, who in 1967 set up the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (Floc), which represents 10,000 migrant workers across several US states such as Kentucky and North Carolina, said the union had been talking to BAT for the last four years about improving pay and working conditions for those working in tobacco fields. “We as farm workers do the most arduous jobs in this industry,” he told shareholders at the AGM. Floc is pushing for collective bargaining, higher tobacco pricing, better accommodation and better shower facilities for farm workers. Some farms have showers, but not enough, Velasquez told the Guardian after the AGM. “There are three to four showers for 30 to 40 workers, and the heating unit runs out after two to three showers and it takes a couple of hours to heat up again. So workers wait or don’t shower at all.” Velasquez, 71, started working on farms at the age of six, picking fruit and later tobacco – one of hundreds of thousands of children who joined their migrant parents working long hours in the fields in the US. He stressed the “need for proper bathing facilities to wash nicotine off in order not to get the green tobacco sickness”. A BAT spokesperson said Reynolds American took farm worker welfare “extremely seriously” and was committed to ensuring its supply chain was fully compliant with relevant laws. “All farm workers have access to washing facilities, and Reynolds American also ensures that workers receive the required training and personal protective equipment to protect them from green tobacco sickness.” Farm labourers have no collective bargaining rights in the US, and child labour is legal on farms. Children as young as 12 can start working unlimited hours outside of school, and children of any age can work on small or family-owned tobacco farms. Velasquez said the stagnant tobacco price was a major problem, arguing that if farms were paid a fair price for their tobacco, they could invest in better facilities. The five big tobacco companies said child labour was unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chain. They said they were encouraging farmers to grow other crops, but added that tobacco gave farms a better income. A BAT spokesperson said: “We agree contracts with farmers at the beginning of each growing season – this not only guarantees that we buy their tobacco crop at a fair price, but also ensures farmers have a regular and secure income throughout the season, protecting them from market fluctuations.” He added: “Growing tobacco for BAT is something the farmers we work with choose to do, and 90% of our farmers also grow other crops such as fruit, wheat and cotton.” JTI said a contracted farmer in Malawi would earn three times more harvesting one hectare of tobacco compared with one hectare of groundnuts. Altria, which sources 70% of its leaf in the US, told the Guardian it was committed to addressing concerns about child labour and had taken “significant steps”. It said last year it had distributed 75,000 isolation gowns to tackle risks of green tobacco sickness and that its contracts required growers to comply with laws and regulations that protect workers. PMI said it had been “making progress” in tackling complex issues on farms supplying to the company and had been working with partners to make improvements for workers. Contractors in the US must meet labour requirements, it added. International labour standards state that children under 18 should be prohibited from hazardous work. According to the latest International Labour Organization estimates, 152 million children are still involved in child labour around the world. The vast majority, 108 million children (71%), are working in the agricultural sector, including tobacco growing.",Tobacco industry; Child labour; British American Tobacco; Philip Morris International; Business; World news,World news
2019-07-23T05:00:41Z,Is fair trade finished?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/23/fairtrade-ethical-certification-supermarkets-sainsburys,"It wasn’t very long ago that a banana was just a banana – just a curved, yellow fruit. All you knew, if you bought a bunch in 1986, was that they cost around 97p per kilo. You weren’t told if they were organic or pesticide-free. You didn’t know if they came from Costa Rica or the Dominican Republic. And you certainly weren’t invited to worry about the farmers who grew them – or if their children went to school, or whether their villages had clinics. You just picked up your bananas and walked to the next aisle for your coffee or tea or chocolate, none the wiser about where they came from either, or about the people who farmed them. Back then, the countries that grew these commodities and many others were still known as the Third World, and the habit of not caring about their farming conditions was a legacy of their colonial past. For centuries, trade propelled the colonial project, and exploitation was its very purpose. The farmers of Asia, Africa and South America were forced to raise the crops that the empire’s companies wanted, to work the crops in abject conditions, and to part with them at ruinously low prices. In the last century, the empires melted away but the trade remained lopsided – with the imbalance now rationalised by the market, which deemed it “efficient” to pay farmers as little as possible. In the 1970s, a Ghanaian cocoa farmer often received less than 10 cents out of every dollar his beans earned on the commodities market; as a proportion of the retail price of a chocolate bar, his take was smaller still. Child labour was common. The chocolate companies prospered and their customers shopped well; the farmers stayed poor. Then, in the late 1980s, you began to hear more about these farmers, encountering their stories on television or in newspapers or even on the labels of the packages you bought. The reasons were manifold. Environmental awareness was on the rise. The prices of some commodities were crashing, placing agricultural incomes in even more acute peril than usual. There had already been small groups pushing for more equitable trade: “little do-good shops scattered in cities around Europe, selling products … bought at fair prices directly from small producers abroad”, as one pioneer described it. By the early 1990s, these disparate initiatives began to coalesce into a larger international struggle to radically reform our relationship with what we bought. Trade had long been unfair by design, but now there was a growing movement to make consumers care about that unfairness, and even to help rectify it. The crown jewel of this movement was Fairtrade International, an umbrella body formed in 1997 out of various national chapters that had sprouted over the previous decade. Fairtrade was founded on the conviction that consumers could make the marketplace more moral. The spine of Fairtrade’s philosophy has always been price: simple, clean, the kind of measure that economists like to deal with. If companies pay farmers equitably, Fairtrade believes, other benefits cascade out as well. Farmers can hire adult workers, rather than employing children; they can send their kids to school, and buy medicines; they can improve the yields of their farms by using better fertilisers. Producers must meet a number of standards to qualify for Fairtrade: rules about labour conditions, for instance, or waste disposal. But for companies, the core of their ethical responsibility towards their producers is defined by price. So Fairtrade works by forming a kind of “virtuous triangle” of ethical business. It recruits farmers and farming cooperatives as members, asking them to meet its standards; periodically, Fairtrade sends inspectors to these farms around the world, ensuring they are still compliant. At another vertex of the triangle, Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price for commodities from these member farms if market prices plunge, and offers to certify products made from such ethically sourced commodities. The final corner is the customer, who can, with a little counsel, be galvanised to shop consciously, and to buy Fairtrade-certified products even if they cost a few pence more. The Fairtrade certification mark has become widely familiar: a green-blue-black logo, resembling a yin-and-yang with a tear in its middle, soothing the consciences of shoppers the world over. Roughly $9bn worth of Fairtrade products were sold in 2017, their raw material sourced from 1.66 million farmers. Around 2,400 companies, including multinational giants such as Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, pay licence fees to their national Fairtrade chapters to use the mark on their products. Fairtrade has become a byword for ethical consumption; 93% of British shoppers now recognise its mark. But its two real triumphs are in the realm of ideas, not numbers. First, and most obviously, Fairtrade challenged the entrenched model of the commodities business – the belief that a farmer’s lean income was just an unavoidable reality of trade economics. Second, somewhat more stealthily, it cemented the notion that the modern corporation would be ethical if only someone held up a lamp and showed it the way. Capitalism didn’t have to be feared; the market would figure out its own checks and balances, through labelling agencies such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance, without having to be regulated by any higher authority. Persistent and egregious inequality could be solved by deft pleats and tucks to the garb of trade, rather than by a full reconsideration of its fabric and seams. Now, though, Fairtrade’s success in helping to build a world of heightened expectations of sustainability is perversely paving the way to its own demise. Companies are losing faith in labels such as Fairtrade – losing faith in their ability to secure the future of farming and the future of commodities that drive corporate profit, but also losing faith that these independent stamps of sustainability carry any value at all any more. Instead, the world’s giant food multinationals are taking matters into their own hands – setting up their own in-house certification programmes, appraising their own ethics to their own satisfaction. Although the fate of Fairtrade is not necessarily the fate of fair trade, the former has kept the latter alive as an object of aspiration. A weakened Fairtrade portends the enfeebling of the very idea of fair trade. This poses a serious problem, because Fairtrade relies on companies to constitute one half of its virtuous bazaar. Without the buyers, the Fairtrade bazaar folds up, and companies return to their own devices, to pursue only what’s best for themselves. Increasingly, companies are finding it easier and more expedient to produce their own certifications, said Trishna Shah, a Euromonitor analyst who tracks ethical labels: “A big change is happening.” What we’re looking at, in short, is something like a corporate capture of fair trade – and it comes at a time when agriculture is already in crisis. The world’s population expanded from about 4.4 billion in 1980 to more than 7 billion by 2011, but the proportion of people employed in agriculture shrank by 12%. Globally, the average age of a coffee farmer is 55. No one from a younger generation seems to want to grow crops any more. The work is difficult and, in the developing world, nearly always unrewarding. And the coming decades, with all the challenges of a changing climate – waves of heat, virulent pests, droughts and floods – appear grimmer still. The lives of farmers are already poised to get worse. A move towards unfairer trade will only push them back towards the exploited miseries of the past. * * * The single most damaging blow to Fairtrade came two summers ago, and it was delivered by Sainsbury’s, which once proudly boasted that it was the world’s largest retailer of Fairtrade products. In May 2017, without any warning, Sainsbury’s broke the news that its own-brand teas would no longer be certified by Fairtrade. “It was a bombshell,” Paul Tiony said. He had travelled to Nairobi that month, from his tea farm in Nandi Hills, in western Kenya, to take part in a half-day workshop run by Fairtrade Africa. Other tea farmers, from Malawi, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, were there as well, at the Pride Westlands hotel; so was a team from Sainsbury’s. The company called a meeting at the end of the workshop, and Tiony grew excited. Sainsbury’s must have some kind of good news, he thought. But after gathering almost 50 workshop participants in a conference room of the hotel, Sainsbury’s revealed that its in-house tea brands were abandoning Fairtrade. Instead, an executive said, it was piloting its own ethical label – and calling it “Fairly Traded”. Later, Fairtrade estimated that these changes would affect nearly 250,000 farmers and workers. Among these were the 8,000 members of Sireet, the tea-farming cooperative to which Tiony belongs. Sireet’s produce is certified by Fairtrade, and Sainsbury’s used to be, by far, the largest buyer of Sireet’s Fairtrade tea. So Tiony was dumbstruck at the shock announcement. “Even Fairtrade Africa officials didn’t seem to know much about it,” he recalled. “They were asking: ‘Why are you doing this?’” Someone inquired: “Are you moving out of Fairtrade because of Brexit?” Sainsbury’s had no real answers, Tiony said – but it seemed to be doubting that Fairtrade was working as promised. One Sainsbury’s executive singled out one of the central principles of Fairtrade’s model: the so-called “premium” above the minimum price that companies must pay, and which cooperatives must use to build schools, or run clinics, or improve their communities in other ways. Sainsbury’s was concerned that the premium was being poorly used, and that it was money wasted. “But just a few days earlier,” Tiony said, “someone from Sainsbury’s had come to look at all our projects.” The farmers tried to argue with the executives; the executives insisted they weren’t going to change their minds. “The meeting ended just like that.” The announcement kicked off an immediate storm. In an open letter, Fairtrade’s tea producers in Africa accused Sainsbury’s of seeking “power and control” over farmers in a manner “reminiscent of colonial rule”. A coalition of British non-profits urged consumers into a weekend of action under the rubric: “Don’t Ditch Fairtrade”. Buy a pack of “Fairly Traded” tea and then give it back, they suggested: “Let the sales assistant know you are returning it because it’s not Fairtrade.” In Parliament, MPs pressed Sainsbury’s to reconsider; one accused the company of lying, and another complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the name Fairly Traded would mislead shoppers who confused it for Fairtrade. (Sainsbury’s declined to comment for this story. “The launch of Fairly Traded was a bit of a disaster,” a former executive told me with a sigh.) The Fairly Traded experiment ignited fears of a full divorce, in which Sainsbury’s would abandon the rest of its Fairtrade products – its coffee and sugar; its flowers; the 650m bananas it sells every year – and move out of the Fairtrade house altogether. That would, the Guardian wrote at the time, bring Fairtrade “crashing down”. So far, this hasn’t happened, but Sainsbury’s is still only a couple of years into its experiment with Fairly Traded. The divorce could still come. The departure of Sainsbury’s wasn’t a one-off. Around the world, the largest agribusiness companies are quitting independent certification, either because they think they can do sustainability better in-house, or because they see an opportunity to craft standards that fit their own purposes. Soon after Sainsbury’s, the global confectionary giant Mondelēz – whose vast holdings include Cadbury and Toblerone – pulled several of its chocolate bars, including Dairy Milk, away from Fairtrade and into an in-house certification scheme called “Cocoa Life”. Nestlé had launched a similar programme, “Cocoa Plan”, back in 2013; between them, Nestlé and Mondelez control roughly 40% of the British chocolate market. Starbucks has “CAFE Practices”; Barry Callebaut, the Swiss cocoa producer, has “Cocoa Horizons”; US giant Cargill has “Cocoa Promise”; McDonald’s has its own “McCafé Sustainability Improvement Platform”. All these firms still have a few products that are certified by third parties – by Fairtrade, or by other agencies such as Rainforest Alliance or UTZ. (The latter two merged in January 2018.) But the ratio is dwindling. The great energies of these corporations, said Trishna Shah, the Euromonitor analyst, are being lavished upon their own, bespoke schemes – each with its own little logo, its own definition of fairness, its own explanatory literature on a web page somewhere. For shoppers, this promises bewildering times ahead at the supermarket: more and more instances of what people in the industry call “label fatigue”. The shelves already crawl with sustainability logos: more than 460 of them on food and beverage packages, and a third of them created over the last 15 years. There are little chromatic decals to testify that tuna is dolphin-friendly; that coffee is bird-friendly; that “wild-collected natural ingredients” are up to FairWild standards; that a slice of salmon is Salmon-Safe and follows Best Aquaculture Practices; that a bottle of wine is LIVE, which means that it fulfills Low Input Viticulture and Ecology benchmarks. One logo promises a carbon-free product, another a carbon-neutral one, and a third a carbon-reducing one. The more labels there are, the less we know about them – about what they stand for, and about how meaningful they are. In a crowd, there’s room to hide. When Fairtrade began, labels were rare and precious things; when you bought a product with a label on it, you knew what you were getting. In contrast, a company today can launch its certification logo into the large ocean of labels, confident that most shoppers will not know what the logo guarantees, but that it will nonetheless salve their consciences. “I think companies are hoping that label fatigue is an enduring trend,” said Elizabeth Bennett, a political economist who co-edited the Handbook of Research on Fair Trade. “They’re hoping that consumers are tired of learning what 30 different labels in one sector mean, and that we’ll all just think: ‘Any claim of sustainability is an improvement over no claim.’” This makes it easy for companies to resort to the ruse of “greenwashing” – pretending to be ethical without really being anything of the sort. Several people in the corporate world offered an even more depressing version of this story: companies are sidling away from third-party certifiers because their optimistic project – the idea that the market can be heedful of its own abuses and correct itself – has, in a grand sense, failed. After decades of work, these certifiers have been unable to truly alter the imbalance in global trade; they have struggled to protect farmers, or to arm them for their various social, economic and environmental battles. The proof is in the dire projections for the future of farming, showing how vanishing agricultural biodiversity, the warming climate and the ageing and impoverishment of farmers are all endangering the world’s crops – which means they are also endangering the supply chains of companies who rely upon farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America to manufacture chocolate bars, coffee pods, or cotton T-shirts. By launching all these in-house programmes, companies are trying to take matters into their own hands – if only to secure their sources of commodities, and their bottom lines. * * * The Fairtrade movement was born in 1988, when a Dutch non-profit introduced the first certification for ethically traded coffee. The label was named Max Havelaar, after a seminal anti-colonial novel by the Dutch writer Eduard Dekker, published in 1860. In the novel, Dekker described how the Dutch in Indonesia, having made themselves “masters of the country”, compelled the Javanese farmer to grow sugar and coffee, instead of rice for his family. The government “punishes him if he sells what he has produced to any purchaser but itself; and it fixes the price actually paid”, Dekker wrote. “And because the entire trade must produce profit, that profit cannot be got in any other way than by paying the Javanese just enough to keep him from starving.” Naming the label after the novel was a blunt acknowledgement of the straight line connecting colonial exploitation to corporate exploitation. When the label launched, three Dutch coffee brands signed on to source their beans from a farmers’ cooperative in Mexico, paying a rate above market price that was agreed to be fair. The following year, coffee prices crashed following a breakdown of trade talks: the cost of a pound of coffee on the commodities market fell to rates last seen in the 1930s. Coffee farmers faced ruin. The universe seemed to be emphasising the urgency of Max Havelaar’s mission. The label was a swift success; within a year, 65% of Dutch consumers had heard of Max Havelaar, and the certified coffee found its way on to shelves at the biggest supermarkets. In tandem with the coffee crisis, Max Havelaar inspired other “alternative trade” initiatives across Europe. In Britain, the Fairtrade Foundation was set up by NGOs and church groups in 1992. By 1997, the various national Fairtrade chapters were gathered into an umbrella body, now called Fairtrade International and headquartered in Bonn, Germany. In the voluminous literature on its website, Fairtrade sets out the prices it calculates to be “fair”. As of mid-July, the minimum price for a metric tonne of cocoa beans was $2,000; for an 18.14kg box of bananas from Cameroon, €6.40; for 1,000 fresh coconuts from the Windward Islands, $112. But Fairtrade doesn’t stop with ensuring these minimum prices; it also demands that producers be paid an extra premium – $11 for the Windward Islands coconuts, for instance – and that these premiums be spent to benefit the community. Fairtrade insists that producers make these investment decisions democratically, which means that farmers have to organise into collectives such as Sireet. There is an undeniable power in Fairtrade bringing these collectives to the negotiating table, said Pauline Tiffen, the editor of the Journal of Fair Trade. “The tea industry used to be so hierarchical until quite recently that it was like something out of Dickens,” she said. “And cocoa still felt like it was operating in the 18th century. Until 20 years ago, if you went to any big trade meetings on cocoa, you’d see no women, no people of colour.” The debate over whether Fairtrade’s systems truly transform the lives of farmers has raged for nearly all of Fairtrade’s lifetime. Its numbers, in relative terms, are still puny. The 1.66 million farmers in the Fairtrade network form a speck within the 2 billion or so people who make their living from agriculture. The sale value of Fairtrade’s products may add up to $9bn, but the global market for coffee alone is worth $200bn. A more dramatic sign of Fairtrade’s struggles is that it can’t sell, on its terms, all the volumes of commodities it certifies. In 2016, of all the coffee grown as Fairtrade, only 34% of it could be sold at the minimum price. There were no takers for the rest; farmers had to unload the surplus into the standard “unfair” market, at the lower prices that the market determined. For cocoa, the rate is a bit better, 47%. For tea, it’s much worse, only 4.7 %. There are tonnes of harvest for which Fairtrade fails to find any fair-minded buyers at all. Even the benefits that Fairtrade promises to deliver to farmers have been called into question. In 2014, Fairtrade entered into a public squabble with a team from Soas University of London, which had examined how well Fairtrade did in shrinking poverty in Ethiopia and Uganda. The study, funded by the British government, found that schoolchildren had worked on Fairtrade-certified farms. The researchers compared wages on Fairtrade-certified tea and coffee estates – always owned by smallholders, in keeping with Fairtrade’s belief in championing the small farmer – with wages on larger, uncertified plantations. Workers on the Fairtrade estates were paid less and often laboured in worse conditions, they concluded. Fairtrade called these “distorted comparisons” and rejected the researchers’ conclusions. In Kenya, the tea farmers of Sireet have experienced some of the frustrations of Fairtrade, but also the sudden precariousness of life without it. The cooperative came together 14 years ago, when 6,230 farmers raised money to buy nearly 1,000 hectares of land to cultivate their tea. Sireet has been a Fairtrade producer from the very beginning, its chairman, Wilson Tuwei, told me. Sireet’s farmers worked hard to meet Fairtrade’s rules and standards, he said, but even so, the cooperative was never able to sell more than 13% of its harvest at Fairtrade rates. Even that feels like a bonanza, though, compared to what has happened over the last two years. After Sainsbury’s stopped its purchases, Sireet’s sales of Fairtrade tea plummeted. “Last year, we were at not even 1%,” Tuwei said. Sireet’s careful plans started to go up in smoke. “We’ve stopped most of the projects we were funding with the Fairtrade premium. There were dispensaries. We were paying school fees for some children. There were irrigation projects. They’ve all become white elephants now. It has really affected us.” * * * The rupture between Sainsbury’s and Fairtrade over tea has become the most prominent case of a large company concluding that Fairtrade wasn’t quite cutting it any more. The details of that rupture convey why Sainsbury’s was dissatisfied with Fairtrade, but also why replacement corporate schemes such as Fairly Traded feel flimsy or stifling to those meant to benefit from them. Two people who have worked with Sainsbury’s told me that the company had been unhappy with Fairtrade for years. When I spoke to these anonymous sources in April, both sounded exasperated at the way Sainsbury’s had handled its exit, but they made the case that its reasons were sound. “We were paying these premiums, but it wasn’t clear where the money was going. Fairtrade isn’t good at keeping tabs on it,” one of them said. “It wasn’t always going to medicines and schools and things like that, as we found through our own investigations.” Other Fairtrade partners had raised this as well, she added. “We wanted more data … Instead, there was just a systemic inefficiency.” Sainsbury’s, as a corporation, was constantly pressured to be transparent, she said. “But it turned out that Fairtrade wasn’t quite as transparent. That was frustrating.” The other Sainsbury’s source confirmed this. “If you wanted to find out what a cooperative had done with a whole wad of Fairtrade premiums, or what the impact of that had been over the years, nobody could tell you. Or you’d get some anecdotal stuff.” A Fairtrade spokesperson told me, in response to these claims, that the organisation wanted farmers to spend their premiums the way they wished, setting their own goals and monitoring their own progress. She added that, since April, Fairtrade has “strengthened the requirements on Fairtrade premium use, management, and reporting, in order to promote best practices and increase transparency”. Now, if a cooperative’s annual premiums exceed $150,000, it must hire an external auditor to inspect the way it accounts for the money. Even as Sainsbury’s was stewing over the premiums it was paying out, the second Sainsbury’s source told me, it had begun to “rain down with standards” over the past decade. Companies and non-profits introduced a fleet of new labels and certifications, their names all seeming to blend hazily into each other. Pasture for Life. New Forest Marque. Food Made Good. Soil Association. Free Range Dairy Pasture Promise. LEAF Marque. “Then Fairtrade starts to look just like a sliver of the pie – an expensive and not very satisfactory one,” said the source. “And Sainsbury’s thinks: ‘I’m sure we can do this ourselves, I’m sure we know what needs to be delivered.’” Fairtrade didn’t think so. Under Fairly Traded, farmer collectives no longer receive their premiums directly, or decide how to spend this money. Instead, they must work on “action plans” and convince a Sainsbury’s board of experts in London to release their funds. In their open letter, Fairtrade’s tea producers protested that the company was characterising these premiums as “donor money” rather than earnings that rightfully belonged to the farmers. Fairtrade called the board “a further layer of bureaucracy controlled by a group far removed from day-to-day life in Africa”. It feels like a paradox: that, in a moment when sustainability and ethics are more important than ever, corporations want to desert an agency such as Fairtrade, the most famous certifying entity in the field. Companies are under pressure – from customers, governments, banks and investors – to prove their sustainability credentials. Signatories to the UN’s Principles of Responsible Investment now manage around $89tn in assets. The network of Sustainable Stock Exchanges – more than 80 bourses around the world – guide and sometimes even require listed companies to report on their sustainability. In a way, this dialled-up consciousness explains why companies are searching for alternatives to independent labelling systems, said Fredrik Galtung, who runs TrueFootprint, a firm that analyses data to tell businesses if their various sustainability projects make any sort of impact. He detects, in the industries he works with, a hardnosed sense that unsustainable practices will result in economic risk. So he isn’t surprised that companies, finding Fairtrade insufficient at tackling that risk, are rushing to erect their own standards. “If Fairtrade producers could show that their farmers were 10 or 20 years younger on average, that would be something. If they could show they’re more climate-resistant, that would be a massive advantage. But we’re unable to see all this.” Fairtrade denies that its future is dim, or that a schism has appeared between itself and the companies with which it aims to work. In his discussions of these issues, Dario Soto Abril, who has been the CEO of Fairtrade International since 2016, is a model of genial tact. He’s in an unenviable position. He must keep his relations with corporations warm; Sainsbury’s still retails plenty of Fairtrade-labelled products, for example, and Mondelēz uses Fairtrade’s skills to track payments and commodities up and down the supply chain. At the same time, Soto must project his conviction that it is best for everyone concerned – shoppers, farmers, but especially companies – if they all commit fully to Fairtrade. Agriculture has never been under more stress, Soto said. The world is so densely connected now that a tremor in one part of a supply chain sets off instant price fluctuations elsewhere. Corporate power is consolidating. Just three giants – Barry Callebaut, Cargill and Olam – control 60% of the world’s cocoa-processing business, for example; this gives them enormous leverage over the prices they pay to producers. “Cocoa farmers still live in poverty,” Soto said. “Banana farmers find that there are hidden costs of production that their sales are not covering.” The effects of climate change alone are “so accelerated”, Soto said, “that we think if nothing of significance is done by 2050, at least half the land under coffee production now will be lost, one way or another.” Last year, the UN released a map of the world predicting where yields were likely to drop or rise before 2050. In West Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, which have been plantation-farmed by colonists and then corporations, harvests will shrink. In North America and Europe, which have already cornered the profits of centuries of agribusiness, harvests will expand. The map is iniquity compounded upon iniquity. Soto insists Fairtrade is flourishing: “Our credibility remains high. We get new partners all the time.” Sales of Fairtrade-certified products have swelled year on year around the world, partly as a result of companies exploring new markets. On the other hand, farmers are entering Fairtrade at a slowing pace. Between 2015 and 2016, Fairtrade managed to bring 3,199 new workers into its network; the previous year, it recruited 9,955. “It’s important to note that Fairtrade can’t solve everything,” Soto said. “We’re here trying to solve challenges as old as humanity. We need more committed partners. We need more innovative ideas.” But Soto is also forgiving of companies that have chosen to set up schemes to certify themselves. “I think companies are looking to test something new,” he said carefully. “We need to allow for that. I will never doubt that companies will do the best they can.” For the chief executive of an organisation founded on the premise that companies need to be cajoled or nagged into paying farmers a living income, this sounded like an astonishingly trusting statement. Soto’s most barbed opinion concerned farmer premiums and the larger issue of involving producers in decision-making. “I’m with you when you say that these companies aren’t giving farmers a seat at the table,” Soto told me. “You have to allow farmers a say in the income generated by sales. They have to own their premiums. That was our biggest suggestion to Sainsbury’s.” Last October, the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK acknowledged that, in the new era of self-certification, its function had to evolve. Since companies are setting up their own sustainability schemes, said Lord Mark Price, who chairs the Foundation’s board of trustees, “the role of Fairtrade is to help those organisations be the best they can be”. Fairtrade will still operate its certification programme; the yin-yang logo will still be seen on products. But for Fairtrade to climb into the role of a consultancy – a supplier of guidance, rather than an umpire enforcing a line for companies to toe – is the most conclusive evidence yet of the transformation under way. And it raises two questions. How will companies behave if they have to testify only to their own code of ethical sourcing? And in what shape will that leave the future of agriculture? * * * If the animating principle of Fairtrade is “price,” that of most corporate in-house programmes is “yield”. These programmes may differ in other details. Some are just two years old; others were established more than a decade ago. Some pay their farmers Fairtrade-like minimum prices; others do not. But they are united by their unwavering focus on yield – on squeezing more produce out of a hectare of land. They consider it the best way to protect and grow their supplies of coffee or tea or cocoa, and thus the best way to save agriculture. The investments are massive. Starbucks has sunk $100m into CAFE Practices, a programme started in 2004 to source sustainably grown coffee. Roughly 99% of Starbucks coffee now falls under this programme, said Michelle Burns, a senior vice president who heads global coffee and tea for the company. Mondelēz will have spent $400m on Cocoa Life, its sustainable cocoa scheme, by 2022. Nearly half of all Mondelēz cocoa is already sourced under this scheme, said Christine McGrath, who heads global impact and sustainability for the $80bn snack giant; she expects that number to have scaled to the full 100% by 2025. Both companies claimed they found existing third-party certifiers inadequate. “There were no programmes we could find that had an emphasis on quality,” Burns said. “Nothing that was comprehensive enough.” In my conversations with Starbucks and Mondelēz, farmer welfare rarely came up. The tacit assumption seemed to be that if the companies help farmers improve their productivity, their lives will improve in tandem. Starbucks doesn’t set a minimum price, or pay a premium for every tonne of coffee it purchases, the way Fairtrade would have it do. Instead, it pays “strategic premiums” for preferred producers. As a result, last September, when coffee prices fell more than 20% to around $1 a pound, Starbucks had to inject a one-time $20m subsidy to its farmers in Central America. Mondelēz also does not set a minimum price. It pays “loyalty premiums” to the farmer collectives with which it chooses to work, and Cathy Pieters, director of Mondelēz’s Cocoa Life programme, said it was up to them to decide what kind of “action plans” can be funded with the money. She added, though, that Mondelēz commissions large NGOs to work with these cooperatives in determining and crafting these action plans. Once again, as with Sainsbury’s and its Fairly Traded programme, the premiums intended to benefit farmers aren’t quite wholly theirs to spend as they see fit. Fairtrade is half-owned by its producer cooperatives, so its standards and metrics are decided in large part by the representatives of farmers. The standards of Cocoa Life, CAFE Practices and other schemes aren’t like that; they are written by the companies themselves, in the companies’ own best interests. No independent third party certifies their success or failure in meeting these standards and publishes those results. Companies reporting on their own sustainability frequently fail “to prioritise planet over profit”, Hans Hoogervorst, who heads the International Accounting Standards Board, said in a speech in April. “Greenwashing is rampant.” Industries are increasingly left to audit themselves, in part because governments have shredded their budgets in the name of austerity. From Volkswagen to Boeing, we don’t have to look very hard for evidence that companies fib and cheat when they get to mark their own homework. Bringing sustainability certification in-house is unlikely to empower farmers, or to renovate the structure of trade. “But it’s simplistic to say that companies will act in ways that are injurious to farmers,” said Fredrik Galtung of TrueFootprint, the sustainability analysts. In his view, the crises in agriculture are so stark that companies are motivated to protect farms and farm workers – if only to secure their own future profits. But TrueFootprint’s scorecards indicate that most companies only report their spending on sustainability; almost none of them investigate the impact of these schemes on farmers or on natural resources like air and water. Galtung described it as “just being happy to check off boxes”. Economists like to examine incentives, and to deduce behaviour from them. If the incentives of these companies are misaligned with those of their producers, it’s only a matter of time before they produce conflict and rupture. Companies perceive Fairtrade to be rigid, and say that keeping sustainability programmes in-house gives them “flexibility”. That word is really standing in, though, for “control”: control over how commodities are priced, how to select or discard producers, how farmers farm, even how they live. This may look, for firms and even for consumers, like efficiency, but the effects can be dysfunctional. When four firms – Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus – control between 70% and 90% of the global grain trade, they can bulldoze governments into clearing forested land for crops, crowd out smallholder farmers and push more and more processed grains into our diets. Many of the failings of global agriculture are not the result of multinational companies having too little control; they are the result of companies having too much. That lesson is available to students of the past as well. After the publication of Max Havelaar shocked the public, in 1901 the Dutch government formulated a new ethical policy – one that would treat Indonesia as a moral responsibility rather than simply as a territory to be exploited. Millions of guilders had flowed from these islands into the Dutch treasury – 187m between 1867 and 1878 alone – and so the government committed to spending 30m guilders over the first decade on the welfare of the Indies’ farmers. Not surprisingly, they received agricultural credit and irrigation canals, because the Dutch corporations were avid for better yields. They also gained more schools and more roads; they were not, however, encouraged to industrialise, because this would have inflated the cost of local labour and led to competition with Dutch businesses. The Dutch ethical policy came undone as soon as the colonist’s aims started to clash with those of the colony. The harvests improved, but not enough to warrant the investment. The Great Depression set in, and the government thinned down its expenditures even as Indonesian farmers slid into debt. Educating the populace began to seem like a mistake; there was no work for young Indonesian men who had attended university, and they inevitably drifted into the nationalist movement. By 1940, the government had ceased to fund the welfare projects. An unnamed administrator, who had once supported the ethical policy, watched with disappointment as the meagre progress unravelled and said: “As soon as we withdraw our hands, everything sinks back into the marsh.” But what the Dutch didn’t recognise was that they were the ones who made it impossible for the Indonesians to rise from the marsh in the first place. • This article was amended on 24 July 2019. An earlier version said that Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price, which is always set above market price. In fact, the Fairtrade minimum price is charged only when market prices drop below a pre-determined level. Sainsbury’s pulled its own-brand teas out of Fairtrade, rather than ceasing to sell any Fairtrade-certified teas; companies buying Fairtrade must meet other standards in addition to price; and the minimum price for bananas from Cameroon is €6.40 per 18.14kg box, not per 1kg. These have been corrected. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",Ethical business; Fair trade; Ethical and green living; Food; Consumer affairs; Supermarkets; Fruit; Coffee; Chocolate; Retail industry; Money; Environment; Global development; Business,Business
